Despite a historically divisive presidency and his own role in inciting an attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, Trump aimed to evoke nostalgia for his time in office, frequently contrasting his first-term accomplishments with the Biden administration’s policies and the current economic climate. Many of those perceived accomplishments – from strict immigration actions to corporate tax cuts and religious freedom initiatives – remain deeply polarizing to this day.\n\nAs Trump spoke to a roomful of Republicans who expect him to face primary challengers in the coming months, he also claimed the party cannot afford to nominate “a politician or conventional candidate” if it wants to win back the White House.\n\n“This will not be my campaign, this will be our campaign all together,” Trump said.\n\nTrump’s long-awaited campaign comes as he tries to reclaim the spotlight following the GOP’s underwhelming midterm elections performance – including the losses of several Trump-endorsed election deniers – and the subsequent blame game that has unfolded since Election Day. Republicans failed to gain a Senate majority, came up short in their efforts to fill several statewide seats, and have yet to secure a House majority, with only 215 races called in their favor so far out of the 218 needed, developments that have forced Trump and other party leaders into a defensive posture as they face reproval from within their ranks.\n\nTrump’s paperwork establishing his candidacy landed with the Federal Election Committee shortly before he delivered his announcement at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nTo the delight of aides and allies who have long advised him to mount a forward-looking campaign, he spent only a fraction of his remarks repeating his lies about the 2020 election. Though he advocated for the use of paper ballots and likened America’s election system to that of “third world countries,” Trump also tried at times to broaden his grievances – lamenting the “massive corruption” and “entrenched interests” that in his view have consumed Washington. Many of Trump’s top advisers have expressed concern that his fixation on promoting conspiracies about the last presidential election would make it harder for him to win a national election in 2024.\n\nThroughout the hour-long speech, Trump made clear that he wants his campaign to be seen by Republicans as a sacrificial undertaking.\n\n“Anyone who truly seeks to take on this rigged and corrupt system will be faced with a storm of fire that only a few could understand,” he said at one point, describing the legal and emotional toll his presidency and post-presidential period has taken on his family members.\n\nOn the heels of last week’s midterm elections, Trump has been blamed for elevating flawed candidates who spent too much time parroting his claims about election fraud, alienating key voters and ultimately leading to their defeats. He attempted to counter that criticism on Tuesday, noting that Republicans appear poised to retake the House majority and touting at least one Trump-endorsed candidate, Kevin Kiley of California. At one point, Trump appeared to blame his party’s midterm performance on voters not yet realizing “the total effect of the suffering” after two years of Democratic control in Washington.\n\n“I have no doubt that by 2024, it will sadly be much worse and they will see clearly what has happened and is happening to our country – and the voting will be much different,” he claimed.\n\nBeating others to the punch\n\nTrump is betting that his first-out-of-the gate strategy will fend off potential primary rivals and give him an early advantage with deep-pocketed donors, aides say. He is widely expected to be challenged by both conservative and moderate Republicans, though the calculus of some presidential hopefuls could change now that he is running. Others – like his former Vice President, Mike Pence – may proceed anyway.\n\nTrump’s third presidential bid also coincides with a period of heightened legal peril as Justice Department officials investigating him and his associates revisit the prospect of indictments in their Trump-related probes. The former president is currently being investigated for his activities before and during the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol and his retention of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate after he left office. While Trump is counting on an easy path to the GOP nomination with his sustained support among the party’s base, his announcement is likely to dash the hopes of party leaders who have longed for fresh talent. In particular, top Republicans have been paying close attention to the next moves of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who won his reelection contest with a 19-point margin of victory and considerable support from minority and independent voters. Some Republican leaders may try to scuttle Trump’s campaign by elevating or encouraging alternative candidates, including DeSantis, who has been quietly laying the groundwork for a possible White House bid of his own.\n\nOf course, any countereffort to inhibit Trump’s path to the nomination is likely to prove difficult. Despite his myriad legal entanglements and the stain of January 6, the twice-impeached 45th president remains immensely popular among most Republican voters and boasts a deep connection with his core backers that could prove difficult for other GOP hopefuls to replicate or weaken. Even leading conservatives who disliked Trump’s pugnacious politics and heterodox policies stuck with him as president because he helped solidify the rightward shift of the US Supreme Court with his nominations – one of the most far-reaching aspects of his legacy, which resulted in the conservative court majority’s deeply polarizing June decision to end federal abortion rights. In fact, while Trump ended his first term with the lowest approval rating of any president, Republicans viewed him favorably, according to a May NBC News poll. That alone could give Trump a significant edge over primary opponents whom voters are still familiarizing themselves with.\n\nAmong those potential competitors is Pence, who would likely benefit from high name recognition due to his role as vice president. Pence, who has been preparing for a possible White House run in 2024, is sure to face an uphill battle courting Trump’s most loyal supporters, many of whom soured on the former vice president after he declined to overstep his congressional authority and block certification of now-President Joe Biden’s 2020 victory. Trump could also find himself pitted against DeSantis, who has risen to hero status among cultural conservatives and who is widely considered a more polished version of Trump. Even some of the former president’s advisers have voiced similar observations to CNN, noting that DeSantis also made inroads with major Republican donors during his quest for reelection and built a mountain of goodwill with GOP leaders by campaigning for federal and statewide Republican candidates in the middle of his own race.\n\nBeyond his potential rivals, Trump has another roadblock in his path as the House select committee continues to investigate his role in January 6, 2021, and Justice Department officials weigh whether to issue criminal charges. The committee, which subpoenaed him for testimony and documents in October and which Trump is now battling in court, held public hearings throughout the summer and early fall featuring depositions from those in Trump’s inner circle at the White House – including members of his family – that detailed his public and private efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results through a sustained pressure campaign on numerous local, state and federal officials, and on his own vice president.\n\nBut Trump’s desire to announce his campaign early can be especially traced to the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, which advisers say further emboldened his decision to mount what he believes will be a triumphant political comeback. The day after the search, the former president fielded calls from allies advising him to accelerate his 2024 timeline. That night, he huddled with House lawmakers in the Republican Study Committee and told them he’d “made up his mind” about launching a bid, though some of those same House Republicans later convinced him to wait until after the midterm elections to announce his next move.\n\nFew of those lawmakers were present for Trump’s speech on Tuesday, choosing to remain in Washington as House Republicans conducted their leadership elections and the party continues to grapple with its failures in highly prized midterm races. Rather, the room was filled with prominent election deniers like MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, several of Trump’s attorneys, and past and present aides. Before he entered the room on Tuesday alongside former first lady Melania Trump, several members of the ex-president’s family were also seen filtering into the ballroom, including Eric and Lara Trump, his son Barron, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, and Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is engaged to Donald Trump Jr. His eldest son was notably missing, along with daughter Ivanka, , who has since said she will no longer be involved in the political arena. A source close to Donald Trump Jr. said he was stuck on a hunting trip in the mountain west and unable to catch a flight back to Florida in time for his father’s announcement. Other guests included longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone; outgoing North Carolina Rep. Madison Cawthorn; former congressman and the current CEO of Trump’s Truth Social app Devin Nunes; and his chief political adviser Susie Wiles.\n\nPreparing for 2024\n\nFrom the moment Trump left Washington, defeated and disgraced, in January 2021, he began plotting a return to power – devoting the bulk of his time to building a political operation intended for this moment. With assistance from numerous former aides and advisers, he continued the aggressive fundraising tactics that had become a marker of his 2020 campaign, amassing a colossal war chest ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, and worked diligently to elect steadfast allies in both Congress and state legislatures across the country.\n\nWhile maintaining a home base in Florida, he also regularly jet-setted across the country for campaign rallies that afforded him crucial face time with his base and with candidates he bet would become valuable allies in the US Senate and House.\n\nThrough it all, Trump continued to falsely insist that the 2020 election was stolen from him, indulging in far-flung conspiracy theories about voter fraud and pressuring Republican leaders across the party’s election apparatus to endorse changes that would curtail voting rights.\n\nTrump’s aides were pleased earlier this fall when his public appearances and rally speeches gradually became more focused on rising crime, immigration and economic woes – key themes throughout the midterm cycle and issues they hope will enable him to draw a compelling contrast with Biden as he begins this next chapter. Allies of the former president have long said that he views the 2024 contest as an opportunity to regain what he believes is his: another four years in the Oval Office.\n\nBut there is no guarantee that Trump will glide easily to a nonconsecutive second term. In fact, it could be quite difficult.\n\nNot only does history offer just one example of such a feat (defeated in 1888 after his first term, President Grover Cleveland was elected again in 1892), no previously impeached president has ever run again for office. Trump was first impeached in 2019 on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of justice, and then again in 2021 for inciting the riot at the US Capitol. Though he was acquitted by the Senate both times, 10 House Republicans broke with their party the second time around to join Democrats in a vote to impeach him. Seven Republican senators voted to convict him at his Senate trial.\n\nTrump has also been the subject of a bevy of lawsuits and investigations, including a New York state investigation and a separate Manhattan district attorney criminal probe into his company’s finances, a Georgia county probe into his efforts to overturn Biden’s election win in the state, and separate Justice Department probes into his campaign’s scheme to put forth fake electors in battleground states and his decision to bring classified materials with him to Mar-a-Lago upon leaving office.\n\nTrump’s actions since he left Washington have, for the most part, signaled his interest in an eventual return. While most former presidents go quietly into retirement – resurfacing to assist their parties during midterm cycles or for the opening of their presidential libraries – Trump bucked tradition to instead plot the comeback he now hopes to make. Despite its distance from Washington, Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club has transformed into a new hub for Republicans and a home base for his political machine. Assisted by a small group of paid staffers, he has hosted numerous candidate and committee fundraisers and seen a rotating cast of party leaders and congressional hopefuls filter through its gilded hallways in the hopes of nabbing his endorsement or reingratiating themselves with his base. Trump’s schedule has enabled him to build close relationships with party leaders and fringe figures – from House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy of California to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia – whose support in a contested primary could ultimately help him clear the field. Many of the aides who have been with him since he left the White House are expected to continue on as campaign hands, as the former president and his de facto chief of staff, longtime Florida GOP strategist Wiles, aim to maintain a lean operation much like the early days of his 2016 presidential campaign. Among those who are likely to be involved are Wiles, Taylor Budowich, Chris LaCivita, Steven Cheung, Justin Caporale and Brian Jack. Brad Parscale, who managed part of Trump’s failed 2020 campaign will not be part of his 2024 operation, nor will Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who was deeply involved in his quest for reelection.\n\nTime in office\n\nAs president, Trump faced criticism over several of his actions, especially his management of the worst public health crisis in nearly a century – the Covid-19 pandemic – though his administration helped facilitate the development of vaccines to treat the novel coronavirus in record time. He also was blasted by critics over his handling of Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico in 2017; the White nationalist rally, also in 2017, in Charlottesville, Virginia, where Heather Heyer was killed while walking with a group of counterprotesters; and Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nWhile in office, Trump signed sweeping tax cuts into law, enacted controversial hard-line immigration policies, including a policy that separated migrant children from their families and one known as “Remain in Mexico,” which the US Supreme Court ruled in June could be ended by his successor, and appointed hundreds of federal judges with deep conservative credentials. He also successfully nominated three Supreme Court justices, whose decisions this year as part of the court’s majority have shifted American society and laws rightward on issues such as abortion, guns, religious freedom and climate change.\n\nThe former real estate businessman and reality TV star was first elected to office in 2016, beating out a wide field of more than a dozen GOP candidates in an ugly primary, and then prevailing over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in a contentious general election, despite sexual misconduct allegations that would have typically been campaign-ending.\n\nAs president, Trump was an impulsive leader, who dispensed with long-standing norms, often announcing policy and Cabinet personnel changes on Twitter. (He was ultimately banned from the platform following the US Capitol riot and was later barred from Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube as well.)\n\nHe pushed an “America First” foreign policy approach, pulling the US out of international agreements such as the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal, a pair of controversial moves that were decried by many of America’s top European allies.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story mistakenly said who was likely to be involved in the Trump campaign. Brad Parscale will not be involved in the 2024 operation.

Ron DeSantis – as some of the party’s most influential donors weigh alternatives to the divisive former president.\n\nTrump still retains a “following” within the party, Mel Sembler, a Florida real-estate developer and GOP donor who sits on the coalition’s board, told CNN last week. But, he said, “I think people are getting tired of his controversies all the time.”\n\n“What concerns me is if he wins the primary and loses the general,” added Sembler, who has not endorsed a 2024 candidate.\n\nThe annual leadership conference of prominent Jewish conservatives marked the first major gathering of GOP establishment forces since this month’s midterm letdown for the party, which saw Democrats retain their hold on the Senate and make inroads in state governments around the country.\n\nRepublicans did flip the House but will hold a slim majority in January after the “red wave” their party envisioned all year failed to materialize.\n\nLeading Republican figures in Washington and elsewhere are casting blame on Trump for his role in boosting far-right Senate candidates who faltered in the general election – and for continuing to publicly nurse his own grievances about the 2020 election and his ongoing legal troubles. During his campaign kickoff Tuesday, he called himself a “victim” of a federal law enforcement system that he has spent years politicizing.\n\nTrump’s legal difficulties appeared to deepen Friday when Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed a special counsel to oversee the criminal investigations into the retention of national defense information at his Mar-a-Lago resort and parts of the January 6, 2021, insurrection.\n\nRather than seeing the party unify behind his third presidential bid, Trump faced immediate blowback. Minutes after his announcement, daughter and former senior White House adviser Ivanka Trump distanced herself from her father’s campaign, saying she does “not plan to be involved in politics.”\n\nHis announcement also overlapped with a high-profile book tour by his own former vice president – and potential 2024 rival – Mike Pence, who also spoke in Las Vegas and has spent the past several days reminding Americans of Trump’s role in the violent US Capitol riot on January 6, 2021.\n\nPerhaps the biggest blow to Trump’s campaign infrastructure was the swift and public defection of several billionaire GOP donors – including a close ally, Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman – who said the country needed leaders “rooted in today and tomorrow, not today and yesterday.”\n\nOthers are hedging their bets.\n\nAmong those playing the field is Miriam Adelson, the billionaire widow of Las Vegas casino magnate and RJC benefactor Sheldon Adelson. The Adelsons have donated nearly a half-billion dollars to Republican groups and candidates in the last four election cycles – including tens of millions to boost Trump’s presidential ambitions, federal records show.\n\nTrump in 2018 bestowed the Presidential Medal of Freedom – the nation’s highest civilian honor – on Miriam Adelson, citing her philanthropy.\n\nDespite that relationship, Adelson intends to remain neutral in the GOP presidential primaries, an aide confirmed to CNN last week. Adelson, whose political contributions have slowed some since her husband’s death in January 2021, has indicated that she will financially support the eventual GOP nominee, whether that be Trump or someone else.\n\nRJC executive director Matt Brooks said Trump has won plaudits from coalition members for his stalwart support of Israel during his presidency and unilateral withdrawal from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.\n\nStill, Brooks said, “people are window-shopping right now. There are people who are asking if we need a new direction and a new face.”\n\nThe outsider\n\nEven as Trump prepared to make his pitch to the RJC, his allies and aides had sought to position him as the outsider in the 2024 contest, despite his recent White House occupancy.\n\n“President Trump is running a campaign that represents everyday Americans who love their country,” campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said in a statement to CNN. “There are others who will answer to the political establishment, be beholden to corporations, and drag the United States into more unnecessary wars.”\n\nAnd his allies noted that Trump’s fundraising operation largely relies on a small-dollar donor base, reducing his reliance on the party’s elite and giving him a potential edge over opponents who do not boast the same small-donation game.\n\nHe enters the 2024 campaign with more than $100 million in cash reserves across a sprawling network of political committees – although federal law could constrain his ability to fully tap those funds for his campaign.\n\n“He has proven he can raise a lot of money on his own,” Michael Caputo, a former Trump administration official who remains close to the former president, recently told CNN.\n\nTrump did not make the trek to Las Vegas but addressed the gathering live via satellite Saturday as part of a lineup that featured several other potential rivals for the GOP nomination, including South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, newly reelected New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. Trump’s remote appearance was announced on Thursday, after it became clear that several of his potential 2024 rivals were scheduled to deliver their own remarks.\n\nTrump opened the speech with lines straight from his standard stump speech, but he did offer a nod to the midterm elections and his White House bid.\n\n“Breaking the radical Democrats’ grip on Congress this month was vital. It was a great thing. But we have always known that 2022 was not the end, only the beginning on the battle to save our country,” Trump said. “Now we have to take the fight straight to Joe Biden … and then we have to take back the White House in 2024.”\n\nMarquee rivalry\n\nDeSantis – fresh off the momentum of his double-digit reelection victory in Florida – addressed the group Saturday night during its gala dinner.\n\nThe governor made no mention of 2024 in his speech but touted his big reelection win – he defeated Democrat Charlie Crist by 19 points – and described Florida as being “a blueprint for success.”\n\n“In times like these, there is no substitute for victory. We in Florida are the light. Freedom will reign supreme with Florida leading the way,” DeSantis said.\n\nTrump has recently stepped up his attacks on DeSantis, and another potential 2024 challenger, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin.\n\nTwo sources familiar with Trump’s thinking said part of the reason he has lashed out is because he believes both governors are actively soliciting support from “his donors.” Trump has told aides and allies that DeSantis especially is trying to pitch himself to deep-pocketed Republicans who helped bankroll Trump’s reelection campaign.\n\nA Republican fundraiser in Florida with knowledge of DeSantis’ political operation said, “Of course, he’s talking to those people. They’re fair game and every Republican is going to go after those donors because that’s the smart thing to do, it’s not with the mindset, ‘Let’s screw Trump.’”\n\nThe conservative Club for Growth, one of the biggest outside spenders in politics, has already broken with Trump and last week circulated internal polling that suggested DeSantis could mount a serious challenge to the former president in early voting states and Florida, where both reside. The group plowed $2 million into DeSantis’ reelection effort this cycle, according to Florida campaign filings.\n\nDavid McIntosh, the former Indiana congressman who runs the group, declined a CNN interview request through a spokesman.\n\nLast week, as the contours of the new GOP majority in the House became clear, DeSantis won praise from national Republicans for injecting himself into congressional map-making this year. In a rare move for a governor, DeSantis pushed state lawmakers to adopt his map, which controversially eliminated two districts represented by Black Democrats and the GOP is now projected to hold 20 of 28 districts in the next Congress.\n\n“That map created four new Republican wins,” said a GOP consultant who has been close to Trump and asked not to be named to speak candidly about the 2024 race. “That’s the practical reality of a conservative governor standing up to his own party and saying, ‘We’re not going to cut deals and do things the old way.’”\n\nDeSantis last week sought to sidestep questions about the growing rivalry with Trump, urging people “to chill out a little bit” – even as he touted his margin of victory in his reelection. CNN has previously reported that those close to DeSantis believe he does not intend to announce his plans before May.\n\n“The smartest thing DeSantis could do is stay out of the fray for as long as possible,” said the Republican consultant. “Don’t stick your face in the frying pan too early.”\n\n‘We keep losing and losing and losing’\n\nMany of Trump’s potential 2024 rivals spoke at the conference in Las Vegas, offering post-midterm assessments and making their pitch for how the party should move forward.\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, an early ally of Trump, issued a long and passionate indictment of the former president on Saturday, casting Trump as a cancer on the Republican Party and the sole responsible figure for its recent election losses.\n\n“We keep losing and losing and losing,” Christie said. “The reason we’re losing is because Donald Trump has put himself before everybody else.”\n\nChristie slammed Trump for recruiting candidates under the singular qualification that they deny the results of the 2020 election.\n\n“That’s not what this party stands for,” the former governor said. “It’s not what it should stand for in the future, and we’ve got to stop it now.”\n\nChristie pointed to midterm GOP defeats in the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, and warned that without a resurgence in those states – especially in the suburbs – Republicans held no hope of winning back the White House in 2024.\n\nEchoing those fears, New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu said that “candidate quality matters,” while adding, “I got a great policy for the Republican Party: Let’s stop supporting crazy, unelectable candidates in our primaries and start getting behind winners that can close the deal in November.”\n\nSununu was initially courted to run for US Senate, but ultimately decided to run for reelection. The GOP nominee, retired Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc, who has pushed falsehoods about the 2020 election, went on to lose to Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan earlier this month.\n\nMeanwhile, Florida Sen. Rick Scott, who headed the Senate GOP’s campaign arm this election cycle, said Republicans’ midterm hopes for a “red wave” did not materialize because the party focused too much on “how bad the Democrats are” and did not offer voters its own policy vision.\n\n“The current strategy of most Republicans in Washington is to only be against the crazy Democrats – and they’re crazy – and never outline any plan what we are for and what we will do. That is a mistake,” the senator said.\n\nScott’s comments come days after his failed bid to oust Mitch McConnell as the party’s Senate leader.\n\nTexas Sen. Ted Cruz, who unsuccessfully ran for president against Trump in 2016, urged the GOP to try to broaden its appeal outside the party’s base.\n\n“We spend far too much time preaching to the choir; talking to the same 2.6 million people watching Fox News every night,” Cruz said.\n\nCruz also said he had spoken at Senate Republicans’ recent leadership election to urge the party to take a harder line against Democratic policies.\n\n“Republicans in the Senate don’t fight,” he said Saturday.\n\nCruz said he urged GOP leaders to “pick two or three or four things that matter and say, ‘We believe in it.’”\n\nIn his own remarks, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy touted the GOP taking control of the chamber in the midterms and promised that Republicans would be quick to wield their new subpoena power next year.\n\n“We finally have a check and balance,” the California Republican said, before pausing to prod the audience, “You can applaud that, that was a big victory.”\n\nFormer United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, meanwhile, said Saturday that she will “have more to say soon” about a potential 2024 presidential run, while adding that she’s “won tough primaries” before.\n\nHaley, a onetime South Carolina governor, called on the GOP to “look in the mirror” after the party’s lackluster midterm performance, saying, “Republicans spent as much time fighting each other as we did the Democrats.”\n\n“It is time to quit eating our own,” Haley said.\n\nOutgoing Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan took a hard stance against the former president Friday night, saying in Las Vegas that the Republican Party was “desperately in need of a course correction.”\n\n“Trump was saying that we’d be winning so much we get tired of winning. Well, I’m sick and tired of our party losing. And after this election last week, I’m even more sick and tired than I was before,” Hogan said.\n\n“Look, this is the third election in a row that we lost and should have won. I say three strikes and you’re out. If you repeatedly lose to a really bad team, it’s time for new leadership,” he added.\n\nThis story has been updated with more information.", "authors": ["Fredreka Schouten Gaborr Steve Contorno", "Fredreka Schouten", "Steve Contorno"], "publish_date": "2022/11/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/20/politics/mike-pence-washington-visit-capitol-hill/index.html", "title": "Pence signals a 2024 bid as he meets with lawmakers and delivers ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence is no longer keeping his cards close, telegraphing in several high-profile moves this week that he is actively exploring a 2024 presidential bid and working to gain a foothold in Trump-fatigued corners of the Republican Party.\n\nThese speeches and appearances undoubtedly reflect the former vice president’s towering political ambitions. While a person familiar with his thinking said Pence has not yet “firmly” decided on a presidential run, he is spending the bulk of his time laying the groundwork and strengthening his ties to key players inside the GOP to ensure he is well-positioned should he announce a bid later this year or next.\n\nOn Monday, Pence threw his weight behind Arizona GOP gubernatorial hopeful Karrin Taylor Robson, whom he will rally alongside on Friday. It was the latest move in a proxy war between Pence and former President Donald Trump, who is slated to hold his own campaign rally on Friday for rival candidate Kari Lake. Ahead of Friday’s split-screen between the two men, Pence aides have circulated a past Facebook post by Lake where she dismissed Trump as “not my president” just days before his 2017 inauguration.\n\nOn Wednesday, Pence returned to Capitol Hill for the first time since he left office to meet with conservative members of the Republican Study Committee, a group he once helmed as a congressman from Indiana and whose current leader, Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana, has previously identified himself as an early supporter of a potential Pence 2024 campaign. Pence’s visit came just a day after Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell seemed to encourage other Republicans to challenge Trump in a primary if the former President decides to launch another White House campaign, as is widely expected. Pence also introduced House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy at a “Young Guns” fundraising dinner on Tuesday night, per a source familiar, underscoring his efforts to maintain close ties to top Republican leaders.\n\n“I think we’re going to have a crowded field for president,” McConnell told reporters on Tuesday when asked how he might confront a third White House bid by Trump. “I assume that most of that will unfold later, and people will be picking their candidates during a crowded primary field.”\n\nLater Wednesday, Pence delivered remarks in South Carolina, an early presidential primary state, where he outlined a path forward for abortion opponents in “a post-Roe America” – urging Republicans to slash red tape for families looking to adopt and bar the US Postal Service from delivering mail-order abortion pills.\n\n“As we gather tonight, we must recognize that we’ve only come to the end of the beginning. Standing here in the first days of a post-Roe America, we must resolve that we will not rest, we will not relent until the sanctity of life is restored in the law of every state in the nation,” Pence told a crowd at the Florence Baptist Temple, stopping short of endorsing a national ban on elective abortions.\n\nThe former vice president has previously signaled interest in banning abortion in all 50 states, either through individual state measures or a national ban. Next week, Pence will outline his policy blueprint for Republicans, dubbed the “Freedom Agenda” by his group Advancing American Freedom, in a speech at the Heritage Foundation in Washington.\n\nEven as Pence lays the groundwork, all of these moves are happening against the backdrop of Trump’s own 2024 machinations and his public criticism of Pence both before he refused the then-President’s pressure campaign to block certification of the electoral votes on January 6, 2021, and in the year and a half since.\n\nPence works to keep Hill allies close\n\nDuring a private breakfast meeting near the US Capitol on Wednesday, RSC members thanked Pence for his actions on January 6 and encouraged him to run for President, according to multiple attendees.\n\nRep. Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican, said lawmakers offered Pence encouraging words about a potential presidential bid, saying they hope he plays a big role in 2024 and that they need more voices like his in the party.\n\nPence responded with a smile, according to Bacon, but did not tip his hand about his plans for his political future even as he prepared to fly to South Carolina later that afternoon.\n\n“People said they hope he’s going to be a big voice in 2024. … He was being encouraged: we need more of you in 2024,” Bacon said. “And I would agree.”\n\nRep. Dan Newhouse, a Washington Republican who voted to impeach then-President Donald Trump for inciting the deadly insurrection, confirmed to CNN there were multiple references to a potential Pence presidential bid during their closed-door meeting.\n\nPence, however, told lawmakers that he is focused right now on helping the House GOP win the 2022 midterms and offered to stump for members on the campaign trail, according to attendees. Pence also handed out a lengthy booklet detailing his agenda and policy vision for the country.\n\nPence’s visit with the RSC, the largest conservative caucus in Congress, represents an attempt to maintain key congressional alliances as he explores a potential White House run.\n\nThe meeting also comes on the eve of potentially the last prime-time hearing from the House select committee investigating the deadly riot at the US Capitol. The committee has revealed stunning details about Trump’s pressure campaign on Pence and others to overturn the 2020 election. The panel is still weighing whether to ask Pence to speak with the committee, according to members.\n\nBut despite a growing rift between Trump and Pence, Republicans on Capitol Hill had no qualms about heaping praise on Pence, a former member of the House who once chaired the RSC.\n\nRep. Andy Barr, a Kentucky Republican, confirmed that RSC members thanked Pence for his conduct on January 6, when he refused to give in to Trump’s demands to object to the certification of the 2020 election results.\n\n“Let me just say: the vice president is a real moral force in our party,” Barr said. “He’s a real true leader, and he’s earned the respect of Republicans and other Americans all over the country.”\n\nRep. Chip Roy of Texas, who also belongs to the hardline House Freedom Caucus and voted to certify the election results, is one of the members who stood up and thanked Pence, according to a source inside the room. The comments were met with loud applause, the source said.\n\nOne topic that did not explicitly come up during the meeting was Trump himself, according to attendees. But Pence did praise the Trump agenda and talked up some of the victories they scored under the Trump presidency. Pence also brought up the recent Supreme Court ruling that overturned the constitutional right to an abortion, attendees said.\n\nPrior to the meeting, Pence’s former chief of staff Marc Short, who has testified to the select committee, was standing outside with Pence’s brother Rep. Greg Pence of Indiana and RSC Chairman Jim Banks, also of Indiana, who hosted the gathering. After the former vice president arrived, he greeted the trio and they all walked inside.\n\nLeaving the meeting, Short did not answer questions about Pence’s remarks or the ongoing January 6 investigation.\n\nFinding a foothold in the GOP base\n\nAt the South Carolina church on Wednesday, Pence addressed an audience of grassroots and religious conservatives who, like him, have spent years working to return the question of abortion rights to individual states. It’s these types of voters who flocked to Trump’s 2016 campaign after he added Pence, the genteel former Indiana governor, to his ticket, and the former vice president is hoping he can regain their favor ahead of a possible White House run.\n\nPence previously spoke on the same topic last November at an event hosted by Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, a prominent anti-abortion group on the political right whose president, Marjorie Dannenfelser, is a longtime friend and ally of Pence and has privately counseled him on the issue as he considers his future. That appearance came on the eve of oral arguments in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the landmark case that eventually led the Supreme Court to overturn federal abortion rights this year.\n\nPence used his remarks to deliver a blueprint of sorts to his fellow Republicans to strengthen abortion restrictions and further limit the federal government’s involvement in the issue. From protecting the Hyde Amendment, which blocks federal funding for most abortions under Medicaid, to de-regulating the adoption industry, Pence said abortion opponents should continue to work toward such goals now that the Supreme Court has ended federal abortion rights.\n\n“It should not cost the average American worker more than a year’s worth of wages to adopt a child,” Pence said, adding that “if you’re going to be pro-life, you need to be pro-adoption.”\n\nUnlike other Republicans who have largely avoided the topic of abortion since the June decision – many of whom are running for reelection in 2022 – Pence has been working to underscore his socially conservative bona fides by leaning into the issue of abortion.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.", "authors": ["Gaborr Melanie Zanona", "Melanie Zanona"], "publish_date": "2022/07/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/donald-trump-botched-midterms-analysis/index.html", "title": "GOP puts on a show of disunity as it edges toward House majority ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWashington Republicans are in an uproar hours ahead of Donald Trump’s expected launch of a new presidential run, exacerbated by the party’s protracted wait for the House majority it will use to try to weaken President Joe Biden.\n\nTrump apparently plans to open the 2024 election cycle at his Mar-a-Lago resort Tuesday evening, despite the failure of his election-denying acolytes in the midterms and unusual ambivalence among GOP lawmakers over his prospects.\n\nHis unsuccessful attempt to leverage the congressional elections to display his own power set off a mess of infighting and recriminations over the failure of the GOP to stir a red wave to claim big congressional majorities. It also raised questions over Trump’s own 2024 general election viability. The result is that the GOP in Washington is further weakened and Trump is under some of the most intense pressure he’s faced during a turbulent political career – even if there’s no sign yet that his enduring power base in the party’s adoring grassroots has eroded.\n\nThe ex-President had clearly hoped to claim credit for a banner Republican midterm performance to supercharge his bid to win back the presidency, but the party failed to recapture the Senate – and a whole week from Election Day, it is still waiting for its control of the House to be confirmed. The GOP did add several seats overnight and now stands three seats short of the 218 it needs. But its eventual margin will be far smaller than it had hoped, meaning the majority will be volatile and hard to manage.\n\nStill, while that could cause general chaos in Washington, it could give pro-Trump factions in the party the chance to maximize their leverage on potential House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who is facing a tougher than expected struggle to nail down the votes he would need to take the top job in January. On Monday evening, GOP Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona confirmed he would challenge McCarthy in a bid to show he didn’t yet have sufficient support to speaker.\n\nStill, the California Republican and current minority leader did get a standing ovation after calling on his conference to show unity on Monday ahead of Tuesday’s leadership elections.\n\nBack-biting has also broken out in the Senate GOP, with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz slamming veteran Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, while Florida Sen. Rick Scott mulls a challenge despite his failed stewardship of the GOP campaign committee’s bid to win the Senate. A fight also looms over control of the Republican National Committee.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Ted Cruz says he's 'pissed off' and is blaming Mitch McConnell 01:26 - Source: CNN\n\nThe finger-pointing is emerging over a disappointing performance for Republicans. Trump-style extremism was repudiated at the ballot box in a vote that ought to have been a referendum on an unpopular sitting president in a tough economy – rather than one on a predecessor who left the White House but won’t go away.\n\nThere is every logical reason for Republicans to move on from Trump. One lesson from last week’s election is that voters didn’t reject Republicans per se. Authentic conservatives who distanced themselves from the ex-president, like Govs. Brian Kemp of Georgia, Mike DeWine of Ohio, Ron DeSantis of Florida and Chris Sununu of New Hampshire cruised to reelection.\n\nBut multiple Trump-backed candidates for governor, secretary of state posts, and Senate and House seats flamed out. One of the most high-profile election deniers, Arizona Republican Kari Lake, will lose to Democrat Katie Hobbs, CNN projected Monday evening. Democrats in Michigan, meanwhile, won control of the state legislature, which had spent the last two years on election-denying distractions. Swearing loyalty to Trump and his election fraud hot air proved to be a disastrous campaign strategy for many candidates.\n\nCampaign announcement to set up GOP test\n\nThe projected defeat of Lake in the Arizona governor’s race on Monday completes a near total rout of 2020 election deniers in swing states whom Trump thrust into the midterm elections.\n\nHis determination to run again is already drawing widespread opposition among many Republicans on Capitol Hill, who are reeling from their failure to whip up a red wave to capture the Senate, where Democrats held on, and the House, which remains uncalled.\n\nA new Trump campaign would set up a test between the growing skepticism of his ambitions among the upper echelons of his party and the adoration millions of base voters still feel for the twice-impeached ex-president.\n\nDespite once telling supporters he’d do so much winning they’d get tired of it, Trump’s record on Election Day is pretty thin – save from the transformative shock of his 2016 triumph over Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe GOP’s losses under his watch – when they lost the House in 2018 and the Senate two years later – are driving a debate over his political viability within the party he has long dominated. His foisting of poor quality, extreme, election-denying candidates on the GOP in this year’s midterms is not just dampening his possible launch party. The ex-president is being accused of sabotaging his own team.\n\nBut true to form, Trump has shown little sign of self-doubt. Instead, he’s been attacking those Republicans who have proven they can build broad majorities more recently than he has – including DeSantis, his biggest potential threat in a presidential primary, and Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who campaigned for GOP candidates across the country this year after last year flipping a state Biden had won by 10 points.\n\nBut while Trump’s brand is tarnished and there are fresh doubts over whether a new campaign based on his obsessive claims of false voter fraud will fly in a general election, his past record of resilience suggests he shouldn’t be dismissed.\n\nThe 45th president has been down and damaged before – after the “Access Hollywood” tape was released in his first campaign, when Republicans lost the House in 2018, and then again following his own general election defeat in 2020. He earned the historic shame of a second impeachment after inciting an insurrection at the US Capitol in 2021.\n\nBut he’s always bounced back, leveraging a near mythical bond with the Republican base to break party rivals. Trump’s power has always been rooted in the notion that potential Republican foes cannot afford to attack him since they’d alienate his supporters and ruin their own political careers. One motivation behind an early White House announcement may be to prove that’s still true, as candidates like DeSantis, ex-Vice President Mike Pence, and other presidential wannabes assess his strength as they consider their own aspirations.\n\nPence, for example – who will appear in a CNN town hall on Wednesday evening – told ABC News in an interview that aired Monday that the American people will “have better choices in the future.”\n\nA 2024 presidential race – with several strong potential GOP alternatives ready in the wings – will test whether Trump’s magnetism with primary voters will overcome growing fatigue over his incessant 2020 election fraud lies. And it would ask GOP primary voters a question: is their devotion to the ex-president more important than worries about his capacity to actually win the White House, despite growing evidence to the contrary?\n\n‘Is it time to rebuild?’\n\nSo unless he has a major change of attitude, Trump – who still fumes with fury about the last presidential election in every campaign rally – will have to prove that that his false claims of a stolen election in 2020 are a winning message in 2024.\n\nEvidence suggests that while those falsehoods may still be a hot currency inside the GOP grassroots, it’s a bust in a broader national electorate.\n\n“You know, if you lose over and over to what’s really not that great of a team, you have got to reassess, is it time to rebuild?” Maryland’s Republican Gov. Larry Hogan said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. “Trump’s cost us the last three elections. And I don’t want to see it happen a fourth time.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback GOP governor: 'Trump cost us the race' 02:05 - Source: CNN\n\nOutgoing Pennsylvania GOP Sen. Pat Toomey effectively accused the ex-president of losing his seat. The Democratic path to Senate control ran through Pennsylvania, where Democrat John Fetterman defeated Republican Mehmet Oz. With Trump’s backing, Oz had narrowly prevailed over businessman David McCormick, a potentially stronger general election candidate, in the primary.\n\n“All over the country, there’s a very high correlation between MAGA candidates and big losses, or at least dramatically underperforming,” Toomey told CNN’s Erin Burnett last week.\n\nOn Monday, Idaho GOP Rep. Mike Simpson told CNN said that while he embraced Trumpism, he had tired of Trump and didn’t think he was good for the party. “I think his policies were good. I just don’t need all the drama with it,” he told CNN’s Alex Rogers.\n\nAnd one of the incoming Republican House lawmakers, Mike Lawler, who picked up a Democratic seat in New York, said it was time for someone else. “I would like to see the party move forward,” he said on CNN’s “This Morning” last week.\n\nAnd in an exclusive interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper on Monday, outgoing Republican Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker said that people were tired of the radicalism represented by the former president.\n\n“One of the big lessons that the Republican Party nationally needs to take away from (the midterms) is voters want collaborative elected officials. They don’t want extremes,” Baker said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Outgoing GOP governor: Here's what Republicans should learn from midterms 02:10 - Source: CNN\n\nTrump still knows his base like few other Republicans\n\nBut while there are important strategic reasons for ambitious Republicans to desert Trump, past experience suggests it would be foolish to dismiss him – even if his early launch, if it happens, could antagonize voters still exhausted by the previous election.\n\nTo begin with, many of those most loudly questioning his continued dominance of the party in recent days have already broken with him in some fashion. There are few signs that more pro-Trump politicians like Cruz are pulling away.\n\nMissouri Sen. Josh Hawley, often spoken of as a future GOP presidential candidate, did hint that he was considering his options when he described the midterms as “the funeral for the Republican Party as we know it.” The Missouri Republican, who has publicly vowed to oppose McConnell’s bid for leader, called for a conversation about what the GOP can do for working class voters before the 2024 election.\n\n“I like a lot of what President Trump did as president … we need to have a conversation about our core convictions. … Clearly this party is going to have to be different or we are not going to be a majority party in this country,” Hawley told Capitol Hill reporters on Monday.\n\nBut at the same time, Trumpism is actually returning to power in Washington. The likely new Republican House may only enjoy a small majority, but it would still be an overwhelmingly pro-Trump force that would relish the chance to try to thwart Biden’s presidency ahead of a possible clash with his predecessor in 2024. Ambitious GOP leaders like New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, the third-ranking House Republican, have already endorsed Trump for president. If Trump is able to demonstrate he’s still strong with grassroots voters, some Republicans might, as they always have before, judge that their hopes for a future in the party mean they must swallow their antipathy to the former president yet again.\n\nFelling Trump might require a candidate like DeSantis to risk his political future to try to take him out. And another crowded primary in the GOP’s winner-take-all presidential race could splinter opposition to Trump and help him plot a path to the nomination.\n\nTrump has never been a cerebral, logical choice for his supporters. In 2016, he fused frustration with the globalized economy and contempt for elites to create a powerful political movement. And it goes deeper than policy. Trump offers his supporters an emotional connection. His rallies are less political speeches than raucous, politically incorrect nights out at which vast crowds relish his defiance, his embrace of their grievances and willingness to say anything, as he crushes propriety and convention. People really do want to believe what he says and not – as he famously once cautioned them against – the facts that the press reports. Attendees often look like they are having the time of their lives with a candidate who, despite serving as president for four years, has maintained the conceit that he’s just one of them and not a real politician.\n\nIf Trump can rekindle that feeling, he’d still be a formidable force in the GOP whether or not its grandees believe he’d risk losing them yet another election in 2024.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/04/politics/donald-trump-presidential-announcement/index.html", "title": "Trump aides eye third week of November for 2024 announcement ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nTop aides to former President Donald Trump have discussed the third week of November as an ideal launch point for his 2024 presidential campaign if Republicans fare well in the midterm elections next week, sources familiar with the matter tell CNN.\n\nTwo sources said Trump’s team has specifically discussed November 14 as one possible announcement date, which would come in the middle of an overseas trip to Asia that President Joe Biden has long been scheduled to make. Trump is unlikely to announce prior to that Monday, even if the GOP exceeds expectations on Election Night, to avoid overshadowing his daughter Tiffany’s November 12 wedding at Mar-a-Lago and because he does not want to share a news cycle with midterm results, sources said.\n\nThese sources also cautioned that no date has been locked in and Trump could push it back if control of the Senate remains undecided after Election Day or Republicans see underwhelming gains in their House races. While discussions about where Trump should launch his next White House bid have occurred, one person familiar with the matter said his team has not yet made a decision on a venue and is still toying with an announcement close to home in Palm Beach, Florida, where he has headquartered his political operation since leaving Washington, or in a Rust Belt battleground area like Ohio or Pennsylvania.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Taylor Budowich, a spokesman for Trump, declined to comment “on the never-ending speculation and rumors.”\n\nThe former president has long been eyeing the post-midterm period before Thanksgiving as a window of opportunity to launch his next political act. As CNN has previously reported, Trump expects the GOP to make significant gains on Election Night and wants to capitalize on the momentum coming out of Tuesday if his prediction holds, especially if his handpicked Senate candidates prevail in key contests in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Ohio and Georgia. Trump has also expressed an interest in announcing before the end of the year to place potential 2024 rivals on notice. One of them, former Vice President Mike Pence, is due to release a book about his time in office on November 15 and recently said “there might be somebody else who I’d prefer more” as the next Republican presidential nominee, fueling speculation that he intends to challenge his former boss.\n\nAt a rally Thursday in Iowa, Trump told the audience to “get ready” for his return to the presidential campaign trail, noting that he would “very, very, very probably do it again,” in reference to running for the White House. It was his latest attempt to put Republicans on notice without outright announcing a third campaign before Election Day, something House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and other top Republicans had previously encouraged Trump to refrain from doing.\n\n“I give him a ton of credit for not announcing this year [and] for not stepping in the way of the midterm candidates. I’m glad he didn’t do that. That was certainly my advice from the beginning,” former White House counselor Kellyanne Conway told reporters at an event Thursday morning.\n\nNews of Trump’s potential November 14 announcement was first reported by Axios.\n\nA Trump announcement later this month would come as he continues to navigate several high-profile investigations that could heat back up after Election Day, when the Justice Department ends its traditional quiet period leading up to Election Day and could begin announcing indictments of Trump associates who were involved in efforts to overturn the 2020 election. The former president remains under investigation for bringing classified government documents to Mar-a-Lago at the end of his presidency and was recently subpoenaed by the House select committee for his testimony and documents related to the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. Meanwhile, Trump also faces an ongoing probe by Fulton County prosecutors into his attempts to overturn the 2020 election results in Georgia.\n\nJustice Department officials have discussed whether a Trump candidacy would create the need for a special counsel to oversee two sprawling federal investigations related to the former president, sources familiar with the matter tell CNN.", "authors": ["Gaborr Kristen Holmes", "Kristen Holmes"], "publish_date": "2022/11/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/16/politics/trump-2024-announcement-timing/index.html", "title": "Trump is weighing whether to announce a 2024 bid before the ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe signs of Donald Trump’s next White House run are there. He has hosted wannabe campaign managers at Mar-a-Lago and quizzed golf partners between shots on who he should put in charge, though no formal interviews have been conducted.\n\nHis interest in 2024 polls – especially how he stacks up against Florida’s Ron DeSantis, his home-state governor – has piqued in recent months, but Trump has yet to formally launch an exploratory committee. And he’s made a series of midterm endorsements meant to impress Republican voters, proving that he has the magic touch – though recent losses in Idaho, Georgia and North Carolina have begun to tell a different story.\n\nWith virtually no formal campaign apparatus in place, mounting questions about the strength of his influence over GOP primary voters and high-profile congressional hearings that are reinjecting Trump’s 2020 election claims into the national conversation, sources close to the former President told CNN he is nevertheless closer than ever to announcing another run for office. As more and more Republicans add Iowa and New Hampshire to their schedules and work to gauge the party’s appetite for fresh leadership, Trump has been telling friends and advisers he wants to put his potential rivals on notice – and soon.\n\n“Announcing before the midterms allows him to clear the field, shore up the donor base and take a victory lap after the midterms,” one former Trump campaign official said.\n\nBut the prospect of Trump launching a third bid for the White House as an end-of-summer or October surprise has worried many of these allies, who think the timing is premature. More than 10 Trump confidants, advisers and aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity said they have personally advised the 45th President to hold off on a formal campaign launch until next year. They noted the careful planning it would take to pull off an announcement that commands deference from other Republican hopefuls and injects excitement into corners of the GOP that crave a new standard-bearer and have quietly debated whether someone like DeSantis, whom Republicans widely consider a new-dand-improved version of Trump, might be more competitive in a general election.\n\n“I don’t think the lack of planning means he’s not actually serious about running. It just means it’s going to be another fly-by-the-seat-of-his-pants sh– show if he does,” said one person close to Trump.\n\nTrump has, of course, taken some steps that are customary for would-be candidates. He has stuck his neck out with high-profile endorsements in key Senate and gubernatorial contests, winning some and losing others. He has built a thriving post-presidential fundraising operation with around $110 million currently in its war chest – topping what both national parties have in the bank. And he has worked to maintain a close relationship with key supporters through periodic campaign rallies and appearances at conservative events. Later this week, he will deliver remarks at the Faith & Freedom Coalition’s annual conference for religious conservatives in Nashville, Tennessee – joining other possible 2024 GOP hopefuls on the speaking roster.\n\nStill, those around Trump who say he is keen on announcing a campaign this year admit that his overall infrastructure is still lacking. One longtime Trump pal also said the former President needs to spend more time beta-testing different messages before throwing his hat in the ring because his false claim that the 2020 election was stolen “is not enough on its own to justify running again.”\n\n“A red wave in November would give him the perfect opportunity to adopt a forward-looking message. He can talk about what Republicans will do to turn the country around now that they have more control and what he would do in a second term to boost those efforts,” this person said.\n\nQuestions about staffing\n\nA key question for allies of the former President is who, exactly, would be involved in his campaign if he announces before the November midterms. That timing would come on the heels of public hearings by the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol that have featured damning testimony from both Trump’s family members and former aides and advisers.\n\nWhile Trump has yet to abandon his practice of consulting a rotating cast of friends, family members and advisers about his political decisions, it is unclear who among his kitchen cabinet would actually commit themselves to another presidential campaign. He has complained, both privately and publicly, about former aides such as Mark Meadows and Kellyanne Conway, who have detailed their experiences in the Trump White House with personal memoirs, and has an increasingly limited number of advisers who are neither profiting off their proximity to him or directly on his payroll – limiting his willingness to trust their intentions.\n\n“He won’t have trouble attracting people if he runs, the trouble will be in who he attracts,” said the former Trump campaign official, who wasn’t ready to commit to working on his 2024 campaign if he runs. “If it resembles anything like 2016 or 2020, there were days when we spent 18 or 19 hours at Trump Tower because of how short-staffed he was. That scares me off a little bit.”\n\nMeanwhile, other former members of Trump’s inner circle have voluntarily created distance.\n\nTrump’s daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner are no longer part of his everyday political operation, said multiple people familiar with the situation, noting that the couple has spent most of the past 18 months focused on their children, settling into the Miami area, and ensuring the success of Kushner’s new investment fund, Affinity Partners.\n\n“I don’t see them being all that involved strategically,” said a second person close to Trump. “Trump trusts [Ivanka] but she’s not knee deep in this like most of his advisers.”\n\nIn fact, in a post to his Truth Social website following the January 6 committee’s first public hearing last week, Trump rebuffed his daughter’s sworn testimony that she believed there was insufficient evidence of fraud in the 2020 election – claiming “she had long since checked out” during the final months of his presidency.\n\nIn the couple’s absence, the former President has been turning more frequently to his son, Donald Trump Jr., for advice on candidate endorsements and messaging.\n\n“Obviously, if he does make an announcement, the Democrat machine will be fully against him, and they will spend so much money trying to knock him out. Once he announces, the negativity will be ramped up, so that’s why it’s important to figure out in advance who is going to be responding to that stuff besides the candidate himself,” the former Trump campaign official said.\n\nBut one current Trump adviser disputed the idea that the former President could be in a precarious position if he launches another presidential campaign later this summer or in the early fall. This adviser pointed to recent campaign finance reports from Trump’s various fundraising committees showing the thousands of dollars he has been spending each month on payroll during his post-presidency.\n\n“In terms of a campaign manager,” the adviser added, “he really doesn’t need one right now.”\n\n“I think [2024] will be decent. Both 2016 and 2020 started very different but got to a place that was really well organized and highly functioning as a campaign operation. He has done this twice now and can put together a pretty good infrastructure” when he wants, the adviser said.\n\nTwo people familiar with the matter said Trump has rented out some off-site office space in Palm Beach, Florida, for those involved in his Save America PAC. And the expectation across his orbit is that any 2024 campaign will be headquartered in Florida, most likely at his current residence.\n\n“Mar-a-Lago will be the campaign HQ and he’ll rent space onsite to the campaign for an exorbitant rate,” said one of the people close to Trump in a nod to the former President’s practice of blurring the lines between his business ventures and political activities.\n\n‘The ball will start rolling’\n\nFor his part, Trump sees his travels for the 2022 midterms and existing fundraising machine as preparation enough for a third presidential run – two steps that leave him ready to announce at a moment’s notice.\n\nBut once the former President settles on an actual announcement date, allies expect he will want to go all in to attract the media attention and shock value his recent campaign rallies have been lacking. That, of course, will take time to plan out.\n\n“There hasn’t been a pick-up-the-phone, ‘We’re doing this by X date,’ conversation yet. Once that happens, the ball will start rolling,” said a third person close to Trump. “What I expect to happen is we will get to mid-summer, and he’ll let a very small group of people know he’s ready and to start organizing without causing too much noise.”\n\nIn the meantime, Trump has been tending to his relationships with top House Republicans – hoping to have an army of MAGA surrogates ready to support him from Capitol Hill if he runs – and working to remain relevant with appearances in 2022 battlegrounds and venues that guarantee him adoring crowds. He will do that Friday when he addresses the audience in Nashville, an appearance he will use to respond to this week’s public hearings by the congressional panel investigating January 6.\n\nThere is one additional consideration Trump has privately discussed with aides and allies as he weighs the timing of a 2024 announcement. The former President remains under investigation in Georgia, where Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has impaneled a special grand jury to determine whether Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in Georgia warrant criminal prosecution. When the grand jury finishes its work, which could take several months, it will issue a report detailing its findings. Two people close to Trump said he is closely monitoring that probe but isn’t treating it as a primary factor in his 2024 decision.\n\n“That is a storyline that could dominate the fall and first quarter of a presidential cycle, so there is a calculation of getting out in front of it,” said one of the people close to Trump.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/21/politics/republican-primary-2024-candidates/index.html", "title": "GOP begins to look for new 2024 candidates amid fears over Trump ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA growing number of Republicans are openly cheering for a competitive primary field in 2024 and encouraging candidates to jump into the race, as some in the GOP get increasingly anxious about the idea of Donald Trump becoming their presidential nominee again – especially amid damning revelations about his actions during the January 6, 2021, insurrection.\n\nRep. Dan Crenshaw, a member of the conservative Republican Study Committee, said that the party has a “lot of good options” and he hopes “they all jump in” to the race. The Texas Republican added that he does not think Trump would be the automatic frontrunner if he decides to launch a third White House bid.\n\nSenate Minority Whip John Thune told CNN that there will be “other attractive” Republican candidates in 2024 besides Trump, echoing recent comments from Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who predicted it will be a crowded field.\n\nAnd Rep. Dusty Johnson, a South Dakota Republican and member of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, said he thinks it would be healthy for the GOP to have a debate about who should be their next standard-bearer.\n\n“I certainly hope we’ll have a crowded field so we can have a robust discussion,” Johnson told CNN. “Trump’s going to have a certain amount of built-in support. So yeah, he’s gonna be ahead in early polls. But I also know that these primaries hardly ever go as scripted.”\n\n“So that’s why you gotta let the process play out,” he added.\n\nWhile Trump still maintains more support among Republicans than any other would-be challenger, there are growing fears inside the GOP about Trump’s potential legal woes and political baggage, which has some lawmakers eying the party’s bench of alternative options, according to Republicans granted anonymity to speak more freely. There is particular concern in GOP circles about the criminal investigation out of the Fulton County District Attorney’s office, which is probing the plot by Trump and his allies to appoint false electors in Georgia in an attempt to overturn the 2020 election results.\n\nAs Crenshaw put it: it would “suck” to select a GOP nominee that winds up getting indicted, though he said he is making no predictions about the outcome of those investigations.\n\n“I won’t be supporting Donald Trump for president or anything else,” said Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, a leading anti-Trump voice in the GOP who voted to convict Trump in both of his impeachment trials. “I think he’s hurt our party and I think he continues to do so.”\n\nStill, most Republicans – even those who are apprehensive about another Trump bid – are signaling they’d fall in line if he ultimately throws his hat into the ring and prevails in the primary.\n\n“It’s always been my practice to support the nominee,” Thune said when asked if he would back Trump as the GOP nominee even if he questioned his fitness for office.\n\nAs the House select committee investigating the January 6 insurrection has publicly revealed damaging details about Trump’s role in the Capitol attack, the former President has begun to weigh an early White House bid – potentially even before the midterms – in an effort to both freeze the field and shift the narrative. His fiercest allies have welcomed the idea of another Trump run.\n\n“Speaker Pelosi’s January 6th Committee is nothing more than a partisan sham. The American people see right through it,” House GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik said in a statement to CNN. “I strongly support President Trump, and hope he runs again in 2024. And if the election were held today, there is no question he would beat Joe Biden handily.”\n\nEven with the threat of Trump running again, a number of Republicans have begun to explore potential presidential bids and meet with donors. Some of them have not ruled out directly challenging Trump for the nomination if he decides to get in the race.\n\nRep. Austin Scott, a Georgia Republican and member of the RSC, told CNN he thinks it would be “great” to see multiple candidates compete for the party nomination, noting that while he would “probably” back Trump, he is also friends with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo – both former House members.\n\nRep. Dan Newhouse of Washington, one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump for inciting the insurrection, agreed, saying they ought to see “who has all the best ideas.”\n\n2024 hopefuls get a stage on Capitol Hill\n\nThe Republican Study Committee, the largest conservative caucus on Capitol Hill, has hosted a number of these 2024 hopefuls over the past year – including Pompeo, Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley – and offered them a platform to share their vision and build congressional alliances. The group has also met numerous times with Trump.\n\nMost recently, the group met with former Vice President Mike Pence, who telegraphed in several high-profile moves last week that he is actively exploring a 2024 presidential bid and working to gain a foothold in Trump-fatigued corners of the Republican Party.\n\n“That’s what has made the RSC important, is that we’ve been planting the flag for where the party goes from here,” Rep. Jim Banks, a fellow Indiana Republican who chairs the Republican Study Committee, told CNN. “The RSC has always believed that if we adopt the Trump agenda as our party platform, then our party will be stronger and healthier than ever before.”\n\nDuring a closed-door meeting with the RSC on Wednesday, some members thanked Pence for his actions on January 6 – when he oversaw the certification of the 2020 election results – and others encouraged him to run for president in 2024, according to attendees.\n\n“I’m a fan of (Pence’s). I’m not here to push him one way or the other way,” said Rep. Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican. “But I like his character.”\n\nGOP Rep. Greg Pence of Indiana said he hopes his brother decides to mount a bid for president and would support him “100%” if he did.\n\nWhen asked whether Pence sounded like someone with their eyes on the Oval Office, Johnson responded: “Anytime anybody who is not a sitting member of the House or Senate comes to DC and gives a speech, I think it’s a pretty fair assumption that they have at least some interest.”\n\nBanks has previously identified himself as an early supporter of a potential Pence 2024 campaign if Trump were to sit on the sidelines in the next election cycle. But Banks, who has emerged as one of Trump’s staunchest supporters on Capitol Hill and may be wary of seeming too supportive of one of Trump’s potential 2024 rivals, predicted on Wednesday Trump would clear the field and go on to win the White House if he decides to run.\n\n“If Donald Trump doesn’t run for president in ’24, then we have the best field we’ve ever had,” Banks said. “If Donald Trump does run, I think he clears the field, he’s the nominee and I think he wins in a landslide in November 2024.”\n\nOthers, however, may have a more difficult time choosing sides in a packed primary. Rep. Brian Mast, a Florida Republican, told CNN he would support Trump if he announced a presidential run right now. But he also said the same of DeSantis.\n\n“It’s hard to play it out, because neither of them are stepping out” at the moment, Mast told CNN. “But in a hypothetical of things, both of them have my support.”\n\nSome Republicans dodged questions about 2024, saying they were focused on the upcoming midterms.\n\n“I’m not going to get involved in the presidential primary,” said Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, a member of GOP leadership.\n\n“I’m not going to worry about the presidential election until we get well into the Iowa caucus,” added Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican. “But anybody that wants to run for president is going to have to compete for it.”", "authors": ["Melanie Zanona Manu Raju", "Melanie Zanona", "Manu Raju"], "publish_date": "2022/07/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/14/politics/takeaways-midterm-election-analysis/index.html", "title": "Takeaways from a grim weekend for Republicans in the election that ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIt was a disappointing weekend for Republicans and ex-President Donald Trump as Democrats kept the Senate for two more years after holding off a red wave in the House, which remains uncalled six days after the election.\n\nThe weekend marked a moment of vindication for President Joe Biden, whose party defied history by staving off a midterm election drubbing, and a moment of truth for some Republicans who had tethered themselves to Trump’s election fraud lies.\n\nAnd even with the GOP appearing to slowly march toward House control – promising to make Biden’s life deeply uncomfortable for the rest of his term with investigations into his administration and even his son, Hunter – the probable Republican majority will be smaller, and therefore more fractious, with the most radical lawmakers having more leverage.\n\nAs Trump presses on with a campaign launch set for Tuesday, the GOP’s loss of the Senate and competitive races nationwide raised new questions about his chances of winning back the White House. Meanwhile, the defeat of several high-profile election deniers boosted Biden’s global campaign for democracy – a central part of his 2022 campaign message – as he heads into talks with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Cambodia and prepares for a possible rematch with his predecessor.\n\nDemocrats hold onto the Senate\n\nPolitical parties are pointless unless they win power. So it’s obvious why Democrats are celebrating the come-from-behind victory of Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto in Nevada Saturday night that handed them their 50th seat and control of the Senate.\n\nThey wouldn’t have held on at this point, though, without John Fetterman’s win last week in Pennsylvania, where Democrats picked up a GOP-held seat. Had Republicans held that seat, Senate control would have come down to the Georgia runoff in December, which, while still massively important for shaping the balance of power, will matter less than the 2021 runoffs that handed Democrats the Senate in the last election.\n\nSenate control is huge for multiple reasons, not least because by pulling it off in deeply unpromising political conditions, Democrats cemented the most stunning showing for an incumbent president’s party in a first-term midterm election since George W. Bush in 2002.\n\n“I think one thing that pundits and prognosticators missed was that in all the incendiary ads that blanketed the airwaves for weeks, people knew the Democrats were getting things done for them,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters on Saturday night after CNN and other media outlets projected the Nevada race.\n\nThe failure to pick up Nevada and Senate control is already having reverberations inside the Senate GOP, with calls from Florida Sen. Rick Scott, the chair of Senate Republicans campaign arm, and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham to delay Wednesday’s leadership elections until after the Georgia runoff. Scott said he’d been approached by “a lot of people” about standing against Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, with whom he’d had significant messaging disagreements during the midterms. Still, it likely won’t be lost on many lawmakers that the party fell short on Scott’s watch.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'Very good news' for Biden: CNN projects Democrats will keep control of Senate 03:05 - Source: CNN\n\nMore importantly, the Democrats’ continued hold on power gives Biden two more years to remake the judiciary and to counter the influx of conservative judges confirmed during Trump’s presidency. In the event that a vacancy arose on the Supreme Court, a Democratic-led Senate would have a good chance of installing a new justice to start to weaken the current conservative majority.\n\nThe failure of Republicans to capture control means that the White House will be spared a relentless onslaught of Senate investigations and subpoenas to match those likely to be pouring out of the House if, as expected, the GOP finally clinches a majority in that chamber. This represents a significant personal and political benefit for Biden.\n\nAnd while a Republican House would mean few legislative wins for the president, Schumer will be able to protect his senators from tough votes that could hurt them in reelection campaigns in 2024, when they’ll be defending seats in tough states like Montana, Ohio, Nevada and Arizona.\n\nThe unexpectedly strong Democratic performance, which will leave both chambers essentially split down the middle, means that the 2024 presidential election is even more critical. A popular candidate on either side could have strong coattails and sweep their party into a monopoly in power in Washington.\n\nWhy Georgia still matters for Democrats\n\nThe final numbers in the Senate will not be known until the runoff in Georgia on December 6 between Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican nominee Herschel Walker. If Warnock, who’s running for a full six-year term, hangs on, Democrats will have a 51-49 majority.\n\nA two-seat margin is clearly better for Democrats than having to rely on the tie-breaking vote wielded by Vice President Kamala Harris. It also gives them a small cushion if one of their members becomes sick or incapacitated and lessens the chance they will lose their majority at some point in the new Congress.\n\nA 51-49 margin would also be a Joe Manchin-proof majority, meaning that the West Virginia moderate Democratic senator might not enjoy the veto he has held the past two years over Schumer’s intentions. If Manchin decides to run for reelection in 2024 in a state where Trump won big twice, he’s likely to become an even tougher vote for Democratic leadership. Earlier this month, for instance, the coal state senator lashed out at the president over his climate change policies.\n\nAnd a clear majority for Democrats means that Schumer would not need a deal with McConnell on parceling out committee assignments and would have far more control over the process – a fact former veteran senator Biden noted in reacting to the Senate win in Phnom Penh over the weekend.\n\nThe Republicans still haven’t taken the House\n\nIn a moment of bravado late on Election Night, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy assured activists who put a victory party on hold, “When you wake up, we’ll be in the majority.” Six embarrassing days later, he’s still waiting. Final results now hinge on races in California, Arizona and Oregon that may not be finalized for days, underscoring the disappointing GOP performance. Republicans currently have 212 House seats and Democrats have 204. A total of 218 is needed for a majority.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'More shocking things I've seen': Enten on House race 02:44 - Source: CNN\n\nIt’s still most likely that the Republicans will control the House with a narrow majority. Democrats need an improbable near-perfect run through remaining seats to stay in power. But McCarthy’s predictions of a huge win backfired and are making his expected smooth path to the speakership rather rocky.\n\nHard-liners in the House Freedom Caucus are demanding large concessions – which could render his leadership toothless – in return for supporting him for the top job. Those more extreme lawmakers would also be able to leverage the thin majority in the GOP to weaponize the House in the service of Trump’s 2024 campaign. CNN reported Sunday that Arizona Rep. Andy Biggs is considering a challenge to McCarthy in the House leadership elections on Tuesday – a move that could ultimately weaken the current minority leader and expose anger over the GOP’s performance, even if his team insists he will have the votes to be speaker.\n\nWhile the pro-Trump radical right will seek to dominate the House GOP if the party does get a majority, Republicans did pick up some key Democratic-held House seats, with some of those incoming Republicans likely to be among the party’s most vulnerable members in 2024. How McCarthy will reconcile their needs with the Trump caucus, which is itching to impeach Biden, is unclear.\n\nWhile a battle is emerging over the Republican House leadership, the current limbo means an expected Democratic tussle to succeed Nancy Pelosi is frozen. The speaker said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday that she was making no decisions while the destiny of the House was undecided. After the brutal attack on her husband, the 82-year-old speaker said family and political considerations could weigh on her future. But she’s not tipping her hand.\n\n“I’m not asking anybody for everything. People are campaigning. And that’s a beautiful thing,” the California Democrat quixotically told CNN’s Dana Bash when asked whether she might feel motivated to stay on as leader. “I’m not asking anyone for anything. My members are asking me to consider doing that. But, again, let’s just get through the election.”\n\n‘Three strikes and you are out’\n\nTrump is being blamed by a broad group of Republican leaders and political analysts for saddling his party’s extreme, untested candidates with a failed message – an obsession with his 2020 election fraud falsehoods.\n\n“I think it’s basically the third election in a row that Donald Trump has cost us the race. And it’s like, three strikes, you’re out,” Maryland GOP Gov. Larry Hogan said on “State of the Union” on Sunday.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback GOP governor: 'Trump cost us the race' 02:05 - Source: CNN\n\nThe problem with Hogan’s analogy is that even when Trump has been down politically – after the 2018 blue wave in the House, his 2020 election loss and the 2021 Capitol insurrection – he’s never struck out with the fervent grassroots Republican base that set him on the way to the White House in 2016 and still adores him.\n\nTrump had expected to ride out of this weekend on a wave of Republican euphoria after a bumper election he’d hoped to claim as his doing and enlist it to power his campaign for the 2024 Republican presidential nod.\n\nYet some of Trump’s favored candidates, including Pennsylvania’s Mehmet Oz in the Senate race and Doug Mastriano in the gubernatorial race, lost. One of the most high-profile election deniers, Kari Lake, is still locked in a close contest with Democrat Katie Hobbs in Arizona’s governor’s race, which CNN has not yet projected.\n\nVoters might have been unhappy with the Democrats and Biden’s record on inflation. But they balked at handing power to Republican radicals in Trump’s election-denying and chaos-causing image.\n\nYet Trump, true to form, is powering ahead. His adviser Jason Miller confirmed on Steve Bannon’s podcast that the ex-president’s planned big announcement on Tuesday at Mar-a-Lago will be the launch of a new presidential campaign – even before the 2022 midterm election will be finalized. Trump’s recent rallies suggest he’s only doubling down on his election fraud lies, even though they were rebuffed by midterm voters.\n\nOne new wrinkle now is that there may be alternatives to Trump in the GOP. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, for instance, showed he knows how to build a strong majority with his thumping reelection victory. In 2021, Virginia’s Glenn Youngkin won the governorship in a state that Biden took by 10 points the year before.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, hasn’t won an election since 2016. Logically, and as Republicans try to woo a national electorate in 2024, there are better choices than Trump. But the former president retains an emotional hold over the party grassroots that will decide the nominee. And Tuesday’s launch, and the immediate aftermath, will offer early clues over whether the staggering resilience to scandals that would have doomed ordinary political careers is beginning to fade.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/11/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/18/us/five-things-november-18-trnd/index.html", "title": "5 things to know for Nov. 18: Snowstorm, Twitter, Student loans ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nGet '5 Things' in your inbox If your day doesn’t start until you’re up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix.

Snowstorm\n\nA potentially historic storm is bearing down on western New York state, bringing treacherous snowfall and temperatures 20 degrees below normal. “The snowfall will produce near zero visibility, difficult to impossible travel, damage to infrastructure, and paralyze the hardest-hit communities,” the National Weather Service said Thursday. A state of emergency has been declared in 11 counties and commercial traffic has been banned since Thursday afternoon on about 130 miles of New York’s I-90 freeway. The storm’s most intense snow is expected to lash the Buffalo, New York, area, where more than 4 feet could pile up, making for an accumulation not seen in more than 20 years.\n\n2. Twitter\n\nAnother employee exodus appears to be underway at Twitter after many workers rejected Elon Musk’s terms for staying with the company, according to current and former employees. This comes after Musk gave employees until Thursday at 5 p.m. ET to commit to “extremely hardcore” work or else leave the company. After the deadline, Twitter staffers began posting the salute emoji on an internal Slack channel, which has become a signal that someone is leaving, employees told CNN. Following Thursday’s exits, remaining employees received an email alerting them that Twitter’s offices will be temporarily closed and badge access will be restricted through Monday, according to a copy of the email obtained by CNN.\n\n3. Student loans\n\nThe Justice Department indicated in a court filing Thursday that it plans to ask the Supreme Court to reinstate President Joe Biden’s student debt relief program. “We are confident in our legal authority to carry out this program, and will be taking this fight to the Supreme Court so that borrowers can get the clarity and relief they deserve quickly,” White House spokesman Abdullah Hasan said in a statement. The loan forgiveness program remains on hold as the Biden administration continues to fight several legal challenges. Under the rules of the program, eligible borrowers can receive up to $20,000 under certain terms. But it may take several more months for court action to play out before any federal student loan debt can be canceled.\n\n4. House\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday she will relinquish her leadership post, a move that marks the end of an era and sets up a major shakeup for House Democrats. Pelosi’s announcement came one day after CNN projected Republicans will win control of the House of Representatives as Democrats maintain a narrow Senate majority. House Democrats appear likely to choose New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries to succeed Pelosi as leader, although they won’t vote until November 30. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn also announced they would step down from their leadership posts, and endorsed Jeffries to succeed Pelosi. It is likely that Pelosi, the only woman to serve as speaker, will continue in the House as a California lawmaker.\n\n5. North Korea\n\nNorth Korea launched an intercontinental ballistic missile today, a test condemned as a “brazen violation” of UN resolutions by the US and its allies. The missile reached an altitude of about 3,790 miles at Mach 22 – or 22 times the speed of sound – then likely fell in the waters of Japan’s exclusive economic zone, officials said. The Kim Jong Un regime has carried out missile tests on 34 days this year, sometimes firing multiple missiles in a single day, according to a CNN count. North Korea’s acceleration in weapons testing has sparked frequent alarm in the region, with the US, South Korea and Japan responding with their own missile launches and joint military exercises.\n\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\n\nWebb telescope finds two of the most distant galaxies ever observed\n\nPrepare to be amazed.

(Fact check: he won the 2016 election and lost the 2020 election.) “And now I feel obligated that we have to really look strongly at doing it again. We are looking at it very, very strongly. We have to do it. We have to do it.”\n\nGiven that Trump could be an announced 2024 candidate by the end of the summer, I thought it made sense to offer up my inaugural ranking of the 2024 Republican presidential field now. In addition to Trump’s public statements, a wide variety of other aspiring national candidates have been making the obligatory trips to places like Iowa and New Hampshire as a way to signal their own interest.\n\nBelow, I’ve ranked the 10 people most likely to win the Republican nomination as of today. You’ll notice that you don’t see the likes of Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan or former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie – both of whom would, presumably, run as anti-Trumpers – in the rankings. That’s because I am very skeptical that there is anything close to majority support for a candidate running expressly against Trump/Trumpism.\n\nDon’t see your favorite on the list? Never fear! We are still 884 days away from the 2024 general election! There’s still (plenty of) time! And stay tuned for my rankings of the 2024 Democratic field!\n\n10. Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas: I wrestled with who should get the final spot on the list – considering Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson and Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley among others. I eventually settled on Cotton because a) I think he is the smartest politician of that group b) he represents the sort of muscular conservatism that I think very much would appeal to Trump voters if the former President isn’t in the race and c) he will outwork almost any one else in the race. Cotton’s challenges are clear: He would have to prove he could raise money to be competitive and he would have lots of work to do to raise his name identification among GOP base voters.\n\n9. Sen. Rick Scott of Florida: Scott has been perennially underestimated in his political career. First, people said that he couldn’t win the governorship. He served two terms in the job. Then they said he couldn’t get elected to the Senate; he knocked off longtime Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson to do just that in 2018. Scott’s ambitions are clearly national in scope; his decision to release a policy agenda that he wants to implement if Republicans retake control of the Senate in 2023 is proof of that.\n\n8. Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin: Two things are true about the Virginia governor: 1) He was just elected to his first public office in 2021 and 2) He is term limited out of that job in 2025. That second point means that Youngkin, necessarily, is already keeping one eye on his future. His successful win in Virginia in 2021 was widely touted as evidence that the GOP can keep the Trump base of the party happy while also appealing to critical swing, suburban voters. I tend to think Youngkin is more VP material in the end but the success and notoriety derived from his 2021 campaign means he can’t be ignored if he goes for the top job.\n\n7. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott: While Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis gets the most 2024 buzz among the Republican state executives – more on that below – Abbott has effectively used his perch as the top elected official in Texas to position himself for a presidential race as well. Abbott has been open about his interest in the race – “We’ll see what happens,” he said in the wake of the 2020 election – but has to win his reelection bid against former Rep. Beto O’Rourke first.\n\n6. Former Ambassador Nikki Haley: You can count on one hand the number of high-profile Trump appointees who left the administration on good terms with the former president. Haley, the former US Ambassador to the United Nations, is one of them. “She’s done a fantastic job and we’ve done a fantastic job together,” Trump said when Haley left in 2018. “We’ve solved a lot of problems and we’re in the process of solving a lot of problems.” But, Haley has also publicly flip-flopped on Trump; she was openly critical of him in the aftermath of the January 6 riot at the US Capitol before falling in line behind him once it became clear that the party’s base didn’t view January 6 as disqualifying for the former president.\n\n5. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas: Don’t forget that the Texas senator was the runner-up to Trump in the 2016 presidential race. And that, after a rocky relationship with Trump during the fall of 2016, Cruz has gone out of his way to make nice with the man who suggested his father might have been involved in the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Cruz’s stronger-than-expected 2016 run should not be discounted – he has organizations in early states and a national fundraising base that is unmatched by those below him on this list.\n\n4. Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina: Like a number of people on this list, it’s hard to imagine the South Carolina Senator running for president if Trump is in the field. (Scott is on record as saying he would back a Trump 2024 campaign.) But, in a Trump-less field, Scott is deeply intriguing: He is the first Black senator elected from the Deep South since Reconstruction and the first Black Republican to serve in the Senate since 1979. He’s built a reliably conservative (and pro Trump) record during his nine years in the Senate while showing a willingness to work across the aisle when possible. If Republicans decide they need a new face to lead their party, Scott is at the front of that line.\n\n3. Former Vice President Mike Pence: I really struggled on where the former vice president belonged on this list. On the one hand, he has been disowned by Trump (and the former president’s loyalists) for refusing to overturn the 2020 electoral college results. On the other, Pence has tons of residual name identification from his four years as vice president and retains a solid base of support among religious conservatives. The New York Times reported last month that Pence is trying to edge away from Trump as he considers running in 2024. That’s going to be a very delicate dance.\n\n2. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis: There’s a clear gap between the Florida governor and the rest of the Republican field not named “Donald Trump.” DeSantis even managed to beat out the former President in a straw poll conducted at a Colorado conservative political conference over the weekend. DeSantis can’t take his eye off the ball – he is running for a second term this fall – but he has, to date, very effectively used his day job as a way to boost his national profile.\n\n1. Former President Donald Trump: If you want to find cracks in the Trump foundation, you can do it; his endorsed candidates in governor’s races in places like Georgia, Nebraska and Idaho lost primaries earlier this year. But, that would miss the forest for the trees. The simple fact is that Trump remains the prime mover in Republican Party politics. If he runs – and I absolutely believe he will – he starts in a top tier all his own. The nomination is quite clearly his to lose – which doesn’t mean he can’t lose it.", "authors": ["Chris Cillizza"], "publish_date": "2022/06/06"}]}

The ship sailed with 95% of the onboard community fully vaccinated on the Dec. 11 to Dec. 18 cruise, with 98% of those people who tested positive being fully vaccinated, Royal Caribbean said.\n\nOn Saturday, the cruise line also notified passengers from that trip and from two others (a sailing that departed Dec. 4 and one that departed Dec. 18) that a passenger who sailed on that same ship earlier this month tested positive for the omicron variant of the coronavirus.\n\n\"We were notified by the (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) that a guest on board our (December) 4th cruise tested positive and it was identified as omicron,\" Sierra-Caro said Saturday. \"They asked us to notify guests on the sailing – the one that ended today – and the current one.\"\n\n►Odyssey of the Seas:Newest Royal Caribbean ship makes brief return to port due to COVID\n\n►COVID on a cruise:How a breakthrough case sent one couple from an ocean view balcony to the 'dungeon'\n\nIn the email to the passengers who sailed on the three cruises on Symphony of the Seas, Royal Caribbean outlined what happened.\n\n\"This guest did not report symptoms to our onboard medical teams as outlined in our health protocols,\" the cruise line said in a copy of the email obtained by USA TODAY. \"Their post cruise test results were subsequently confirmed as the omicron variant.\"\n\nThe 48 cases on the recently disembarked cruise \"were found as a result of immediately identifying close contacts after a guest tested positive,\" Sierra-Caro said, noting each person was quarantined quickly.\n\nInitially, Royal Caribbean said that everyone who tested positive was asymptomatic. In the statement Monday morning, it said that \"everyone who tested positive were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms, and we continuously monitored their health.\"\n\nSix passengers disembarked earlier in the cruise and were transported home. The rest of the passengers were assisted Saturday at disembarkation in Miami, Sierra-Caro said.\n\nIn the email to passengers, Royal Caribbean said that the cases on the Dec. 11th sailing were \"unrelated to the omicron case from the guest who sailed on Dec. 4th.\"\n\nIt is not immediately clear why the cases were unrelated.\n\nThe cruise line advised that passengers visit a certified testing center three to five days after disembarkation, per CDC guidance.\n\nOn Saturday, the CDC said in a statement that the agency was aware of the situation on Symphony of the Seas and that it was working with the cruise line to gather more information.\n\nOn Monday, the CDC told USA TODAY in a statement provided by spokesperson David Daigle that the health agency continues to work with Royal Caribbean to gather information about the cases and potential exposures. The CDC added that \"RCI collected specimens from the voyage that sailed from 12/11-12/18 for genetic sequencing.\"\n\nOn the CDC’s cruise ship color status list, Symphony of the Seas is “Yellow,” indicating that the “CDC has investigated and the ship remains under observation,” according to the agency.\n\n►Norwegian Cruise Line, Royal Caribbean:Update onboard mask requirement as omicron spreads\n\n►'What a mess':Travelers scrap plans to visit New York City as omicron shutters performances\n\nPassengers say Royal Caribbean was overwhelmed\n\nConnor O'Dell, 29, from Orlando, Florida, was traveling with a party of 12 on the Symphony of the Seas sailing that wrapped up Saturday. Six of his traveling companions tested positive for COVID-19. Everyone in their group was fully vaccinated and most had had a booster shot, O'Dell said.\n\nO'Dell and his fiance, James Johnson, 36, tested negative, he said.\n\nThe first person who tested positive in their group was Johnson's aunt, who is 66 and at high risk for COVID-19, O'Dell said. She was symptomatic and reported her symptoms to Royal Caribbean Thursday during the cruise.\n\n\"She was very symptomatic,\" O'Dell said, noting she had a bad cough and sore throat, and that neither a doctor nor nurse gave her an in-depth physical exam or asked her about preexisting conditions. \"We all knew the risks of going on the ship – the problem is that we were promised a set of protocols (or) adequate medical staffing and they were never adhered to.\"\n\nIt took around four hours for a nurse to come to administer a coronavirus test and get a result. Johnson's aunt was then quarantined for the rest of the trip.\n\nJohnson said he contacted medical staff and, after several attempts, he reached a nurse who told him that they were understaffed. He asked if the ship's medical team could check on his aunt. His aunt received a call the next day.\n\nOut of their party, she was the only one who was checked in on by the cruise line at all, even after five others tested positive, Johnson said.\n\nJohnson and O'Dell self-quarantined but later were told that they could leave their stateroom after the positive test came back on Johnson's aunt, even though they had been spending time together as a group.\n\n\"We kept asking 'are you sure we can leave?'\" Johnson said. After half an hour, O'Dell said that they were asked by crew members to isolate again.\n\nJohnson said that they received conflicting results, with his cousin being told she tested positive, then later told that it was actually her boyfriend who was positive.\n\n\"They were so overwhelmed,\" Johnson said. \"They just kept saying something (and then) changing what they were saying. Everything was so confusing,\" he said.\n\nWhen asked to comment on whether staff was overwhelmed and if the protocol wasn't followed properly, Sierra-Caro said that wasn't the case.\n\n\"Our staff was able to handle all the cases on board and we followed all of our protocols for testing and quarantine,\" Sierra-Caro said.\n\nAs omicron spreads, cruise industry says it's focused on health and safety\n\nCruise Lines International Association, the leading trade organization for the cruise industry, told USA TODAY Monday in a statement that health and safety are the cruise industry's \"highest priority.\"\n\n\"Together with our members, we are monitoring developments related to the Omicron variant and remain closely engaged with local and national authorities in the places where cruises sail,\" the association said in a statement provided by Bari Golin-Blaugrund, vice president of strategic communications.\n\nThe cruise lines association continued that the protocols which include testing, masking, vaccination and other measures were \"designed with variants in mind.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/12/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/cruises/2021/12/22/covid-royal-caribbean-odyssey-seas/8990149002/", "title": "CDC investigating Odyssey of the Seas, cruise ship with 55 COVID ...", "text": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is investigating Royal Caribbean's Odyssey of the Seas ship as it continues to sail with more than 50 cases of COVID onboard.\n\n\"CDC is investigating the recent increase in COVID-19 cases identified on Royal Caribbean International’s (RCI) Odyssey of the Seas,\" CDC spokesperson David Daigle told USA TODAY Thursday. \"All cases appear to be mild or asymptomatic.

Those who tested positive are either mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic and being monitored by an on-board medical team.\n\nRoyal Caribbean announced Wednesday that the cruise will not stop in Curacao or Aruba as planned.\n\n\"The decision was made together with the islands and out of an abundance of caution due to the current trend of cases in the destination communities and having COVID-19 positive cases on board ... representing 1.1% of the onboard community,\" according to a statement shared by Sierra-Caro.\n\n►After disembarking, she tested positive:A cruise line didn't provide a COVID test to a symptomatic passenger\n\n►Royal Caribbean's newest ship:Odyssey of the Seas, makes brief return to port due to COVID\n\nWeekly testing of crew members is one of the protocols on Royal Caribbean's ships, part of a \"multilayered set of comprehensive health and safety measures,\" the company said.

Between Dec. 15 and Dec. 29, cruise ships sailing in U.S. waters reported 5,013 COVID-19 cases to the CDC.\n\nThat's nearly 31 times the number of cases reported in the first two weeks of December, the CDC said.\n\nIn the U.S., the seven-day daily average of COVID-19 cases has been 240,000 per day. That's an increase of about 60% over the previous week, according to the CDC.\n\nAs of Wednesday, the CDC was investigating or monitoring more than 90 ships for COVID-19 on board. The CDC said on its website Thursday that the decision to raise the warning level against cruising reflects the rise in cases since the identification of the omicron variant of COVID.\n\nDaigle told USA TODAY Tuesday that the health agency acknowledges it is \"not possible\" for cruising to be a zero-risk activity amid the pandemic. A person's chance at contracting coronavirus is higher on cruise ships because the virus spreads more easily between people spending time in close quarters on the vessels.\n\nPreviously, the CDC had in place a \"level 3: High Level of COVID-19\" warning, that was put into place in August.\n\n►Should you cancel your cruise? It comes down to personal choice\n\n►After disembarking, she tested positive:A cruise line didn't provide a COVID test to a symptomatic passenger\n\nCruise Lines International Association, the leading industry organization said it was \"disappointed\" with the CDC's decision to warn against the form of travel.\n\n\"The decision by the CDC to raise the travel level for cruise is particularly perplexing considering that cases identified on cruise ships consistently make up a very slim minority of the total population onboard – far fewer than on land – and the majority of those cases are asymptomatic or mild in nature, posing little to no burden on medical resources onboard or onshore,\" CLIA said in a statement shared by Bari Golin-Blaugrund, vice president of strategic communications and public affairs for CLIA.\n\nThe organization continued that \"no setting can be immune from this virus\" and added that cruise lines are providing highly controlled environments with protocol in place to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus including testing and vaccination levels.\n\n\"While we are disappointed and disagree with the decision to single out the cruise industry – an industry that continues to go above and beyond compared to other sectors – CLIA and our ocean-going cruise line members remain committed to working collaboratively with the CDC in the interest of public health and safety,\" CLIA said.\n\nIf travelers choose to embark on a cruise, the CDC said to make sure to be fully vaccinated and to get a COVID-19 booster shot if eligible before boarding.\n\nWill the cruise industry shut down again?\n\nCOVID-19 cases reported on cruise ships have been stacking up. As the numbers climb, will cruise lines halt operations as they did in March 2020, leaving the industry shuttered for more than a year?\n\nThough the answer remains unclear, it doesn't seem likely.\n\nLines have yet to cancel any sailings, though some companies adjusted protocols onboard ships. The world is not in the same place with COVID-19 as in 2020. Vaccines are widely available, and enhanced protocols on ships mitigate the spread of communicable diseases.\n\nWhile it has raised its warning level, the CDC has not moved to shut down the cruise industry. The agency's Conditional Sailing Order remains in place until mid-January before it becomes voluntary for cruise lines.\n\n\"CDC is working with cruise ships to keep passengers and crew safe through COVID-19 mitigation measures,\" Daigle said Thursday. \"The best way to protect yourself from COVID-19 is to get vaccinated, get boosted, wear a mask in public indoor settings in areas of substantial and high community transmission, and take a test before you gather.\"\n\n►Cruising during COVID-19:Cancellation, refund policies vary by cruise line\n\n►Royal Caribbean halts new bookings:For cruises departing through early January", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/12/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/12/19/omicron-variant-doubling-covid-updates/8952895002/", "title": "Sens.

But omicron is quickly gaining ground, making up nearly 3% of total U.S. cases. Fauci said in certain parts of the country the omicron variant is found in about 50% of sequenced cases.\n\n“When you have a doubling time that’s that short a period, pretty soon that isolate is going to take over,\" he said. “I would not be surprised if omicron bumped delta off the table.”\n\nLeading COVID drugs may not work as well against omicron, doctors warn\n\nDoctors are warning two standard drugs they’ve used to fight infections are unlikely to work against the omicron variant.\n\nFor more than a year antibody drugs from Regeneron and Eli Lilly have been the go-to treatments for early COVID-19, thanks to their ability to head off severe disease and keep patients out of the hospital.\n\nBut both drugmakers recently warned that laboratory testing suggests their therapies will be much less potent against omicron, which contains dozens of mutations that make it harder for antibodies to attack the virus. And while the companies say they can quickly develop new omicron-targeting antibodies, those aren’t expected to launch for at least several months.\n\n“We’re certainly going to see hospitalizations rise,” said Dr. James Cutrell of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. “If we have a lack of antibodies that’s certainly going to contribute to that many more patients needing to be in the hospital.”\n\nA third antibody from British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline appears to be the best positioned to fight omicron. But Glaxo’s drug is not widely available in the U.S., accounting for a small portion of the millions of doses purchased and distributed by the federal government. U.S. health officials are now rationing scarce drug supplies to states.\n\nBiden to announce new steps in addressing COVID, omicron this winter\n\nAs Americans prepare for the upcoming holiday festivities, the White House braces for another possible winter surge in COVID-19 cases brought on by family gatherings, travel and the highly transmissible delta and omicron variants.\n\nPresident Joe Biden plans to speak Tuesday on the status of the fight against COVID-19 and discuss government help for communities in need of assistance, White House press secretary Jen Psaki tweeted. The president will also warn about the risks for unvaccinated Americans.\n\nFauci told NBC the president would again urge people to get the booster shot, highlight increased availability of testing, discuss “surge teams” for besieged hospitals and explain how important it is to provide vaccines for the rest of the world.\n\n\"If we're going to deal with omicron successfully, vaccinated people need to get boosted,\" he said. \"And obviously, people who are not vaccinated clearly need to get vaccinated now more than ever.\"\n\n44 people test positive for COVID on Royal Caribbean cruise\n\nForty-four people on board Royal Caribbean's Symphony of the Seas cruise that ended Saturday tested positive for COVID-19, the cruise line said.\n\nThe cruise line also notified passengers on that sailing and on two others that a passenger who sailed on that ship during an earlier itinerary tested positive for the omicron variant.\n\nLyan Sierra-Caro, spokesperson for Royal Caribbean, told USA TODAY late Saturday each person was quarantined quickly.\n\n\"They were found as a result of immediately identifying close contacts after a guest tested positive,\" she said. \"Everyone who tested positive is asymptomatic, and we continually monitored their health. Six guests were disembarked earlier in the cruise and transported home. The remaining guests received assistance today upon our arrival.\"\n\nAll passengers age 12 and older were required to be fully vaccinated and to test negative to board the cruise which departed from Miami on Dec. 11. Children ineligible for the vaccine were required to test negative, too.\n\n– Morgan Hines, USA TODAY\n\nLatest surge in New York City cases isn't swamping hospitals, so far\n\nSoaring COVID-19 case numbers, long testing lines and event cancellations might feel a bit like déjà vu, but so far New York City hospitals aren’t seeing a repeat of the surges that swamped emergency rooms early in the pandemic.\n\nThe state reported Saturday that nearly 22,000 people had tested positive for COVID-19 on Friday – eclipsing the previous day’s mark for the highest single-day total for new cases since testing became widely available. More than half of the positive results were in the city.\n\nBut new hospitalizations and deaths – so far – are averaging well below their spring 2020 peak and even where they were this time last year, during a winter wave that came as vaccinations were just beginning, city data shows.\n\nAt least so far, “we’re seeing a lot more treat-and-release” coronavirus patients than in earlier waves, Dr. Eric Legome, who oversees two of Mount Sinai Health System’s emergency rooms, said.\n\nFlorida is now a 'high transmission' state as cases double over a week\n\nCOVID-19 cases across Florida more than doubled over the course of a week, according to data released by the Florida Department of Health on Friday.\n\nFrom Dec. 10 to Dec. 16, Florida had 29,568 COVID-19 cases and 134.6 cases per 100,000; the week prior, Florida had 13,530 COVID-19 cases and 61.6 cases per 100,000. This makes for an increase of 16,038 COVID-19 cases and 73 cases per 100,000 in the span of one week.\n\nThe increase in the new case positivity rate saw parallel increases: From Dec. 10 to Dec. 16, Florida had a case positivity rate of 5.4%, up 2.8% from the previous week.\n\nThe increase in cases coincides with the highly-contagious omicron’s arrival in the Sunshine State. Wastewater sampling in Orange County found the omicron variant that has swept other parts of the globe to be the main strain of COVID-19 found in the county’s sewage samples.\n\n– Amira Sweilem, Florida Today\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/12/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/cruises/2020/03/06/coronavirus-grand-princess-cruise-passengers-what-we-know/4972973002/", "title": "21 test positive for coronavirus on cruise ship off California coast ...", "text": "Vice President Mike Pence said Friday that the Princess Cruises' Grand Princess cruise ship off the coast of California will dock this weekend in a “non-commercial port,” and that all passengers and crew will be tested for the coronavirus.\n\nSpeaking at the White House on Friday evening, Pence said that 46 people aboard the ship had been swabbed.

And some passengers from that trip stayed aboard for the current voyage.\n\nCarson City Health and Human Services in Nevada confirmed on Friday that it is also monitoring \"a few\" individuals in its jurisdiction who have ties to the Grand Princess cruise ship.\n\nOfficials ordered the ship to stay at bay until testing is concluded of those on board who were on the previous voyage and those on board who are displaying coronavirus symptoms.\n\n“The ship will not come on shore until we appropriately assess the passengers,” California Gov. Gavin Newsom had said Thursday.\n\nThe Sunnyvale Department of Public Safety in California confirmed on Twitter that another cruiser who may have been on the ship has died, though it's unclear if he had coronavirus.\n\n\"While obtaining the patient’s medical history, a family member advised us that the patient had recently been on a cruise where two other passengers were suspected of having COVID-19,\" Phan Ngo, chief of the Sunnyvale Department of Public Safety said. \"At this time we don’t yet know if the patient had COVID-19.\"\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to the city of Sunnyvale and Princess Cruises for further information.\n\nShortly after 1 p.m. local time Friday, the Grand Princess captain made an announcement to passengers, who had all been confined to their rooms while they awaited testing results.\n\n\"Allowing everyone the opportunity to enjoy fresh air and time outdoors remains a top priority,” he can be heard saying in a video obtained by USA TODAY. \"Unfortunately, at this time we have not received approval for this from local authorities.\"\n\nThe captain also said that out of an \"abundance of caution,\" prescription information would be gathered from passengers in case they would remain on board past Saturday.\n\nThose on board the Grand Princess may have been exposed to coronavirus after sailing with 62 passengers who company officials say had previously been on the ship's Mexico voyage with a man who eventually died from the virus.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised guests stay in their rooms for the remainder of a cruise but had not declared a quarantine, according to a Thursday statement from Princess Cruises provided by spokesperson Alivia Owyoung Ender.\n\n“In many respects, our ships are small floating cities. Just as life happens in cities for good and for bad, life also happens onboard our ships,\" Princess Cruises' president Jan Swartz said in a video posted to Twitter Friday morning.\n\nAs of Friday afternoon, coronavirus had infected more than 101,000 people globally and killed 3,460 according to Johns Hopkins data.\n\nPresident Trump says White House is involved\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump told reporters Friday in the White House's Diplomatic Room that he spoke to Newsom about the Grand Princess being held off the coast of California.\n\n“We had a good conversation; we’re both working on the ship together,” he said of his conversation with Newsom. “It’s close to 5,000 people, so big ship. We’re doing testing on those people.”\n\nThere are 2,422 passengers and 1,111 crew representing 54 nationalities currently sailing on the Grand Princess for its Hawaii voyage, according to the cruise line.\n\n“We have big news on the ship. A lot of things are happening on the ship,” Trump said during a signing ceremony for the $8.3-billion spending package to combat the spread of coronavirus.\n\n\"It's a big decision because we have very low numbers compared to major countries throughout the world,\" he said of how to deal with the cruise ship. \"Our numbers are lower than just about anybody.\"\n\nWhen will people on the cruise ship disembark and where?\n\nWhile the ship was meant to arrive to port in San Francisco, it is is unclear which “non-commercial port” Pence was referring to when he said the ship would dock this weekend.\n\nThe office of the Mayor of San Francisco said in a statement Thursday that the state and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are determining a location that \"can most appropriately address the health of those passengers that may have COVID-19 and the safety of those passengers not impacted, as well as the surrounding community.\"\n\nHow were the coronavirus tests administered?\n\nA military helicopter lowered test kits onto the 951-foot (290-meter) Grand Princess by rope Thursday as the vessel lay at anchor off the coast of San Francisco.\n\nKailee Higgins Ott, a passenger on Grand Princess from California, who is 17, told USA TODAY that she's not worried about herself. \"But I’m worried because we made friends with some older folks on the cruise,\" she said. \"I’m worried about them and the crew members.\"\n\nUpon hearing the news that 21 people had tested positive on board for coronavirus, she said she was \"kind of annoyed with the cruise line that they didn’t announce anything and we had to hear it from the news. I’m scared about missing school and all the uncertainties. We don’t know anything that’s happening with us yet.\"\n\nAcross the hall from Higgins Ott's state room, some guests were being tested. The medical team was wearing white masks over their mouths with a clear face mask cover. Their bodies were fully covered and they were wearing gloves.\n\n\"The test took place in the room,\" she said. \"There’s about five medical people that helped with the testing.\"\n\nA baby was being tested, too. She heard that test would take longer to conduct than the others.\n\nWhat's it like for those on the ship?\n\nWhile confined in their rooms, guests will receive all meals by room service. Extra television and movie options have been added to programming in each state room, and guests have been given complimentary internet service – the ship’s bandwidth has been increased, according to the cruise line.\n\nGreg and Susan White, from Fort Collins, Colorado, are on board and weren't surprised to hear that they were being confined to their rooms when the announcement came.\n\nBefore they were directed to stay in their staterooms, they said there was a lot of \"gallows humor,\" but that everyone understood the need to isolate.\n\n\"Personally, this did not surprise me because I was on business travel some 2,000 miles from home on Sept. 11 and saw pretty much the same thing,\" White said in an email to the Coloradoan, which is part of the USA TODAY Network. \"Virtually everyone cooperated fully, resigned to the fact that there wasn't really anything they could do about it.\"\n\nHiggins Ott said that when passengers were informed they should remain in their staterooms, there was a scramble in the shops and restaurants on board to stock up.\n\n\"There were a lot of people in the lobby, there were a lot of people in the store, getting food and chips,\" Higgins Ott said Thursday as the lunch period was ending. \"People tried to get into the dining rooms, to do last-minute things.\"\n\nIn a video recording obtained by USA TODAY of a Thursday evening announcement from the captain detailed the meal delivery procin addition to an update on the status of testing.\n\n\"The sample collection continues for guests,\" the captain can be heard saying. \"We expect the test results sometime in the near future, as previously advised we anticipate that we will receive the first results tomorrow morning.\"\n\nWhat about for those who disembarked from its Mexico voyage?\n\nA passenger from the Mexico voyage, Judy Cadiz of Lodi said she and her husband Mark became ill following their cruise but did not give it much thought until learning a fellow traveler had died of the virus. Now they cannot get a straight answer about how to get tested, she said.\n\nWith Mark, 65, running a fever, the couple worries not only about themselves, but about the possibility that — if they contracted the infection — they could have passed it on to others.\n\n“They’re telling us to stay home, but nobody told me until yesterday to stay home. We were in Sacramento, we were in Martinez, we were in Oakland. We took a train home from the cruise,” Judy Cadiz said Thursday. “I really hope that we’re negative so nobody got infected.”\n\nThis isn't Princess Cruises' first coronavirus cruise situation\n\nPrincess Cruises also owns the Diamond Princess, the ship that was quarantined in Yokohama, Japan, and experienced a coronavirus outbreak that infected more than 700 passengers.\n\n“We learned a lot from our recent experience in Japan, and we are taking those lessons into account as we continue to support our fleet and our guests,\" Swartz said in the video on Twitter.\n\n“We have been on the frontier of fighting this disease, and we are sharing what we learned with the hospitality and the travel industry.\"\n\nThe Princess Cruises ship was carrying 2,666 guests and 1,045 crew when it set sail and was quarantined after 10 cases of coronavirus were reported Feb. 4. More than 400 Americans were on the cruise ship. The State Department coordinated with the Department of Health and Human Services and other agencies to bring some passengers back to the U.S.\n\nAll but a handful of the remaining passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship who had been quarantined at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio were released to return home Tuesday. Passengers who had symptoms during the quarantine in Texas and tested positive for coronavirus will remain in isolation.\n\nMeanwhile, Princess Cruises' Sun Princess was met with riots when stopping in port at Réunion Island, located off the southeastern coast of Africa, near Madagascar on Sunday, Princess Cruises confirmed to USA TODAY.\n\nThe reason? More concerns over coronavirus. There had not been any cases reported in Réunion as of Wednesday, nor on the ship.\n\nPrincess Cruises said Wednesday that there are no concerns of coronavirus on the ship.\n\n\"We can confirm that there are no cases of COVID-19 onboard Sun Princess. Sun Princess is heading back to Fremantle (Australia) as scheduled with arrival March 10th,\" Princess Cruises said in a statement shared with USA TODAY by spokesperson Alivia Owyoung Ender on Wednesday.\n\nWhat is happening with future Princess Cruises?\n\nPrincess has adjusted its cancellation policy, at least temporarily, to allow people who have booked an upcoming cruise to change their plans. Those who have a cruise booked through May 31, 2020, can make changes to their reservations, the company stated.\n\nContributing: John Fritze, Maureen Groppe,Courtney Subramanian, USA TODAY; The Associated Press; Sady Swanson, Fort Collins Coloradoan; Sam Gross, Reno Gazette Journal", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/03/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2020/03/20/before-coronavirus-princess-cruises-saw-outbreaks-alarming-rates/5047508002/", "title": "Before coronavirus, Princess Cruises saw outbreaks at alarming rates", "text": "Letitia Stein, Mike Stucka and Cara Kelly\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nPrincess Cruises had a health problem long before back-to-back outbreaks of the new coronavirus on the Diamond and Grand Princess ships unmoored the entire cruise industry.\n\nTheir passengers fell sick extraordinarily often. Nearly 5,000 people onboard Princess ships in the past decade have suffered from bouts of vomiting, diarrhea – or both – in numbers widespread enough that government health officials issued alerts on 26 outbreaks.\n\nThe next-closest cruise line, Celebrity, reported one-third fewer breakouts during the same years.\n\nYet Princess, with 18 ships in the world's largest cruise company, Carnival Corp., consistently earned high marks on U.S. inspections that were supposed to protect 30 million people taking cruise vacations each year.\n\nA USA TODAY investigation found the high-profile scoring of inspections administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention masks how frequently ships are cited for health and sanitation violations.\n\nThe score most commonly awarded? A perfect 100.\n\nYet outbreaks kept occurring, even on ships with flawless inspections. USA TODAY found no instance in which a ship had failed its last inspection before a breakout of a stomach-related illness, the only type of outbreak routinely published by the CDC.\n\nPrincess ships consistently earned high ratings, including some of the best scores in the industry on disease reporting standards.\n\nIn 2017, inspectors noted multiple problems with medical records on the Coral Princess. A food service worker fell sick on the job and supposedly went into isolation, but his timecard indicated he was still working. In a separate violation, there was no documentation that the cabin mates of several sick crew members were interviewed to assess and contain the risk of possible spread.\n\nThe ship still earned a perfect inspection score. Then, on a voyage starting 10 days later, it reported a norovirus outbreak.\n\nHelp USA TODAY report on the new coronavirus outbreak. If you have a story, please email coronavirus@usatoday.com. We are investigating the federal response, where the system is failing and the challenges to medical workers and patients. We won't publish your name unless you agree.\n\nDr. Chris Taylor, a former cruise ship physician, researched five years of CDC inspections and found the scores had no value in informing the public about the risk of illness spreading on a ship.\n\n“The proof of whether a ship has a high sanitary standard is the outcome,” Taylor said. “It is all about whether you have outbreaks.”\n\nCruise ship health safety failures came into glaring focus in recent weeks. The industry’s slow response to initial warnings facilitated the early global spread of the COVID-19 virus. Only after two high-profile outbreaks, and after major U.S. sporting tournaments and other events were canceled, did the industry at large decide to abandon ship for a month.\n\nREAD: CDC says because of coronavirus everyone should avoid cruise ships\n\nMany of the health factors that fuel gastrointestinal illness outbreaks also are suspected of contributing to spread of the coronavirus, from unwashed hands to failing to separate the sick from the healthy.\n\nDuring the second outbreak, people onboard the Grand Princess kept mingling even after public health authorities and ship leaders knew that passengers on the voyage immediately before had contracted the coronavirus, with some still on the ship who could have been exposed.\n\nAfter being informed of the concern by loudspeaker announcement, passengers were still permitted to don formal attire for an evening meal featuring lobster tail. By morning, a letter had been pushed under their cabin doors explaining that only a few people needed to stay in their rooms, an initial isolation later expanded to all passengers.\n\n“Zero steps were taken,” said Debi Chalik, an attorney whose parents, Ronald and Eva Weissberger of Florida, are now suing the cruise line for putting them at risk of infection.\n\nPrincess declined to answer detailed questions under deadline “due to the large volume of media inquiries we’ve received.”\n\nThe cruise line referred USA TODAY to a video posted last week when Princess Cruises announced a 60-day hiatus for its fleet. In it, President Jan Swartz noted the company’s global clientele of passengers and crew and its commitment to reporting every medical case onboard.\n\n“We’ve been asked, and we’ve asked ourselves, why COVID-19 seems to be impacting Princess so heavily,” she said. “We don’t really know.”\n\nSpeaking in the White House Rose Garden the next day, President Donald Trump praised his administration’s response to the coronavirus outbreak on the Grand Princess. Vice President Mike Pence also pledged to work with the industry so when the pandemic passes, “cruise lines are safer than ever before.”\n\nContagious disease long a concern on cruise ships\n\nIn the past decade, outbreaks of stomach-related illnesses on cruise ships have sickened about 18,000 people, USA TODAY found.\n\nIn that time, more than 415 million passengers sailed on cruise ships, plus hundreds of thousands of crew, the Cruise Lines International Association said. It added that far more people get sick from norovirus each year on land.\n\nStill, contagious disease has long been a concern on cruise ships that thrust thousands of people into close quarters for days or weeks at a time. The new coronavirus has raised similar questions in other crowded living environments, such as nursing homes, where early examples show the infection can rage rapidly, with deadly consequences.\n\nThe current system of cruise safety inspections is aimed at preventing stomach bugs rather than an influenza-like illness like the new coronavirus, which is suspected of spreading widely by air. But many of the preventive measures are the same, such as scrupulous hand cleaning and tracing the contacts of anyone sickened.\n\nNo agency regulates medical practices on cruise ships. Instead, the CDC sends inspectors twice a year to conduct sanitation inspections on ships sailing internationally with visits to U.S. ports. The comprehensive reviews can last eight to 10 hours.\n\nDeficiencies cited based on those visits can attest to the broader health and safety culture on the ship, said Ross Klein, an academic in Newfoundland who tracks cruise ship outbreaks and has spent two decades researching and studying the industry.\n\n“If their attentiveness is lower with known viruses, what can we expect about the viruses that are not known?” he said.\n\nUSA TODAY reviewed about 4,100 inspections conducted across the cruise industry through the so-called Vessel Sanitation Program since 2010, looking at both the scores behind the ship’s overall passing score and details of cited deficiencies.\n\nAlmost every ship inspected – 92% of them – has been flagged for problems with medical records maintained onboard, a standard intended to help control the spread of disease and track outbreaks when they do occur.\n\nSailing into a coronavirus outbreak\n\nOn a crisp Friday last month in San Francisco, Greg and Cathy Rafanelli of Seattle boarded the Grand Princess for their 21st Princess line cruise. They were handed a questionnaire to report any recent travel abroad to countries of concern or symptoms of the new coronavirus.\n\n“We said, ‘no, no, no, no, no,’” Greg Rafanelli said, “and happily sailed away.”\n\nJudy and Garth LaPar of Florida got the same form before the ship departed on Feb. 21. Later, they wondered why no one from the ship had interviewed them in person or checked their temperature, a more rigorous approach to coronavirus screening.\n\nThree weeks before, another of the company’s ships, the Diamond Princess, had been the site of an early coronavirus outbreak that ultimately would infect about 700 passengers and crew.\n\nInvestigators now believe that outbreak started with a passenger and spread to the crew – who continued to work unless they had symptoms – especially food service workers working closely together and living in cabins on the same deck, the CDC said in a report released this week.\n\nThe Grand Princess was similarly vulnerable as it sailed away for 13 days, making four stops on islands in Hawaii. The Rafanellis recalled rough seas as the ship turned toward Ensenada, Mexico, with less experienced cruisers vomiting in public and crew scurrying to clean up.\n\nBy then, U.S. health authorities were aware of a problem not yet announced to passengers: Authorities in California were tracking several coronavirus cases involving passengers on the previous Grand Princess voyage – with exposure to some still onboard. They reported an elderly man’s death on Wednesday.\n\nThe captain shared the news over the loudspeaker that afternoon and canceled a reception that night for VIP cruisers. A planned music and dance show was instead piped into the rooms, where the Rafanellis watched it.\n\nThe formal dress dinner still carried on that night, though, featuring a “surf and turf” menu. The crew now wore gloves and served the food rather than allowing passengers to help themselves from the buffet.\n\nRafanelli, 73, recognized the protocol from a previous cruise with a norovirus outbreak. That night, he was not allowed to touch common utensils. “The gloved wait staff had to put on your salt and pepper,” he said.\n\nIn a ship cafe after dinner, Michelle Saunders, 23, sipped hot cocoa with her grandmother. She had been impressed throughout the cruise by how attentively the crew were wiping down handrails and elevator buttons.\n\nStill, she wondered whether crowds should be mingling. “The thought crossed my mind,” she said.\n\nA letter delivered overnight to passengers' rooms offered details. Princess Cruises’ chief medical officer, Grant Tarling, explained that the CDC was investigating a “small cluster” of coronavirus cases connected to the previous voyage. Out of an abundance of caution, he wrote, the CDC was requiring passengers who had sailed on both trips to stay in their rooms until medically cleared.\n\nAll were advised to practice proper hand washing and sneeze etiquette.\n\nIt was not until later Thursday that passengers received instructions to isolate themselves in their rooms. Before retreating, Cathy Rafanelli, 67, darted back to the buffet line, which was still open despite the new guidance, to stock up on cookies and fruit.\n\nGloved and masked crew deposited meals at cabin doors for the next week as authorities scrambled to arrange for the disembarkment and quarantine of the ship’s passengers. Clean linens arrived in bags. Rafanelli and her husband left their cabin only once for an organized deck walk, with protective masks provided.\n\nThey were pleased with the measures taken to protect their health, even after the captain informed passengers over the speaker system that coronavirus tests given to 45 of the 3,533 people onboard turned up 21 cases – two in passengers and 19 among the crew.\n\nBut in an interior cabin with no windows, the LaPars worried about air circulating between rooms and how sanitary it was to sleep on the same sheets night after night. On their lone trip out for fresh air, they saw passengers violating the recommendation to stay 6 feet apart.\n\n“For six to seven days, our room wasn’t clean,” said Judy LaPar, 73.\n\nPerfect inspections downplay problems\n\nThe Grand Princess had never failed a CDC inspection. Nor had any Princess ship on its last inspection before an outbreak.\n\nYet in 2012 alone, five outbreaks occurred on three Princess Cruises ships with recent flawless 100-point inspections: the Emerald Princess, the Crown Princess and the Ruby Princess.\n\nThe CDC’s outbreak reports offer limited insight beyond the numbers and pathogens involved.\n\nAn attorney in Australia has been collecting detailed accounts from passengers on the Sun Princess, which in 2017 experienced norovirus outbreaks on back-to-back cruises, one to Papua New Guinea, the other to New Zealand. Concerns include contamination in the buffet areas, public restrooms, swimming pools and casinos.\n\nOne passenger smelled vomit in a cabin upon arrival for the second trip, raising questions about how well cabins were sanitized, according to Vicky Antzoulatos, who is investigating for a potential lawsuit over the outbreaks that sickened 230 passengers in all.\n\n“They basically didn’t take adequate steps,” she said.\n\nIndustry experts say cruise lines take their inspection scores very seriously. The CDC posts the ratings online, and findings of unsanitary conditions can be public relations nightmares.\n\nSome caution, however, that the vessels prepare for the unannounced exams. They can anticipate at times when a ship visit is likely in the rotation from the timing of passenger disembarkation or boarding, for example, or if there is just one U.S. docking in an itinerary.\n\nThey add that cruise lines have little control over passengers who board knowing that they are sick.\n\n“Once someone made their final payment, if they can go from toilet to toilet, they are going to go on their cruise ship,” said Andrew Coggins Jr., a professor in the business school at Pace University in New York who specializes in the cruise industry.\n\n'Nothing happened' until sickness broke out\n\nFor weeks, the cruise industry gradually stepped up protocols around the new coronavirus threat, gradually restricting passengers who had traveled to certain international countries from boarding.\n\nAs of March 9, when the Grand Princess was finally able to dock in Oakland, California, cruise ships had begun rolling out temperature screenings before boarding.\n\nAs U.S. health officials started cautioning against cruise travel, the industry proposed requiring a doctor’s note for anyone over 70 and at higher risk of coronavirus complication. Finally, late last week, the major cruise lines all canceled voyages from U.S. ports for a month.\n\nNew Orleans attorney and maritime law expert Paul Sterbcow, who testified about cruise safety before Congress last fall, told USA TODAY the industry should have responded to the emerging public health threat far sooner.\n\n“Nothing happened until people started getting sick on their boats,” he said. “And then the reaction is, ‘We’ll just stay out here and let them get sick.’ ”\n\nExperts say any return to the high seas will require a complete review of infection control practices and should include not only stomach bugs but also respiratory illness like the new coronavirus.\n\n“What the cruise ship industry has to do is really critically assess their infection prevention and control,” said Connie Steed, a frequent cruiser and president of the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology.\n\nMeanwhile, knowledge – and questions – about the impact of the Princess line’s role in the pandemic’s early stages are still expanding: A Chicago teacher exposed on the earlier Grand Princess cruise tested positive, prompting one of the nation’s early school closures.\n\nREAD:Coronavirus closed this school.\n\nCrew with potential exposure on that voyage also ended up on three other ships – the Caribbean Princess, Royal Princess and the Regal Princess – sailing out of Los Angeles and Port Everglades in Florida.\n\nThe CDC then asserted its rarely used authority to issue “no sail” orders until that crew tested negative. But soon after, three workers at a company that greets cruise passengers at Port Everglades tested positive.\n\nThe South Florida region is now the leading hot spot for infection in the state.\n\nLetitia Stein is a reporter on the USA TODAY investigations team, focusing primarily on health and medicine.

Typically, the ship can carry 3,934 passengers and 1,450 crew members.\n\nOn the ship, 99.98% of crew members are vaccinated, and 96.5% of passengers are vaccinated, the tourism board said, noting that all of the people who tested positive are vaccinated. Most are asymptomatic, and a few have mild symptoms.\n\nCOVID-19 vaccines are highly effective, but they’re not 100% effective in preventing infection. A small percentage of people who are fully vaccinated will still get COVID-19 if they're exposed to the virus that causes it, according to the CDC. However, vaccinated people who have breakthrough infections are much less likely to get severely sick or die.\n\nContact tracing was completed on the ship, with no additional positive tests, and all who tested positive were isolated.\n\n\"Additional protocols have been put in place, including increased mask-wearing indoors, use of N95 masks by crew, crew social areas have been closed, and as early as the next departure, all guests will require a negative rapid test, regardless of whether they are vaccinated,\" the Belize Tourism Board said.\n\nAs part of \"normal protocol\" Carnival reported the positive cases to Belize upon arrival in the Belize City port. Belize's Minister of Tourism and Diaspora Relations then met with Carnival Vista officials virtually Monday to discuss the cases and the situation.\n\nThe tourism board determined that risk was low and noted that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is aware of the situation on board. Other passengers were allowed to disembark and go on shore excursions as scheduled.\n\nHowever, an additional protocol was added for the port call in Belize Wednesday. All passengers were asked to provide proof of a negative COVID test, and those passengers without proof of a negative test were subject to \"random testing\" conducted by Belize's Ministry of Health and Wellness.\n\nThe health agency also inspected the ship.\n\n\"We are pleased to inform that our personnel from the Ministry of Health and Wellness also carried out an inspection of the protocols on board the Carnival Vista this morning and are satisfied that they have been able to verify that the measures put in place by the ship are meticulous and deemed highly effective,\" the tourism board said.\n\nThe CDC said on its website tracking cruise ships and COVID that it \"has investigated and ship remains under observation.\"\n\nStarting last Saturday, Carnival began requiring passengers to wear their masks in indoor areas.

Symptoms, which may appear 2-14 days after exposure, can include cough, fever and shortness of breath.\n\n“The reality is COVID-19 is now here, and we can expect the number of tests and the number of positive cases will continue to increase in the days to come,” Reynolds said from the state Capitol. “While this news is concerning, it's not cause for alarm.

The Board of Regents, which oversees Iowa's three public universities, announced it was working toward virtual instruction as well.\n\nReynolds said 21 Iowans traveled on a cruise ship in Egypt during a trip that officials said ran between Feb. 17 and March 2. Twelve of those individuals represent 13 of the presumptive coronavirus cases that have been reported in Iowa.\n\nThe cases are presumptive until confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The federal agency has a backlog of tests as of Tuesday afternoon, according to Polly Carver-Kimm, spokeswoman for the Iowa public health department.\n\nReynolds said Iowans who were on the cruise in Egypt are self-quarantined at home. Some who were tested for the coronavirus had positive results, and others had tested negative.\n\nReynolds said these Iowans “had limited interaction in their communities” prior to being asked to self-quarantine. She did say that they had not attended any large public events prior to self-quarantining.\n\nAnother 22 Iowans were on the separate Grand Princess cruise ship that has been floating off the coast of California after several passengers and crew members tested positive for the coronavirus. The cruise docked in Oakland on Monday.\n\nEighteen of those Iowans will be returning to Iowa soon on a chartered flight coordinated by the federal government. Officials said the other four Iowans will be traveling elsewhere.\n\nReynolds said the returning Iowans will be screened before coming back to Iowa. She added the individuals have shown no symptoms of the virus.\n\nState officials said they don't plan to release more information about the impacted traveling Iowans unless the public needs to know it to protect their health. To date, the state has provided general information about the presumptive coronavirus cases, like age ranges instead of exact ages. No names have been released.\n\n“We will not provide some of the details about the Iowans affected, out of respect for their privacy,” Reynolds said.\n\n► More:Myth or fact: We dispel the rumors surrounding the coronavirus\n\nWhile 12 of the presumptive cases are tied to the cruise ship in Egypt, one is linked to a woman who traveled recently to California. A Pottawattamie County official confirmed with the Register on Tuesday that the woman worked at a Panera Bread in Council Bluffs and, according to local news reports, was sent home when she showed virus-related symptoms.\n\nCaitlin Pedati, the state's medical director and an epidemiologist at the Iowa Department of Public Health, said public health officials are aware of the reports involving the affected person in Council Bluffs, adding that it's a factor in their investigation.\n\nState officials in Iowa reported the first three presumptive cases of the coronavirus Sunday night. That tally was increased to eight presumptive cases Monday afternoon, just as Reynolds announced that she had signed a disaster emergency proclamation Monday that is supposed to help the state respond to the escalating situation. The latest update, bringing the total to 13, was released Tuesday evening.\n\n► More:Coronavirus map: How many cases have been confirmed in Iowa and where are they located?\n\nThe governor said she and public health officials will provide daily updates, including on testing for the virus. As of Tuesday, the state has the ability to test about 500 people. Over 50 people in Iowa have been tested for the virus so far.\n\nReynolds said she expects the state to receive more materials for testing, but she provided no additional timeline.\n\n\"We're in a good place,\" she said in response to the questions about testing.\n\nReynolds said all major insurance companies in Iowa have agreed to waive the \"cost share and copay\" for the testing of coronavirus. She said that includes people who receive services through Medicaid, Medicare, Wellmark Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Aetna, Medica and UnitedHealthcare. She said people will have access to telehealth through these programs that can help answer questions.\n\nFor months, the coronavirus has gradually affected people around the world. Officials estimate the virus has infected more than 118,000 people, and caused more than 4,000 deaths as of Tuesday, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.\n\nWhile more than 64,000 people have recovered from the disease, according to the tally, it impacts people in different ways. Relatively healthy people may experience mild symptoms, while older individuals and people with compromised immune systems could face more serious illness.\n\nPedati repeated the directives that federal, state and local officials have been giving the public in recent weeks about limiting the spread of the virus: Iowans should wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, cover coughs and sneezes, and stay home if sick.\n\nPedati also said that Iowans who are sick should stay away from people who have compromised immune systems.\n\n“Even though it sounds basic, those steps of washing your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds, of really staying home and away from those high-risk groups, in particular, when you're sick, are going to be effective at limiting the spread of viruses whether we talk about COVID-19 or flu or other illnesses,” she said.\n\nThe federal government has approved $8.3 billion in response to the coronavirus. Reynolds said Iowa's estimated request from that pot of money will be about $200 million, though the timeline for that complete funding is unclear. The state is expected to soon receive a batch of emergency preparedness funding.\n\nMore on coronavirus:\n\nThe Register's Sarah LeBlanc contributed to this report.\n\nBarbara Rodriguez covers health care and politics for the Register.

The automaker said at the time it could be worth nearly $56 billion, making it the largest compensation package for anyone on Earth from a publicly traded company, and the net value today is $50.9 billion.\n\nEven in the rarified air of CEO pay, Musk’s compensation plan stood apart. Millions upon millions of dollars are often lavished on corporate executives of the biggest companies, but the plan to pay Musk initially totaled in the tens of billions, as long as he met performance goals. It wasn’t in cash – top executive pay rarely is – but in shares of the company. The higher Tesla went, the more those shares would be valued, the more Musk would be awarded and the more those shares would be worth. And as Tesla’s stock shot ever upwards, it helped propel him to a net worth of over $300 billion at one point, all while shareholders reaped the potential gains.\n\nBut all the while, Musk was sharing his time between his many other endeavors. SpaceX began regularly sending astronauts to the International Space Station. The Boring Company built a Loop under the Las Vegas Convention Center. And then, of course, he bought Twitter.\n\nHuge CEO Pay\n\nMusk isn’t the only one to benefit from the rise in value of Tesla shares and options, however. So have shareholders. The market value of Tesla has soared more 1,000% since they approved his pay package in March of 2018.\n\nThe case could be significant for Tesla, given the serious questions raised about its executive compensation, according to corporate governance experts. Tesla’s board of directors has defended the compensation package.\n\nThe trial may also invigorate debate over executive compensation, including large stock grants they receive. S&P 500 CEOs averaged $18.3 million in compensation in 2021, 324 times the median pay at the companies. That disparity has grown in recent years.\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy, for example, received compensation valued at $212.7 million in 2021. Apple CEO Tim Cook received nearly $100 million last year. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was paid nearly $50 million in 2021.\n\nThe plaintiff, Richard J. Tornetta, claims on behalf of Tesla shareholders that Musk exploited his control over the company and its board of directors to secure the huge compensation package in order to “fund his personal ambition to colonize Mars.”\n\nMusk entered March 2018, the month shareholders approved the compensation plan, at No. 41 on the Bloomberg Billionaire’s Index, due largely to his involvement in Tesla and SpaceX. At the time, Tesla was a promising but troubled automaker. It had lost nearly $2 billion the year before and struggled to overcome production delays as it manufactured its mass-market Model 3 sedan. Musk spoke of being in “production hell” as well as “delivery logistics hell” during the year, and joked about going bankrupt.\n\nMany questioned if the company could survive as an independent automaker.\n\nTesla’s board of directors felt that with proper execution the automaker could become one of the world’s most valuable companies and wanted to encourage Musk to lead it for the long term. The compensation plan included 12 batches of stock that Musk would receive if milestones were hit, including the market capitalization of Tesla as well as its revenue and adjusted earnings. (Each batch of stock would be earned if Tesla’s market capitalization increased an additional $50 billion above $100 billion. Other milestones included hitting $35 billion in annualized revenue and $3 billion in adjusted earnings.)\n\nThe plan, originally set to pay out over the course of a decade, turned out to be wildly lucrative for Musk and in astonishing time. Tesla was the best performing US stock in 2020 and became America’s most valuable automaker ever. Its small SUV, the Model Y, became the best-selling car in Europe recently.\n\nMusk has reached many of the milestones that trigger the payouts, and he is expected to earn the final batch early next year.\n\nThe payment plan helped lead to Musk becoming the world’s richest person, with an estimated net worth of $184 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire’s Index. His true net worth can be challenging to estimate as a significant portion is invested in SpaceX, a private company that does not have to publicly reveal detailed financials that could show a decline or increase in value. Tech stocks and the entire stock market more broadly have fallen sharply this year.\n\nA Duty to Shareholders\n\nRichard Tornetta, who originally filed the lawsuit in June 2018, claims that the Tesla board of directors has breached its fiduciary duties for waste, and Musk has breached his own fiduciary duties for unjust enrichment.\n\nTornetta argued in his original 2018 complaint that the compensation plan was unnecessary to incentive Musk as he already had a large ownership stake in the automaker.\n\nThe lawsuit was certified as a class action case by the court in January 2021. The case has taken years to move through the system due to the drawn-out nature of litigation, including working through a motion from Tesla to dismiss the complaint.\n\nThe Tornetta complaint alleges that the board of directors that created Musk’s compensation plan lacked sufficient independence from him. The board included Musk’s brother Kimbal as well as friends Anthony Gracias and Steve Jurvetson. (Jurvetson and Gracias have since left Tesla’s board.)\n\nCarla Hayn, a professor who teaches corporate governance at the UCLA business school, told CNN Business that the case is serious for Tesla as it will be a heavy burden for the automaker to prove the compensation and the process to create it was fair.\n\n“This is a huge package,” Hayn said of the compensation plan. “Did they need to give away this much of the company to Musk to align his interests and keep him as CEO?”\n\nShe noted that Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis, advisory firms, both recommended in 2018 that Tesla stockholders reject the compensation plan.\n\nInstitutional Shareholder Services cautioned that the plan “locks in unprecedented high pay opportunities for the next decade,” and noted that Musk already owned 22% of Tesla, aligning his interests with it. But shareholders did approve the plan, she noted.\n\nTesla’s Board\n\nHayn noted that Musk’s close relationships with the board members could be problematic for Tesla in the case.\n\n“Given that that entire board is very much under the influence of Musk it’s hard to know that anything that they did would be following proper process,” she said.\n\nTesla’s board of directors have claimed that it created the plan “after more than six months of careful analysis with a leading independent compensation consultant as well as discussions with Elon.”\n\n“We gave Elon the ability to share in the upside in a way that is commensurate with the difficulty of achieving them,” they said at the time.\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment and generally does not engage with the professional news media.\n\nThe trial is expected to last a week. Chancery court judges at times rule from the bench, but that’s uncommon. It may take weeks to months before a decision is issued.\n\nMusk has become something of a regular at the Delaware Court of Chancery. Last month his acquisition of Twitter nearly went to trial at the court. He testified before the court last year in a dispute over Tesla’s acquisition of SolarCity. A judge ruled in Musk’s favor this April.\n\nMusk’s unique management style will be a topic of discussion. He leads several ventures outside of Tesla: the aerospace company SpaceX; his tunneling venture The Boring Co.; a brain interface startup, Neuralink; and Twitter. It’s uncommon for executives to hold multiple CEO titles.\n\nCNN’s Chris Isidore contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Matt Mcfarland"], "publish_date": "2022/11/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/16/business/tesla-elon-musk-testimony-lawsuit/index.html", "title": "Elon Musk's $50 billion payday trial: Tesla CEO testifies in his own ...", "text": "Washington, DC CNN —\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk testified this morning in a shareholder lawsuit examining the massive compensation package that helped make him the world’s richest person.\n\nTesla is being sued by plaintiff Richard J. Tornetta, who says that the company was wrong in awarding Musk his compensation package in 2018, which shareholders approved at the time. Tesla said at the time it could be worth nearly $56 billion, and the net value today is $50.9 billion.\n\nMusk took the stand in the Delaware Court of Chancery in Wilmington shortly after 9 a.m. Musk’s testimony came just as he is asserting his control over Twitter, overnight giving an employees an ultimatum to become “extremely hardcore,” involving “working long hours at high intensity,” or leave the company.\n\nMusk began the day under questioning from his defense attorney and an attorney for the plaintiff, where they asked him about Tesla’s governance and his time spent at the company, as well as his relationship with the board, which is supposed to be independent from Musk and represent shareholders. Musk acknowledged his friendship with board members, including some shared family vacations. Under questioning, Musk defended himself, saying he upheld his duty to increase Tesla’s market value, but conceded that he at times does not seek board approval for public statements.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Musk’s huge pay package was unjust enrichment, and alleges the board failed to meet its legal duty to act in the best interest of Tesla shareholders. The suit describes Musk as a “part-time CEO,” as he leads other ventures. One of the points of contention in the case is whether or not Tesla’s board is truly independent from Musk and represents shareholders, or if he had undue influence on the board to award him such a massive payday.\n\nMusk himself controls more than 20% of all outstanding Tesla shares, including unexercised options.\n\nMusk initially denied Thursday that he essentially negotiated against himself regarding how many shares he would receive in the pay package. (To negotiate against oneself would essentially give Musk total control over the outcome, and raise big questions about the board and if it met its fiduciary responsibilities.)\n\nBut the plaintiff’s attorney Gregory Varallo then replayed some of Musk’s deposition in which he said at one point regarding the pay package, “that was I guess me negotiating against myself.”\n\nMusk then acknowledged saying this. It was one of several occasions where Varallo appeared to highlight inconsistencies in Musk’s statements, current and former.\n\nFewer than three minutes into questioning, Musk said that he believed that there had been consultation with the board of directors before his title changed to “Technoking.”\n\nVarallo then played back Musk’s deposition in which Musk said that he hadn’t consulted with the board over the title change.\n\nMusk also had said in his deposition, which was replayed in court Wednesday, that he was the person that came up with the vision for Tesla.\n\nBut in court Wednesday Musk struck a different tone, and objected to being asked the question in a yes-no format.\n\n“I believe you are asking complex questions where yes or not is not possible. Yes is more accurate than no,” Musk said Wednesday. “But your question is a complex question that is commonly used to mislead people.”\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk testifies before Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick in Wilmington, Delaware. Elizabeth Williams/AP\n\nVarallo highlighted the degree of control Musk holds over Tesla.\n\nMusk said he didn’t seek approval when he announced a potential stock buyback recently. He also said that he didn’t seek approval over stating that he saw a path to Tesla becoming worth more than Apple and Saudi Aramco, the two most valuable companies in the world.\n\nThe plaintiff’s lawyers have described the package this week as close to the gross domestic product of the entire state of Delaware, and vastly more expensive than building the World Trade Center. They’ve also contrasted Musk’s compensation with the average Tesla salary, which they’ve said is $40,000.\n\nWhile the trial is focused on Musk’s compensation, the lawyers for the plaintiffs asked a wide variety of questions concerning his governance of Tesla. Musk protested a question regarding when he tweets about Tesla.\n\n“We’re on cross-examination in an interesting case Mr. Musk,” Varallo fired back. “So when your lawyer wants to make an objection he has a right to do it, but sadly you don’t. I suspect that he will if he doesn’t like the question.’\n\nThe exchange led to Musk repeating his criticisms of the SEC.\n\n“The consent decree was made under duress,” Musk claimed Wednesday, referring to a 2018 settlement with the SEC over Musk’s claims that he had “funding secured” to take Tesla private at $420 a share. “An agreement made under duress is not valid as a foundation of law.”\n\nAt a TED conference earlier this year, Musk said he agreed to a settlement only because if he continued to fight the SEC, Tesla’s banks would have cut off funding at a time when it needed cash. “I was forced [to lie] to save Tesla’s life and that’s the only reason,” Musk said at the April event.\n\nVarallo then asked if Musk had any legal training. Musk described some familiarity.\n\n“If you’re in enough lawsuits you pick up a few things along the way,” Musk said.\n\nTesla executives have defended Musk’s pay package in two days of testimony so far.\n\n“It was around motivating him to achieve things that were bold and audacious and him putting his time and energy into that as opposed to his other interests,” Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm testified Tuesday. Musk was interested in funding inter-planetary travel, she said. Beyond Tesla, Musk is also the CEO of SpaceX and owner of Twitter, as well as leading the Boring Company, which specializes in underground tunneling, and he is the founder of Neuralink, which seeks to put computer chips in people’s brains.\n\nTesla board member James Murdoch, son of media magnate Rupert Murdoch, testified Wednesday that Musk has discussed someone replacing him as CEO of the automaker.\n\nAn attorney for the plaintiff asked Murdoch whether Musk has ever “identified anybody as a potential successor” as Tesla’s CEO.\n\n“He actually has,” Murdoch responded. “But it’s in between the time where you took that deposition and now,” referring to Murdoch’s testimony before the trial. Murdoch clarified that the conversation was in the past few months.\n\nMurdoch said that Musk has never suggested to him that he may imminently leave Tesla. And Murdoch said he was not aware of Musk suggesting to anyone else that he was going to imminently quit Tesla.\n\nMurdoch did not reveal any other details about who a potential successor for Musk could be. Musk has mused about leaving his role at Tesla for years.\n\nTesla executives and board members like Murdoch have characterized the compensation package’s goals as lofty and incredibly difficult to achieve.\n\nFormer Tesla Chief Financial Officer Deepak Ahuja described the plan as “extremely high-risk, high-reward” on Tuesday.\n\n“Even though I believe in Tesla deeply, I felt the level of difficulty of these milestones was so high that for a mere mortal like me, I did not find this as a compelling incentive plan at a personal level,” Ahuja said.\n\nMusk pushed for shareholders to approve the plan, warning that he was “very offended” by a lack of support and those who opposed it would not be welcome in any of his companies, according to emails read in court by the plaintiff ‘s attorneys.\n\nChris Isidore contributed to this story.", "authors": ["Matt Mcfarland"], "publish_date": "2022/11/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/17/business/elon-musk-board-friends/index.html", "title": "Tesla's close-knit leadership team goes under the spotlight in court ...", "text": "Washington, DC CNN —\n\nThe Tesla board of directors that created the largest compensation package in history for CEO Elon Musk was stocked with friends of Musk, according to court testimony this week.\n\n“Yes we’re friends,” former Tesla board member Antonio Gracias said after a long line of questions about his relationships with Elon Musk and his brother Kimbal Musk, who is also on Tesla’s board. “Yes, I mean, yes, yes, yes, yes.”\n\nThis potential conflict of interest may be problematic as Tesla says its board of directors has a legal responsibility for shareholders’ money in addition to overseeing management, which includes Elon Musk.\n\nPlaintiff Richard J. Tornetta has claimed on behalf of Tesla’s shareholders, however, that Musk exploited his control over the company’s board of directors to secure the compensation package that’s worth $50.9 billion today and to fund his plans to colonize Mars. The 2018 compensation package helped launched Musk from No. 41 on the world’s richest list, all the way to No. 1.\n\nThe week-long trial is being held at the Delaware Court of Chancery in Wilmington. Tornetta accuses Tesla’s board of breaching its duties to shareholders. Tesla says its board members are supposed to manage potential conflict of interests and act in the best interests of Tesla and its stockholders.\n\nThe plaintiff’s attorneys have highlighted the closeness of Musk’s relationships with some board members to raise questions about their independence. Testimony is expected to conclude Friday, but Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick may not make a decision for weeks or months.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk is friends with some of those who have served on the company's board of directors including Ira Ehrenpreis, left, James Murdoch, center, and Antonio Gracias, right. From DBL Partners/Valor Equity Partners/Getty Images\n\nThe Tesla board approved Musk’s unprecedented pay package without negotiating how many shares Musk would receive in the plan, according to testimony Wednesday from Gracias. The failure to negotiate may indicate the board isn’t independent of Musk.\n\nOne board member, Ira Ehrenpreis, explored how the disclosed public value of the plan could be limited, according to his testimony. An interest in not disclosing the value of a pay package to shareholders could be interpreted as having more interest in maximizing executive pay than helping shareholders evaluate executive compensation.\n\nThe pay package from Tesla’s board granted Musk large sums of shares every time Tesla hit certain milestones, including earnings and share price targets.\n\nBut when the board sought shareholder approval of the package it did not consider revealing publicly that Tesla’s internal forecasts expected three milestones to be achieved in roughly 18 months, according to testimony from Gracias. That’s at odds with earlier testimony at this week’s trial in which Tesla leaders described the plan as difficult to achieve.\n\n“Even though I believe in Tesla deeply I felt the level of difficulty of these milestones was so high that for a mere mortal like me, I did not find this as a compelling incentive plan at a personal level,” former Tesla chief financial officer Deepak Ahuja testified earlier this week.\n\nMusk’s pay package was also unusual, because there was no traditional benchmarking study conducted by Tesla to compare Musk’s compensation to other leaders, according to testimony by Tesla board member Ira Ehrenpreis.\n\nVivek Wadhwa, a former Distinguished Fellow at Harvard Law School and Carnegie Mellon University’s College of Engineering before retiring, told CNN Business that it’s common for Silicon Valley boards like Tesla to lack adequate checks and balances. CEOs often end up with too much control of their boards and companies.\n\n“It’s an incestuous relationship. It’s a serious problem,” Wadhwa said in a phone interview conducted while charging his Tesla. He’s described himself in the past as a “Tesla fanboy.”\n\nToo close for business comfort?\n\nA plaintiff’s attorney questioned Gracias Wednesday about his relationship with Elon Musk, as well as Musk’s brother Kimbal Musk, who remains on Tesla’s board of directors.\n\nGracias described vacationing with Elon Musk’s family in the Bahamas, and having had an annual tradition for eight to 10 years of spending President’s Day weekend with Elon, Kimbal and their families. They’ve attended birthday parties for each other’s children, and Gracias has spent Christmas at Kimbal’s home. Gracias also said he was a groomsman in Kimbal’s wedding.\n\nIn this sketch, former Tesla board member Antonio Gracias testifies in court. Elizabeth Williams/AP\n\nElizabeth Umphress, a University of Washington business school professor who researches ethical decision making, says that friendships between board members and CEOs are concerning. Personal relationships can impact the quality of decision regarding pay and performance, research has shown.\n\nShe said this is a problem at all levels of organizations, but can be especially problematic at higher levels as high-status people are more likely to think they’re immune to conflict of interests.\n\n“When you do have these friendships,” Umphress said. “You are compromised.”\n\nJames Murdoch, who described himself in testimony as a friend of Elon Musk since 2006, described joining the Tesla board of directors in 2017 after being approached by Gracias. (Murdoch is the son of media titan Rupert Murdoch.)\n\nMurdoch, Gracias and Elon Musk vacationed together with their families in the Caribbean shortly before Murdoch joined the board. Murdoch said he also spent time with Musk and his family in Jerusalem and Mexico.\n\nIra Ehrenpreis, left, is cross examined by plaintiff attorney Gregory Varallo, standing at right, as Chief Judge Kathaleen McCormick, center, looks on. Elizabeth Williams/AP\n\nEhrenpreis, a Tesla board member who led the automaker’s compensation committee, has exchanged messages with Musk referring to each other with things like “love you man,” he testified earlier this week.

Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick did not issue a ruling from the bench, and it could be weeks to months before a ruling.\n\n“We have a lot of work ahead of us,” McCormick told both side’s attorneys as the trial concluded. “I won’t insult you with the typical talk I give at this point which is settlement is still achievable.”\n\nTesla awarded Musk a pay package in 2018 that helped make him the richest person on Earth. The net value of the compensation package is $50.9 billion today, after Tesla’s valuation soared more than 1,000% at its peak since shareholders approved the package.\n\nPlaintiff Richard Tornetta originally filed the lawsuit in June 2018, alleging that Musk exploited his control of Tesla and the board of directors to secure the compensation to “fund his personal ambition to colonize Mars.” The Delaware Court of Chancery has heard arguments this week in Wilmington.\n\nTornetta and his lawyers allege that Musk and the board failed to uphold their financial responsibilities to shareholders. Tesla says its board of directors has a legal responsibility for shareholders’ money in addition to overseeing management, which includes Musk.\n\nTornetta argued that the huge pay package wasn’t needed to incentivize Musk as he already owned the largest stake of Tesla.\n\nTestimony was heard this week from a who’s-who of Tesla insiders including Musk, board chair Robyn Denholm, former chief financial officer Deepak Ahuja, former board member Antonio Gracias, and board members Ira Ehrenpreis and James Murdoch.\n\nThe trial Friday included testimony from expert witnesses.\n\nKevin Murphy, a University of Southern California business school professor, testified on behalf of Tesla and the other defendants that the pay package was reasonable. He also said that Tesla’s board members were considered independent under NASDAQ’s standards. The independence of the directors is a central theme of the case.\n\nTornetta’s lawyers have highlighted the friendships between Musk and many of his board members who created the deal. Some have vacationed together in places like magician David Copperfield’s private island in the Bahamas, where Musk summoned his brother Kimbal and Gracias in 2017 to determine if James Murdoch should join Tesla’s board, according to Kimbal’s deposition which played in court this week. Murdoch, who described himself as a friend of Elon Musk’s since 2006, joined them on Copperfield’s Island for part of the trip, and joined the board shortly thereafter.\n\nSeveral corporate governance experts told CNN Business that it’s clear Tesla’s board of directors lacks independence from Musk.\n\n“It’s safe to say that Musk has a lot of power – and probably too much power – over the Tesla board,” George S. Georgiev a professor who studies corporate governance at Emory University school of law, told CNN Business. “The Tesla board has been extremely indulgent despite Musk’s many transgressions over the years, including his skirmishes with the SEC.”\n\nDenholm, chair of Tesla’s board, revealed after extensive questioning in her testimony that she was unaware of the details of how Musk handles an SEC settlement that required him to not tweet about certain topics, such as Tesla’s financial condition and new business lines, unless he obtained pre-approval from an “experienced securities lawyer.”\n\nMusk explained in his deposition that he sends certain tweets for approval, and publishes them if he hasn’t heard back in an unspecified amount of time. That arrangement leaves open the possibility of Musk’s tweets being published without the required review.\n\nDenholm first joined Tesla’s board in 2014 and became its chair in 2018 when Musk agreed to step down from that position following SEC charges. She said in her testimony that she interviewed with Musk before joining the board of directors.\n\nGeorgiev said there’s not a lot of precedent for cases like this one because they are either dismissed or settled.\n\nGeorgiev also said this makes an appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court more likely, so the case may stretch on. He pointed to a case the compensation of Michael Ovitz, a briefly-tenured Disney CEO, which stretched on for about a decade.\n\nThe Tesla board members who testified generally spoke of the huge pay package as necessary to keep Musk engaged at Tesla.\n\n“He’s got 100 company ideas in his mind. I promise you he’s only done very few of them,” Gracias testified. “And we wanted him focused. We needed him focused.”\n\nMurphy, Tesla’s expert witness, also pushed back Friday on the idea that Tesla shareholders are subsidizing Musk’s Mars mission.\n\n“I don’t think that’s any more true than USC is subsidizing my vacation. They pay me a reasonable wage for reasonable services,” Murphy said.\n\nHe said he didn’t feel that shareholders have a particular interest in how Musk spends his money.\n\n“The fact that Mr. Musk is potentially incentivized by this money is a good thing for Tesla shareholders,” he said.\n\nMusk is also the CEO of SpaceX and created a tunnel and transit venture, the Boring Company, as well as Neuralink, which is working toward putting computer chips in brains. Musk recently acquired Twitter for $44 billion, and has described himself as its “Chief Twit.”\n\nMusk’s brother Kimbal had a slightly different take in his deposition. At the time of the 2018 compensation package, Kimbal said it was “very unlikely” that Elon would walk away from his role of CEO at Tesla.\n\n“He’s responsible to the shareholders to the company.

(AP) — Testimony began Monday in a Delaware courtroom where a Tesla shareholder is challenging a compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk potentially worth more than $55 billion.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that the performance-based stock option grant was negotiated by a compensation committee and approved in 2018 by Tesla board members who had conflicts of interest due to personal and professional ties to Musk.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in 2018, also alleges that the shareholder vote to approve that compensation was based on an incomplete and misleading proxy statement.\n\nAnother option? With Elon Musk ruining Twitter, it's time to get back to hollering on street corners\n\nSpecifically, the plaintiff alleges that proxy wrongly described members of the compensation committee as \"independent,\" and characterized all the milestones that triggered vesting in the stock options as \"stretch\" goals meant to be difficult to achieve, even though internal projections indicated that three operational milestones were likely to be achieved within 18 months of the stockholder vote.\n\n\"Any action by stockholders based on a materially misleading proxy is a nullity and the grant fails,\" according to a brief by the plaintiff's attorneys.\n\nTesla owners worry:Tesla recalls more than 40,000 vehicles for possible loss of power steering\n\nAttorneys for the defendants countered in their pretrial brief that two institutional proxy advisers noted that the plan would require \"significant and perhaps historic achievements\" and require growth that \"appear stretching by any benchmark.\"\n\nThe first witness to testify was Ira Ehrenpreis, a prominent venture capitalist and longtime friend of Musk who chaired Tesla's compensation committee when the grant was formulated.\n\nAre you in danger? Remove these 5 dangerous tech gadgets from your home\n\nUnder the plan, Musk stood to reap billions if the electric car and solar panel maker hit certain market capitalization and operational milestones.\n\nFor each of incidence of simultaneously meeting a market cap milestone and an operational milestone, Musk, who already owned about 22% of Tesla when the plan was approved, would get stock equal to 1% of outstanding shares at the time of the grant.\n\nHis interest in the company would grow to about 28% if the company's market capitalization grew by $600 billion.\n\nEach milestone in the plan includes expanding Tesla's market capitalization by $50 billion and meeting an aggressive revenue or pretax profit growth target. Musk stood to receive the full benefit of the pay plan, $55.8 billion, only if Tesla hit a market capitalization of $650 billion and unprecedented revenues and earnings within a decade.\n\nTo date, Tesla has achieved all 12 of the market capitalization milestones and 11 of the operational milestones, resulting in the vesting of 11 of the grant's 12 installments and providing Musk over $52.4B in stock option gains, according to the lawsuit. Since the grant was awarded, Tesla's market capitalization has increased from $59 billion to more than $690 billion, having briefly hit $1 trillion early this year.\n\nShares of Tesla Inc. have been battered this year, like all automakers, due to a mix of backed-up supply chains and soaring inflation.

Now, a stunning whistleblower disclosure from the company’s former security lead Peiter Zatko is almost certain to become the latest complication.\n\nAs part of a wide-ranging, nearly 200-page disclosure sent last month to US lawmakers and regulators, which was exclusively reported by CNN and the Washington Post Tuesday, Zatko alleges that Twitter (TWTR) has neither the incentive nor the resources to properly measure the full scope of bots on its platform. He also alleges that Twitter (TWTR) suffers from a range of other security vulnerabilities that it has for years failed to fix. (Twitter (TWTR) has broadly defended itself and criticized Zatko’s allegations as “riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies.”)\n\nMusk, who initially said he wanted to “defeat the spam bots” after buying Twitter, later raised alarms that the company might be significantly under-reporting the number of spam and fake accounts, although he had little apparent evidence beyond his own experience on the platform to support the claim. He has made the issue central to the legal fight over the $44 billion acquisition, even as Twitter argues Musk is simply attempting to get out of a deal for which he now has buyer’s remorse amid a market downturn.\n\nMany merger law experts have previously said Twitter had the stronger legal argument in the case. Experts have also said the success of Musk’s bot argument will likely come down to how closely the Delaware Chancery Court judge wants to focus the case on the specific language in the contract — which does not mention bots — versus allowing the billionaire’s more tangential arguments.\n\nBut the new disclosure could help bolster Musk’s argument and potentially encourage the court to pay closer attention to the bot issue. Moreover, Musk’s legal team could attempt to seize on other claims in the disclosure unrelated to bots — including allegations that Twitter made misrepresentations to regulators such as the Federal Trade Commission and Securities and Exchange Commission about its privacy and security practices — as additional reasons he should be able to walk away from the deal.\n\n“For years, across many public statements and [SEC] filings, Twitter has made material misrepresentations and omissions … regarding security, privacy and integrity,” Zatko’s disclosure states. “Twitter’s misrepresentations are especially impactful, given that they are directly at issue in Elon Musk’s contemplated takeover of the company.”\n\nZatko, better known as “Mudge,” is a prominent ethical hacker-turned-cybersecurity executive whose career also included stops at Google and the Department of Defense. He was hired as Twitter’s security lead following a major hack at the company in 2020 and fired in January of this year, a move he claims came after he tried to blow the whistle internally about security deficiencies and alleged possible fraud by the company’s senior leaders.\n\nPeiter Zatko, known as Mudge in the computer hacking community, poses for a portrait on August 22, 2022. Sarah Silbiger for CNN\n\nHis disclosure paints a picture of a company rife with security vulnerabilities that threaten user data and the platform’s functionality, and which he says could put US national security at risk. Zatko also alleges that Twitter’s top executives have misled users, regulators and even the company’s own board about the condition of its information security. “Please open an investigation into legal violations by Twitter,” the disclosure states.\n\nA Twitter spokesperson said in a statement to CNN in response to the disclosure that Zatko was fired for “ineffective leadership and poor performance.”\n\n“What we’ve seen so far is a false narrative about Twitter and our privacy and data security practices that is riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies and lacks important context,” the spokesperson said. “Mr. Zatko’s allegations and opportunistic timing appear designed to capture attention and inflict harm on Twitter, its customers and its shareholders. Security and privacy have long been company-wide priorities at Twitter and will continue to be.”\n\nTwitter CEO Parag Agrawal on Tuesday wrote an internal memo to employees, obtained by CNN, vowing to challenge the allegations in the disclosure and seeking to reassure employees, calling the allegations “frustrating and confusing to read.”\n\nWhile the disclosure could impact Twitter’s standing with regulators, users and even its board of directors, one of the most pressing immediate impacts could be on its case against Musk. After Musk last month moved to terminate the deal over allegations that Twitter has misstated the number of bots on the platform and failed to hand over information to help him evaluate the issue, Twitter filed a lawsuit accusing him of using bots as a pretext to exit the deal. Twitter has asked a court to compel him to follow through with the agreement, and the case is set to go to trial in the Delaware Chancery Court in October.\n\nOn Tuesday, after news of Zatko’s disclosure broke, Musk lawyer Alex Spiro said the billionaire’s legal team had already subpoenaed Zatko in the dispute with Twitter. “We found his exit and that of other key employees curious in light of what we have been finding,” Spiro told CNN.\n\nThe stakes of the legal dispute, and any impact the latest disclosures have on it, could not be higher for Twitter. The company is fighting to complete a deal to be acquired at a price significantly higher than its current market valuation, or else secure a billion-dollar breakup fee from Musk, and to do so as soon as possible to avoid a prolonged cloud of uncertainty for its business. Even prior to Musk’s involvement, Twitter had been struggling to expand its user base and grow its advertising business.\n\nZatko told CNN that his disclosure is unrelated to the acquisition, that he has no personal relationship with Musk and that he began documenting the concerns that would become his disclosure before there was any indication of Musk’s involvement with Twitter. Zatko says he holds as part of his broader stock portfolio, which includes shares in a number of individual companies, a small amount of Tesla (TSLA) shares acquired over the past 10 years, as well as a slightly larger stake in Twitter because his compensation plan there included stock. He told CNN he does not plan to touch either throughout the disclosure process.\n\nZatko began documenting his concerns about misleading statements made to Twitter’s board regarding security in December; Musk first reported his large stake in Twitter on April 4, before agreeing to acquire it later that month.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Twitter whistleblower was on CNN 22 years ago. Here's what he had to say 03:22 - Source: CNN\n\n‘No appetite’ to properly measure bots\n\nIn February 2019, Twitter announced it would start using a new metric to quantify the size of its audience when the company reported its financial results each quarter. The company, which had been facing a decline in users for several quarters, said it would shift from disclosing monthly active users — a metric commonly used by social media companies — to reporting monetizable daily active users (mDAU), a measure of the number of real users who could be shown an ad on the platform.\n\n“Our goal was not to disclose just the largest daily active user number we could,” Twitter said in a letter to shareholders at the time, adding that it felt the new metric would give advertisers a better sense of the value of ads placed on the platform. The metric also meant that the user numbers Twitter reported to shareholders — often a determining factor for a company’s share price — would be less likely to fluctuate if, for example, the company removed a large bot network comprising many accounts.\n\nSince making the switch, Twitter has reported that fake and spam accounts make up less than 5% of mDAUs, a figure it has repeated in its fight with Musk and one the billionaire has called into question. (Twitter has acknowledged in SEC filings that figure relies on significant judgement that may not accurately reflect reality.)\n\nMusk initially said in May that his deal to buy Twitter was “on hold,” and appeared to ask about the prevalence of bots as a percentage of total users. Agrawal responded in a tweet thread several days later, reiterating Twitter’s calculation that fake and spam accounts make up less than 5% of mDAU and defending the company’s measurement. In the disclosure, Zatko claims Agrawal was effectively answering a different question than Musk was asking, adding that most regular Twitter users and shareholders might not notice or understand the distinction between bots as a percentage of total users and bots as a percentage of mDAU.\n\nElon Musk spoke about his offer to purchase Twitter during an on-stage interview at a TED conference in Vancouver, Canada, on April 14. Ryan Lash/AFP/TED Conferences, LLC/Getty Images\n\nTwitter, Zatko’s disclosure claims, actually considers bots to be a part of a category of millions of “non-monetizable” users that it does not report. The 5% bots figure that Twitter shares publicly is essentially an estimate, based on human review, of the number of bots that slip through into the company’s automated count of monetizable daily active users, the disclosure states. So while Twitter’s 5% of mDAU bots figure may be useful in indicating to advertisers the number of fake accounts that might see but be unable to interact with their ads, the disclosure alleges that it does not reflect the full scope of fake and spam accounts on the platform.\n\nThe disclosure also points to another tweet in Agrawal’s May thread in which he stated that Twitter is “strongly incentivized to detect and remove as much spam as we possibly can, every single day.” Zatko alleges that, contrary to Agrawal’s statement, the company’s executives were instead incentivized by business pressures and bonus structures to grow mDAU, and in some cases did so at the expense of dedicating resources and attention to addressing the amount of spam on the platform.\n\nThe executive team, the board, the shareholders and the users all deserve an honest answer as to what it is that they are consuming as far as data and information and content on the platform.” Peiter \"Mudge\" Zatko\n\nZatko says he began asking about the prevalence of bot accounts on Twitter in early 2021, and was told by Twitter’s head of site integrity that the company didn’t know how many total bots are on its platform. (Twitter told CNN Zatko’s statement lacks necessary context.)\n\nZatko also alleges that he came away from conversations with the integrity team with the understanding that the company “had no appetite to properly measure the prevalence of bots,” in part because if the true number became public, it could harm the company’s value and image.\n\nTwitter’s systems to measure and remove bots also consist of “mostly outdated, unmonitored, simple scripts plus overworked, inefficient, understaffed and reactive human teams,” the disclosure states.\n\nExperts on inauthentic behavior online say it can be difficult to quantify bots because there isn’t a widely agreed upon definition of the term, because humans can sometimes be behind fake and spam accounts, and because bad actors constantly change their tactics. There are also many good bots on Twitter, such as automated accounts that tweet weather or news updates, and the platform offers opt-in labels for such accounts to identify themselves to users. But Zatko says he thinks there would still be value in attempting to better measure the full scale of spam, false or otherwise harmful automated accounts on the platform.\n\n“The executive team, the board, the shareholders and the users all deserve an honest answer as to what it is that they are consuming as far as data and information and content on the platform,” he told CNN in an interview earlier this month. “Your whole perception of the world is made from what you are seeing, reading and consuming online. And if you don’t have an understanding of what’s real, what’s not … yeah, I think this is pretty scary.”\n\nTwitter says that it allows bots on its platform, but its rules prohibit those that engage in spam or platform manipulation. But, as with all social media platforms’ rules, the challenge often lies in enforcing such policies.\n\nThe company says it regularly challenges, suspends and removes accounts engaged in spam and platform manipulation, including typically removing more than one million spam accounts each day. Twitter confirmed that the number of spam accounts as a percentage of mDAU is distinct from the total number of fake and spam accounts on the platform. But the company added that it believes the total number would not be useful because it could include accounts Twitter has already taken action on, and it does not believe it could catch all such accounts and thus the number would be a minimum count.\n\nIn the disclosure, Zatko alleges that without more context, it’s hard to fully understand the figures Twitter reports about taking down spam and fake accounts. The disclosure questions whether the number “is a lot or a little, for a platform as vast as Twitter? No one knows because there is no denominator provided for context.”\n\nTwitter did not respond to a request to provide the total number of accounts on the platform, or the average number of accounts added daily, as context around the bot removal figure.\n\nBots may not be the only issue\n\nMuch of the dispute between Twitter and Musk has focused on bots — an issue that legal experts have said may not be material to the deal even if Twitter was found to have misstated the numbers. But following the disclosure, Musk’s legal team could also choose to focus on some of Zatko’s other serious allegations.\n\nFor example, Zatko’s disclosure alleges that Twitter has lax security practices and a lack of emergency plans, which could threaten to take down the servers that keep the platform running, potentially permanently — a so-called “Black Swan” event that he claims nearly occurred in the spring of 2021.\n\n“Twitter has consistently misrepresented in SEC filings its capacity to recover from even a brief outage of only a few data centers,” according to the disclosure. The disclosure makes reference to the risk factors the company lists in its annual report, which states that it has a “disaster recovery program” in case of damage to its data centers. Zatko alleges that recovery program may not be “functional enough” to prevent a Black Swan event.\n\nTwitter has pushed back, saying the disclosure is \"riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies and lacks important context.\" Adobe Stock\n\nTwitter did not respond to specific questions about the risk of data center outages, but said it continuously invests in its teams and technology to ensure the platform’s security. And a source close to the matter told CNN that the platform had systems in place to address privacy, security and health-related risks for years before Zatko joined the company that have continued since his departure.\n\nThe disclosure also alleges that Twitter is in violation of a 2011 consent order that resulted from a lawsuit by the Federal Trade Commission, in which the company vowed to clean up its act around security and user data privacy. Zatko alleges that despite its claims to the contrary, Twitter executives are aware that the company has “never been in compliance” with the order.\n\nTwitter said it is in compliance with relevant privacy rules and that it has been transparent with regulators about its efforts to fix any shortcomings in its systems.\n\nThe disclosure also claims that some of the shortcomings Zatko identified while leading the company’s security could create issues that would constitute a “material adverse effect,” a legal term for a change in a company’s circumstances that would significantly reduce its value, and the sort of risk that could give Musk greater leverage to get out of the deal.\n\nThe disclosure points to a section in Twitter and Musk’s merger agreement in which the company affirmed it does not “infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate any Intellectual Property Rights of any other Person” in a way that would constitute a material adverse event. However, the disclosure alleges that Twitter has failed to obtain the appropriate licenses for the data it uses to train its artificial intelligence — which is used in key Twitter features such as the algorithm it relies on to rank what tweets users see.\n\n“Twitter senior leadership have known for years that the company has never held the proper licenses to the data sets and/or software used to build some of the key Machine Learning models used to run the service,” the disclosure states.\n\nThe acquisition agreement defines a material adverse effect as a change or event that has or would result in material harm to “the business, financial condition or results of operations of Twitter,” with several exceptions including those caused by economic or political conditions and “acts of God” such as terrorism, cyberattacks or data breaches. It would likely be up to a court to decide exactly what issues would fall under that classification. But the disclosure claims that litigation by any of the owners of the intellectual property used to train Twitter’s AI could result in “massive monetary damages” to Twitter or an injunction that could affect its ability to operate key products, which it alleges could constitute a material adverse effect.\n\n“Unless circumstances have changed since Mudge was fired in January, Twitter’s continued operation of many of its basic products is most likely unlawful,” the disclosure alleges.\n\nTwitter did not respond to questions about the allegation that it does not have the proper intellectual property rights for the data used to train its AI.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/08/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/23/tech/twitter-whistleblower-peiter-zatko-security/index.html", "title": "Twitter whistleblower Peiter \"Mudge\" Zatko raises concerns over ...", "text": "Twitter has major security problems that pose a threat to its own users’ personal information, to company shareholders, to national security, and to democracy, according to an explosive whistleblower disclosure obtained exclusively by CNN and The Washington Post.\n\nThe disclosure, sent last month to Congress and federal agencies, paints a picture of a chaotic and reckless environment at a mismanaged company that allows too many of its staff access to the platform’s central controls and most sensitive information without adequate oversight. It also alleges that some of the company’s senior-most executives have been trying to cover up Twitter’s serious vulnerabilities, and that one or more current employees may be working for a foreign intelligence service.\n\nThe whistleblower, who has agreed to be publicly identified, is Peiter “Mudge” Zatko, who was previously the company’s head of security, reporting directly to the CEO. Zatko further alleges that Twitter’s leadership has misled its own board and government regulators about its security vulnerabilities, including some that could allegedly open the door to foreign spying or manipulation, hacking and disinformation campaigns. The whistleblower also alleges Twitter does not reliably delete users’ data after they cancel their accounts, in some cases because the company has lost track of the information, and that it has misled regulators about whether it deletes the data as it is required to do. The whistleblower also says Twitter executives don’t have the resources to fully understand the true number of bots on the platform, and were not motivated to. Bots have recently become central to Elon Musk’s attempts to back out of a $44 billion deal to buy the company (although Twitter denies Musk’s claims).\n\nZatko was fired by Twitter (TWTR) in January for what the company claims was poor performance. According to Zatko, his public whistleblowing comes after he attempted to flag the security lapses to Twitter (TWTR)’s board and to help Twitter (TWTR) fix years of technical shortcomings and alleged non-compliance with an earlier privacy agreement with the Federal Trade Commission. Zatko is being represented by Whistleblower Aid, the same group that represented Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen.\n\nJohn Tye, founder of Whistleblower Aid and Zatko’s lawyer, told CNN that Zatko has not been in contact with Musk, and said Zatko began the whistleblower process before there was any indication of Musk’s involvement with Twitter.\n\nAfter this article was initially published, Alex Spiro, an attorney for Musk, told CNN, “We have already issued a subpoena for Mr. Zatko, and we found his exit and that of other key employees curious in light of what we have been finding.”\n\nCNN sought comment from Twitter on more than 50 specific questions regarding the disclosure.\n\nIn a statement, a Twitter spokesperson told CNN that security and privacy are both longtime priorities for the company. Twitter also said the company provides clear tools for users to control privacy, ad targeting and data sharing, and added that it has created internal workflows to ensure users know that when they cancel their accounts, Twitter will deactivate the accounts and start a deletion process. Twitter declined to say whether it typically completes the process.\n\n“Mr. Zatko was fired from his senior executive role at Twitter in January 2022 for ineffective leadership and poor performance,” the Twitter spokesperson said. “What we’ve seen so far is a false narrative about Twitter and our privacy and data security practices that is riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies and lacks important context. Mr. Zatko’s allegations and opportunistic timing appear designed to capture attention and inflict harm on Twitter, its customers and its shareholders. Security and privacy have long been company-wide priorities at Twitter and will continue to be.”\n\nSome of Zatko’s most damning claims spring from his apparently tense relationship with Parag Agrawal, the company’s former chief technology officer who was made CEO after Jack Dorsey stepped down last November. According to the disclosure, Agrawal and his lieutenants repeatedly discouraged Zatko from providing a full accounting of Twitter’s security problems to the company’s board of directors. The company’s executive team allegedly instructed Zatko to provide an oral report of his initial findings on the company’s security condition to the board rather than a detailed written account, ordered Zatko to knowingly present cherry-picked and misrepresented data to create the false perception of progress on urgent cybersecurity issues, and went behind Zatko’s back to have a third-party consulting firm’s report scrubbed to hide the true extent of the company’s problems.\n\nThe disclosure is generally much kinder to Dorsey, who hired Zatko and whom Zatko believes wanted to see the problems within the company fixed. But it does depict him as extremely disengaged in his final months leading Twitter – so much so that some senior staff even considered the possibility he was sick.\n\nCNN has reached out to Dorsey for comment. A person familiar with Zatko’s tenure at Twitter told CNN the company investigated several claims he brought forward around the time he was fired, and ultimately found them unpersuasive; the person added that Zatko at times lacked understanding of Twitter’s FTC obligations.\n\nZatko believes his firing was in retaliation for his sounding the alarm about the company’s security problems.\n\nThe scathing disclosure, which totals around 200 pages, including supporting exhibits – was sent last month to a number of US government agencies and congressional committees, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice. The existence and details of the disclosure have not previously been reported. CNN obtained a copy of the disclosure from a senior Democratic aide on Capitol Hill. The SEC, DOJ and FTC declined to comment; the Senate Intelligence Committee, which received a copy of the report, is taking the disclosure seriously and is setting a meeting to discuss the allegations, according to Rachel Cohen, a committee spokesperson.\n\nSen. Dick Durbin, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee and also received the report, vowed to investigate “and take further steps as needed to get to the bottom of these alarming allegations.”\n\nThe claims I’ve received from a Twitter whistleblower raise serious national security concerns. Sen. Chuck Grassley, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley, the same panel’s top Republican and an avid Twitter user, also expressed deep concerns about the allegations in a statement to CNN.\n\n“Take a tech platform that collects massive amounts of user data, combine it with what appears to be an incredibly weak security infrastructure and infuse it with foreign state actors with an agenda, and you’ve got a recipe for disaster,” Grassley said. “The claims I’ve received from a Twitter whistleblower raise serious national security concerns as well as privacy issues, and they must be investigated further.”\n\nThe FTC should investigate the claims, and impose fines and individual liability on specific Twitter executives if a probe finds they were responsible for security lapses, Sen. Richard Blumenthal wrote to the agency in a letter on Tuesday obtained by CNN.\n\nThe letter by Blumenthal — who chairs the Senate subcommittee on consumer protection — highlights the pressure Twitter now faces from Washington as a result of the disclosure.\n\n“If the Commission does not vigorously oversee and enforce its orders, they will not be taken seriously and these dangerous breaches will continue,” Blumenthal wrote.\n\nZatko may be eligible for a monetary award from the US government as a result of his whistleblower activities. “Original, timely and credible information that leads to a successful enforcement action” by the SEC can earn whistleblowers up to a 30% cut of agency fines related to the action if the penalties amount to more than $1 million, the SEC has said. The SEC has awarded more than $1 billion to nearly 300 whistleblowers since 2012.\n\nTye told CNN that Zatko filed his disclosure to the SEC “to help the agency enforce the laws,” and to gain federal whistleblower protections. “The prospect of a reward was not a factor in Mudge’s decision, and in fact he didn’t even know about the reward program when he decided to become a lawful whistleblower.”\n\nThe Whistleblower\n\nZatko first came to national attention in 1998 when he took part in the first congressional hearings on cybersecurity.\n\n“All my life, I’ve been about finding places where I can go and make a difference. I’ve done that through the security field. That’s my main lever,” he told CNN in an interview earlier this month.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Twitter whistleblower was on CNN 22 years ago. Here's what he had to say 03:22 - Source: CNN\n\nThe events leading to his decision to become a whistleblower began before he worked at Twitter, with a devastating hack in 2020 in which the Twitter accounts of some of the world’s most famous people, including then-presidential candidate Joe Biden, former President Barack Obama, Kim Kardashian and Musk, were compromised. Twitter told CNN that in response to the incident, the company began compartmentalizing access to customer support tools.\n\nAfter the attack, Dorsey recruited Zatko, a well-known “ethical hacker” turned cybersecurity insider and executive who previously held senior roles at Google, Stripe and the US Department of Defense, and who told CNN that he’d been offered a senior, day-one cyber position in the Biden administration.\n\nZatko, center, was among a group of hackers who testified before Congress on cybersecurity in 1998. Douglas Graham/CQ-Roll Call, Inc./Congressional Quarterly/Getty Images\n\nWhat Zatko says he found was a company with extraordinarily poor security practices, including giving thousands of the company’s employees — amounting to roughly half the company’s workforce — access to some of the platform’s critical controls. His disclosure describes his overall findings as “egregious deficiencies, negligence, willful ignorance, and threats to national security and democracy.”\n\nAfter the January 6 insurrection, Zatko was concerned about the possibility someone within Twitter who sympathized with the insurrectionists could try to manipulate the company’s platform, according to his disclosure. He sought to clamp down on internal access that allows Twitter engineers to make changes to the platform, known as the “production environment.”\n\nBut, the disclosure says, Zatko soon learned “it was impossible to protect the production environment. All engineers had access. There was no logging of who went into the environment or what they did…. Nobody knew where data lived or whether it was critical, and all engineers had some form of critical access to the production environment.” Twitter also lacked the ability to hold workers accountable for information security lapses because it has little control or visibility into employees’ individual work computers, Zatko claims, citing internal cybersecurity reports estimating that 4 in 10 devices do not meet basic security standards.\n\nTwitter’s flimsy server infrastructure is a separate yet equally serious vulnerability, the disclosure claims. About half of the company’s 500,000 servers run on outdated software that does not support basic security features such as encryption for stored data or regular security updates by vendors, according to the letter to regulators and a February email Zatko wrote to Patrick Pichette, a Twitter board member, that is included in the disclosure.\n\n[I]t was impossible to protect the production environment. All engineers had access. There was no logging of who went into the environment or what they did. From Zatko's disclosure\n\nThe company also lacks sufficient redundancies and procedures to restart or recover from data center crashes, Zatko’s disclosure says, meaning that even minor outages of several data centers at the same time could knock the entire Twitter service offline, perhaps for good.\n\nTwitter did not respond to questions about the risk of data center outages, but told CNN that people on Twitter’s engineering and product teams are authorized to access the production environment if they have a specific business justification for doing so. Twitter’s employees use devices overseen by other IT and security teams with the power to prevent a device from connecting to sensitive internal systems if it is running outdated software, Twitter added.\n\nThe company also said it uses automated checks to ensure laptops running outdated software cannot access the production environment, and that employees may only make changes to Twitter’s live product after the code meets certain record-keeping and review requirements.\n\nTwitter has internal security tools that are tested by the company regularly, and every two years by external auditors, according to the person familiar with Zatko’s tenure at the company. The person added that some of Zatko’s statistics surrounding device security lacked credibility and were derived by a small team that did not properly account for Twitter’s existing security procedures.\n\nBut Twitter’s security concerns had come to light prior to 2020. In 2010, the FTC filed a complaint against Twitter for its mishandling of users’ private information and the issue of too many employees having access to Twitter’s central controls. The complaint resulted in an FTC consent order finalized the following year in which Twitter vowed to clean up its act, including by creating and maintaining “a comprehensive information security program.”\n\nZatko alleges that despite the company’s claims to the contrary, it had “never been in compliance” with what the FTC demanded more than 10 years ago. As a result of its alleged failures to address vulnerabilities raised by the FTC as well as other deficiencies, he says, Twitter suffers an “anomalously high rate of security incidents,” approximately one per week serious enough to require disclosure to government agencies. “Based on my professional experience, peer companies do not have this magnitude or volume of incidents,” Zatko wrote in a February letter to Twitter’s board after he was fired by Twitter in January.\n\nThe stakes of Zatko’s disclosure are enormous. It could lead to billions of dollars in new fines for Twitter if it’s found to have violated its legal obligations, according to Jon Leibowitz, who was chair of the FTC at the time of Twitter’s original 2011 consent order.\n\nThe agency now has another opportunity to show the tech industry it is serious about holding platforms accountable, Leibowitz added, after officials opted not to name top Facebook execs including Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg in the FTC’s $5 billion privacy settlement with that company in 2019.\n\n[I]f there’s a violation here — and that’s a big if — then I think the FTC should very seriously consider not just fining the corporation but also putting the executives responsible under order. Jon Leibowitz, former chair of the FTC\n\n“One of the big disappointments in the Facebook order violation case was that the FTC let executives off the hook; they should’ve been named,” Leibowitz told CNN in an interview. “And if there’s a violation here — and that’s a big if — then I think the FTC should very seriously consider not just fining the corporation but also putting the executives responsible under order.”\n\nTwitter told CNN its FTC compliance record speaks for itself, citing third-party audits filed to the agency under the 2011 consent order in which it said Zatko did not participate. Twitter also said it is in compliance with relevant privacy rules and that it has been transparent with regulators about its efforts to fix any shortcomings in its systems.\n\nZatko’s allegations are based in part on a failure to grasp how Twitter’s existing programs and processes work to fulfill Twitter’s FTC obligations, the person familiar with his tenure told CNN, saying that misunderstanding has prompted him to make inaccurate claims about the company’s level of compliance.\n\nForeign threats\n\nTwitter is exceptionally vulnerable to foreign government exploitation in ways that undermine US national security, and the company may even have foreign spies currently on its payroll, the disclosure alleges.\n\nThe whistleblower report says the US government provided specific evidence to Twitter shortly before Zatko’s firing that at least one of its employees, perhaps more, were working for another government’s intelligence service. The report does not say whether Twitter was already aware or if it subsequently acted on the tip.\n\nParag Agrawal, Twitter's former chief technology officer, was made CEO after Jack Dorsey stepped down last November. Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n\nLast year, prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Agrawal — then Twitter’s chief technology officer — proposed to Zatko that Twitter comply with Russian demands that could result in broad-based censorship or surveillance of the platform, Zatko alleges.\n\nThe disclosure does not provide details of Agrawal’s suggestion. Last summer, however, Russia passed a law pressuring tech platforms to open local offices in the country or face potential advertising bans, a move western security experts said was intended to give Russia greater leverage over US tech companies.\n\nWhile Agrawal’s suggestion was ultimately discarded, it was still an alarming sign of how far Twitter was willing to go in pursuit of growth, according to Zatko.\n\n“The fact that Twitter’s current CEO even suggested Twitter become complicit with the Putin regime is cause for concern about Twitter’s effects on U.S. national security,” Zatko’s disclosure says.\n\nThe fact that Twitter’s current CEO even suggested Twitter become complicit with the Putin regime is cause for concern about Twitter’s effects on US national security, From Zatko's disclosure\n\nZatko’s report is becoming public just two weeks after a former Twitter manager was convicted of spying for Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe Saudi case underscores the gravity of the allegations Zatko now levels at Twitter. His report could further inflame bipartisan concerns in Washington about foreign adversaries and the cybersecurity threats they pose to Americans, ranging from the theft of US citizens’ data to manipulating US voters or stealing technology and trade secrets.\n\nTwitter did not respond to specific questions about its alleged foreign intelligence vulnerabilities.\n\nThe Musk element\n\nZatko’s disclosure comes at a particularly fortuitous moment for Musk, who is engaged in a legal battle with Twitter over his attempt to back out of buying the company. Musk has accused Twitter of lying about the number of spam bots on its platform, an issue that he claims should let him terminate the deal.\n\nWhile the binding acquisition agreement that Musk signed with Twitter in April did not include any bot-related exemptions, the billionaire claims that the number of bots on the platform affect the user experience and that having more bots than previously known could therefore impact the company’s long-term value. After Musk moved to terminate the purchase, Twitter responded with a lawsuit alleging that he is using bots as a pretext to get out of a deal over which he now has buyers’ remorse following the recent market downturn, and asking a court to force him to close the deal. The case is set to go to trial in Delaware Chancery Court in October.\n\nTwitter employees walk by the company's headquarters in San Francisco. Glenn Chapman/AFP/Getty Images\n\nUser numbers are vital information for any social media business, as advertising revenue depends on how many people could potentially see an ad. But figures about how many users a service has, or how many people actually view a given ad on a site, are notoriously unreliable throughout the tech and media industries due to manipulation and error.\n\nAlone among social media companies, Twitter reports its user numbers to investors and advertisers using a measurement it calls monetizable daily active users, or mDAUs. Its rivals simply count and report all active users; until 2019, Twitter had worked that way as well. But that meant Twitter’s figures were subject to significant swings in certain situations, including takedowns of major bot networks. So Twitter switched to mDAUs, which it says counts all users that could be shown an advertisement on Twitter – leaving all accounts that for some reason can’t, for instance because they’re known to be bots, in a separate bucket, according to Zatko’s disclosure.\n\nThe company has repeatedly reported that less than 5% of its mDAUs are fake or spam accounts, and a person familiar with the matter both affirmed that assessment to CNN this week and pointed to other investor disclosures saying the figure relies on significant judgement that may not accurately reflect reality. But Zatko’s disclosure argues that by reporting bots only as a percentage of mDAU, rather than as a percentage of the total number of accounts on the platform, Twitter obscures the true scale of fake and spam accounts on the service, a move Zatko alleges is deliberately misleading.\n\nZatko says he began asking about the prevalence of bot accounts on Twitter in early 2021, and was told by Twitter’s head of site integrity that the company didn’t know how many total bots are on its platform. He alleges that he came away from conversations with the integrity team with the understanding that the company “had no appetite to properly measure the prevalence of bots,” in part because if the true number became public, it could harm the company’s value and image.\n\nJack Dorsey reached out and asked me to come and perform a critical task at Twitter. I signed on to do it and believe I’m still performing that mission. Peiter \"Mudge\" Zatko, former Twitter head of security\n\nExperts on inauthentic behavior online say it can be difficult to quantify “bots” because there isn’t a widely agreed upon definition of the term, and because bad actors constantly change their tactics. There are also many harmless bots on Twitter (and across the internet), such as automated news accounts, and Twitter offers an opt-in feature to allow such accounts to transparently label themselves as automated. Twitter told CNN that the claim it doesn’t know how many bots are on its platform lacks context, reiterating that not all bots are bad and adding that to focus on the total number of bots on Twitter would include those the company may have already identified and taken action against. The company also does not believe it can catch every spam account on the platform, Twitter said, which is why it reports its less-than-5% figure, which reflects a manual estimate, in its financial filings.\n\nBut Zatko told CNN he thinks there would still be value in attempting to measure the total number of spam, false or otherwise potentially harmful automated accounts on the platform. “The executive team, the board, the shareholders and the users all deserve an honest answer as to what it is that they are consuming as far as data and information and content [on the platform … At least from my point of view, I want to invest in a company where I know what’s actually going on because I want to invest strategically in the long-term value of an organization,” he said.\n\nTwitter says that it allows bots on its platform, but its rules prohibit those that engage in spam or platform manipulation. But, as with all social media platforms’ rules, the challenge often lies in enforcing its policies.\n\nElon Musk is engaged in a legal battle with Twitter over his attempt to back out of buying the company. Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe company says it regularly challenges, suspends and removes accounts engaged in spam and platform manipulation, including typically removing more than one million spam accounts each day. Twitter said the total number of bots on the platform is not a useful number. The company declined to answer questions about the total number of accounts on the platform or the average number of new accounts added on the platform daily as context around its daily bot deletion figure.\n\nBut in casting doubt on Twitter’s ability to estimate the true number of fake and spam accounts, Zatko’s allegations could provide ammunition to Musk’s central claim that the figure is much higher than Twitter has publicly reported.\n\nBy going public, Zatko says, he believes he is doing the job he was hired to do for a platform he says is critical to democracy. “Jack Dorsey reached out and asked me to come and perform a critical task at Twitter. I signed on to do it and believe I’m still performing that mission,” he said.", "authors": ["Donie O'Sullivan Clare Duffy Brian Fung Cnn Business Video John General Zach Wasser Logan Whiteside", "Donie O'Sullivan", "Clare Duffy", "Brian Fung", "Zach Wasser", "Logan Whiteside"], "publish_date": "2022/08/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/13/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html", "title": "Premarket stocks: Tesla is trying an old trick to boost its stock.

You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link.\n\nNew York CNN Business —\n\nIn recent years, when a company announced it was splitting its stock, Wall Street went wild. When Tesla (TSLA) revealed such plans in 2020, its shares immediately shot up. They climbed 66% over the following 12 months.\n\nBut as concerns about the Federal Reserve, inflation and the economy plague investors, those days may be over.\n\nTesla announced Friday that it will ask investors to split its shares 3-to-1 at its annual meeting in August. But the stock barely moved after hours Friday and is sliding in premarket trading Monday. Shares are down more than 30% since the company first teased a stock split in late March.\n\nIn the case of a 5-to-1 split, someone who owned one share priced at $100 would instead receive five worth $20 apiece. A 3-to-1 split would dole out three shares worth $33.33.\n\nThat may not sound like a big deal. Yet in the past, it’s helped drive demand, since it makes shares more accessible to everyday investors.\n\nIt also makes it more likely that companies will be included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which tends to include less expensive stocks. Apple announced a 7-for-1 stock split in 2014 and joined the Dow in 2015.\n\nIn the current market environment, it’s hard to get anyone excited about Tesla or many of its fast-growing peers. Amazon’s 20-for-1 stock split took effect last Monday. Its shares are still down 25% year-to-date. Alphabet, which owns Google, will split its shares 20-for-1 in July. The stock has fallen 23% this year.\n\nThese three companies all took a beating on Friday after government data showed that US consumer prices are rising at the fastest rate in 40 years. The Consumer Price Index leaped 8.6% for the 12 months ending in May.\n\nThat rounded out the S&P 500’s worst week since January. The concern is that higher inflation will push the Federal Reserve to be more aggressive in hiking interest rates. When rates rise, it hurts stocks like Tesla, whose prices are tied to expectations for longer-term growth and earning potential.\n\nTesla has already seen tons of money wiped off its valuation this year. In January, it was worth $1.15 trillion. Now its market value is $722 billion.\n\nCEO Elon Musk’s recent warning that he has a “super bad feeling” about the economy, combined with confusion over whether he plans to cut jobs at the automaker, hasn’t helped. Federal investigators also said last week that they’re expanding their probe of Teslas that have slammed into parked first responders’ vehicles.\n\nAt some point, Wall Street’s bargain hunters may enter the scene, putting a floor under stocks that have been hit hard by the recent sell-off. But this moment hasn’t arrived yet — even with stock splits on the table.\n\n$5 gas has arrived. Is $6 around the corner\n\nOver the weekend, the national average price for a gallon of regular gasoline hit $5 for the first time as drivers brace for a painful summer at the pump.\n\nGas prices have been rising steadily for the last eight weeks. The latest milestone, achieved Saturday, marked the 15th straight day that the AAA reading notched a record.\n\nThe average price of a gallon of gas was $4.42 one month ago and $3.08 a year ago. But the pandemic and the war in Ukraine have strained energy supplies, sending prices surging.\n\nRising fuel costs are a big part of the reason inflation in America is rising at such a fast clip. Energy prices in the year to May skyrocketed almost 35%, according to the data released Friday.\n\nThat’s feeding concerns about whether consumers could become more frugal, which would drag down the economy. Consumer confidence hit a record low on Friday, according to a survey by the University of Michigan.\n\nGas prices are unlikely to stop climbing. As the summer travel season gets underway, demand for gasoline will jump. And while some oil producers have promised to ramp up supply, it’s unlikely to make up for shortfalls as Western traders wean themselves off Russian crude.\n\nThe US national average for gasoline could be close to $6 later this summer, according to Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for the Oil Price Information Service.\n\n“Anything goes from June 20 to Labor Day,” he said last week about the demand for gas as people hit the road for long-anticipated getaways. “Come hell or high gas prices, people are going to take vacations.”\n\nThe highest statewide average price is in California. It stood at $6.43 a gallon on Saturday\n\nThere really are more weddings this year\n\nScrolling through social media lately, I’ve had to wonder: Are more people getting married this year?\n\nSignet Jewelers, which recently reported quarterly earnings, has a clear answer: Yes.\n\nThe world’s largest retailer of diamond jewelry said that weddings are at a 40-year high after a lull because of the coronavirus.\n\n“We’ve seen an increase in wedding bands, anniversary bands, bridal party jewelry, gifts for the bride and groom, those kinds of things,” Signet’s CEO told analysts.\n\nThe company said it’s working hard to persuade people who come in to buy engagement rings to return for their wedding bands. Engagements are expected to bounce back to their pre-pandemic level this year, according to Signet.\n\nShares jumped last week after the company beat Wall Street’s earnings expectations. But they’re down more than 20% year-to-date as diamond prices spike.\n\nUp next\n\nOracle (ORCL) reports results after US markets close.", "authors": ["Julia Horowitz"], "publish_date": "2022/06/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/25/tech/twitter-lawsuit-us-government/index.html", "title": "Twitter agrees to pay millions in fines after US government alleges ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nTwitter has agreed to pay $150 million in fines after the US government sued the social media company on Wednesday, alleging that it misled consumers about how it protects their personal data.\n\nAccording to the federal lawsuit, Twitter failed to tell its users for years that it used their contact information to help marketers target their advertising — in violation of a 2011 privacy settlement with the Federal Trade Commission.\n\n“This practice affected more than 140 million Twitter users, while boosting Twitter’s primary source of revenue,” FTC Chair Lina Khan said in a statement.\n\nTwitter said Wednesday that the use of the personal information for ads was “inadvertent,” and that the incident was first disclosed in 2019.\n\n“This issue was addressed as of September 17, 2019, and today we want to reiterate the work we’ll continue to do to protect the privacy and security of the people who use Twitter,” Damien Kieran, Twitter’s chief privacy officer, wrote in a blog post. “Keeping data secure and respecting privacy is something we take extremely seriously, and we have cooperated with the FTC every step of the way. In reaching this settlement, we have paid a $150M USD penalty, and we have aligned with the agency on operational updates and program enhancements to ensure that people’s personal data remains secure and their privacy protected.”\n\nWednesday’s suit, filed by the FTC and the Justice Department in the US District Court for the Northern District of California, marks the latest headache for Twitter amid a tumultuous acquisition process by billionaire Elon Musk and a personnel shakeup at the company that has led to multiple senior employees’ departure.\n\nIn its alleged misconduct, Twitter only ever told users that their phone numbers and email addresses were being used for account security purposes, but failed to mention advertising, according to a copy of the complaint viewed by CNN.\n\n“From at least May 2013 until at least September 2019, Twitter misrepresented to users of its online communication service the extent to which it maintained and protected the security and privacy of their nonpublic contact information,” the complaint said.\n\nThe complaint also alleges that Twitter’s conduct violates the terms of a 2011 settlement stemming from two hacking incidents that resulted in the attackers gaining administrative privileges on the platform. Under the settlement, Twitter was barred from misleading the public about how it protects consumer data. Violations of the agreement can lead to fines.\n\n“Twitter’s misrepresentations violate the FTC Act and the 2011 Order, which specifically prohibits the company from making misrepresentations regarding the security of nonpublic consumer information,” the complaint said.\n\nIn addition to the $150 million penalty, the new proposed agreement between Twitter and the FTC to settle Wednesday’s allegations also bars the company from profiting off of what the FTC described as “deceptively collected data” and to allow for user authentication methods other than phone numbers, such as multi-factor authentication apps. The company will also be required to inform users about its failure to disclose its alleged practice of using contact information for advertising purposes.\n\nWednesday’s settlement must still be approved by the court.", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/05/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/15/business/tesla-fsd-california-dmv/index.html", "title": "Tesla's 'full self-driving' feature may have finally met its match | CNN ...", "text": "Washington, DC CNN —\n\n“Full self-driving,” the controversially named driver-assist feature from Tesla, may have finally met its match.\n\nTesla’s foil isn’t a silver-haired US Senator, world-class autonomous driving experts, or some of the country’s preeminent safety advocates. They’ve all warned that “full self-driving” isn’t really full self-driving. The technology is designed to navigate local roads with steering, braking and acceleration, but it requires an attentive human driver who’s ready to take control and correct the system, which “may do the wrong thing at the worst time,” Tesla warns.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Elon Musk wants to end traffic. The company he built to do it may not deliver 02:06 - Source: CNN\n\nBut while these critics may have the traditional bully pulpit of the Senate or other institutions, they have no real power to change any policy on their own. An actual impact may instead come from an unglamorous public agency, one that many Americans think of as only capable of offering customers long wait times: the Department of Motor Vehicles. The California DMV has become the first US government entity to formally move against the naming of “full self-driving.”\n\nAutomotive regulation has traditionally fallen to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, part of the Department of Transportation, and Congress, which can push NHTSA to regulate specific things like driver-assist technology. But NHTSA and Congress have spent recent years swept away in the excitement and lobbying surrounding a more eye-catching technology — fully autonomous vehicles.\n\nNHTSA has even exempted some robotaxis from its safety standards, and described many potential benefits of these technologies, including improved quality of life, safer roads, shorter commutes, lower energy usage and more access to jobs. It’s claimed in the past that leaving “breathing room for innovation” led to the development of technologies like air bags. Self-driving cars and trucks could, in theory, revolutionize transportation and save millions of lives if crashes become rarer, as supporters of the technology have predicted.\n\nCalifornia's DMV appears poised to take action on Tesla's \"full self-driving.\" Santiago Mejia/San Francisco Chronicle/Getty Images\n\nThe US House of Representatives passed a law related to self-driving cars. It hasn’t acted on the more pedestrian driver-assist technologies.\n\nNHTSA has no standards for these systems, which has effectively left automakers like Tesla to decide what’s safe enough. But there are strong signs in the last year that NHTSA is shifting some of its attention to driver-assist technologies. It announced last summer, for instance, that automakers must report driver-assist crashes.\n\nNHTSA has also cited its powers to protect the public from motor vehicle risks that it received when created in 1970.\n\n“Given the rapid evolution of these technologies and testing of new technologies and features on publicly accessible roads, it is critical for NHTSA to exercise its robust oversight over potential safety defects,” it said.\n\nNHTSA has even taken steps toward standards for one driver-assist feature, automatic emergency braking. But the first major regulatory impact may be from that unlikely candidate, the California Department of Motor Vehicles.\n\nMost Americans’ interactions with their own state DMV is limited to dreary, underfunded offices with long lines and beleaguered staff. Most people are there to fill out forms and pay fees for various bureaucratic duties that the agency undertakes.\n\nBut that is not the entirety of the California DMV.\n\nIt has long been a leader in regulating autonomous vehicles, largely due to the fact many companies developing autonomous vehicles are based in California. It released its own rules for testing autonomous vehicles in 2015, and hasn’t backed down from conflict.\n\nUber provoked the DMV in 2017 when it tested autonomous vehicles in San Francisco without a required DMV permit. The DMV revoked Uber’s vehicles’ registrations in response, and Uber pulled its cars from San Francisco streets. (Uber fled to the looser regulations of Arizona, but was kicked out of the state in 2018 after one of its test vehicles was involved in a high-profile fatal crash. It then sold its robotaxi business in 2020.)\n\nNow, the California DMV is flexing the type of muscle that could force Tesla to drop the name “full self-driving,” according to autonomous driving experts.\n\nThe DMV recently filed a complaint that says Tesla’s description of its driver-assist technologies, Autopilot and “full self-driving,” is deceptive and grounds for suspending or revoking its license to sell motor vehicles in the state. The risk of losing such a license may force Tesla’s hand. The automaker was founded in California, it’s made most of its cars in California, and its vehicles are among the best-selling in California. “Full self-driving” is even designed to be at its best in California’s San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nTesla’s use of the words “full self-driving” and “Autopilot,” as well as its descriptors of the technology on its website, suggest the vehicles are autonomous, when they aren’t, the DMV says in its complaint.\n\nTesla has long qualified the limits of its systems with disclaimers. But the DMV says in its complaint that one Tesla disclaimer “contradicts the original untrue or misleading labels and claims, which is misleading, and does not cure the violation.”\n\nIt’s unclear how Tesla and the DMV’s differences might be resolved, and the conflict could include lengthy litigation.\n\nA settlement could include changes to how Tesla talks about the systems on its website, a promise to avoid similar behavior in the future, or even new names for its products, according to Bryant Walker Smith, a professor at the University of South Carolina law school who researches autonomous vehicles.\n\n“Full self-driving describes a system that is used by a driver. That’s making me dizzy,” Smith said. “How can a driver use a full self-driving system?”\n\nTesla claimed in 2016 that all its new vehicles had the hardware capability for “full self-driving,” and it would soon offer complementary software for the cars to drive themselves. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said every year from 2015 to 2022 that self-driving Teslas were probably a year or two away. Tesla has released a beta version of “full self-driving” to more than 100,000 drivers, but the software requires constant vigilance as it sometimes makes dangerous decisions.\n\nThis is not the first fight over this type of language. A German court ruled in 2020 that Tesla’s language was misleading, which the automaker appealed last year.\n\nWaymo chose to stop using the term \"self-driving\" and refers to its vehicles as fully autonomous. Andrej Sokolow/dpa/picture alliance/Getty Images\n\nWaymo, the self-driving subsidiary of Google’s parent company, stopped using the term “self-driving” in 2021, saying that misuse by other automakers was giving the public a false impression of its capabilities. Waymo began referring to its robotaxis as “fully autonomous.” Waymo, which operates robotaxis in the Phoenix area, does not need a human in the driver’s seat to ensure safe operation.\n\nThe California DMV’s actions are officially limited to the state, but the impact could be much greater. It’s routine for California to lead on regulations and for other states to follow, such as vehicle emission standards. California’s large population makes tailoring vehicles just for that state too expensive for most automakers.\n\n“Once you talk about one state investigating, you could talk about 50 states potentially investigating,” said Smith, adding that it will become easier politically and factually. “They’re not putting their necks out.”\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment.", "authors": ["Matt Mcfarland"], "publish_date": "2022/08/15"}]}

Gov. Kay Ivey on Friday signed into law the $1.3 billion construction plan to build two 4,000-bed prisons and a new prison for women and to renovate other facilities. The plan taps $400 million from the American Rescue Plan – money the state has already received – and could steer the construction contracts toward companies that previously qualified for the work. Those include Birmingham-based construction giant BL Harbert International and Montgomery-based Caddell Construction. Caddell and BL Harbert are expected to be the main contractors for the two prisons, Republican state Sen. Greg Albritton said. Lawmakers said working with those companies will allow the state to incorporate prior work. “This is going to enable us to start these projects 12 months in advance, and time is money,” said the bill’s sponsor, Republican Rep. Steve Clouse. Officials will have the money to start construction after lawmakers approved $400 million in coronavirus funds and another $150 million from the state’s general fund, in addition to agreeing to borrow $785 million through a bond issue.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A Canadian mining company has been looking for precious metals on Chichagof Island in southeast Alaska. Millrock Resources, a Vancouver, British Columbia-based company, several years ago applied to the U.S. Forest Service for drilling permits to renew exploration on claims that once made up the historic Apex and El Nido gold mines. However, the exploration never happened. CEO Gregory Beischer said the company wasn’t able to secure financing. The mines produced precious metals in the early 20th century. Some exploration resumed in the 1980s. “But it really has been dormant since the mining activity took place in the ’20s and ’30s,” Beischer told CoastAlaska. Millrock has formed a partnership with another company, which has allowed it to take soil samples on claims less than 3 miles from Pelican, a community with fewer than 100 year-round residents. The operator of Kensington Mine north of Juneau, which is a subsidiary of Coeur Mining, invested about $200,000 for a small team of geologists based in Pelican. Beischer said soil sample results are pending. But he said geologists hope they will show that gold-bearing quartz veins continue down the mountain. Taking soil samples doesn’t require permits, according to state and federal regulators.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: U.S. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema said Monday that activists who confronted her outside an Arizona State University classroom and filmed her inside a restroom were not engaging in “legitimate protest.” The Democratic senator said the immigration reform activists unlawfully entered the suburban Phoenix campus building, which was only open to ASU students and faculty, and recorded her and her students. Sinema, a former social worker, is a lecturer at ASU’s School of Social Work. “In the 19 years I have been teaching at ASU, I have been committed to creating a safe and intellectually challenging environment for my students,” Sinema said. “Yesterday, that environment was breached. My students were unfairly and unlawfully victimized.” Living United for Change in Arizona posted video of the Sunday encounter on social media. The video showed LUCHA members chastising Sinema on accusations that she did not adequately support expectations of a pathway to citizenship for people in the country illegally and has not been supportive enough of President Joe Biden’s $3.5 trillion infrastructure proposal. LUCHA said its members were forced to confront Sinema at ASU because she has been inaccessible. Sinema said in her statement she has met with the group multiple times since she was elected to the Senate.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state Senate has advanced a measure that would require an exemption process for workers who face a COVID-19 vaccine mandate from their employers. The vote Monday came during a special session that was called to redraw the state’s congressional maps. The measure from Sen. Kim Hammer, R-Benton, says any employer that mandates the vaccines must also offer an exemption process that includes coronavirus testing or proof of antibodies. If enacted, the requirement would end July 31, 2023, unless extended by lawmakers. Republican lawmakers have filed numerous bills targeting vaccine mandates for the special session, which began last week. The proposals are primarily in response to President Joe Biden’s order requiring workers at businesses with at least 100 employees to get vaccinated or tested regularly. The discussion about vaccine requirements comes as coronavirus cases continue to decrease from their summer peaks in Arkansas. According to Johns Hopkins University, the state had 529.7 new cases per 100,000 people over the past two weeks, which ranks Arkansas 28th in the country for new cases per capita.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Weeks before a leak from an oil pipeline fouled beaches to the south in Orange County, Los Angeles County supervisors voted unanimously to phase out oil and gas drilling and ban new drill sites in the unincorporated areas of the nation’s most populous county. Over 1,600 active and idle oil and gas wells could be shuttered after last month’s 5-0 vote by the board of supervisors. Among the sites is the Inglewood Oil Field, one of the largest U.S. urban oil fields. The sprawling, 1,000-acre site, owned and operated by Sentinel Peak Resources, contains over half the oil and gas wells in the county’s unincorporated areas. The field produced 2.5 million to 3.1 million barrels of oil a year over the past decade, according to the company. “The goal is to provide direction to county departments to begin addressing the variety of issues, environmental and climate impacts created by these active and inactive oil and gas wells,” said Supervisor Holly J. Mitchell, who represents the district where most of the Inglewood Oil Field is located. The California Independent Petroleum Association, representing nearly 400 oil and gas industry entities, opposed the measure.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Three Front Range ski areas vying for the annual distinction of being the first to open for the season could begin snowmaking operations very soon. They just need Mother Nature to cooperate. In 15 of the past 20 years, at least one of those areas – Arapahoe Basin, Loveland and Keystone – has opened during the second or third week of October, usually relying heavily on manmade snow, The Denver Post reports. But October this year is likely to have above-average temperatures with average or slightly below-average precipitation, said Kari Bowen, a National Weather Service meteorologist. That doesn’t necessarily mean the resorts won’t be able to make snow, but a cold October doesn’t appear to be in the forecast. Beyond that, the weather service’s Climate Prediction Center says there is a 60% chance of above-normal temperatures for the northern and central mountains over the next three months, with a 60% chance of below-normal precipitation. From the early 1980s through 2001, the rivalry to become the first Front Range ski area to open was between Keystone and Loveland. Then, in 2002, Arapahoe Basin installed snowmaking equipment, and the race became a duel between A-Basin and Loveland. In 2019, Keystone added 53 automated snow guns with 11,000 feet of pipe and 15 miles of electrical cable.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state’s attorney general is asking leadership of TikTok, a video-sharing service, to come to Connecticut and meet with educators and parents to discuss the “harmful impact” the popular app is having on the mental and physical safety of students and educators. Attorney General William Tong, who sent a letter Monday to TikTok’s CEO, said there’s concern that a current viral challenge known as “Slap a Teacher” could put educators at risk. His request comes after New Britain High School temporarily closed last month due to student misbehavior that was attributed in part to the viral “Devious Licks” TikTok challenge, which led to damage at schools across the U.S. Students took videos of themselves vandalizing school bathrooms and stealing soap dispensers, among other acts of destruction. “With new reports of the “Slap a Teacher” challenge, it is clear that TikTok is unable to control the spread of harmful content,” Tong wrote, noting that TikTok had identified and removed “Devious Licks” content from its platform. “Simply put, whatever TikTok has been doing to enforce its terms of service has not been working and merits serious review and reform.” A message was left seeking comment with a TikTok spokesperson.\n\nDelaware\n\nNewark: A school bus with students on board crashed into parked cars, went off the road and struck a pole Tuesday morning as it pulled into a school campus, but there were only minor injuries, police said. The crash happened just before 9 a.m. at the Newark Charter School campus on Patriot Way, Newark police said in a news release. Elementary and middle school students were on the bus at the time of the crash. When police officers arrived, a school nurse was treating some students who received minor injuries, but no students needed to be taken to a medical facility, police said. The school notified parents of the incident. The driver was not injured, police said.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A plan to remove homeless encampments at two underpasses in the NoMa neighborhood near Union Station paused Monday after a bulldozer driver began clearing out a tent with an unhoused resident still inside, WUSA-TV reports. Witnesses described the moment as a chaotic scene, with advocates rushing to prevent the man from getting seriously hurt. Community advocates said he was taken to a hospital by ambulance for extra medical attention and was expected to be OK. “They had to cut a hole to make sure this person was OK, and they brought in the fire department, who actually got him out,” witness Andrew Anderson said. “They didn’t actually take any time to make sure anyone was in there; they just grabbed the tents and took them out.” Anderson is part of the nonprofit organization People for Fairness Coalition, which provides services to homeless encampments. He and other activists spent much of the day at the sites at the L and M Street underpasses – one of four areas on which the city is focusing as part of the new Coordinated Assistance and Resources for Encampments pilot program aimed at relocating more than 100 unhoused residents to apartments and connecting them to resources while closing down the homeless encampments for health and public safety reasons.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Florida first lady Casey DeSantis has breast cancer, Gov. Ron DeSantis announced Monday. DeSantis, 41, is the mother of the couple’s three children, the youngest of whom was born after the governor took office in January 2019. “As she faces the most difficult test of her life, she will … not only have my unwavering support but the support of our entire family, as well as the prayers and well wishes from Floridians across our state. Casey is a true fighter, and she will never, never, never give up,” Ron DeSantis said in a statement. Casey DeSantis has played an active role in her husband’s Republican administration, advocating for people with mental health issues. She often appears with him, children in tow, at bill signings and other official events. Republican and Democratic leaders put partisanship aside during an outpouring of support for Mrs. DeSantis on social media. “As a #breastcancer survivor also diagnosed at 41 and a 14 year survivor, I’m wishing you the strength you need to fight and win this battle,” Democratic U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz wrote on Twitter. “The breast cancer survivor sisterhood knows no party. Please reach out if I can help in any way.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A new photo and video project celebrates Hispanic workers in the state who were required to keep going to their jobs during the pandemic, even when a lockdown let many other employees stay home. Photographers Hector Amador and Miguel Martinez document the experiences of these essential workers in the online exhibition “Our Essential Heroes,” the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. The project, which includes interviews with a farm worker and janitor, is part of the Latino Community Fund Georgia’s Hispanic Heritage Month celebrations. “We realized a lot of people were sort of invisible when it comes to essential work,” Amador told the paper. “Miguel and I are both immigrants. We know what it’s like being trapped between two cultures. We know what it’s like being treated like a second-class citizen sometimes.” Maria Fajardo, a farmworker in Glennville who contracted the coronavirus, said in an interview featured in the project that work harvesting crops is not appreciated, and farmworkers are not valued. “We have to be here,” she said. “We could be sick, but we are still expected to keep working, harvesting the food so that people can eat.” To view the project, visit unidosgeorgia.com/heroes.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The Hawaii Tourism Authority plans to seek $64 million from the state’s capital improvements budget to fix a leaky rooftop deck at the Hawaii Convention Center. That’s more than double what the agency had last anticipated it would cost to complete the largest deferred maintenance project at the building, which opened in 1998, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. It’s a substantial reinvestment in a center that cost $200 million to construct. Julian Anderson, who presented recommendations to the Hawaii Tourism Authority board Thursday on behalf of Honolulu-based property manager Rider Levett Bucknall, said the deck was still structurally safe. However, he said, components of contractor Nordic/PCL’s design were guaranteed for only 15 to 20 years, so it’s well past time to address the leaky rooftop. “This is an issue that has existed since the building was designed. Repair is not an option; replacement is required,” he said. “If work is not done, the amount of damage will continue to increase, and more rentable space will be taken out of inventory.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A constant barrage of misinformation has health care workers facing increased animosity from some patients and community members, officials say. It’s gotten so bad in northern Idaho that some Kootenai Health employees are scared to go to the grocery store if they haven’t changed out of their scrubs, hospital spokeswoman Caiti Bobbitt said. Some doctors and nurses at the Coeur d’Alene hospital have been accused of killing patients by grieving family members who don’t believe COVID-19 is real, Bobbitt said. Others have been the subject of hurtful rumors spread by people angry about the pandemic. “Our health care workers are almost feeling like Vietnam veterans, scared to go into the community after a shift,” Bobbitt said. Similar instances are happening across the state, said Brian Whitlock, president of the Idaho Hospital Association. “We’ve had reports of physical violence, verbal abuse, demands for alternative treatment that are not acceptable or approved. And those become very difficult conversations to have as the patient continues to decompensate,” Whitlock said. “We’re not frustrated with the misinformed. We’re frustrated with those who propagate the misinformation because it’s costing people their lives.”\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A federal agency has recommended that Tootsie Roll Industries pay more than $136,000 in fines after a machine at its Chicago plant cut off part of an employee’s finger earlier this year. In a news release, the U.S. Department of Labor said its Occupational Safety and Health Administration issued one willful violation “for inadequate machine guarding” and proposed the fines after an investigation into the April 19 incident. According to the release, a 48-year-old employee had reached into a machine to remove stuck paper debris when a bag sealer snapped shut on one of his fingers. And the Labor Department said the incident happened after the company had allowed the machine’s access doors to remain unguarded. “Hundreds of workers are injured needlessly each year because employers ignore safety guards, often to speed up production, and that’s exactly what happened in this case,” OSHA Chicago South Area Director James Martineck said in the release. Calls to the company for comment were not immediately returned Tuesday. According to the Labor Department, the company has 15 business days to comply with the recommended fines, request an informal conference with OSHA’s area director, or contest the findings before the independent OSHA review commission.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The governor gave his approval Monday to the Republican redrawing of the state’s congressional and legislative districts that critics argued gives the party an excessive election advantage for the next decade. Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb’s signature was the final step in the redistricting for Indiana’s nine congressional seats and 150 seats in the Legislature that were drawn by Republican leaders behind closed doors and adopted Friday in the Legislature without any support from Democrats. The maps faced intense criticism as diluting the influence of minority and urban voters in favor of white voters living in rural areas to bolster the election prospects for Republicans. That came after the 2020 census found that the state’s white and rural populations both shrank over the past 10 years. Holcomb said in a statement he believed that legislators completed the redistricting work in “an orderly and transparent way.” Political analysts say the new maps that will be used through the 2030 elections protect the Republican dominance that has boosted them to a 7-2 majority of Indiana’s U.S. House seats and commanding majorities in the Legislature. Opponents pointed to Donald Trump winning 57% of Indiana’s presidential vote last year as Republicans captured 71 of the 100 Indiana House and 39 of 50 state Senate seats.\n\nIowa\n\nDavenport: The city is making a million-dollar investment in a riverside park as part of an effort to get ready for an expected increase in cruise ship traffic. The Quad-City Times reports the city has repaired the seawall and is extending the river walk and promenade that runs the length of the riverfront at River Heritage Park. The promenade includes a decorative walkway, lighting and benches. The latest Mississippi River cruise schedule shows large passenger vessels from two cruise lines anchoring simultaneously next year along the seawall. Davenport was a stop this year for boats from American Cruise Lines, including classic paddlewheelers and modern riverboats. Passengers typically get off the boat at Davenport and board buses for tours of Quad City destinations. New riverboats from Viking Cruise Lines also will be anchoring next season in Davenport.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Some local governments are operating with 10% of their positions unfilled, making it hard to deliver the services that citizens expect. Across the state, Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows that Kansas has seen a 4.7% drop in the number of public-sector workers, which translates into about 12,000 vacant jobs, but some towns are being hit harder. The pandemic has compounded the situation because the competitive labor market has made it hard to replace older employees who decided to retire. And private companies, which are also struggling to hire, have more flexibility in pay and benefits than city governments generally do. In Concordia, city manager Amy Lange said the government is down to the bare minimum needed to perform city functions, but with six positions open – which accounts for 10% of its workforce – workers are stretched thin. The problems become more serious in the area’s pool of emergency medical technicians, where the pool of part-time EMS workers has dwindled. Elsewhere, Lawrence has over twice the normal number of vacant positions. In Winfield, the city had to overhaul its pay structure for utilities workers in an effort to avoid being short-staffed. And officials in Shawnee County and across Kansas have struggled to hire corrections and public safety workers.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Gov. Andy Beshear recommended Monday that the state use $400 million in federal pandemic relief assistance to provide bonuses next year for beleaguered health care staff and other front-line workers who provided essential services during the COVID-19 outbreak. The Democratic governor said he intends to send a framework of the plan to the state’s Republican-dominated Legislature within the next 10 days. Lawmakers would make the final decision on appropriating the federal aid. Beshear’s recommendation comes as many Kentucky hospitals continue struggling with chronic staffing shortages to treat an influx of coronavirus patients – most of them unvaccinated against COVID-19. Some prominent Senate Republicans have urged the governor to call lawmakers into a special legislative session this year to direct immediate aid to hospitals to overcome staffing woes. The governor said Monday that the federal money won’t be available until next year, when lawmakers are back in regular session. Beshear also expanded the number of workers potentially eligible for bonuses, mentioning emergency responders, grocery store workers, educators and factory workers employed by companies deemed essential during the pandemic.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Sixteen of the 49 Louisiana hospitals that regularly deliver babies have met new standards aimed at improving the state’s poor performance involving deaths resulting from pregnancy. The Louisiana Department of Health said Monday that 11 hospitals in the state are “Birth Ready,” and five others met the higher designation of “Birth Ready+” under standards set by the Louisiana Perinatal Quality Collaborative, a network of public health experts, advocates, doctors and other care providers. The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reports the classifications grade hospitals on whether they meet certain benchmarks related to maternal blood loss, cesarean sections, staff education and other factors that contribute to improved outcomes during pregnancy. “These 16 hospitals went above and beyond,” said Dr. Veronica Gillispie-Bell, director of the collaborative. The effort seeks to make births safer using metrics to judge whether a hospital is doing everything possible to ensure births don’t end in death or serious complications. Louisiana’s rate of pregnancy-related deaths in 2018 was 25.2 deaths per 100,000 live births – compared to the national rate of 17.4.\n\nMaine\n\nBangor: The headlining event of next year’s Maine Science Festival will be a musical exploration of climate change. The organizers of the festival said they commissioned composer Lucas Richman to create a symphony about hope in the era of climate change in the Gulf of Maine, which is warming faster than most of the world’s oceans. The organizers said the Bangor Symphony Orchestra will perform the premiere of the work, called “The Warming Sea,” at the Maine Science Festival on March 19. Festival organizers said Richman’s work was informed by discussions with scientists, researchers, experts and Maine middle school students. The performance will also include a women’s and children’s choir. It will take place at Collins Center for the Arts in Orono. The Maine Science Festival began in 2015 and hosts dozens of events during its five-day March festival.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Dundalk residents and some preservationist groups fear that a developer’s plans to build storage units on one of the last undeveloped pieces of battleground land from a key War of 1812 battle may destroy human remains that they believe are yet to be unearthed on the property. The proposed 13,600-square-foot building would be an extension of a Prime Storage facility in the Baltimore County community. The county approved the project as a limited exemption from standard development processes because it’s a minor commercial structure, so neither public notice nor hearings were required. The property is near the site of the former Patapsco Neck Methodist Meeting House, used as a field hospital during the Battle of North Point in September 1814. About 70 American and British soldiers were killed during the two-day battle, and, as the story goes, British bodies were buried in unmarked graves near the long-gone church that was used as a makeshift hospital. A 1990s archaeological survey found no evidence of remains on the property where the project is proposed. But community groups and state and federal agencies want to halt the development for a more thorough investigation they say would determine the truth.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBarnstable: A hydrologist who researched the levels of contamination in Cape Cod’s bodies of water found there were human-made chemicals in 21 ponds he tested. Tom Cambareri collected water samples from ponds around town, finding a group of chemicals known as PFAS polluting the town’s clean water supply. The chemicals have been linked to several health problems and often do not break down into the environment easily. Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances are unregulated at the federal level, but Massachusetts is beginning to put safeguards on drinking water. Last year, the state enacted a safeguard that would allow 20 nanograms per liter for a group of six PFAS compounds in drinking water. The contamination of local water supplies can be traced to the Barnstable County Fire Rescue and Training Academy and the Cape Cod Gateway Airport. The two locations used PFAS-filled firefighting foam for decades. Even though in 2015 city water officials began cleaning up the pollution from the airport and training academy, Cambareri’s report found that the pollutants spread across the village through contaminated well water before that treatment began. Local officials said they can’t do anything further because there is no state or federal standard for exposure to PFAS in surface water bodies.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Aretha Franklin was given a bit of posthumous R-E-S-P-E-C-T on Monday when a post office was named after the late singer in her hometown. Members of Franklin’s family as well as postal and elected officials visited the former Fox Creek post office to celebrate the name change honoring the Queen of Soul. “Her legacy lives on in her music, in her family. But we have added to that list of her legacy a post office with her name on it,” said U.S. Rep. Brenda Lawrence, a Michigan Democrat and longtime postal service worker. Lawrence also was a friend of Franklin and introduced the bill in Congress that resulted in the name change. That legislation, signed by President Donald Trump in January, sailed through Congress, U.S. Sen. Gary Peters said. “Sometimes people wonder if Congress can come together,” the Democratic senator said to laughter during the dedication ceremony Monday. “Congress can come together when it comes to standing up and recognizing this amazing person.” The post office is located about 5 miles east of downtown and not far from a concert amphitheater on the Detroit River that also is named for Franklin. It now will be known as the Aretha Franklin Post Office Building.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: An appeals court has ruled in favor of a retired botany and physics professor whose unmanicured yard was declared a public nuisance. Ed Borchardt wanted a natural yard, filled with native plants and flowers that would attract birds, bees, butterflies and other wildlife. The city of North Mankato disagreed with his vision and said the yard doesn’t meet the standards of a new local ordinance that encourages naturally managed lawns. The appeals court on Monday said a city cannot declare a nuisance “based on little more than neighbors’ displeasure with the property’s appearance.” The court said the city failed to produce enough evidence that Borchardt’s yard was a hazard to public health or safety, the Star Tribune reports. In recent years, health problems have prevented Borchardt from keeping up with the yardwork, and neighbors began to complain about an explosion of vegetation. City Administrator John Harrenstein said that despite the appeals ruling, the case is not closed. “The property in question still remains, in our opinion, a nuisance according to our existing code,” he said. The appeals court decision faulted the city for not offering enough evidence to back its contention that Borchardt’s yard is a nuisance, and Harrenstein said the city will be consulting with its lawyers on how to proceed.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The largest physician group in the state will pursue options to expand Medicaid despite opposition from two top political leaders. The Mississippi State Medical Association recently adopted a resolution to explore and pursue options including a Medicaid waiver program and or amending the state’s Medicaid plan to ensure more people have access to health care. “Mississippi has been saddled with a health care access issue long before the COVID-19 pandemic. The current landscape has demonstrated how urgent and critical the need to increase access to health care for Mississippians is,” MSMA President Dr. Geri Lee Weiland said. Mississippi is one of the dozen states that have not expanded Medicaid despite the federal government picking up 90% of the cost. The Mississippi Hospital Association also supports expanding Medicaid. Its president, Tim Moore, has said the state’s decision not to expand Medicaid has hit rural Mississippi particularly hard. He said six rural hospitals have closed their doors for good in recent years, and nearly half of all rural hospitals are now at risk of closure. Hospitals in the state spent over $600 million on uncompensated care in 2019, Moore said. Joint House and Senate Medicaid committees have four hearings scheduled this month on Medicaid at the state Capitol.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Former U.S. Rep. Todd Akin, a conservative Republican whose comment that women’s bodies have a way of avoiding pregnancies in cases of “legitimate rape” sunk his bid for the U.S. Senate and became a cautionary tale for other GOP candidates, has died. He was 74. Akin had cancer for several years, his son Perry said in a statement. He died late Sunday at his home in Wildwood, a St. Louis suburb. “As my father’s death approached, we had people from all different walks of life share story after story of the personal impact he had on them,” Perry Akin said in a statement. “He was a devout Christian, a great father, and a friend to many.” Akin represented a Republican-leaning eastern Missouri district that included St. Louis-area suburbs for 12 years, giving up a safe seat to run for the U.S. Senate in 2012. He emerged from a crowded GOP primary to challenge then-incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill, only to seriously hurt Republicans’ chances of recapturing a Senate majority less than two weeks later. Akin, a strong abortion opponent, was asked during an interview by a St. Louis television station whether he supported allowing abortions for women who have been raped. He answered that “from what I understand from doctors,” such pregnancies are “really rare.”\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A plan designed to test whether boosting water releases from Fort Peck Dam in the spring could help endangered pallid sturgeon successfully spawn has been approved. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers released its environmental impact statement Sept. 24 outlining its proposed path forward as well as the predicted economic impacts. Under its chosen alternative, when reservoir water levels allow, the Corps would request that Fort Peck Dam begin increasing releases in April to see if mimicking spring runoff will attract pallid sturgeon into the Missouri River. The concept is not a new one, U.S. Geological Survey research fish biologist Pat Braaten noted. In the early 2000s, fisheries and biologists worked on test flows from Fort Peck to gather data, but the push evaporated around 2007 when water levels dropped due to drier weather. Mother Nature eventually provided proof of concept in the high-water years of 2011 and 2018, Braaten said, as pallid sturgeon females moved up the river below the dam. Without managed flows like the Corps’ proposed tests, such opportunistic runoff scenarios provide the best chance for the fish to successfully spawn in the wild, he said. Under the Corps proposal, the tests would fluctuate dam releases between April and July.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Two women sued the state’s public health agency Monday after it denied their request to list both their names as parents on their children’s birth certificates. Erin Porterfield and Kristin Williams, of Omaha, allege in their lawsuit that state officials treat unmarried, same-sex couples differently from unmarried, opposite-sex couples, in violation of their due process and equal protection rights. The women argue listing them both is critical because it could affect their children’s eligibility for government benefits, should something happen to one of them. They also accuse the state of sexual discrimination because it allows men to voluntarily acknowledge they are parents to get onto a birth certificate but doesn’t allow women to do so. “Our sons are our entire world, and we want to make sure we’re doing right by them,” Porterfield said. “Our boys have a right to the security of having both parents on their birth certificates, a required document in so many life changes and decisions.” Porterfield and Williams began a romantic relationship in 2000 and used an anonymous sperm donor to have two children, according to the lawsuit. Porterfield gave birth to their first son in 2002 and Williams to their second in 2005. They ended their romantic involvement in 2013 but continued to share parenting duties.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: State health officials as of Monday are counting results from rapid antigen tests in the coronavirus data they present to the public and use to determine whether the pandemic is prevalent enough to trigger mask and capacity mandates. The state updated its health response dashboard, adding more than 600,000 tests to its count. The dashboard started displaying “cumulative tests” on its testing page and dividing the new infections into “confirmed cases” and “probable cases” on its page that reports total cases. Unlike the traditional molecular tests that are considered more accurate, antigen tests detect viral proteins rather than the coronavirus itself. They can return results in about 15 minutes instead of days. Rapid tests have become increasingly common throughout the nation, particularly in high-risk settings like nursing homes, schools and prisons. Nevada’s updated tally counts molecular tests as confirmed cases and rapid tests reported to the state as probable cases. State health officials said the fact that the tests are now being used more commonly prompted them to change their data reporting practices. As of February, CNN reported five states including Nevada only reported publicly reported confirmed cases from molecular tests, contrary to guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. All but Maryland now report both.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Gov. Chris Sununu is calling for the removal of a state representative, a fellow Republican, from his position as head of the legislative fiscal committee, saying the lawmaker is continuing to spread COVID-19 misinformation. Last month, Rep. Ken Weyler, of Kingston, told state Health Commissioner Lori Shibinette at a committee hearing that he doubted the state’s figures showing 90% people who are hospitalized with COVID-19 are unvaccinated. Shibinette said his assessment was incorrect and was misinformation. On Monday, Democratic committee member Rep. Mary Jane Wallner released a statement saying Weyler sent the entire committee an email containing a 52-page “report” with disinformation on COVID-19, including claims that live creatures with tentacles are entering people’s bodies through the vaccine and that technology was placed in the vaccine to control people’s thoughts. Sununu said in a statement Monday that he has “repeatedly expressed” to House Speaker Sherman Packard the need to remove Weyler from his leadership position, calling the latest emails “absurd” and saying they have “accelerated the urgency that the Speaker needs to take action.” Sununu added: “Disseminating this misinformation clearly shows a detachment from reality and lack of judgment.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state eliminated a carve-out Tuesday in its law against discrimination that permitted employers not to hire or promote workers who are 70 or older. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy signed the legislation into law, saying that “discrimination of any kind has no place in New Jersey.” New Jersey’s law bars discrimination or harassment based on disability, gender, national origin, race, religion or age. But the law contained provisions that said the law shouldn’t be construed to block employers “from refusing to accept for employment or to promote any person over 70 years of age.” The new law eliminates that provision and also does away with a section that permitted colleges and universities to require retirement at age 70. “Seventy is the new 50, and older individuals are continuing to work either due to financial need or because they still have the energy, skills, and experience,” Democratic Sen. Shirley Turner said in a statement. One of the bill’s sponsors said the measure was necessary to update the state’s anti-discrimination statutes. “As in many places around the country, New Jersey’s workforce is aging, and we need to be proactive in protecting those older workers against age discrimination,” Senate Democratic Majority Leader Loretta Weinberg said in a statement. The bill had passed without any opposition.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The Democratic governor is seeking legislation to help jump-start hydrogen production from natural gas in her state – a process that generates harmful greenhouse gases but could one day be harnessed to provide environmental benefits. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham outlined the effort briefly at a convention of oil executives Monday in a speech that acknowledged New Mexico’s reliance on industry tax revenue while pledging to enforce pro-environment regulations. It’s the latest tightrope walk for the governor who has promised action on climate change while also working to shield the state’s oil and gas producers from a federal drilling moratorium on public lands issued by fellow Democrat President Joe Biden. After waiting for the executives to put on their masks, citing her emergency regulations in response to the coronavirus, Lujan Grisham launched into a 20-minute speech thanking oil and gas producers for their contributions to the economy and tax revenues that form the backbone of state education funding. She pledged to kick-start the hydrogen fuel industry in New Mexico with legislation in February. The bill could include taxes and incentives to produce hydrogen, legal frameworks to facilitate production and storage, refueling corridors for truck traffic and training programs for workers in the industry.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The city’s public libraries will no longer charge late fees and will waive existing fines for overdue books and other materials, officials announced Tuesday. Late fees had already been suspended since March 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic and will now be permanently eliminated, elected officials and leaders of the city’s three library systems said in a news release. “This announcement is another major step towards making our public libraries, the heart of so many communities, accessible to all,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said. “Eliminating fines will let us serve even more New Yorkers, allowing them to enjoy all of the resources and programs that public libraries offer to grow and succeed.” In 2019, the city’s libraries collected about $3.2 million in late fees. No late fees were collected in 2020 because of the pandemic, and libraries made up the lost revenue in other fines. New Yorkers will still need to pay replacement fees if they lose books or other materials, the library officials said. A book is considered lost after it is overdue for a month, though if it is returned, there will no longer be a fee. The new policy covers the New York Public Library, with branches in Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island, as well as the Brooklyn Public Library and the Queens Public Library.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: Janice Covington Allison, a transgender woman who became a strong Democratic activist on behalf of LGBT rights, has died at age 74. Allison died Friday at Atrium Health Mercy hospital in Charlotte, according to a friend, September McCrady. McCrady, who had been in contact with Allison’s wife, said Monday that her health had declined with kidney troubles. Allison became the first transgender woman to represent North Carolina at the Democratic National Convention when she was elected a delegate to the 2012 convention in Charlotte, The Charlotte Observer reports. Allison also ran unsuccessfully for North Carolina Democratic Party chair in 2015 and was the party’s diversity and outreach chair. A Delaware native, Allison served in the military and moved to the Charlotte area in the 1970s. Dressed as a man, she was a volunteer fire chief in Cabarrus County. “I was living two lives, yelling at men to get on a ladder and put out a fire by day and going to clubs at night as Janice … wearing a miniskirt and heels,” Allison told the Observer. In a statement over the weekend, North Carolina Democratic Party leaders called Allison “a fearless LGBTQ+ advocate and champion for the transgender community.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Passenger traffic at the state’s eight commercial airports declined in August after a more robust July. “July is historically one of our busiest months out of the year for air travel, and so it can be expected to see lower passenger numbers heading into the fall as leisure travel begins to slow down,” said Kyle Wanner, the executive director of the North Dakota Aeronautics Commission. A total of 82,371 passengers boarded planes in August, nearly double the same month last year but well below the 101,784 boardings in August 2019, before the coronavirus pandemic hit, the Bismarck Tribune reports. The airports in Bismarck, Minot, Williston, Dickinson, Grand Forks, Fargo, Devils Lake and Jamestown all saw an increase in passengers this August from the previous year. Bismarck’s 19,272 boardings were 77% higher than the same month last year yet 26% down from pre-pandemic August 2019. “Our communities are doing an incredible job in maintaining a high level of air service, and we hope to see passenger demand maintain at current levels and then grow, once the holiday season arrives,” Wanner said. Year-to-date boardings are ahead of the 2020 pace at all eight airports. Statewide, they’re up more than 41%. But they’re down 30% from 2019.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The police officer who shot and killed Andre Hill will stand trial next spring, a judge decided Monday. Hill, 47, who was Black, was fatally shot by Officer Adam Coy, who is white, on Dec. 22 as Hill emerged from a garage holding up a cellphone. Coy has since been fired from the Columbus police department. Coy, 44, has pleaded not guilty to murder and reckless homicide. Franklin County Judge Stephen McIntosh set Coy’s trial for March 7. In August, McIntosh denied a request by Coy’s attorneys to move the trial out of concern that extensive local and national publicity – including news coverage, posts on social media and billboards around Columbus – would make it impossible to assemble an impartial jury for Coy in Franklin County. McIntosh sided with prosecutors, who argued there was no reason to believe that people elsewhere were less likely to have read about the case than were Franklin County residents. In May, the city reached a $10 million settlement, the largest in Columbus history, with Hill’s family.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: COVID-19 vaccinations have helped reduce infections by 7,500 and deaths by 1,100 among Oklahomans ages 65 and older, according to a study released Tuesday by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The study of Medicare recipients found that as vaccinations increased from January, when the vaccines became more widely available, through May, each 10% increase in vaccination rates resulted in an 11%-12% decline in weekly COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths among Medicare beneficiaries. In its weekly report Sept. 29, the Oklahoma State Department of Health said 91.1% of Oklahomans 65 or older had received at least one vaccination, and 79.8% were fully vaccinated. The three-day average of hospitalizations due to COVID-19 on Tuesday stood at 825, the health department reported. The average fell below 1,000 daily on Monday for the first time since mid-August. In other developments, the Yukon School District announced Monday that it will provide its full-time employees with $1,000 stipends from funds it received from a federal coronavirus relief package. The district’s board voted for the stipends Monday night and for prorated stipends for part-time employees.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The summer of 2021 was the hottest on record both in the capital city and statewide. The average temperature in Salem for June, July and August was a record-breaking 71.7 degrees, the warmest since records began in 1892, according to the National Weather Service in Portland. That broke the previous record average of 71.3 degrees, set in 2015. The record heat this summer had severe consequences for Oregonians. More than 100 people died due to the temperature in the June heat wave. Large portions of the state spent the summer in various phases of drought. These conditions threatened water resources and made the state more susceptible to wildfire, which has burned about 800,000 acres this year so far. Larry O’Neill, the state climatologist, confirmed that Oregon’s average temperature of 67.7 degrees was the highest in NOAA’s records dating back to 1895. Summer 2015, which previously held the record, was a degree cooler than 2021. The state’s average for the 1900s is more than 5.5 degrees cooler than this year’s, O’Neill said. He pointed to prolonged periods of higher-than-normal temperatures as being among the biggest factors in this summer’s record-breaking heat.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The corporate developer of a multibillion-dollar pipeline system that takes natural gas liquids from the Marcellus Shale gas field to an export terminal near Philadelphia was charged criminally Tuesday after a grand jury concluded that it flouted Pennsylvania environmental laws and fouled waterways and residential water supplies across hundreds of miles. Attorney General Josh Shapiro announced the sprawling case at a news conference at Marsh Creek State Park in Downingtown, where Sunoco Pipeline LP spilled thousands of gallons of drilling fluid last year. The spill, during construction of the troubled Mariner East 2 pipeline, contaminated wetlands, a stream and part of a 535-acre lake. Energy Transfer, Sunoco’s owner, faces 48 criminal charges, most of them for illegally releasing industrial waste at 22 sites in 11 counties across the state. A felony count accuses the operator of willfully failing to report spills to state environmental regulators. Shapiro said Energy Transfer ruined the drinking water of at least 150 families statewide and released a grand jury report that includes testimony from numerous residents who accused Energy Transfer of denying responsibility for the contamination and then refusing to help.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Two men who authorities say touched off a needless and expensive ocean search and rescue effort when they fired maritime distress flares to celebrate a friend’s wedding have agreed to pay $5,000 each to settle the case, federal prosecutors said Tuesday. The Coast Guard and the town of New Shoreham spent more than $100,000 combined responding to the flares off the coast of Block Island on June 6, 2020, when there was no one in distress, according to a statement from the U.S. attorney’s office in Providence. Perry Phillips, 31, and Benjamin Foster, 33, “knowingly and willfully communicated a false distress message to the Coast Guard,” according to the civil complaint, and “caused the Coast Guard to attempt to save lives and property when no help was needed.” The men borrowed a flare gun and flares, set out on the water in a small skiff, and, when they thought they could by seen by people at their friend’s wedding reception, fired three flares, prosecutors said. They recorded their actions to post on social media, prosecutors said. People who saw the flares reported them to the New Shoreham harbormaster, who in turn alerted the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard deployed a boat and two helicopters for the search.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Gov. Henry McMaster wants lawmakers to set aside $300 million in federal COVID-19 relief and surplus money to pay for the first segment of a long-desired interstate link between Interstate 95 and Myrtle Beach. The full 60 miles of new freeways and upgrades would cost $1.6 billion, and McMaster and other leaders hope by building the first segment, the rest of the road will follow. “It may be the most significant step we can take toward making I-73 a reality,” McMaster said during a news conference Monday. The Republican governor wants to spend $100 million in coronavirus relief funds and $200 million left over from last year’s state budget that lawmakers set aside in case the economy tanked because of the pandemic. The first segment of I-73 would run from I-95 in Dillon County south of Latta to U.S. Highway 501. The project has permits and has been successfully defended in court. Work could begin as soon as the money is in place, officials said. I-73 has been a dream of tourism boosters and highway builders, as those coming to Myrtle Beach run into stoplights and a few small towns where the speed limit drops, and police officers with radar may await. Environmentalists have opposed the road as unneeded and say it would destroy wetlands and farms.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: A growing grass fire north of the city prompted officials to warn residents they may need to evacuate. Abnormally high temperatures, gusty winds and extremely dry conditions fueled a fire that began Monday afternoon. By Monday evening, the fire torched between 250 and 300 acres and burned uncontained, according to authorities. Rapid City police helped evacuate the Marvel Mountain neighborhood earlier Monday and helped divert traffic around road closures. An unknown number of residents were evacuated. It’s not known what ignited the fire, and no structures had been damaged as of Tuesday morning. Early Monday evening, the fire crossed into Meade County, prompting officials there to warn residents that additional evacuations may be needed. “Any residents who live north of the Pennington County line, west of Erickson Ranch Road, and south of Elk Creek Road are encouraged to be ready to evacuate if an order is given,” Meade County Emergency Management said in an alert sent Monday evening. Single-engine air tankers were dropping fire retardant on the north and west flanks of the fire. Additional air support was being summoned, officials said.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: It’s out with the old and in with blue for the state’s new license plate, moving away from its green mountain design to a new dark blue plate with white text and Tennessee’s three-star emblem displayed in the center. State law requires the reissuing of a new license design at least every eight years, but the green one first introduced by former Gov. Phil Bredesen in 2006 has been essentially unchanged over the past 15 years. In September, Gov. Bill Lee’s office asked the public to vote on four new designs in a contest to determine the new plate. His administration said the winning license design received 42% of the 300,000 total votes cast. A picture of the new plate provided by Lee’s office in a press release Tuesday contains the phrase “In God We Trust,” but Tennesseans can choose a plate with or without that language. The new tag will also display the words “Tennessee” and “Volunteer State,” as well as the website “TNvacation.com,” as required by law. New plates will be available online and in person beginning Jan. 3, 2022.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: A state agency on Monday approved a request that George Floyd be granted a posthumous pardon for a 2004 drug arrest made by a now-indicted ex-Houston police officer whose case history is under scrutiny following a deadly drug raid. The unanimous recommendation by the seven-member Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles will now be forwarded to Gov. Greg Abbott, who will make the final decision. Allison Mathis, an attorney with the Harris County Public Defender’s Office who submitted the pardon request in April, said she was pleased by the board’s decision. “A man was set up by a corrupt police officer intent on securing arrests rather than pursuing justice. No matter what your political affiliation is, no matter who that man was in his life or in his death, that is not something we should stand for in the United States or in Texas,” Mathis said. The board’s recommendation was first made public on Monday by a reporter with The Marshall Project. The May 2020 killing of Floyd, who was Black, by a white Minneapolis police officer prompted worldwide protests against racial injustice. Floyd, who grew up in Houston, was arrested in February 2004 by Officer Gerald Goines and accused of selling $10 worth of crack in a police sting. Floyd later pleaded guilty to a drug charge and was sentenced to 10 months in a state jail.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Former independent presidential candidate Evan McMullin launched a campaign Tuesday to challenge Republican Sen. Mike Lee in the conservative state where McMullin made inroads with voters uncomfortable with then-candidate Donald Trump in 2016. McMullin, a former CIA agent and congressional aide to Republicans, settled in Utah after capturing more than 20% of the state’s presidential vote in 2016. In a tweet announcing his campaign Tuesday, he said that “extremism, division and conspiracy now threaten our quality of life and democratic republic.” The brand of conservatism popular in Utah, by contrast, tends to seek more of a middle ground and values politeness – qualities that initially made many voters uncomfortable with Trump, especially in his first campaign. “I’m not running as a Republican or a Democrat,” McMullin said in a statement. “I’m running as a patriot, as an American committed to defending our nation and changing our politics for the better.” The 2022 Senate race promises to test whether lingering discomfort with Trump-style Republican politics remains a political force in Utah. Lee, a two-term incumbent who first won office during the tea party movement, was skeptical of Trump at first but later became a staunch ally of the president.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state will be represented in a series of new $1 coins issued by the U.S. Mint with an image of a snowboarder. The “American Innovation” series of dollar coins started in 2018 and will eventually include one for each state, the District of Columbia and five U.S. territories. Vermont’s coin, to be released in 2022, shows a snowboarder holding the edge of her board while doing a trick. While snowboarding was not created in Vermont, many advances in the sport come from the state. Burton Snowboards, started in Londonderry and now headquartered in Burlington, improved foot bindings, and its founder, Jake Burton Carpenter, campaigned to allow access for snowboarders to local ski resorts, WPTZ-TV reports. “In many ways, Vermont is the birthplace of modern snowboarding, and this coin represents Vermont’s contributions to the sport,” Gov. Phil Scott said. The U.S. Mint says it works with the governor or chief executive of each state or territory to choose possible design concepts, which are then developed and vetted. Other states’ designs include a telephone for Massachusetts, the educator and civil rights activist Septima Poinsette Clark for South Carolina, and the first home video game console for New Hampshire.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: Much of the hotel industry in the Hampton Roads region has recovered faster from the COVID-19 pandemic than almost any other market in the United States, according to an economic report released Tuesday. The State of the Region, an annual analysis by economists at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, reports that the region’s hotel revenue was 10% higher this June than it was in June 2019, before the pandemic began. Nationally, hotel revenue was down by 12%. One reason for the quick recovery is that Hampton Roads’ hotel industry relies more on people taking vacations than it does on people attending large events, such as conventions, conferences and concerts. ODU economists also told The Virginian-Pilot last year that visitors typically arrive by car instead of flying, a method of travel that fell out of favor for many during the pandemic. Virginia Beach is typically a 3 1/ 2 -hour drive from Washington, five hours from Philadelphia and about seven hours from New York. There is one exception, however. The Williamsburg hotel market has not done as well, according to the report. The COVID-19 pandemic had temporarily shut down attractions like Busch Gardens and Water Country USA. And Colonial Williamsburg was already experiencing a downturn in visits prior to the pandemic.\n\nWashington\n\nTacoma: A female Sumatran tiger from Point Defiance Zoo & Aquarium has died after another tiger attacked her during a breeding introduction, officials said. Six-year-old Kirana, who was born at the zoo, died Monday, The News Tribune reports. Dr. Karen Wolf, the zoo’s head veterinarian, said in a news release that a necropsy completed Monday confirmed Kirana died from substantial trauma from injuries and a bacterial infection. Zoo staff had slowly introduced Kirana and Raja, the zoo’s 2-year-old male Sumatran tiger, as part of a plan to help save the endangered species. The two were closely monitored and separated by a mesh door, staff said. When zookeepers removed the barrier to allow the tigers to meet physically Friday, Kirana was attacked, and staff moved quickly to separate them, officials said. “We’re devastated by the loss of a very special tiger and by the loss to the tiger population as a whole,” said zoo general curator Dr. Karen Goodrowe, who is also coordinator of Species Survival Plan programs for Sumatran, Malayan and Amur tigers. She said some aggression is natural in tiger breeding, but this level was far beyond expectations. There are only about 400 Sumatran tigers left in the wild on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. Fewer than 80 live in North American zoos.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMonongah: Amid shortages of emergency medical technicians at a time the COVID-19 pandemic has pushed many medical systems to the brink, a state program is training workers to fill the critical need. West Virginia Public Service Training trains more than 45,000 first responders every year, with trainers traveling all around the state to run affordable classes that help residents earn certifications in specific fields, the Times West Virginian reports. Recently, Monongah Volunteer Fire Department was filled with about 12 prospective EMTs, ready to take part in the state’s 155-hour program to put participants on track to get certified. The EMT courses are some of the most rigorous in Public Service Training’s repertoire, requiring a commitment of about 155 hours of class instruction, though the hours can vary depending on how ride-alongs go, according to instructor Brian Potter. Once participants finish the classes, they’re able to take the national registry exam for the position and can become nationally registered EMTs before applying for the state certification. “This is a job that’s always in need,” instructor Randy Corbin said. “A lot of (EMTs) move on to become paramedics, doctors and nurses and move on somewhere else in the medical field, and COVID has hurt our numbers.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A report published by the Wisconsin Policy Forum shows the state’s bars and restaurants are recovering but have not reached pre-pandemic levels. It’s not due to a lack of customers or jobs, according to the report, but because restaurant and bar owners can’t find enough willing workers. “We have seen customers coming back, and we’ve seen a lot of our long-time regulars coming back. The biggest problem that we’re having is staffing and having enough staff to handle the demand,” said Chris Wiken, owner of The Packing House in Milwaukee. On a busy night, Wiken has to let tables sit empty, simply because he doesn’t have the staff to serve them. Food service has been one of the hardest-hit industries from COVID-19, with employment at bars and restaurants plummeting by nearly 50% in April 2020. According to last week’s report, employment was still down 8.8% in August compared to pre-pandemic levels in August 2019. “Overall, what we’re seeing is the restaurant and bar industry in Wisconsin has recovered quite a bit but that its recovery is not quite as strong as the economy overall,” said Joe Peterangelo, a senior researcher at the Wisconsin Policy Forum and author of the report. Still, July sales tax revenues in the industry were actually up 6.8% compared to July 2019, according to the report.\n\nWyoming\n\nYellowstone National Park: A woman suffered burns from her shoulders to her feet when she tried to rescue her dog from a Yellowstone hot spring. Park rangers and firefighters cared for the 20-year-old woman from Washington state before she was taken to the burn unit at Eastern Idaho Regional Medical Center in Idaho Falls, park officials said in a statement Tuesday. The woman’s name, the intensity of her burns and her condition weren’t released after she was burned Monday afternoon in the Madison Junction area. The woman and her father had stopped to look around when their dog jumped out of their car and into Maiden’s Grave Spring near the Firehole River. After the woman tried rescuing the dog, her father pulled her out of the spring and drove her to West Yellowstone, Montana. Somebody else rescued the dog, and the father said he planned to take it to a veterinarian, park officials said. The woman was the second burned in a Yellowstone thermal feature in recent weeks. A park concessions employee suffered second- and third-degree burns to 5% of her body near Old Faithful Geyser in September, park officials said. Yellowstone has more than 10,000 thermal features, which can be as hot as 280 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/01/26/ice-castles-mirage-volcano-stolen-puppies-news-around-states/49720973/", "title": "Ice castles, Mirage volcano, stolen puppies: News from around our ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Alabama motorists are about to have new license plate designs added to their options on Feb. 1, and three plate designs are being retired. The new plates are for the Alabama Poultry Foundation, Sickle Cell Awareness and Troy University, according to AL.com. Also available on Feb. 1 will be an Alabama Audubon “Protect Our Birds” tag. Most of the proceeds of the tag - $41.25 of its $50 cost – will go to Alabama Audubon to support bird conservation. Discontinued are the Rotary International, Civitan International and Square/Round Dancing plates.\n\nAlaska\n\nSitka: Police are investigating vandalism at a Russian cemetery in Sitka. Police are investigating vandalism at the Russian Cemetery. About 20 headstones were knocked over or damaged and Russian Orthodox crosses were broken and left the ground, the Daily Sitka Sentinel reported. Police were informed of the vandalism Friday by the cemetery’s caretaker, Bob Sam, who had last checked the cemetery a week before. Wooden crosses were destroyed, numerous cement headstones were pushed off their bases, statues on top of headstones were toppled and glass vases were broken, Sitka Police Department spokesperson Serena Wild said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The Phoenix Public Transit Department has received a $920,000 grant to manage the planning of 11 stations along a 5-mile streetcar route that would connect four activity centers in Mesa. The money from the Transit-Oriented Development Planning grant will be used to conduct extensive planning efforts, determine design guidelines and establish economic strategies, according to Mesa officials. The route would connect Riverview Marketplace, Asian District, Fiesta District and downtown Mesa when it’s completed, the officials said. The Valley Metro Tempe Street Car Project was allocated $17.4 million last June under the American Rescue Plan to advance the 3-mile streetcar plan with 14 stations and six vehicles.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: A University of Arkansas professor pleaded guilty Friday to lying to the FBI about patents he had for inventions in mainland China. Simon Saw-Teong Ang pleaded guilty in federal court in Fayetteville to one count from a 58-count federal indictment. Prosecutors said 24 patents bearing Ang’s name were filed with the Beijing government but that he failed to report the patents to the university and denied having them when questioned by the FBI. The university requires disclosure of all faculty patents, which the university would own. The plea deal called for a one-year prison sentence, but the crime could be punishable by up to five years in prison. The 64-year-old Fayetteville resident was suspended from the university faculty when he was initially indicted in July 2020. The university website no longer lists him on its faculty directory.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The descendants of Native American tribes on the northern California coast are reclaiming a bit of their heritage that includes ancient redwoods that have stood since their ancestors walked the land. Save the Redwoods League planned to announce Tuesday that it is transferring more than 500 acres on the Lost Coast to the InterTribal Sinkyone Wilderness Council. The group of 10 tribes that have inhabited the area for thousands of years will be responsible for protecting the land dubbed Tc’ih-Léh-Dûñ, or “Fish Run Place,” in the Sinkyone language. Priscilla Hunter, chairwoman of the Sinkyone Council, said it’s fitting they will be caretakers of the land where her people were removed or forced to flee before the forest was largely stripped for timber. The transfer marks a step in the growing Land Back movement to return Indigenous homelands to the ancestors of those who lived there for millennia before European settlers arrived. The league first worked with the Sinkyone council when it transferred a 164-acre plot nearby to the group in 2012. The league recently paid $37 million for a scenic 5-mile stretch of the rugged and forbidding Lost Coast from a lumber company to protect it from logging and open it to the public.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Student enrollment has continued declining across Colorado public schools, with the state counting about 1,200 fewer students in kindergarten through 12th grade this fall than last year, when enrollment in preschool through high school plunged by about 30,000 students. State officials largely attributed last year’s enrollment slump – which was the first of its kind reported in more than 30 years – to parents’ pandemic-driven decisions. Many held off on enrolling kids in preschool and kindergarten and other families switched to homeschooling or online education programs. And the Colorado Department of Education, which on Wednesday released enrollment numbers from a count conducted in October, expected that enrollment numbers would increase again within the next few years. But the dip in K-12 students this year points to an underlying issue that has nothing to do with the pandemic: declining birth rates. Declining numbers could spell financial trouble for some school districts, because district budgets are largely determined by pupil counts.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: Three Connecticut breweries have closed or announced closings within the last month because of the pandemic, and a fourth announced it is leaving its current space and assessing options for the future. It’s a blow to an industry that has been thriving in the state in recent years and it reflects a nationwide trend. Sales of craft beer dropped more than 9% in 2020, according to the Brewers Association. Brewery owners told the New Haven Register they faced challenges from an overall decline in taproom business to having to comply with the state’s post-lockdown requirement that they also serve food. 30 Mile Brewery, which opened in 2016, announced it is closing recently on its Facebook page. Better Half Brewing of Bristol closed on Dec. 31 and Shebeen Brewing Company in Wolcott also is closing its taproom, the Register reported. Taproom sales are especially important for small breweries that might not be able to make enough money from selling their products wholesale, William da Silva, a founder of Derby’s Bad Sons Beer Co., told the Register.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:Surf-fishing permits for 2022 will got on sale starting Feb. 1 after a nationwide supply chain disruptions pushed back the sale dates, which are usually around the winter holidays, the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control said. Sales for surf-fishing permits will begin at 10 a.m. Feb. 1, and annual passes for the Delaware State Parks will go on sale at 10 a.m. Feb. 15. The annual passes allow visitors to access the parks for the entire fee season from March 1 to Nov. 30, and surf-fishing permits allow people to drive onto designated sections of Delaware State Parks beaches for fishing. An annual pass costs $35 for a Delaware registered vehicle and $70 for an out-of-state vehicle. A Delawarean can get an annual surf-fishing permit for $90, and an out-of-state angler can get it for $180. First-time permit holders must also obtain a surf-fishing plate on which they will affix their surf-fishing permit decal. Beyond drive-on beach access, the decal grants entrance into the other state parks without paying the daily entrance fee.

Keepers at the National Zoo’s small mammal house reported for duty on Jan. 4 to discover Beatrix had given birth overnight. Now 2 weeks old, zoo staff said the prickly little one is doing well. The porcupette has bonded with its mom and is nursing well and gaining weight, keepers said. “Our team is looking forward to learning if the newborn will take after Beatrix, who is relaxed and easy-going, or be more active and curious like Quillbur,” the zoo said in a social media post. It’s not known whether the new bundle of spiny joy is a boy or a girl. Newborn porcupettes look anatomically similar until they are about 6 months old, staff said. Keepers sent quill samples to scientists at the Zoo’s Center for Conservation Genomics for DNA analysis. They should know the newborn’s sex in a few weeks. Quillbur and Beatrix gave birth to their first offspring back in 2019, soon after Quillbur came to the National Zoo. After a naming contest that year, the son was named Quilliam. Quilliam and this newborn porcupine are the fourth generation of this family to live in the small mammal house\n\nFlorida\n\nGainesville:Data released by the International Shark Attack File said Florida ranked No. 1 in the world for unprovoked shark bites in 2021. Florida had 28 unprovoked bites last year, compared to 19 in the rest of the U.S. and is consistent with Florida’s most recent five-year annual average of 25 attacks. Of Florida’s 28 unprovoked bites, 17 were in Volusia County, which includes Daytona Beach. Researchers with the ISAF, which is a division of the University of Florida’s Florida Museum of Natural History, scour media reports for news of shark bites, include reports from field researchers and verify with medical personnel the veracity of the information. “Unprovoked attacks” are defined as incidents in which a live human is bitten in the shark’s natural habitat with no human provocation of the shark, according to the report. “Provoked attacks” occur when a human initiates interaction with a shark in some way, including spearfishers, divers that harassed or tried to touch sharks, people that tried to feed, unhook or remove sharks from a fishing net.\n\nGeorgia\n\nGriffin: A pastor has denied he was holding people against their will in an unlicensed group home. However, police have charged Curtis Keith Bankston and his wife, Sophia Simm-Bankston, with false imprisonment in connection with the operation. Police said the couple at times locked as many as eight people in the basement, seizing control of their finances. Police said earlier this week city firefighters responded on Jan. 13 to a report of a person having a seizure at the location and found people were in a deadbolted basement, with paramedics climbing through a window to reach a patient. Police said they found the residents were all mentally or physically disabled and the Bankstons also controlled their medications and had denied medical care to residents. Dexter Wimbish, Curtis Keith Bankston’s attorney, told local news outlets on Thursday that his client hadn’t committed a crime. Police said the couple disguised the home as a ministry of Bankston’s church called One Step of Faith 2nd Chance. Investigators said the couple locked residents in the basement during parts of the day. Police said all the residents were moved to new homes.\n\nHawaii\n\nKahului: A reinforced fence has been installed around Kahului Airport on Maui after a deer blocked a runway earlier this month. Vinyl fencing now overlaps an existing wood fence surrounding the airport to prevent deer from squeezing through, Maui District Airports Manager Marvin Moniz told The Maui News. The added barrier installed for an estimated $100,000 will prevent a “small kitten” from getting through, Moniz said. Workers also cut brush growing along the fence to make it less appealing for hungry deer, Moniz said. Tens of thousands of invasive axis deer roam Maui. At one time, up to 700 axis deer were spotted around the perimeter of the airport fence, Moniz said, but that number has since reduced to about 300 as they move more north seeking greener pastures and water. Deer herds have also trampled trees and brush around the Molokai Airport. Gov. David Ige recently extended through March 7 an emergency disaster declaration for Maui County so the state can take measures to reduce and control the deer.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin asked legislative budget writers for $29,000 in taxpayer money to cover legal fees incurred after she lost a public records lawsuit. The Idaho Press Club sued McGeachin in July after several journalists said she wrongly denied public record requests for materials relating to her new Education Task Force. McGeachin lost the lawsuit, with the judge saying she acted in “bad faith” in denying access to the public documents. He ordered her to release the records and pay the Idaho Press Club’s legal fees, which came in just below $29,000. McGeachin hired a private attorney to represent her in the case rather than using the Idaho Attorney General’s office. That work cost her an additional unknown amount in legal fees, but she told the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee on Wednesday she was still “auditing” that bill, the Idaho Statesman reported.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A man known as the “Dreadhead Cowboy” has pleaded guilty to animal cruelty in connection with a rush-hour horseback ride he took along Chicago’s Dan Ryan Expressway in 2020. Adam Hollingsworth pleaded guilty Friday to aggravated animal cruelty and was sentenced to a year in prison by a Cook County judge, court records showed. With credit he earned while on electronic home monitoring as his case was pending, Hollingsworth could be released from the Cook County Jail as early as Monday. Hollingsworth was arrested in September 2020 after disrupting traffic on the Dan Ryan Expressway while galloping his horse, Nunu, amid rush hour traffic in an act of civil disobedience he said was intended to draw attention to gun violence against children. Hollingsworth’s ride resulted in extensive delays on the expressway, with traffic backed up for miles. Officials initially said the horse was so severely injured by the 8-mile ride on asphalt that it might have to be euthanized, but Nunu was later reported to have significantly recovered.\n\nIndiana\n\nPeru: A historic barn that once housed elephants and tigers from well-known circuses and now is home to the International Circus Hall of Fame museum is in need of emergency repairs. Bob Cline, treasurer of the nonprofit hall of fame, said volunteers discovered in December that a main beam supporting an upper wall of the structure had rotted completely and given way, the Kokomo Tribune reported. The barn was built in 1922 by the American Circus Corporation. It is among several structures located east of Peru, in northern Indiana, that once served as the winter quarters for the world’s largest circuses, including Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey. The hall of fame has been working for years to preserve the structures. Cline said the $4,200 to repair the barn’s beam is just the “tip of the iceberg” of what needs to be done. The group is seeking donations to help cover costs for the project.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:The Red Bull Soapbox Race – an extreme soapbox derby for adults – will make its Iowa debut this summer. Red Bull promotes several extreme sports to publicize its energy drink line and give consumers “wings.” Its soapbox race is similar to the traditional version for children in that carts coast downhill, but the Red Bull Soapbox Race challenges “the most fearless, fun-loving and foolhardy teams to prototype and create the wackiest of rides” using homemade carts, according to its website. Sponsors include West Des Moines-based Hy-Vee and Ankeny-based Casey’s. Casey’s plans to set up a committee that will look for the best “hometown racers” celebrating where racers are from and what they love about Casey’s. Winning hometown racers will receive free Casey’s pizza for a year. The Des Moines event will take place June 18, with the course running along East Walnut Street just south of the state Capitol, from East 12th to East 7th streets. Those interested in entering a cart for the race can apply now.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka:Clipeez salon is catering to the needs of children and parents, with child-friendly salon chairs that look like firetrucks, airplanes and more. Owner Amanda Rice, who has been a stylist for almost a decade, said she has dreamed of opening a business like Clipeez since she was in beauty school. Rice said she has learned tricks over the years to help children feel at ease while getting their hair cut. With two children of her own, she knows haircuts can be a stressful experience for some children. Rice’s small customers also are greeted with a play area that includes a chalkboard wall for drawing, child-sized tables and chairs, and a variety of toys and activities to keep them busy while they wait. Although Clipeez is a child-focused salon, Rice said customers of all ages are welcome. Parents can schedule a haircut for themselves, knowing their child will be entertained during the appointment. Rice is the only stylist taking appointments at Clipeez but is in the process of hiring additional help. She said she hopes to add five to six stylists to her team so Clipeez can offer walk in appointment options in the future.\n\nKentucky\n\nLivermore: This city in western Kentucky has become certified as the 25th trail town in the state, officials said. Livermore in McLean County received its certification from the Kentucky Department of Tourism, officials said in a statement. The tourism and economic development program provides a strategic plan for communities, which commit to sharing outdoor opportunities, culture, history and stories with visitors looking for adventure, the Kentucky Department of Tourism said. Livermore offers paddling on the Rough and Green rivers and cycling on three new routes, officials said. “There are thousands of miles of trails and waterways throughout the commonwealth,” Department of Tourism Commissioner Mike Mangeot said. “These trail towns offer the perfect destination for long-distance adventures or day trips and we are excited to have Livermore join the other 24 destinations who have received this designation.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A worker on a crew replacing corroded grating on an oil platform wasn’t wearing his safety lifeline when he fell to his death off Louisiana in May 2020, the federal offshore safety agency said. The man stood on grating after he and another worker had cut through its metal crossbars so it could be removed in sections, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said. He died after falling 50 feet. The job safety plan said such cutting, called ripping, should be done in sections but the crew “proceeded to rip the entirety of the work area,” weakening it, according to the report. Workers had set out the safety gear called a self-retracting lanyard but didn’t put it on, the report said. The rig operator and the man’s supervisors also contributed to the accident, the agency said. The man was not identified. His employer, Fluid Crane and Construction Co. of New Iberia, had no comment. The rig’s operator, Fieldwood Energy LLC, is reorganizing under a bankruptcy court administrator. Its website shows only the administrator as a contact. Neither the administrator nor Fieldwood’s bankruptcy attorneys responded to emails requesting comment.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Maine wildlife managers will soon start accepting applications for the 2022 moose hunt, which will follow a year in which hunters had limited success. Tens of thousands of hunters typically apply for a spot in the state moose permit lottery. The Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife said it will start accepting applications in February. The lottery typically happens in June and then the hunt is in the fall. The wildlife department said 68% of hunters killed a moose during the 2021 hunt. That was the third-lowest success rate in the four-decade history of the modern hunt, the Bangor Daily News reported.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City:New housing in Ocean City is scheduled to be built at Philadelphia Avenue and Dolphin Street. On Friday, SVN Miller announced that Dolphin Street Development has purchased the corner parcel and plans to build 22 “upscale townhomes” on the property. Dolphin Street Development Owner Jeff Thaler isn’t a stranger to Ocean City development and has completed numerous projects in the area. SVN Miller’s release did not say when construction would begin. This announcement came a month after the Ocean City Town Council approved conceptual plans to build workforce housing between Somerset and Dorchester streets.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nMethuen: The city’s first female firefighter has been promoted to captain after a state board ruled in her favor, saying she was passed over for a promotion because of her gender and favoritism in the department. City officials approved Tracy Blanchette’s promotion to captain of the Methuen Fire Department at the request of Fire Chief Tim Sheehy, The Eagle-Tribune reported Friday. The promotion followed the Civil Service Commission’s ruling in November that stated Blanchette was passed over for a promotion from private to captain because of her gender. According to Blanchette and witnesses who testified before the commission, the department fostered an environment of “mutual back-scratching employment culture” among male firefighters. The commission also ruled that Blanchette receive back pay at a captain’s salary dating back to February 2019, when she was passed over for the promotion. Blanchette also filed a sexual discrimination suit against the city in November 2020, seeking $2.75 million in damages, the newspaper reported.\n\nMichigan\n\nSt. Clair Shores: It’s rusty and no longer needed, but a 165-foot water tower still has fans in a Detroit suburb. St. Clair Shores City Council member David Rubello wants to save the tower, which stands at the city’s golf course, The Macomb Daily reported. The tower was built in the 1920s to improve water pressure in the community but now is obsolete. To some, it’s a local landmark that deserves love. “I hate to see any part of the history of St. Clair Shores destroyed,” Rubello said. “If the people of our community can come together and save this tower, that would be amazing and a win.” He has proposed finding a company that would pay to repair it in exchange for placing advertising on the tower. It could cost roughly $400,000 – 10 times the cost to demolish it. Tall structures can be converted into wireless phone towers, but the area appears to be covered. “It has become part of the landscape. Sadly, demolition looks to be the proper choice,” said Chris Rayes, community development and inspections director. The council voted to table the issue for six months.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: A state appeals court on Monday issued a mixed opinion in a complicated case contesting one of the key permits that a St. Paul-based company needs to build what would be the state’s first copper-nickel mine. The Minnesota Court of Appeals reversed a decision by regulators to issue the PolyMet Mining Corp. a water quality permit for the project. It now goes back to the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency to determine whether any pollution discharges from the mine into groundwater would violate the federal Clean Water Act. However, the three-judge panel rejected several other arguments from PolyMet’s opponents. Among them, there was a demand for more stringent limits on the treated wastewater that’s discharged from the mine and a call for a contested case hearing to gather more evidence and testimony on certain aspects of the permit before a neutral judge, Minnesota Public Radio News reported.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson:Parts of Mississippi’s capital city have had little or no water pressure in recent days because of broken pipes and problems at a water treatment plant. Areas with higher elevation in south Jackson have been most affected. Problems started Thursday after a major water main broke, and other water lines have broken since then, the Clarion-Ledger reported. On Monday, low water pressure forced four Jackson public schools to have classes online instead of in person and students from four elementary schools were sent to other campuses. City engineer Charles Williams told news outlets he expected crews to make significant progress in restoring service this week. “We are seeing improvements and will continue to see those improvements over the next couple of days,” Williams said during a news conference Monday. “We just ask for patience from our residents. We know they’re frustrated with this, especially in south Jackson.” Multiple pipes broke when temperatures dropped below freezing. The city had problems with a membrane system at a treatment plant, which delayed the crews’ ability to fully restore water pressure to all residents, WAPT-TV reported.\n\nMissouri\n\nClayton: Eastern Missouri prosecutors have refiled a felony terrorist threat charge against a man accused of livestreaming threats to bomb and kill people while he was dressed as the Batman villain known as The Joker. St. Louis County prosecutors refiled the charge Friday against Jeremy Garnier, 50, of University City, a day after a judge dismissed the case because prosecutors could not produce a key witness for the grand jury, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported. Garnier was arrested in March 2020 in a University City restaurant in the midst of his livestream. In it, prosecutors said, he was dressed as The Joker and ordered a soda in the restaurant, saying: “I can’t be inebriated when I’m planning on, you know, killing a bunch of people.” Garnier’s costume and alleged threats were reminiscent of a 2012 shooting in Aurora, Colorado, in which 12 people were killed and dozens injured during the showing of the Batman movie “The Dark Knight Rises.” Shooter James Holmes, who was dressed as The Joker during the shooting, received multiple life sentences after a jury couldn’t agree unanimously on a death sentence.\n\nMontana\n\nRonan: The Flathead Water Compact officially got in gear managing one of the Flathead Indian Reservation’s most valuable assets, water rights on the 1.3 million-acre reservation. On Thursday, four new board members took their seats and outlined the rules for granting, managing and enforcing the water rights, which include drinking-water wells, irrigation water, river flows, wetlands, high-mountain lakes, and some of the reservoir behind Hungry Horse Dam. “This is a landmark day for the tribes and the state,” board member Teresa Wall-McDonald said. “With continued cooperation, we can work through any challenge that presents itself.” The CSKT Tribal Council appointed Wall-McDonald, head of the Tribal Lands Department, and Tribal Services Director Clayton Matt to the board, the Missoulian reported. Gov. Greg Gianforte appointed geologist Roger Noble and attorney Ken Pitt. Their first job was to pick a fifth member, which they agreed to choose from a list of five people put forth by the CSKT and governor’s office, at their next meeting. The U.S. Interior Department will also appoint a sixth, nonvoting member to the board. The second, and much larger, task is to set up staff to redo all the previous water rights and get future allocations going. That includes hiring a lead water engineer and a team of five technicians, along with record-keepers and other staff.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Contract talks between the biggest freight railroads and unions that represent 105,000 employees are headed to mediation this week after the unions declared an impasse following more than two years of negotiations. The unions said Monday the contract talks had deadlocked because the railroads are still seeking concessions, even after workers remained on the job throughout the pandemic and endured significant staff cuts in recent years as the railroads overhauled their operations. Michael Maratto, general counsel of the National Railway Labor Conference that represents the railroads, said it is routine for federal mediators to get involved in contract talks, and the railroads welcome their help in reaching an agreement. The NRLC group is negotiating on behalf of more than 30 railroads, including Union Pacific, BNSF, Norfolk Southern, CSX and Kansas City Southern. Since 2017, the major freight railroads have collectively cut more than 20% of their staff as the industry adopted a new operating model called Precision Scheduled Railroading. It calls for running fewer, longer trains with a mix of freight to reduce the number of crews and locomotives needed to deliver millions of tons of goods nationwide. Unions have said the widespread cuts have spread employees thin, raising concerns about whether defects that could cause derailments will be missed during inspections or allowed to linger in the rail network because routine maintenance has been delayed.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Hard Rock International, owners of the Mirage Hotel & Casino, said it plans to demolish the property’s iconic volcano as part of a major renovation plan, KLAS-TV reported. Hard Rock International Chief Executive Officer Jim Allen confirmed plans to rebrand the resort and get rid of the entire front area. A guitar-shaped hotel will take over, according to a recent rendering. MGM Resorts International, the previous owner, said in a statement it will license The Mirage name and brand to Hard Rock for the next few years while the rebranding process continues. Some are not happy with the decision to do away with the volcano. An online petition on change.org to save the Mirage volcano had gathered more than 1,500 signatures as of Monday.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nRye: A flock of 10 loons rescued on frozen Lake Winnipesaukee was released Monday into the Atlantic Ocean. WMUR-TV reported the 10 adult loons trapped on Lake Winnipesaukee were rescued Saturday by members of the New Hampshire’s Loon Preservation Committee. “It could just be that they stuck around a little bit too long because the lake was still open, the fishing was good, and then they molted those flight feathers and as the water started to come in it was too late for them to be able to leave,” said the committee’s Carolyn Hughes. Loons commonly spend the summer and fall months on inland lakes where they breed and raise their young. Loons typically spend the winter on the ocean. The birds were examined on Sunday and found to be in good health.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Gov. Phil Murphy has tapped Sarah Adelman, the acting head of the state Department of Human Services, to become the commissioner of the state agency. Murphy said Adelman has successfully led the department since taking over on an interim basis in January 2021. She stepped in after Commissioner Carole Johnson left Murphy’s Cabinet for the Biden administration, where she was tapped to oversee COVID-19 testing. Adelman previously served as a deputy commissioner at the department, overseeing a number of divisions, including one that oversees NJ FamilyCare, which is the state’s program to provide health care for children and lower-income residents. She also has served on the board of the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency, and before joining the Murphy administration was an executive at the New Jersey Association of Health Plans. The Human Services Department is one of the state’s biggest agencies, with 7,400 employees and a $20 billion budget, which includes state and federal funds. Adelman’s nomination is subject to confirmation by the state Senate.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Two COVID-19 testing sites that were not on the list of facilities approved by state public health officials have closed indefinitely. The Santa Fe New Mexican reported the New Mexico Attorney General’s Office said in a statement it will investigate the Illinois-based operator, Center for COVID Control. The operator ran roughly 300 testing sites nationwide, including one in Santa Fe and one in Albuquerque. According to its website, sites are closed so that all staff can undergo more training. Center for COVID Control has been riddled with allegations, including falsely billing the federal government for tests for people who had health insurance, falsifying test results and being unhygienic.\n\nNew York\n\nLake George:Ice Castles, a new winter attraction in Lake George that features a wintry playground of tunnels, slides and sculptures all made from ice, opened Sunday. In early December, ice artisans began growing and harvesting icicles to create the frozen attraction that is expected to draw tens of thousands of visitors. Each day, they harvested and hand-placed up to 10,000 icicles to build the acre-sized winter experience. About 25 million pounds of ice went into the creation. The frozen playground includes ice-carved slides, tunnels, fountains, crawl spaces, caverns, and intricately carved ice thrones. At night, color-changing LED lights embedded in the ice create a beautiful glow. Tickets, which range from $15 to $27 a person, are on sale at www.icecastles.com/new-york.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The Department of Natural and Cultural Resources said a record 22.8 million visitors entered the system’s 41 parks, recreation areas and natural areas in 2021, WRAL-TV reported. That’s a 15% increase from the 19.8 million visitors in 2020, when visits surged as more people sought outdoor activities amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Jockey’s Ridge State Park was the most visited park in 2021 with more than 1.8 million visitors, about 100,000 fewer than in 2020. The second-most frequented park, Jordan Lake State Recreation Area, saw the largest growth, up 84% from the nearly 877,000 visitors in 2020. Falls Lake State Recreation Area came in third and saw 46% growth last year. Nearly 1.5 million people traveled to the Wake Forest location, up from the 1 million visitors in 2020.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Officials said a produced water spill at an oil well near Watford City Sunday was the result of vandalism. North Dakota Oil and Gas Division officials said valves were opened on the location, leading to a spill of more than 18,000 gallons. Most of the wastewater had been recovered by vacuum trucks, officials said. Produced water is a mixture of saltwater and oil that can contain drilling chemicals. It’s a byproduct of oil and gas development. A state inspector has been to the Abraxas Petroleum Corp. site and will monitor the cleanup.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Ohio has settled an environmental lawsuit with Volkswagen over the company’s 2015 emissions scandal for $3.5 million, state Attorney General Dave Yost said. As that scandal unfolded, the automaker was found to have rigged its vehicles to cheat U.S. diesel emissions tests. and ultimately paid more than $33 billion in fines and settlements. The Ohio Attorney General’s Office also sued the company, alleging Volkswagen’s conduct – affecting about 14,000 vehicles sold or leased in Ohio – violated the state’s anti-air pollution law. The Ohio Supreme Court ruled in June the federal Clean Air Act did not preclude Ohio from seeking its own compensation against Volkswagen. In November the U.S. Supreme Court turned away Volkswagen’s appeals. In settling the lawsuit, Volkswagen did not admit liability. “This agreement fully resolves Ohio’s legacy claims and puts this matter behind the company as we focus on building a future of sustainable mobility,” Volkswagen said in a statement.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: The Cherokee Nation Film Office has unveiled plans for a new incentive program offering up to $1 million in annual funding for productions filmed within the Cherokee Nation in northeastern Oklahoma. The 7,000 square-mile Cherokee Nation spans all or parts of 14 Oklahoma counties: Adair, Cherokee, Craig, Delaware, Mayes, McIntosh, Muskogee, Nowata, Ottawa, Rogers, Sequoyah, Tulsa, Wagoner, and Washington. The specialized film incentive is devised to generate economic development and jobs in the Cherokee Nation, as well as to help Oklahoma’s burgeoning film industry continue to grow, the tribe announced Tuesday in a virtual news conference. Plus, the new incentive will provide additional funding for employing Native American citizens and using Native-owned businesses. It is billed as the first tribal film incentive program in the United States. The tribal film office will begin accepting applications for the tribe’s film incentive on March 1. The base incentive offers a cash rebate for qualified production expenses. Prequalified productions filming anywhere in Cherokee Nation are eligible for the rebate.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The Oregon Supreme Court has OK’d a proposal that would give would-be lawyers the option to skip the bar exam and instead become licensed to practice law through experience or supervision. The state’s highest court in a unanimous vote “expressed approval in concept” to two alternative pathways designed for law students and postgraduates seeking admittance to the state bar, according to draft minutes from the court’s Tuesday business meeting. The court disbanded a previous task force and ordered the Oregon Board of Bar Examiners to convene new committees to further develop the proposals, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported. Brian Gallini, dean of the Willamette University College of Law, said one proposed alternative would allow Oregon law school students to become licensed attorneys after completing a standard curriculum and likely a capstone project. The other proposed alternative is tailored for out-of-state applicants and would require would-be lawyers to spend 1,000 to 1,500 hours with a licensed Oregon attorney. Many attorneys-in-training would likely continue to take the arduous bar test, as students who score high enough on the uniform exam can be admitted to practice law anywhere in the state.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: State authorities said Scranton has been removed from a program for financially distressed municipalities after three decades. The Department of Community and Economic Development said Tuesday the decision was made after “a thorough review” of city audits and financial data, as well as the record from a November public hearing. Secretary Dennis Davin credited “years of hard work and collaboration” on the part of residents, businesses and others. Scranton was designated as distressed in 1992 under the Municipalities Financial Recovery Act or Act 47 following “years of recurring deficits, ineffective financial management practices and unfavorable socioeconomic and demographic trends,” the department said. State officials credited the mayor and city council for working together to help the city “prepare and follow realistic budgets and find ways to improve services while cutting costs.” Monetization of the sewer authority also provided funds to address pension shortfalls and pay off punitive loans, officials said. Officials said Scranton is the 16th municipality to exit the Act 47 program enacted in 1987 to provide fiscal management oversight, technical assistance, planning and financial aid to municipalities experiencing severe fiscal distress.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state has reached a settlement of more than $114 million with an opioid manufacturer and three distributors, most of which will go directly to fighting the crisis and helping people with addiction, state Attorney General Peter Neronha said. The settlement includes $21.1 million from Johnson & Johnson and an additional $90.8 million from AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health and McKesson, he said at a news conference. The money is an addition to a $2.6 million settlement reached with McKinsey & Co. last year. Rhode Island’s settlement is separate from a $21 billion global settlement proposed for other states. Rhode Island was not satisfied with how much it would have received under the global settlement and did better this way, Neronha said, noting the state did better than other New England states that signed onto the global settlement.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Gov. Henry McMaster is considering whether to sign into law a bill that would make it easier for businesses that recycle plastic by melting it to open in the state. The bill passed both chambers of the General Assembly on Thursday after a group of House and Senate lawmakers worked out a compromise. Supporters said recycling plastic this way is a safe business and good for the environment because it reduces trash in landfills. Opponents of the bill said melting plastic to recycle it is an unproven industry and it’s not enough to require firms that use the technique to pay a bond to promise to clean up any excessive pollution for five years after the law goes into effect. The five-year bond requirement was a compromise after the bill’s original three-year requirement stalled the proposal in 2021. A spokesman for the governor said McMaster is reviewing the bill.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: A state House committee approved a proposal to prod school districts to use most of their boost in state funding for teachers’ salaries. The Republican-dominated committee approved the bill on an 8-6 vote, sending it to debate on the House floor. Lawmakers were also considering whether to approve a historic 6% boost in state funding for schools to keep up with inflation. In recent years, South Dakota has been trying to climb up the rankings of states with the lowest average teacher pay in the country. But even as a 2016 sales tax hike channeled more money to school districts, South Dakota’s average teacher pay has remained among the lowest in the nation. Republican Rep. Hugh Bartels is championing the bill, which would extend for three years a requirement that came with the 2016 tax plan. It would require school districts to use at least 85% of their funding increase for teachers’ salaries and benefits. School districts would risk losing funding if they don’t at least match average teacher compensation from 2017, but they could also apply for a waiver if they fail to.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Security officers at Tennessee’s major airports found more than 280 guns in passengers’ carry-on luggage in 2021, a significant increase from prior years, officials said. The 283 guns found last year at security checkpoints in airports in Nashville, Memphis, Knoxville, Chattanooga and the Tri-Cities area surpassed the 162 weapons discovered in 2020 and exceeded the total of 181 guns found in 2019, Transportation Security Administration spokesman Mark Howell said in a news release. Nashville International Airport led with 163 firearms found in 2021, more than the total found at the other four airports. The TSA screened about 10.7 million departing travelers at the five airports, an 88% increase over the number screened in 2020, the news release said. Travelers face criminal and civil penalties for bringing firearms to a security checkpoint. Guns can be transported on a commercial aircraft only if they are unloaded, packed in a locked, hard-sided case and placed in checked baggage, the TSA said.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin:An 812-acre fire that ignited Jan. 18 and caused at least 250 families to flee from their homes in central Bastrop County after officials said a prescribed burn in Bastrop State Park grew out of control, was 100% contained Monday night, the Texas A&M Forest Service said. “The fire received beneficial rainfall today,” the forest service said Monday. Bastrop County Judge Paul Pape told the Advertiser on Friday that the fire management team’s strategy going into the weekend was to let the fire burn itself out within its footprint and to maintain security around the fire’s perimeter.\n\nUtah\n\nCedar Hills: A teenager was seriously injured in a sledding accident just as health officials were giving out helmets and warning of the sport’s potential hazard’s at a nearby safety event. The accident – at a popular sledding site known as “the Bowl” in American Fork Canyon south of Salt Lake City – came as doctors in the area have reported more serious sledding accidents and a doubling in head injuries, KSL-TV reported. The 16-year-old injured on Saturday was airlifted to a hospital in stable condition after receiving a serious cut to the head. Medical workers and first responders nearby had been seeking to raise awareness about safety and encouraging the use of helmets.\n\nVermont\n\nElmore: The city is asking the U.S. Postal Service to renew a contract with a local store to retain an outpost where people can collect their packages and mail. The post office at the back of The Elmore Store serves fewer than 1,000 people and could close as early as February, New England Cable News reported. The store was taken over by new owners at the beginning of January, according to its Facebook page. In a statement, the Postal Service told New England Cable News: “The business that runs this unit has recently been sold and the Postal Service is in the process of negotiating a contract with the new owner. If there is any change to service there, Post Office Box customers will be given advance notice.” If the post office closes, free mail delivery would be available to residents, but some do not want their packages left outside in the weather, or for other reasons prefer to rent a post office box at the store.\n\nVirginia\n\nHampton: A newborn husky stolen from an eastern Virginia pet salon has been found and reunited with her mother, but the dogs’ owner said two more puppies from the litter of six are still missing. Bandi Murdock, who owns the dogs and the Critter Cleaners pet salon in Hampton, said the female puppy was returned Sunday, the Virginian-Pilot reported. The six puppies were stolen from the pet salon early Friday, but three were recovered quickly. Hampton police announced Saturday a homeless man had been charged with breaking into Critter Cleaners, animal larceny and other crimes in connection with the theft of the puppies, each about 2 weeks old. Officers and the business owner said someone entered through a window and took money and the puppies early Friday. There was surveillance video. Police found two puppies in the home of an acquaintance of the suspect, according to Murdock, who said she reimbursed a woman who returned a third dog she bought for $100. On Sunday, a woman contacted police to report that her boyfriend bought the fourth puppy and she wanted to return the puppy to her owners, Murdock said. Officers met the woman and Animal Control checked the puppy. Murdock said she and her husband gave the woman a $100 reward, then rushed the puppy to her mother, Nala. “Everybody’s doing great,” Murdock said of the recovered puppies and their mother. “They were all very hungry, but they’re all doing good.” The puppies must be nursed by their mother until they’re at least 4 weeks old, so it’s critical to return them to Nala, Murdock said. Anyone with information about the remaining two puppies is asked to contact Hampton police.\n\nWashington\n\nEverett: Flights departing and arriving at Paine Field in Everett were canceled Tuesday morning, as foggy weather and new 5G restrictions hampered the airport’s operation. The Seattle Times repotred all commercial flights out of the small airport were canceled on Monday. On Tuesday morning, the first four outgoing flights were also canceled, according to flight trackers, as were the morning’s first arrivals. Alaska Air, whose regional carrier Horizon Air is the only commercial airline operating out of Paine Field, warned that cancellations could continue for several days and was offering some accommodations to affected travelers. Ticket-holders can reschedule their flights for later this week at no additional cost, or try to reschedule their trips to depart from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. The Federal Aviation Administration has imposed limitations on low-visibility flying to avoid 5G interference with cockpit instruments. That has created a problem specific to the Embraer E175 regional jets that operate out of Paine Field and to certain airports, including Paine Field and Portland International Airport.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Signaling an eagerness to diversify its energy offerings, coal-dependent West Virginia would eliminate a ban on nuclear power plants under a bill that passed the state Senate on Tuesday. The bill was approved on a 24-7 vote. Three senators did not vote. A similar bill is pending in the House of Delegates. The state’s ban on nuclear plants was enacted in 1996, but nuclear power has in recent years gained support as a tool to keep climate change under control, with proponents noting that it emits few planet-damaging emissions and is safer on average than nearly any other energy source. “All this bill does is simply says we’re open to discussion. That’s it,” said Kanawha County Republican Sen. Tom Takubo, the bill’s sponsor. “We’re not close-minded. “I think it’s important for West Virginia to be looking forward to the future, looking forward to diversify, and simply say to the rest of the world we are open for discussion should this technology come to our mountain state.” West Virginia is the nation’s second-largest coal producer, behind Wyoming, and accounted for 5% of the nation’s total energy production in 2019, ranking fifth among the states, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. But West Virginia has lost thousands of coal jobs in the past decade as companies and utilities explore using other energy sources such as natural gas, solar and wind.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Republicans who control the state Assembly were set to approve bills Tuesday that would require employers to count a prior coronavirus infection as an alternative to vaccination and testing and prohibit vaccine passports. Both measures would face a likely veto from Democratic Gov. Tony Evers. The governor last year vetoed a GOP bill that would have barred public health officials from requiring people get vaccinated. Republican backers maintain natural immunity is at least as effective as being vaccinated. Similar bills passed in Florida and Arkansas last year. A number of Wisconsin medical groups, including the Wisconsin Medical Society, oppose the measure, arguing vaccination is the best way to protect against COVID-19 and it’s not known how long natural immunity lasts. Data from the state health department showed unvaccinated people are hospitalized at a rate nearly 11 times higher than fully vaccinated people. No groups have registered in support the proposal.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Wyoming’s first Black sheriff last year fired a white deputy who is accused of tormenting a Black subordinate for years with racist name-calling that led him to quit, a new federal lawsuit revealed. Albany County Patrol Sgt. Christian Handley once drove past and yelled a profanity and the N-word at Cpl. Jamin Johnson while Johnson and his wife and children were walking out of their home, according to one example of racism alleged in the discrimination lawsuit filed last week. “Mr. Handley later apologized for having not realized that Mr. Johnson’s family was present, as if his vile racism was otherwise acceptable,” the lawsuit said. Johnson is suing Handley, seeking a jury trial if necessary and damages for the years of racism that he said led up to his decision to quit in 2017. The allegations put a new spotlight on the sheriff’s office in Laramie, the Albany County seat known for the murder of gay University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard in 1998, a crime that drew unprecedented attention to LGBTQ rights and hate crimes. The racism allegations came after Sheriff Aaron Appelhans’ appointment as Wyoming’s first Black sheriff in the wake of an outcry in Laramie over a deputy’s 2018 shooting of an unarmed man who had been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. Handley used racial slurs to refer not only to Johnson but to Black citizens he came in contact with on the job, including four University of Wyoming students who were in a vehicle he once pulled over, according to Johnson’s lawsuit against Handley, filed Jan. 18 in U.S. District Court in Cheyenne. The suit didn’t provide the reason for the stop. Handley declined to comment when reached by phone and asked about the lawsuit Monday.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/01/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/06/30/star-wars-wing-lands-dc-disney-delays-cruise-truman-museum-news-around-states/117326470/", "title": "'Star Wars' X-wing lands in DC, Disney delays cruise, Truman ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: State House Speaker Mac McCutcheon said he will not seek reelection next year. McCutcheon, 68, said in a statement that he is stepping away from politics to spend time with his family and to do some traveling with his wife during retirement. “It’s been an honor and a privilege to represent the people of District 25 in the House and the citizens of the State of Alabama as speaker, but after four terms it’s time to go home,” McCutcheon said. McCutcheon, a Republican from Monrovia, is a former police officer and crisis negotiator. He was first elected to the House in 2006. He served as the chairman of the influential House Rules Committee, which decides which bills come up for debate, from 2012 to 2016. A new speaker will be selected in the organizational session in 2023.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The state House reached in dramatic fashion an agreement that Gov. Mike Dunleavy said would avert a government shutdown. House Speaker Louise Stutes indicated the outcome was not assured when she called the House to order, and House Minority Leader Cathy Tilton, who had been negotiating with Stutes, said things were “absolutely, completely close” to unraveling. Involved was adoption of a statement of the House, calling for creation of a House-Senate working group to make recommendations on a “comprehensive fiscal plan” for the next special session. There also was another vote on the effective date provisions attached to the state spending package lawmakers approved earlier this month. Those provisions failed in the House at that time but squeaked by on Monday. The new fiscal year starts Thursday.\n\nArizona\n\nChandler:A new casino will open on Gila River Indian Community land south of Chandler, the tribe recently announced. This will be the tribe’s fourth casino, allowed because of Arizona Native American tribes’ newly negotiated tribal compact with the state. Before, the Gila River Indian Community was allowed three casinos, which it operates at Wild Horse Pass and Lone Butte in Chandler and Vee Quiva in Laveen. The new casino will be on community trust land south of Gilbert Road and Hunt Highway, outside Chandler’s southern border. The casino is expected to open in 11/ 2 to 2 years. Gov. Doug Ducey in April signed a historic agreement with Arizona’s tribes, marking the biggest update to gambling in the state in decades. In addition to allowing sports betting, the compact provides for casino expansions and at least four new casinos, including at least two in metro Phoenix.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith:The River Valley Regional Food Bank and Antioch for Youth and Family have partnered to fill in the gap with the Summer Picnic Basket for Kids program. The Summer Picnic Basket for Kids program was made possible through a grant from Feeding America. The program was designed to help students attending eight elementary schools with the highest levels of food insecurity in Fort Smith. Arkansas ranked fourth-highest in the nation for child food insecurity in 2020, according to Feeding America, the largest domestic hunger relief organization. A 2019 study conducted by the Urban Institute found that 1 in 4 children was food-insecure in Sebastian County. Food insecurity refers to the lack of access to enough food and the limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate foods for a healthy, active lifestyle, as defined by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Health officials in Los Angeles County now strongly recommend that people wear masks indoors in public places – regardless of their vaccination status – to prevent the spread of the highly transmissible delta variant of the coronavirus. The move came two weeks after Gov. Gavin Newsom reopened California and lifted the statewide mask mandate. The LA County recommendation – which is not a mandate – in the nation’s most populous county does not match what the state government and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said, which is that vaccinated people in certain public indoor settings do not need to be masked. Unvaccinated people are supposed to wear masks in public. The World Health Organization, however, is urging vaccinated people to wear masks as cases of the delta variant spike worldwide, which was first identified in India. Hong Kong said it will ban all passenger flights from the U.K. starting Thursday. More than 95% of COVID-19 cases in the U.K. are of the delta variant.\n\nColorado\n\nGlenwood Springs: A portion of Interstate 70 in western Colorado was closed Monday following a series of mudslides triggered by rainfall over the weekend near where a wildfire burned last year. Although eastbound lanes of I-70 through Glenwood Canyon were expected to open later in the day because of cleanup work overnight, there is no estimate for when westbound lanes of the highway will reopen, the Colorado Department of Transportation said. The largest of the mudslides that happened on Sunday along Colorado’s main east-west highway flowed down the same drainage as the one that happened Saturday along the Grizzly Creek Fire burn scar, the Glenwood Post Independent reported. The fire, which started in August, burned about 51 square miles. Sunday’s main mudslide reached 80 feet wide and 5 feet deep in areas. Travelers might have to expect on-and-off closures of I-70 in Glenwood Canyon when rainfall is expected in the area this summer, said Kane Schneider, a CDOT transportation maintenance employee.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont’s office said rebates under the state’s Connecticut Hydrogen and Electric Automobile Purchase Rebate program will increase to between $750 and $7,500, depending on the type of vehicle purchased. That’s up from between $500 and $5,000. The state is also extending the program to the purchase of used electric vehicles. Connecticut has about 7,000 electric vehicles on its roads, the administration said. The administration estimated that state consumers need to be driving 125,000 to 150,000 electric vehicles by 2025 and 500,000 by 2030 to meet the state’s statutorily mandated greenhouse gas reduction target. The move comes the same day the administration announced it has been awarded a $7.4 million grant from the Federal Transit Administration for the purchase of 10 battery electric buses and 10 DC fast chargers. The buses are earmarked for CTtransit’s Waterbury division and will help make that city’s bus depot the first bus facility in the state capable of running a 100% battery electric bus transit fleet, the governor’s office said.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:City officials are reminding area residents that city pools are open and free electric fans are available for eligible older adults as dangerous hot temperatures and high humidity are expected to linger through at least Wednesday. The National Weather Service has issued an excessive heat warning for New Castle County through 8 p.m. Wednesday. The temperature Monday afternoon at New Castle County Airport was 90 degrees and was expected to climb to a high of 92 degrees. Wilmington Parks Director Ian Smith said most city pools and spray parks are now open with COVID-19 health protocols in place. The city operates five indoor and outdoor pools, but the Foster Brown Pool is closed for repairs and the P.S. du Pont Middle School indoor pool does not open until July. The three operating pools, William \"Hicks\" Anderson Community Center Pool, Eden Park Pool and Joseph R. Biden Jr. Aquatic Center (formerly Prices Pool), are staffed by Red Cross-certified lifeguards and have changing facilities and showers. There is no cost to use the pools during public swim hours. The city also operates six water spray parks daily from 9 a.m. until 6 p.m. City residents who want a free fan must bring a photo ID showing proof of age and address to the lobby of the Louis L. Redding City/County Building, 800 N. French St., Monday through Friday between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m., or call the City Customer Service Center by dialing 311.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Starting in 2022, the Smithsonian's Air and Space Museum will display an X-Wing Starfighter model from the latest \"Star Wars\" trilogy, WUSA-TV reported. The X-wing will sit at the entrance of the museum's Albert Einstein Planetarium, located on the National Mall. The detailed replica with a 37-foot wingspan is housed at the museum's reservation hanger in Fairfax County for restorations, where it is also on public display. \"Star Wars introduced generations of fans here on Earth to outer space as a setting for adventure and exploration,” said Margaret Weitekamp, chair of space history at the museum. “All air-and-space milestones begin with inspiration, and science fiction so often provides that spark. The iconic X-wing displayed amid our other spacecraft celebrates the journey from imagination to achievement.” The Smithsonian did not provide a specific date in 2022 for when the X-Wing would be moved to its main site. Lucasfilm -- the producing studio of the \"Star Wars\" series -- has indefinitely lent the model to the Smithsonian Institute. The museum previously curated a 1997 \"Star Wars: The Magic of Myth\" exhibit that displayed props and costumes from the original trilogy. The museum remains closed because of COVID-19 restrictions, though it is set to reopen July 31.\n\nFlorida\n\nCape Canaveral: Disney Cruise Line is postponing its first test cruise since the pandemic brought the cruise industry to a standstill after a handful of participants had inconsistent test results for the coronavirus, the company said. The Disney Dream had been scheduled to set sail Tuesday from Port Canaveral, Florida, with 300 employees who had volunteered for the “simulation” cruise. But the trip was postponed until next month, pending approvals, because a small number of employees had inconsistent results for the coronavirus, “which is considered positive by the CDC,” Disney said in a statement. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had approved the cruise line’s request to conduct a two-night test cruise. The federal government is starting to allow cruises to sail again, but only if nearly all passengers and crew are vaccinated against the virus. Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill banning business from requiring proof of vaccination, so cruise lines must prove the effectiveness of their COVID-19 safety protocols on test cruises. Last weekend, Celebrity Edge departed Fort Lauderdale, Florida, becoming the first cruise ship to leave a U.S. port in 15 months.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSocial Circle: A federal grant has been awarded to sample, grow and save 14 rare plant species in Georgia. The $780,000 grant will support work by a partnership led by the state Department of Natural Resources, the agency said in a news release. It will also increase the capacity to preserve plants at the State Botanical Garden of Georgia, Atlanta Botanical Garden and the Chattahoochee Nature Center and to spread expertise and support to others in the Georgia Plant Conservation Alliance. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Recovery Challenge grant was awarded for a five-year project to protect the 14 plants, which are all listed as endangered or threatened by federal authorities, and to all members to the alliance to help do that work. Safeguarding the plants includes protecting species’ genetic stock, growing the plants in a nursery and planting them in the wild, the release says. Protecting and restoring habitats is also crucial to saving at-risk plants.\n\nHawaii\n\nLihue: Officials want to study parking lots at crowded beach parks on the Hawaiian island of Kauai and explore the possibility of imposing fees on tourists’ vehicles. Kauai has allocated $30,000 of the county’s federal coronavirus relief money to study parking at Poipu, Lydgate and Hanalei’s Black Pot beach parks, The Garden Island reported Monday. The measure that directs the Department of Parks and Recreation to conduct the study was in the works before the COVID-19 pandemic, when Kauai was feeling the strain of too many tourists, Councilmember Luke Evslin said. When officials imposed travel restrictions to try to protect Hawaii against the spread of the virus, there were days when fewer than 100 people entered Kauai County. Now that restrictions are easing, more than 32,000 people traveled to the state one day last week, with more than 2,500 going to Kauai, according to the Hawaii Tourism Authority. The ordinance allows the parks department to impose parking fees on visitors and directs it to conduct a study to determine those rates. The department will be facilitating the study but would need council approval to enact such a program. Violating the parking fees would come with a $100 fine for the first offense. More than two offenses would mean a fine of up to $500.\n\nIdaho\n\nRigby: The Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office said a woman drowned in eastern Idaho on Sunday after she became trapped in a log jam. The 50-year-old woman and her husband were kayaking on the Snake River near Rigby when the accident happened about 5 p.m., EastIdahoNews.com reported. The sheriff’s office said in a prepared statement that the woman’s kayak overturned in the log jam, causing her to be pinned underwater against the logs and current. It took first responders about an hour to recover the woman’s body, the sheriff’s office said. The woman and her husband are both from Jefferson County. Authorities did not release their names.\n\nIllinois\n\nNaperville: A man who said he sprayed trees in a suburban Chicago park to protect them after a dog chewed off the bark has been ticketed by authorities. Asher Thomas is accused of “altering flora” in a Naperville dog park. The ticket from the Will County Forest Preserve carries a $225 fine, the Aurora Beacon-News reported. “Just as you can’t go around doing things to other people’s property, even if intentions are good, you can’t allow your dogs to do damage or spray a foreign substance on trees,” said Forest Preserve Deputy Police Chief Dave Barrios. Thomas said he regularly takes his dog, Dixie, to Whalon Lake Dog Park and learned that another owner’s German shepherd had gnawed away the bark on more than a dozen trees. He said he used a can of tree pruning sealer to cover the wounds. “The whole purpose was to prevent trees from being lost,” said Thomas, who works for the U.S. Coast Guard. “What if I saved the trees? What if the other nine I did not spray died and the ones I treated lived?” He said a “tree is worth more than gold” in his native state, Colorado. Thomas said he will ask a judge to dismiss the ticket for “good Samaritan” reasons.\n\nIndiana\n\nNoblesville:Firefighters and police officers in Noblesville will receive coronavirus-related bonuses of $2,000 each and other city workers will get $1,000 each. “We didn’t give raises this year, and this is our way of saying thank you for working through the health crisis. … People will spend a lot of this money locally,” Mayor Chris Jensen said. The money will come from Noblesville’s share of federal aid for the COVID-19 pandemic. Hamilton County gave $3,000 to each of its workers. Jensen said police and firefighters are getting larger bonuses because they were at risk of getting COVID-19, the Indianapolis Star reported. “They were out answering calls and in close contact with people,” he said.\n\nIowa\n\nAnkeny: Police arrested an Ankeny man Saturday after he allegedly threatened to blow up a McDonald’s restaurant for neglecting to include dipping sauce with his order of chicken McNuggets. Television station WHO 13 reported that police in the Des Moines suburb arrested the 42-year-old man after he admitted to investigators that he called the Ankeny restaurant Saturday night upon realizing his order mistakenly didn’t include the dipping sauce. During the call, he threatened to blow up the restaurant and punch an employee. The man was charged with a felony of false report of an explosive or incendiary device. He was booked into the Polk County Jail on Saturday and released on a bond Sunday.\n\nKansas\n\nManhattan: The government’s latest crop snapshot Monday showed the Kansas winter wheat harvest is running slower than usual for this time of year. The National Agricultural Statistics Service reported that about 41% of the state’s wheat has been cut. That is behind the 44% at this time last year and the 48% five-year average. The report reflects crop conditions as of Sunday and comes amid recent rains that have kept many combines out of fields. The agency also reported that 83% of the wheat had matured. It rated the condition of the crop still in the ground as 12% excellent, 50% good, 25% fair and 13% as poor or very poor. Planting for two other major Kansas crops also is nearly finished with 95% of the soybeans and 94% of the sorghum now seeded. The state’s corn crop is also mostly in good shape with just 6% rated as poor or very poor.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A startup spirits producer is reviving an old name as it plans to open a distillery at the same Kentucky site where whiskey was made starting in the late 1860s. The new E.J. Curley distillery will be located at Camp Nelson in Jessamine County. It’s at the same site as the original E.J. Curley & Co. operation. Spirits production is scheduled to begin by May 2022, along with the opening of a tasting room. Company leaders said they expect to welcome more than 100,000 visitors annually. The new distillery will offer two Kentucky mash bills that will reflect traditional bourbon whiskey, with plans to launch a first-of-its-kind Kentucky-blended international spirit, according to a news release announcing the project. The company is reviving the E.J. Curley name, which dates to the Civil War-era. After Prohibition, it was known as Kentucky River Distillery until it closed in the late 1960s, early 1970s, the Lexington Herald-Leader reported.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLake Charles: A volunteer organization that mobilizes veterans for disaster recovery efforts has helped a southwest Louisiana woman return to her hurricane-damaged home. Team Rubicon renovated the home of Susan Stewart of Lake Charles. The American Press reported that Stewart returned to the house late last week – months after hurricanes Laura and Delta struck the area. “My house was shuffled during Laura, but rain came in during Delta and fell through the cracks,” Stewart said. She met Team Rubicon members when they were cutting trees down in the neighborhood. Volunteers initially signed her up for gutting and mold treatment but ended up completely restoring the home, including heating and air conditioning, plumbing, electrical work, flooring, roof and windows. A Team Rubicon press release said the organization was founded following the Haiti earthquake of 2010. The volunteer veterans use skills and experience gained from their time in the military to help people prepare, respond and recover from disasters.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The Maine Hospital Association wants the state to mandate that all health care workers get the COVID-19 vaccination once the federal government grants full approval for the vaccines. Health care worker vaccination data showed wide variations in vaccination rates among the state’s hospitals and nursing homes. “We would prefer if there is a mandate, that we want the mandate to cover all health care providers,” said Steven Michaud, president of the Maine Hospital Association. “Job No. 1 for us, however we can get it done, is to get them vaccinated.” A blanket requirement would prevent health care workers who don’t want the shot from switching jobs to employers who do not mandate the vaccine. Such clusters of unvaccinated workers could lead to more outbreaks, Michaud said. The vaccines in use – Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson – were approved in 2020 and early 2021 by the FDA under an emergency use authorization. Studies showed the vaccines worked, and have worked safely and effectively as they’ve been given to millions of people worldwide starting in December.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City:The Ferris wheel at a historic amusement park on the Ocean City boardwalk has reopened following a zoning violation. Trimper’s Rides said on June 9 that it would move the ride after a surveyor contracted by the company found that the Ferris wheel overhung town property by at least 10 feet, the Salisbury Daily Times reported. When company president Antoinette Bruno confirmed that the ride would be dismantled and relocated, she said it wouldn’t operate this summer. But Trimper’s Rides said “It’s baaaaack!!” in a Facebook post on Saturday with an accompanying photo of its 149-foot-tall Ferris wheel. The Ocean City town council said at its meeting on June 7 that the company would continue to be penalized with fines if it didn’t move the ride. Bruno told the council that the ride’s placement was the result of human error. She estimated that moving the Ferris wheel and other rides could cost more than $100,000 – an expense she said the company couldn’t afford. Trimper’s Rides received multiple fines from Ocean City before the ride was removed from town property, according to the Daily Times.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The Massachusetts Department of Transportation has scheduled two virtual meetings to discuss plans to replace the Bourne and Sagamore bridges. Officials at the public information meetings on Tuesday and Wednesday will present an overview of the proposed Cape Cod Canal Area Transportation Improvement Program, which not only includes replacing the two bridges across the Cape Cod Canal, but improving the approach road networks. The purpose of the meetings is to provide the public with the opportunity to become acquainted with the proposed project and to gather feedback. The state’s policy concerning land acquisitions for the project will also be presented. The $1 billion effort to replace the bridges – both more than 80 years old – will be done in three phases, with construction not expected to start until 2025 at the earliest, state transportation officials have said.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: COVID-19 vaccinations will be mandatory for employees at one of Michigan’s largest health care providers. Henry Ford Health System in southeastern Michigan said the policy starts Sept. 10 and covers employees, medical students and contractors. Nearly 70% of 33,000 staff members have been fully vaccinated, Henry Ford Health said Tuesday. “We acknowledge the magnitude of this decision and we did not make it lightly. … Safety and infection prevention are everyone’s responsibility,” said Wright Lassiter III, president and chief executive. There will be exemptions for people with medical or religious reasons. Henry Ford Health said employees already are required to get a flu shot every year and stay current with vaccinations for other diseases. The Detroit-based health system has five acute care hospitals: four in the Detroit area and one in Jackson. It has treated thousands of people with COVID-19.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: June’s dry weather has impacted Minnesota’s pastures, and might soon force cattle farmers to make tough decisions before they run out of grass. Cattle veterinarian and University of Minnesota extension educator Joe Armstrong said those decisions include possibly weaning calves early to lower the amount of energy cows need, or selling cattle early to reduce the size of the herd, the Star Tribune reported. Minnesota is abnormally dry. A majority of the state is declared to be in a moderate or severe drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor at the University of Nebraska. Monday’s crop report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture said roughly half of Minnesota’s pasture and range land is in very poor or poor condition. Only 14% of the state’s pastures are in good condition and none was deemed excellent for the week ending Sunday, the USDA said. “At this point, if we get rain, it may help regrowth a little bit, but we’ve lost so much that even a decent amount of rain is just not going to benefit the crop this year,” said Armstrong. Jared Luhman, who raises Red Angus with his family near Goodhue, said he has never experienced anything like this, and his father told him this is the worst it has been since the drought of 1988. Their pasture usually gets 60% of its grass growth in May and June before conditions dry out in July, Luhman said. “But we are already dry in what is usually the wet season, so we don’t know what that means for the rest of the year,” he said.\n\nMississippi\n\nGreenville: A historic northwest Mississippi building complex with 19th century roots has been purchased by a nonprofit economic development group and will reopen as a hotel this fall after closing down during the pandemic. The Delta Democrat-Times reported that the Greenville Inn and Suites building was purchased from the Mississippi Levee Board in June by Main Street Greenville, a division of Greater Greenville Development Foundation. The plan is for it to reopen as a 36-room, boutique hotel in September. The Levee Board most recently leased the building to TROP Casino, which operated it as a hotel. The hotel closed last year during the COVID-19 pandemic and TROP did not renew its lease. “The Levee Board is thrilled that the Greater Greenville Development Foundation wanted to purchase the hotel. It is a win-win for downtown Greenville, GGDF, and the Levee Board,” said Peter Nimrod, the chief engineer of the Levee Board. “They will do an excellent job in preserving a downtown landmark and will run a very successful and unique hotel for visitors to stay while visiting Greenville.” The property was originally comprised of a bank built in 1880 and the Levee Board Building built in 1883. The Levee Board acquired the bank in 1919. In 1997 the property was converted into a hotel and a third building was erected, creating a courtyard between the two original buildings.\n\nMissouri\n\nIndependence: After nearly two years of renovations complicated by COVID-19 restrictions, the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum is ready to welcome visitors back with an updated focus on how Truman’s legacy resonates today.The museum opens to the public Friday, with hours and visitor numbers initially restricted because of pandemic regulations. Visitors will find a museum reimagined during its most extensive renovation since it opened in 1957 in Truman’s hometown, an eastern suburb of Kansas City. The nearly $30 million project includes a sparkling new entrance; many more artifacts, photographs, videos and films; and exhibits that encourage visitors to touch and interact with displays. One solemn gallery showcases Truman’s first four months in office, some of the most consequential months in U.S. history. Germany surrendered, the U.S. dropped nuclear bombs on Japan to end World War II, and world leaders at the Potsdam conference determined the makeup of the postwar world.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: A federal judge said a management plan for the Flathead National Forest failed to adequately protect imperiled grizzly bears and bull trout, but he’s leaving the plan in place while officials review their policies. The ruling from U.S. District Judge Donald Molloy will allow several planned timber harvest projects on the 3,750-square-mile forest to proceed, the Missoulian reported. The development came in a 2019 lawsuit from environmental groups who alleged that allowing new road building in the forest could harm threatened species like grizzly bears. Molloy agreed that the Fish and Wildlife Service did not properly analyze how the plan for the forest could harm grizzlies and trout. But the judge said shutting down timber projects could have yielded severe economic damages to local communities, and that the new forest plan was better than a previous one from 1986.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Nebraska will formally end its coronavirus emergency this week, Gov. Pete Ricketts said, even though rural parts of the state continue to lag larger cities in vaccinations. Ricketts said he will let the state’s current virus emergency expire as scheduled on Wednesday along with its remaining social-distancing guidelines that were made mandatory earlier in the pandemic. He said he also expects all schools to be open for in-person learning this fall without imposing any mask or vaccination requirements. “We need to get back to normal,” he said at a news conference. His comments came as the number of virus-related hospitalizations dropped to 27 on Sunday after more than a month of declines. Still, Nebraska continues to show a wide disparity in vaccination rates between urban and rural areas. In Lancaster County, encompassing Lincoln, more than 52% of the population is fully vaccinated, according to the state’s coronavirus dashboard. But in the rural Panhandle, the proportion is 31%. In Sioux County, on Nebraska’s northwestern border, less than 19% of the population has been fully vaccinated.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: MGM Resorts International switched on a giant solar farm Monday that will power up to 90% of the company’s 13 Las Vegas properties and 36,000 hotel rooms. “As Nevada’s largest private employer and operator on the Strip, MGM Resorts is uniquely positioned to use our scale and resources to make a significant and positive difference. It’s an obligation and commitment to take incredibly seriously,” MGM Resorts President and CEO Bill Hornbuckle said. “It’s fair to say that much in Las Vegas Strip has now gone solar.” The 323,000-panel system will produce an estimated 100 megawatts, roughly enough to power 27,000 U.S. homes annually. The company said the energy will be enough to supply 90% of its daytime energy needs. MGM called the solar farm the hospitality industry’s largest renewable energy project. It said it wants to transition toward renewable energy sources to reduce carbon emissions by 45% per square foot throughout its roughly 65 million square feet by 2025. The array of solar panels sits in the desert northeast of Las Vegas and will be managed by Invenergy, which owns and operates renewable energy developments throughout the world.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHanover: Dartmouth College is selling its FM radio station, meaning that for the first time since at least 1958, the college will not broadcast on either AM or FM frequencies. The sale of the school’s FM radio show that goes by the name 99Rock on WFRD-FM could take up to a year to complete, the Valley News reported Saturday. WFRD-FM had been operating at a loss, Dartmouth spokesperson Diana Lawrence told the newspaper, and the school decided that it was not, “fiscally prudent or sustainable to continue to operate the station.” The sale of the FM station will also mean the elimination of the station’s one remaining employee. The Federal Communications Commission first granted Dartmouth a commercial license for its AM frequency in 1958, and that station, WDCR-AM, stopped broadcasting and moved online in 2008. Students will continue to produce radio programming online after the FM station’s sale, the college has said. Proceeds from the sale will support the ongoing work of Dartmouth Broadcasting, which is the student umbrella organization that had overseen both AM and FM stations, the school has said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: New Jersey’s prison system is about to begin housing inmates based on gender identity, the result of a lawsuit filed in 2019 by a transgender woman who said she was forced to live in men’s prisons for a year and a half. The new policy goes into effect Thursday and provides greater protections for transgender, intersex and nonbinary people in state prisons, most importantly by housing them based on the gender they identify with rather than by sex assigned at birth. Inmates can provide information about their gender identity at anytime during their incarceration, under the policy. Other protections include single-cell housing while final housing determinations are being made; being able to shower separately from other inmates; the right to have input into housing decision and to appeal those decisions, and a prohibition of physical examinations to determine an inmate’s genital status. Pat-down searches or strip searches by transgender women by male officers will be prohibited. The policy will be maintained for at least one year, according to the settlement. Under terms of the settlement, the woman, identified in court papers as Sonia Doe, will receive $125,000 in damages and $45,000 for attorneys’ fees, and won’t face any sanctions in connection with an assault that occurred in prison in May 2019.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: An organization that represents thousands of racehorse owners and trainers is accusing New Mexico regulators of violating their civil rights. The New Mexico Horsemen’s Association said it is suing the New Mexico Racing Commission in U.S. District Court, saying it had no other recourse since the commission had barred the group and its members from contacting any commissioners or attending the panel’s regular public meetings. The commission took action to limit communication after the horse owners sued in December to stop the commission from using purse money to cover operating costs at the state’s five privately owned race tracks. The commission also voted earlier this year to prohibit association members from contributing 1% of their purse winnings to the association and ending the contribution of starter fees that fund medical expenses as well as fees that go toward advocacy efforts. That prompted another legal challenge by the association in state district court. The commission has not commented on any of the pending litigation.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Tenants and their advocates hope New York’s revamped rent relief program will finally help renters and landlords who have struggled to get assistance since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Paperwork requirements made it tough for tenants and landlords to get relief funds in a previous round of pandemic assistance. Last year, New York dedicated $100 million from the federal CARES Act to rental relief and received 94,000 applications. But it ended up rejecting most applicants. It has dispersed $47 million to date to 18,000 applicants, far fewer than officials had hoped to reach. Now, it has a new $2 billion fund, passed in April, but people can only submit online applications and the website has been crashing in recent days and weeks. Ernesto Tohom, an undocumented immigrant from Guatemala studying business at Baruch College who lost his job in a deli last year, said the state denied his application for rental relief last year because he could not provide documentation that he had lost his job, which was off-the-books. This year, he’s trying again because of expanded eligibility criteria – which does not consider immigration status – but has not been able to submit the required documents because that part of the website has malfunctioned each time he’s tried to load it. In New York City alone, renters owe at least $1 billion in back rent, according to a survey of rent-regulated apartments by Community Housing Improvement Program, a landlord trade group.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Textile executives joined advocates for the environment and the poor to urge state legislators to reject a major energy bill pushed by state House Republicans. The coalition held a news conference to criticize the wide-ranging proposal, which would order an early retirement of several coal-fired plants operated by Duke Energy subsidiaries. The bill, which got a committee hearing earlier this month, also would expand solar production and allow the electric utility to seek multiyear rate increases from the North Carolina Utilities Commission. Textile companies are worried about the financial expense the likely rate increases would have upon Duke Energy customers like themselves. They warned the burden would be so great it would discourage efforts to expand in the state. North Carolina is home to 30,000 textile industry positions, which in turn support 90,000 additional related jobs, Dan Nation with Gastonia-based yarn maker Parkdale Mills said. Significantly higher electricity costs would push industry investments out of North Carolina and into other states, Nation said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nGrand Forks: Col. Timothy Curry is the new commander at Grand Forks Air Force Baser, replacing Col. Cameron Pringle during a change of command ceremony Monday for the 319th Reconnaissance Wing. Pringle was named commander in June 2019, the same month Curry took over as vice commander. Curry has been in charge of organizing, training, and equipping the base’s RQ-4 Global Hawk unmanned aircraft fleet. He has been recognized with numerous awards, including the Meritorious Service Medal. Curry graduated from the United State Air Force Academy in 1999, He has earned three master’s degrees, in strategic intelligence, military strategy and pastoral counseling,\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Gov. Mike DeWine signed legislation directing about $2.2 billion in federal COVID-19 relief to children’s behavioral health care, water and sewer infrastructure projects, local government budgets and paying off the state’s unemployment insurance loan. “There are bill signings you’re OK with, then there are bill signings that you’re very happy with,” the Republican said at a Statehouse signing ceremony. “This is one I’m very happy about.” The bill allocates all but $500 million of Ohio’s first payout from the American Rescue Plan Act, with decisions yet to be made on how the rest will be spent, DeWine said. It includes $84 million for pediatric behavioral health initiative, $250 million for water and sewer infrastructure, $422 million for more than 2,000 local governments and roughly $1.5 billion to repay a federal loan that shored up the Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Oklahoma National Guard troops who have been assisting with the state’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic will begin ending their assignment beginning Thursday, health officials said. Over a 15-month deployment, Guard troops helped sanitize long-term-care facilities that were particularly hard hit during the first several months of the pandemic. Troops also helped distribute personal protective gear and transport testing specimens and supplies across the state. Meanwhile, data from Johns Hopkins University showed Oklahoma’s seven-day rolling average of daily deaths and daily new cases have increased over the last two weeks. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Oklahoma increased from 120.29 new cases per day on June 12 to 196.43 new cases per day on June 26. The rolling average of daily deaths also increased during the same time period from 1.29 deaths per day to 4.29 deaths per day. Oklahoma ranks 40th in the nation with just 37.9% of its population fully vaccinated, compared to a national average of 45.8%, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Oregon hospitals over the weekend saw a sharp increase in the number of people experiencing heat-related illnesses, according to the Oregon Health Authority. Agency spokesperson Delia Hernández said 128 people visited Oregon hospitals for heat-related illnesses on Sunday, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported. That compared with 24 heat-related hospital visits Friday and 56 such visits Saturday. The heat has broken state records, with Portland reaching 112 degrees on Sunday. That record was broken again Monday when temperatures reached 113 degrees. Hernández said the state health authority couldn’t immediately confirm whether anyone had died from the recent heat-related illnesses, or the severity of any of those illnesses. Richard Leman, a public health expert with the Oregon Health Authority, among other things urged people to use fans or air conditioning, avoid hot food and heavy meals and to close windows and shades during the afternoon, the hottest part of the day.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nGoldsboro:Authorities said dozens of freight train cars derailed in Pennsylvania, but no injuries or hazardous spills were reported. Chief Steve Lutz of the Newberry Township police force said 33 of the 133 cars on the eastbound Norfolk Southern train derailed and overturned shortly after 3 p.m. Monday in northern York County near Goldsboro. Lutz said all of the cars were intact except for one car that contained pellets of polyvinyl chloride, or PVC. One of the overturned tanks carried crude oil, but none of it leaked, he said. The York County emergency management office said no injuries, evacuations or environmental hazards occurred. Lutz said there was no concern about anything leaking into the Susquehanna River or drinking water. The cause of the derailment wasn’t immediately known. Norfolk Southern spokesperson Jeff DeGraff said the company is investigating and will complete a report for submission to the Federal Railroad Administration.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state and the city have committed a combined $600,000 to revive the WaterFire Providence arts installation this year. Gov. Dan McKee and Commerce Secretary Stefan Pryor said $150,000 would be provided through a state discretionary fund, with another $150,000 provided from the Commerce Department’s budget if approved by the board, WPRI-TV reported. Also, the Providence City Council reversed course and pledged to provide $300,000 in federal relief funding for WaterFire, which was canceled last year because of the coronavirus pandemic. The future of the event founded in 1994 was in jeopardy. Peter Mello, managing director of WaterFire, told city councilors last week that the organization had gone into debt during the pandemic after losing private sponsorships. Employees were furloughed, but the organization wants to bring them back this summer to reinstall infrastructure. WaterFire brings hundreds of thousands of visitors to the city to see the arts festival backlit by burning braziers on the city’s rivers.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: State officials gave initial approval Tuesday to a $6 million settlement to resolve dozens of prisoner lawsuits against the Department of Corrections following a riot that killed seven inmates. With one abstention because of a conflict of interest, the State Fiscal Accountability Authority voted unanimously to approve the deal, which it said would work toward resolving a total of 81 lawsuits filed by or for inmates in state and federal courts against the prison system. The 2018 riot raged for more than seven hours at Lee Correctional Institution in Bishopville, about 40 miles east of Columbia. Most of the slain were stabbed or slashed; others appeared to have been beaten. One inmate described bodies “literally stacked on top of each other, like some macabre woodpile.” Corrections officials have blamed the violence – the worst U.S. prison riot in 25 years – in part on illegal cellphones, which Department Director Bryan Stirling has said represent the greatest security threat inside prisons because they give inmates an unmonitored way to communicate with the outside world and each other. Stirling told the Associated Press after the vote that the deal next goes to the plaintiffs for signatures, before a court decides how to divvy up the money.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem said she will join a growing list of Republican governors sending law enforcement officers to the U.S. border with Mexico. Noem’s announcement that she will send up to 50 South Dakota National Guard troops to Texas comes as the GOP ramps up a political fight with President Joe Biden over border security. The issue has drawn a host of prominent GOP figures: former President Donald Trump was expected to travel to the border this week and Republican governors from Florida, Nebraska and Iowa have committed to sending law enforcement officers for border security. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott this month announced plans to build more barriers along the border.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Tennessee plans to suspend construction-related lane closures on interstates and state routes during the Fourth of July holiday weekend to reduce traffic delays, transportation officials said. Suspension of lane closures in construction areas will start Friday morning and end on the morning of July 6, Tennessee’s Department of Transportation said. “It is estimated that 939,000 motorists will travel Tennessee’s interstates and state routes this July 4 holiday,” Tennessee Transportation Commissioner Clay Bright said. “To help motorists reach their destinations safely and without unnecessary delays, we are suspending lane closures during this holiday travel time.” Drivers will still face some long-term lane closures on construction projects, the department said. Workers might be on the site of construction zones, and reduced speed limits in work zones will still be in effect, the department said.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin:As coronavirus hospitalizations and cases continue to decrease in Austin and Travis County, Dr. Desmar Walkes, the area's top health chief, said she's growing increasingly concerned about one variant of the disease and the threat it poses for unvaccinated residents. Walkes, who began her role as Austin-Travis County health authority earlier this month, said Austin and Travis County health leaders are closely monitoring the highly contagious Delta coronavirus variant making its way across the nation. Walkes said although the strain has yet to be confirmed in Austin and Travis County, the Delta variant will put the area's unvaccinated residents most at risk. Seven cases have been confirmed in Dallas County, according to the county's website last updated on Tuesday. Although residents who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 can still be infected by the variant, they are likely to have a milder case and not experience severe illness leading to hospitalizations, Walkes said. Unvaccinated residents, even if they were previously infected with COVID-19, though, will likely be at greater risk of contracting the coronavirus if exposed to the Delta variant.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Doug Emhoff, the husband of Vice President Kamala Harris, is planning to visit Bryce Canyon National Park in southern Utah this week as part of a tour through southwestern states, the White House announced Monday. Emhoff will be visiting the park on Friday as part of a Biden administration tour to celebrate the country’s progress against COVID-19. Emhoff’s visit comes as many U.S. states continue to experience lagging vaccination rates. No additional details about his visit were immediately available. First lady Jill Biden also announced Monday that she and Emhoff will tour a vaccination site in Houston on Tuesday and another vaccine clinic at a middle school in Phoenix on Wednesday. Biden’s office said the trips are intended to highlight the ease of getting vaccinated and mobilize outreach efforts. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland visited southern Utah in early April as she prepared to submit recommendations on whether to reverse President Donald Trump’s decision to downsize the Bears Ears National Monument and Grand Staircase-Escalante.\n\nVermont\n\nRutland: The long-awaited extension of the Amtrak line from Rutland to Burlington might be delayed until later in 2022 because of issues in the supply chain. Vermont Rail Action Network Executive Director Christopher Parker told the Rutland Herald on Monday that work is under way at the station in Rutland and the yard and station in Burlington, but some parts are proving difficult to get. “It turns out the switches are on back order,” Parker said. “I don’t know how serious that is.” That could delay the opening of the line from early 2022 to sometime later in 2022, Parker said. The Ethan Allen Express train is being extended north from Rutland to Burlington with stops in Middlebury and Vergennes. The Vermont Rail Advisory Council recently discussed the schedule for the line, Parker said. Southbound trains would leave Burlington at 10:15 a.m. and then depart from Rutland at 12:25 p.m., arriving at New York’s Penn Station at 5:50 p.m. The northbound trips leave from New York City at 2:21 p.m., reaching Rutland at 7:46 p.m. and Burlington at 9:55 p.m. Amtrak service to Vermont was suspended last year because of the coronavirus pandemic. Service from Washington and New York City will resume on July 19.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Virginia is expanding its Medicaid program to provide a comprehensive dental benefit to poor adults, meaning more than 750,000 Virginians will be eligible for the benefit starting Thursday. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported that it is part of a two-year state budget that includes $35 million in state and federal funds to provide a wide range of dental care to adults for the first time. Currently, Medicaid will pay only for emergency tooth extraction for adults. The benefit expansion includes checkups three times a year to prevent oral disease that can lead to bigger medical problems. The safety-net program serves more than 1.8 million Virginians, including 558,000 people who receive health care coverage because of expanded eligibility. The change will likely mean a significant jump in demand for dentists and about 1,500 dentists have committed to serving adults under the Medicaid benefit. Virginia Dental Association Executive Director Ryan Dunn said more dentists will be needed. Currently, about 2,000 dentists provide dental services through Medicaid, but to get more to participate in the program, Dunn said the state must raise reimbursement rates.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Most of the COVID-19 restrictions that have been in place and modified several times since March 2020 will be lifted Wednesday, meaning restaurants and bars and other businesses can resume full indoor occupancy levels and physical distancing requirements will be lifted. Since May, all of the state’s 39 counties have been in the third phase of a four-stage reopening plan, with indoor capacity limited at 50%. Now, businesses across the state can resume normal operations. Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee had set the June 30 date for reopening, and the state fell short of an option that would have allowed earlier opening if 70% of residents age 16 and older had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Even with the creation of lottery incentives with prizes up to $ million, the statewide vaccination rate for those 16 and up is just over 68%. Residents age 12-15 have been eligible for vaccinations since last month, and more than 37% of that group have initiated vaccination, and about 28% are fully vaccinated.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Federal regulators are proposing a $12,288 fine in response to an explosion and fire at a West Virginia chemical plant that killed a worker and injured three other people. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration proposed that Optima Belle LLC pay the penalty in a citation issued this month, saying the plant in Kanawha County violated federal code that requires employers to provide a workplace “free from recognized hazards that were causing or likely to cause death or serious physical harm to employees,” the Charleston Gazette-Mail reported. The agency found that the company left employees exposed to hazards while they conducted a chemical drying process on a solid chlorinated product, according to regulators. John Gillenwater, 42, of Hurricanewas killed in the Dec. 8 explosion. Optima Belle can abate the violation by developing policies and training to prevent similar occurrences in the future, regulators said. The company could also contest and litigate the case, OSHA spokeswoman Lenore Uddyback-Fortson said. If the company accepts the citation as issued, the fine would become a final order, she said. Optima Belle has scheduled an informal conference to discuss the citation, she said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A former drug smuggler can practice law in Wisconsin, the state Supreme Court ruled Tuesday. The 4-3 ruling reverses a decision from the Wisconsin Board of Bar Examiners to block Abby Padlock from becoming an attorney in the state. According to court documents, Padlock became a drug smuggler to earn money so she could become an international language instructor. Police stopped her and a friend as they were driving through Minnesota in 2015 and discovered 114 pounds of marijuana in their vehicle that they were moving from Oregon to Wisconsin. Police also discovered $30,000 in her house that she had been paid for the job. Padlock was charged with two felony drug counts. The charges were reduced to one count of misdemeanor marijuana possession. She was sentenced to three days in jail, placed on probation for two years and ordered to pay a $30,000 forfeiture. She applied to the University of Wisconsin Law School while she was still on probation, but noted on her application that the charges had been dismissed. Applicants also are required to supply a host of details about any criminal violations. Padlock failed to provide any details about her arrest. She did not divulge the amount of marijuana she was carrying, the initial charges she faced, that she spent three days in jail or that she was ordered to pay a $30,000 forfeiture. She was admitted to the law school and began her studies. Officials there didn’t learn of her criminal history until she joined a program that required a background check. The law school chose not to discipline her and allowed her to finish school. She applied for admission to the state bar in 2019. This time, she did include details of her crime on her application.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The U.S. Supreme Court decided Monday that it won’t allow Wyoming and Montana to sue Washington state for denying a key permit to build a coal export dock that would have sent coal to Asia. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito voted in the minority in the ruling against letting the states sue the third in a case that would have gone directly before the high court. The two major coal mining states have sought to boost exports to prop up an industry in decline for a decade as U.S. utilities switch to gas-fired power and renewable energy. The Washington state Department of Ecology in 2017 denied a permit for the export dock, saying the facility on the Columbia River would cause “irreparable and unavoidable” environmental harm. Denying the permit violated the U.S. Constitution’s prohibition against trade protectionism between states, the coal states argued in 2020. Washington state officials were not trying to block Wyoming and Montana coal but acted because of “valid environmental concerns” about the dock, attorneys for the state argued in a court filing later that year In any event, the developer of the Millennium Bulk Terminal project went bankrupt and the project wouldn’t proceed, U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar argued in May. Wyoming this year set aside $1 million to help Gov. Mark Gordon’s office pursue the lawsuit and potentially file others against states with policies leading to the early shutdown of Wyoming coal-fired power plants.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/08/17/infected-minks-airport-layoffs-crawfish-farmers-news-around-states/113304530/", "title": "Infected minks, airport layoffs, crawfish farmers: News from around ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nOpelika: High schools are severely limiting attendance at football games this fall because of the coronavirus pandemic, and at least one canceled sports after deciding it wasn’t worth the risk to play. Opelika High School said it will cap attendance at about 30% of the stadium’s capacity of 8,000 so fans can maintain proper social distancing, and Gulf Shores said attendance at athletic events will be cut by 50%. Other schools are also announcing attendance reductions or still working on plans. The first football games are scheduled for this week, although some schools have delayed contests after players or staff tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19. The moves follow an announcement by state health officials on Thursday that fans can attend games despite the pandemic. The agency asked schools to limit crowds and require anyone in attendance to wear face masks and keep away from other people to avoid spreading the virus. In Dallas County, Ellwood Christian Academy decided to cancel its football, volleyball and soccer seasons rather than take a risk during the pandemic.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The food service provider for the Anchorage and Fairbanks airports will lay off more than 140 employees because of the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, the organization said in a letter to state officials. The layoffs will consist of 123 workers from Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport and 19 at Fairbanks International Airport, the food service provider, HMSHost, said in letters to state employment officials. The layoffs at the Anchorage airport will affect businesses such as Starbucks, Cinnabon, Humpy’s Great Alaskan Alehouse, Norton Sound Seafood House, Alaska Doghaus, Cream, Mezzanine Bar, Anchorage Marketplace and Local Alaskan Rustic Marketplace, the Anchorage Daily News reported. “The COVID-19 pandemic has devastated the travel and restaurant industries, and unfortunately, HMSHost sits at the intersection of both,” the letter said. “Never in the history of aviation and the hospitality industry have we experienced such catastrophic customer traffic declines.” The Fairbanks layoffs will affect businesses such as The Local and Starbucks, HMSHost said. The workers were originally furloughed in March. The layoffs are expected to be permanent on Oct. 15, HMSHost said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:The Arizona Department of Health Services has approved a reopening plan for more than 20 gyms in the Phoenix area operated by EoS Fitness. The gyms will be some of the first to open their doors after the state announced a number of health benchmarks to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and guide the reopening of certain businesses. When the benchmarks were announced on Aug. 10, the spread of COVID-19 in Maricopa County was “substantial” by state guidelines and had not slowed to a safe threshold for opening gyms. Still, the state said it would consider plans for reopening that followed stricter safety policies than will be required when the benchmarks are met. The approved plan for EoS Fitness centers includes limiting occupancy to about 100 members, or 10% capacity. Saunas, steam rooms, hot tubs and basketball courts – places where people are likely to come in close contact – will stay closed, according to the company’s website. The gyms will have water refill stations as opposed to drinking fountains, and will space exercise equipment at least 6 feet apart. EoS Fitness said it would not hold group fitness classes until the spread of COVID-19 is downgraded to “moderate” in Maricopa County, per the health department benchmarks.\n\nArkansas\n\nPine Bluff:As of Thursday, Arkansas is sixth in the nation for COVID-19-related cases among inmates in state prisons, and Arkansas is ninth for most inmate deaths, according to data from the Marshall Project. Since March, The Marshall Project has been tracking how many people are being sickened and killed by COVID-19 in prisons and how widely it has spread across the nation and within each state. According to the Marshall Project there have been at least 4,665 cases of coronavirus reported among prisoners in Arkansas, with 3,883 prisoners recovered. Their report states there have been at least 34 COVID-19-related deaths. Since July, a continuous number of inmates have been announced as having died in various hospitals by the Arkansas Department of Corrections. Most recently, an inmate was pronounced dead on Saturday at CHI St. Vincent – Hot Springs. The inmate from the Ouachita River Correctional Unit was undergoing treatment for COVID-19-related symptoms. The inmate was in his late 50s and serving a sentence for criminal attempt at murder in the first degree. The Department of Corrections has extended suspension of inmate visitation until Sept. 1. The suspension includes all prisons and community correction centers, and it applies to regular and special visits.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: A judge ordered immediate testing of all detainees and staff at an immigration detention center where COVID-19 was spreading for weeks while officials refused to test for the virus. Federal District Court Judge Vince Chhabria ordered the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency to conduct quick-result testing of everyone in the Mesa Verde ICE Processing Facility in Bakersfield, The Los Angeles Times reported. At least 54 of the 104 detained people remaining at the facility tested positive for the virus. Initial results from quick tests Saturday found 11 more positive cases, MacLean said. Chhabria’s order also directed about 140 staff members at Mesa Verde to be tested during their next shift, and weekly thereafter. The order followed results Friday showing nearly half of the detainees tested earlier in the week were positive for COVID-19. Deputy Public Defender Emi MacLean of the San Francisco public defender’s office said the judge cited the “deliberate indifference” of ICE and GEO Group, the private company managing the facility. The public defender’s office represents detainees at the facility in San Francisco Immigration Court.\n\nColorado\n\nRocky Ford:The 32nd Arkansas Valley Fair Board has canceled the 2020 Balloon Festival because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The festival was planned for Nov. 6-8 and has been rescheduled for Nov. 5-7, 2021. The festival was canceled to avoid adding more stress on attendees and participants, the board said in a news release. “We love our ballooning family and want everyone to be as safe as possible,” the statement said. “We considered many scenarios before coming to this decision. The strain of this pandemic has been difficult, and we do not want to put any more stress on our sponsors, pilots, or spectators.” For the last three decades, colorful and vibrant hot air balloons have filled the skies nearly every first week of November. Balloon pilots – professional fliers and often longtime thrill-seekers – have visited the Arkansas Valley and Rocky Ford where, weather conditions permitting, they would take to the skies. Pilots were usually happy to take locals and visitors up with them, too, where one could get a rare, expansive look at the valley.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Britain: Two Connecticut parents filed an appeal in state court challenging a Department of Education requirement that students returning to classrooms this fall wear facemasks. The appeal filed Friday in Superior Court in New Britain seeks to have the department rescind the requirement to wear face coverings and to issue an order stating that neither the department nor local school districts can impose such a requirement, according to the Hartford Courant. “The Defendants’ requirements regarding the use of face coverings, masks, and face shields in schools … place an unconstitutional burden and restriction on the Plaintiffs’ fundamental right to an education, and is a denial of their right to equal protection of the law,” according to the filing. An emailed response Saturday from the Department of Education and the Office of the Attorney General said: “We are reviewing the complaint and will respond in court. Masks keep people safe. Please wear your mask.” The parents named in the filing are Jenna Matos, whose children ages 5 and 7 attend a parochial school in Manchester, and Raena Ferguson of East Lyme, whose 14-year-old child attends the local high school. The parents were joined in the appeal by the Connecticut Freedom Alliance. The mask requirement was included in a plan the education department released this summer stipulating certain rules schools must follow if they open for in-person learning this fall.\n\nDelaware\n\nRehoboth Beach:The 31st annual Sea Witch Festival has been postponed to Oct. 29-31 of next year amid concerns over the coronavirus pandemic, organizers announced Monday in a Rehoboth Beach-Dewey Beach Chamber of Commerce email. Organizers stated that COVID-19 regulations and mandates “cannot be met” for such an event. “Next year will be bigger & better than EVER, including more entertainment, more activities, and more FUN!!” they added. The Sea Witch Festival, which welcomes thousands of people to Rehoboth Beach each fall, is one of the latest crowd-drawing events in southern Delaware to be impacted by the pandemic. Last week, the Jazz Festival was also postponed to October 2021. The Sea Witch Festival is a weekend-long event that attracts visitors well after the summer season ends, making Monday’s announcement especially taxing on small businesses. Rehoboth Beach, like many resort towns along the Delaware coast and nationally, has taken an economic punch this summer season, with less visitors, an uptick in hotel cancellations and restaurants facing limited capacity and other strict COVID-19 regulations.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Asymptomatic spread of the coronavirus has been a major source of infections in the District, WUSA-TV reported, according to new data revealed by an analysis of the city’s contact tracing cases. In a presentation released Monday, DC Health offered lessons learned from an analysis of 971 confirmed cases of the coronavirus between July 31 and Aug. 13. According to DC Health, more than half of those surveyed, 51%, said they had not come into contact with a person diagnosed with COVID-19 during the exposure period. To illustrate this, DC Health offered several contact tracing case studies derived from the data, including one in which three branches of an extended family became infected with the virus after attending a birthday party together – despite none of the attendees showing symptoms until the day after the party. The presentation also found troubling reports about large gatherings that have continued to be held in the District. Of those surveyed, 145 people reported attending a large event during their exposure event. More than 60% of those indicated that some part of the event occurred indoors, and the same amount said social distancing wasn’t observed during the event. Also, of those surveyed, 102 said they have traveled during their exposure period, with air travel being far and away the most common (71%), followed by rideshare (33%).\n\nFlorida\n\nDaytona Beach:Ninety-three inmates at the Volusia County Branch Jail have tested positive for the coronavirus since July 31, according to a county spokesman. The jail began routinely testing all inmates on July 27 except for inmates who were booked and immediately bonded out, said spokesman Gary Davidson. Before that, the jail had only been testing inmates who exhibited symptoms, Davidson wrote in an email. Davidson provided statistics on Friday going back to July 27 showing that 1,128 inmates have been tested resulting in 93 positive results. Those 93 are in addition to 13 inmates who had tested positive by July 31 at the jail, Davidson wrote. Davidson said that all the inmates who have tested positive since July 27 were asymptomatic. “Because of the proactive testing measures, we’re now able to identify and isolate the inmates as necessary to help prevent further spread,” Davidson wrote. He said the jail has not had any coronavirus-related deaths and none of the inmates who has tested positive has been hospitalized. Jail staff are awaiting the results on about 275 tests; 1,033 inmates have tested negative.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Gov. Brian Kemp, who has opposed local mask mandates and even sued over one in Atlanta, has signed an executive order that allows local governments to enact mask requirements to help fight the coronavirus pandemic. As with previous orders, the one issued Saturday said residents and visitors of the state are “strongly encouraged” to wear face coverings when they are outside of their homes, except when eating, drinking or exercising outside. But unlike previous orders, this one allows local governments in counties that have reached a “threshold requirement” to require the wearing of masks on government-owned property. A county meets that threshold requirement if it has had 100 or more confirmed cases of COVID-19 per 100,000 people over the previous 14 days. Only two of Georgia’s 159 counties were below that threshold, according to data from the state Department of Public Health. Local mask mandates cannot result in fines, fees or penalties against private businesses or organizations, and penalties against individuals for non-compliance cannot included a fine greater than $50 and cannot include prison time, the order said. If people are not in compliance, local authorities must warn them “about the health risks posed by not wearing a face mask or face covering” prior to issuing a citation. Local mask requirements can’t be enforced on residential property and can only be enforced on private property, including businesses, if the owner or occupant consents to enforcement, the order said.\n\nHawaii\n\nKahului: Kahului Airport on Maui has completed its second phase of its thermal screening project meant to fight the spread of the coronavirus. The screening uses thermal imaging and facial recognition technology to pinpoint people with a temperature of 100.4 degrees or higher. Dual lens cameras have been installed at all arrival gates and TSA checkpoints in the airport. When Phase 3 is completed, the cameras will be able to track travelers with high body temperatures so contact tracers can stop and screen them before they leave the airport, The Maui News reported. Maui Airports District Manager Marvin Moniz said he expects Phase 3 to be completed before the end of the year. The technology is being implemented at all five of Hawaii’s main airports. In response to growing privacy concerns, Moniz said the images are erased every 30 minutes. There are also signs throughout the airport that alert travelers about the thermal screening cameras. “It’s not recorded, it’s just like a queue,” said Maui District Assistant Airport Superintendent Larry Miller. “It’s not permanently stored.” Moniz said the airport is using the system to flag people, even before the third phase starts. He said personnel from the American Medical Response and the Kahului Airport Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting Unit are tasked with testing passengers who are flagged for high temperatures. He said those who have been flagged so far using the cameras include a person who had a kidney infection and another with an ear infection.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A group that had been collecting online signatures for an education initiative called off the effort Thursday following a U.S. Supreme Court ruling against them late last month. The court case remains active, but it’s back at the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and not likely to wrap up with enough time left to get the initiative on the ballot. Reclaim Idaho contended it should be allowed to collect online signatures during the pandemic. The initiative would have raised $170 million for K-12 education by raising taxes on corporations and individuals making $250,000 or more annually. “This is an initiative that promised to save Idaho from deep cuts to the K-12 budget, and it’s an initiative that the vast majority of Idahoans support,” said Luke Mayville, co-founder of Reclaim Idaho, in a statement. The group backs initiatives and successfully got Medicaid expansion on the ballot several years ago that ultimately became law. Reclaim Idaho in the lawsuit filed in June said Republican Gov. Brad Little’s statewide stay-at-home order in late March because of the pandemic didn’t include exceptions for ballot initiative signature-gathering. The group said that violated the First Amendment-protected process of signature gathering, a form of political speech. Idaho does not allow online signatures for ballot initiatives. The state argued in court documents that allowing such signatures undermines the election process. Reclaim Idaho won in U.S. District Court and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, allowing online signature gathering. But the U.S. Supreme Court sided with Little, putting online signature gathering on hold and sending the case back to the appeals court to be decided on its merits.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Gov. J.B. Pritzker announced fresh restrictions Sunday for southwestern Illinois after a resurgence of COVID-19 cases. The rules, effective Tuesday, include limiting meetings and social events to the lesser of 25 people or 25% of overall room capacity and closing bars and casinos at 11 p.m. The restrictions follow three straight days of a positive test rate of 8% or higher. Illinois’ statewide average is 4.1%. “Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, I have made it clear that neither arbitrary dates on a calendar nor political pressure will dictate Illinois’ efforts to protect our people,” Pritzker said in a statement. “If the data shows we need to go backwards in our reopening, I won’t hesitate to tighten restrictions to protect our collective health.” The restrictions apply to seven counties, including Madison and St. Clair.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Arts, cultural and tourism organizations across the state can compete for a share of $10 million in aid intended to give a boost to groups impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. Lt. Gov. Suzanne Crouch has announced that qualifying organizations whose normal operations have been disrupted by COVID-19 are eligible for the state grants, which are funded by the federal CARES Act. “The arts and cultural sector adds vibrancy and depth to Hoosiers’ lives and is a significant factor in the health of Indiana’s tourism economy,” Crouch said. The funding will be jointly awarded by the Indiana Destination Development Corp. and the Indiana Arts Commission, The (Northwest Indiana) Times reported. Indiana-based nonprofit organizations can apply for the funds through the Indiana Arts Commission website at in.gov/arts/2567.htm. The application deadline is Sept. 8.Lewis Ricci, executive director of the state arts commission, said the funding “will help preserve the arts and cultural community assets that our citizens value.” “In cities, towns and counties both urban and rural, big and small, the arts play a vital role in economy, quality of life, and community identity,” Ricci said.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:Another three people with COVID-19 have died and there have been an additional 395 confirmed cases, the state reported Monday. There have been a total of 978 COVID-19-related deaths in the state. The state has a total of 52,616 confirmed cases of coronavirus, an increase of 395 since Sunday. Of those tested Sunday, 11.8% were positive. Since the state started tracking the positivity rate, 9.4% of people who have been tested were positive.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: Teachers who quit because they don’t feel safe returning to teaching in-person classes during the pandemic might have to pay their school districts up to $10,000 for backing out of their contracts. Penalties for quitting or resigning are meant to help districts find replacement teachers, but schools must prove that their penalty fee is based on the cost of replacing that teacher and not just an arbitrary amount designed to punish teachers. Educators said heading back to school seemed a lot safer before the resignation deadlines a few months ago when the coronavirus outbreak appeared nearly under control, KMUW-FM reported. The state had reported its lowest number of new coronavirus cases in two months and businesses were slowly reopening. Some educators said it’s unfair to charge teachers for escaping their contracts if the situation has changed and they no longer feel safe returning to the classroom. Marcus Baltzell, head of communications for the Kansas National Education Association, said forcing teachers to pay could just lead to more teachers quitting. “You can claw back as much money as you want, but if you’re not careful, then what you end up with is a district with no teachers,” he said. Usually districts ask for about $2,000, depending on how late a teacher leaves. But some districts do more. Emporia Public Schools is asking for $5,000 if a teacher resigns after August. The Syracuse school district near the Colorado border asks for $10,000.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Gov. Andy Beshear raised concerns about tightening supplies of testing materials and personal protective equipment in the fight against COVID-19. The Bluegrass State has built reserve supplies of some PPE and is in better shape than most states to deal with shortages of testing materials, Beshear said. “I believe that in Kentucky, we are in a much better place because of our local partnerships,” the Democratic governor told reporters. “But I will warn everybody that we’re starting to see the market tighten in both testing supplies, which are at a very difficult level, and PPE. It’s getting harder and harder, once again, to get certain items of PPE.” His concerns about the availability of crucial supplies come as Kentucky recorded its highest number of coronavirus cases in a single week. The state had 4,333 reported cases last week, Beshear said. He’s hoping the state has reached a “new plateau” in weekly cases.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Crawfish farmers are now eligible for a $16 billion coronavirus aid program run by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Crawfish are among scores of commodities added to the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program announced in May. Louisiana’s congressional delegation, state Agriculture and Forestry Commissioner Mike Strain, the Louisiana Farm Bureau Federation and the LSU AgCenter have been pushing to add farmed crawfish to the list. “For generations, crawfish have brought Louisianans together to celebrate the change in seasons, our faith, our families, and our heritage,” Louisiana’s U.S. senators and representatives said in a July 6 letter to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue. “While the social impact of the loss of these celebrations on the people of Louisiana can never be quantified, the economic loss to the State is estimated at over $146 million for 2020.” Program details are available at www.farmers.gov/cfap.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Maine’s community banks are getting credit for swiftly funneling aid to businesses through the Paycheck Protection Program. Although national banks prioritized large businesses, Maine banks helped small businesses stabilize and the economy with hundreds of millions of dollars of forgivable loans, the Portland Press Herald reported. More than 46% of Paycheck Protection Program loans over $150,000 were made by just six locally owned banks, according to data from the U.S. Small Business Administration. National banks were far less active in PPP lending in Maine. The top 10 national PPP lenders, including TD Bank, KeyBank, Bank of America and Chase Bank, provided just 13% of loans under $150,000, and about 17% of larger loans in the state. “I think everyone realized that the goal was to get as many of those loans approved and in the system as quickly as possible,” said Kim Donnelly, director of business banking at Gorham Savings Bank. To date, about 28,300 loans worth more than $2.2 billion have been made to Maine employers. The vast majority of loans are below $150,000. The loans could be forgiven if businesses meet certain spending and employment thresholds. Loan balances that aren’t forgiven could be repaid over up to five years at 1% interest.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis:The Maryland Department of Health will keep the results of rapid antigen tests separate from those of more accurate molecular tests in its official count of COVID-19 cases, a state health official said. The antigen tests, which are the centerpiece of Gov. Larry Hogan’s interstate compact to expand COVID-19 testing, can offer results in 15 to 20 minutes, rather than days. But they are also less sensitive than the standard molecular tests, known as PCR tests, experts said. The use of antigen tests in Maryland is limited, said Dennis Schrader, chief operating officer and Medicaid director for the Maryland Department of Health. The rapid tests will form the next phase of testing, he said – one that is focused on fast, high-volume screening. Because the antigen tests will focus more on screening than on diagnosis, he said, the results from those tests will be tracked separately from the results of PCR tests. Schrader said the antigen tests also will not be used to calculate the state’s positivity rate, a key metric that measures what percentage of COVID-19 test results are positive.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The city’s Museum of Science and a top Harvard University health expert have teamed to make it easier for anyone anywhere in the world to get answers to questions about the coronavirus pandemic. The interactive exhibit, featuring Dr. Ashish Jha and using StoryFile’s conversational video artificial intelligence technology, was unveiled Monday, the museum said in a statement. “ Ask a Virtual Expert: COVID Conversations with Dr. Jha “ allows the curious on-site and remotely to ask a digital image of Jha a multitude of questions about COVID-19. The answers are based on Jha’s responses to more than 550 questions. The museum’s goal is to make complex scientific topics accessible, President Tim Ritchie said in a statement. “The suite of COVID exhibit content we present in the museum and online – especially the opportunity to have a “personal” conversation with an AI version of one of the world’s leading public health scientists – does just that,” he said. Jha is a professor of global health at Harvard and director of the Harvard Global Health Institute. “Collaborating with the Museum of Science on this experience was, for me, an extraordinary opportunity to reach people – children and adults alike – with fact-based information about health policy, disease transmission, the importance of masks and social distancing and global efforts to combat COVID-19,” he said in a statement.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A state employee who was accused of stabbing a man after a face-mask dispute and was fatally shot by a sheriff’s deputy had been reprimanded for three separate work incidents from 2017 to 2018, according to state personnel filings. Michigan Department of Transportation employee Sean Ruis, 43, was disciplined following interactions with colleagues, according to The Detroit News. The newspaper cites filings it obtained through a public records request. Ruis had worked at the agency for 12 years. In a March 2017 incident, he was issued a notice of reprimand for approaching a coworker and questioning him about his use of leave. “You had been previously instructed, multiple times, by your supervisor and by labor relations, that the employee’s use of leave is confidential,” the notice said. “You continued to confront this coworker even after he had informed you that you were harassing him.” Ruis, 43, was shot last month near Lansing after a stabbing inside a Quality Dairy store. Authorities alleged he stabbed a 77-year-old man after being approached about not wearing a mask. The victim, John Duncan III, was left in critical condition and later died, family members said. Later, a sheriff’s deputy shot Ruiz when he tried to attack. He was holding a screwdriver and knives, authorities said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSauk Rapids:Students in the Sauk Rapids-Rice district will return to classrooms for the 2020-21 school year, but how a school day will work and which students can return first could be different between buildings and grade levels. Although the school board voted 6-1 at a special meeting Thursday to begin the school year with in-person learning for all students, the first weeks of classes might not see every student return all at once. “The biggest piece, from my perspective, is giving our staff and our students time to understand what our new normal is,” Superintendent Brad Bergstrom said at the meeting. “What we need to do at the elementary level, time-wise, may look a little different than what we need to do at the secondary level,” Bergstrom said, “and I think that we may need more than one week to do that in some circumstances.” The specific plans for reopening each building and grade level will fall to building administrators with guidance from the district, based on factors like the size of the building’s spaces and ability to allow for social distancing. All students might not return to school at the same time, Bergstrom said after the meeting. In a normal school year, he said, ninth- and sixth-graders begin the school year earlier than other students to get acclimated and transition to a new building. Mark Hauck was the only board member to vote against the in-person plan with building-specific slow starts.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Fall sports and extracurricular activities for students in Mississippi’s second-largest school district have been canceled amid concerns surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. Jackson Public Schools announced the decision Friday, The Clarion Ledger reported. “I know how disappointing the cancellation of sports and extracurricular activities may be for students, coaches and parents, but the school district must make decisions that make safety our top priority,” Daryl Jones, the district’s athletic director, said in a news release. “As we will not be able to host competitions with teams in a way that we can comply with the guidance from all levels of government and health officials, we must put safety first.” In the district’s announcement, alternative methods of developing student-athletes were outlined. Seniors can create highlight videos to introduce themselves to college coaches, officials said. Small group workout sessions emphasizing technique and skill development can also be conducted and there will be a winter showcase for senior student-athletes. Small group lessons will be held for band members and small-group tumbling assistance and training will be available for cheerleaders, the district said. The district cited Hinds County’s “hot spot” designation by Gov. Tate Reeves and Mississippi’s high positivity testing rate in making its decision. It also referred to the decision by Power 5 college conferences like the Big Ten and Pac 12 to not play sports this fall.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A security guard who was beaten in a confrontation over facemasks opened fire early Saturday and wounded one of his attackers. St. Louis Police said the shooting happened around 2:30 a.m. after the guard told three men they couldn’t be inside a Shell gas station because they weren’t wearing masks. The city is requiring masks to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The men left but kept the door open and taunted the guard, police said. When the guard ordered the men to leave the property, they surrounded him and began punching him in the face. One of the suspects grabbed the guard’s baton and struck him several times. The guard then shot at the suspects, hitting one of the men in the abdomen, police said. That man was dropped off at a hospital where he was listed in critical but stable condition. The other two suspects fled.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls:The number of COVID-19 cases in Montana dipped to 43 on Monday, a 53% drop and tying the lowest figure reported in 22 days. In north-central Montana, Cascade and Phillips counties reported one each. The total number of confirmed reports is now 5,792. Of those, 4,162 have recovered and 1,548 remain active, according to covid19.mt.gov. There are 92 people who are still hospitalized out of 330 total hospitalizations. The number of deaths remained at 82. The number of cases from Saturday, reported Sunday, was 92. There were 120 on Friday, 132 on Thursday and 142 on Wednesday, according to covid19.mt.gov. The last time 43 cases was reported was July 26. The lowest before that was 37 on July 5. Flathead County reported 15 cases, Yellowstone County had 11, Big Horn had 10 and Carbon had two, the state reported. Cascade, Gallatin, Madison, Missoula and Phillips counties each had one.\n\nNebraska\n\nWayne: Two Wayne State College professors said they are frustrated that their requests to teach remotely this fall were denied. Longtime history professor Don Hickey, 76, said he hired an attorney after college officials rejected his request. “This is a scandal to us – that they’re playing hardball with senior faculty and putting them at risk,” Hickey said. After Hickey told administrators he would teach his classes remotely whether they approved or not he was told his classes would be taught on campus by other faculty members. Hickey has taught at the school since 1978. A request by another Wayne State history faculty member, Joseph Weixelman, 63, also was rejected. Weixelman said he has multiple sclerosis and that medications for that disease suppress the immune system, which could make him more susceptible to severe illness from the COVID-19 virus. “I feel scared,” said Weixelman, who plans to teach his courses on campus. “With my age and a preexisting condition, I’m not sure I would make it through” a bout with COVID-19. A spokeswoman for the Nebraska State College System said fewer than 20 professors requested accommodations for teaching this fall under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Spokeswoman Judi Yorges said she wasn’t sure how many requests were granted. Yorges said in a statement that decisions “have been made with the best interests of our students and staff in mind. It is unfortunate if these efforts are misrepresented as ‘playing hardball.’ ”\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: In a letter to state officials, the food service provider at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas said it will lay off 940 employees. HMSHost sent a letter to the Nevada Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation about the decisions last Tuesday. The group also said that any workers that were furloughed and not scheduled to return to work by Oct. 15 will also be let go. Most of the layoffs are for those working as fast food clerks, restaurant hosts, baristas, bartenders and servers. Food and retail outlets at the airport have been severely affected by the pandemic, which has greatly diminished air travel. Although some outlets at McCarran have reopened with limited hours, many remain closed. “HMSHost continues to see an unprecedented decline in traffic in airports and on the motorways,” the company’s letter said. “The COVID-19 pandemic has devastated the travel and restaurant industries and, unfortunately, HMSHost sits at the crossroads of both. Never in the history of aviation and the hospitality industry, have we experienced such catastrophic customer traffic declines.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: When the coronavirus pandemic shut down schools and museums, the Aviation Museum of New Hampshire used its flight simulator to bring children on a virtual trip around the world in a Douglas DC-3, which is credited with helping the allies win World War II. “Every segment was a learning adventure in which we discussed the physics of flight, in which we discussed the culture and the history and the geography of the areas that we were flying over,” said Jeffrey Rapsis, the museum’s executive director. WMUR-TV reported that the museum celebrated the end of the remote learning program Saturday by displaying one of the 21 passenger propeller planes. Hundreds turned out, wearing masks to get a close look.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton:The state has a shortage of nearly 3,000 physicians, according to the New Jersey Physician Task Force of the New Jersey Council of Teaching Hospitals. And that shortage could become critically worse if COVID-19 restrictions have a serious impact on medical school students who have to accumulate clinical hours for their accreditation. The deans of Rowan University’s two medical schools are asking Gov. Phil Murphy to create a task force to address the threat of a projected physician shortage. Unless accrediting bodies, government agencies, hospital associations and medical regulators come together to address a possible threat to clinical hours and accreditation, those numbers exacerbate the physician shortage, said Dr. Thomas A. Cavalieri, dean of Rowan’s School of Osteopathic Medicine in Stratford, and Dr. Annette Reboli, dean of Cooper Medical School of Rowan University in Camden. “All these groups are stakeholders in this and need to come together to see to it that the medical schools are getting what they need in order to produce a physician workforce at the state and national level,” Cavalieri said. “If not, there’s a lot at risk. If we don’t address this issue, and we get hit with another pandemic, there will be a serious shortfall of appropriately trained physicians to respond.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nJemez Springs: A popular music camp in New Mexico is canceling its summer program for the first time in more than 60 years because of COVID-19. KRQE-TV reported organizers for the Hummingbird Music Camp in Jemez Springs recently made the decision as the state remains under health orders because of the virus. Camp Director Teena King said organizers had no choice but to cancel the rest of the 2020 summer season. “It hurt our hearts. We were so prepared to figure it out and go forward,” King said. King said she is keeping her business afloat by renting out the cabins on the camp’s property to families.\n\nNew York\n\nCanandaigua:After a late start to the summer season at the Kershaw Park beach because of the coronavirus pandemic, summer will be coming to an end earlier than usual at the city’s popular swimming area. The last day of swimming will be Saturday, about two weeks before the traditional Labor Day closing, according to City Manager John Goodwin. “I know it’s two weeks early, but unfortunately, we don’t have the staffing,” Goodwin said. The beach typically opens Memorial Day weekend, but that didn’t happen until June this year because of the pandemic. Noting that Ontario County’s Deep Run beach on Canandaigua Lake did not open this summer, Goodwin said “we were fortunate to get the staff to run all of July and most of August.” The city cannot allow swimmers to “swim at your own risk” – which is allowed on private properties such as hotels – because it is not permitted at public parks in New York, Goodwin said. In previous years, the tail end of the summer swim season has also brought beach closures as a result of blue-green algae blooms.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nChapel Hill: Another cluster of positive COVID-19 cases within student housing was announced Sunday at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The disclosure of cases within the Hinton James dormitory building marks the fourth such cluster – defined as five or more cases in close proximity – since the semester began Aug. 10 at the state’s flagship public university campus. The other three have occurred within an on-campus dormitory, private student housing and a fraternity house. As with the other clusters, the individuals testing positive in the Hinton James cluster are being isolated and receiving medical monitoring. Contact tracing is also happening.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: All North Dakota counties are aiming to have in-person voting as an option during the general election, a reversal from the June primary when all polling places were closed statewide amid the coronavirus outbreak. “Everyone is really moving ahead on in-person voting,” Donnell Preskey Hushka, executive director of the North Dakota County Auditors Association, said Monday. Election officials in the state’s 53 counties are “determining how many polling places they want or need.” Gov. Doug Burgum, at the request of the group, signed an executive order in March waiving the requirement that counties have at least one physical polling site for the June election, while allowing counties to conduct the primary election entirely by mail. Burgum stopped short of mandating that all polling places close during the state’s June election, despite being urged by county auditors to do so. The governor said he wanted to give counties the option of having open polling places, if they wanted. Hushka said county auditors, who serve as local election officials, have more time to plan for the upcoming election. More personal protective equipment also is available now for election workers and voters, she said.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Among the voices of athletes, parents and coaches clamoring for high school sports to proceed during the coronavirus pandemic is a booster with one of the state’s highest-profile platforms: Republican Lt. Gov. Jon Husted. Husted, a former University of Dayton football player, is working with Ohio’s high school sports oversight organization to develop a plan. He has been outspoken on his personal Twitter account in recent days that sports should go forward. Those tweets come as GOP Gov. Mike DeWine was expected to announce his order governing sports Tuesday – a plan that appears to leave a lot of decision-making to local officials. “What’s the greater risk to people under age 25, canceling in-person learning & extracurriculars (sports) to protect them from COVID or leaving it to chance how they’ll fill this time?” Husted tweeted on Aug. 10 to his more than 25,500 followers. “You can’t take these things away from young people & expect good (health, academic, life) results.” DeWine hinted last week that fall sports, including football and soccer, could go forward with limits and based on local decisions by parents, schools and health officials.\n\nOklahoma\n\nStillwater: Women living at an off-campus sorority house at Oklahoma State University have been placed in isolation and are prohibited from leaving the house after 23 of them tested positive for COVID-19, university officials confirmed Monday. “Due to the nature of this situation, the entire chapter house is in isolation or quarantine and will be prohibited from leaving the facility,” the university said in a statement. “One member of the sorority who lives elsewhere is among those who tested positive and will also remain in isolation.” A widely circulated video showed dozens of students without masks packed into a Stillwater nightclub over the weekend. “As a student, I’m frustrated as hell,” said Ryan Novozinsky, an OSU junior from Allentown, New Jersey, and the editor of the student newspaper. “These are people I have to interact with. People will tell you this age group isn’t affected, but there’s always outliers with diseases, and there will be professors they interact with, starting today, that won’t be able to fight this off.” OSU has a combination of in-person and online courses, and students, staff and faculty are required to wear masks indoors and outdoors where social distancing isn’t possible. The city of Stillwater also has a mandate that masks be worn inside businesses, but police Capt. Kyle Gibbs said the department doesn’t typically respond to reports of mask violations.\n\nOregon\n\nOntario: A person imprisoned at the Snake River Correctional Institution died Wednesday after contracting COVID-19, officials said. The death marks the second of an inmate who tested positive for the virus in custody of the Oregon Department of Corrections, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported. The person who died, a man between the ages of 60 and 70, was tested last Tuesday, officials said. His test results came back Friday confirming that he had contracted the virus. The Department of Corrections did not release the man’s name or exact cause of death. The state generally discloses the deceased person’s name, county of conviction and length of sentence, but officials have changed that practice for inmates who contract the virus. The first inmate to succumb to the disease in the state, a man between 50 and 60 years old, died at the Oregon State Penitentiary in Salem in May.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state plans to launch a coronavirus exposure-notification app in early September to more quickly break chains of transmission by using the new technology to notify people who might have been exposed, officials said. The state has a $1.9 million contract to deploy and maintain the app with software developer NearForm Ltd, the Ireland-based company whose app has been downloaded by more than one-fourth of that country’s residents. The app is based on smartphone technology developed by Apple and Google, and will undergo a pilot project next week, using state government employees and public health students, staff and faculty, officials told the Associated Press. The app will be interoperable with the state of Delaware’s app, and it also is expected to be interoperable with those of two other states, although Pennsylvania state officials declined to name those states because they are still in discussions with the app developer. It’s use will be limited to people 18 and over. It is similar to the app rolled out by Virginia earlier this month, when it became the first U.S. state to use new pandemic technology created by Apple and Google. North Dakota and Wyoming have also launched an app using the Apple-Google technology in recent days, and a number of other states are interested in it, Google has said. It is designed to automatically notify people if they might have been exposed to the coronavirus, and state officials said the app does not store location information, personal information or the identify of anyone who is in close enough range to possibly be exposed. It relies on Bluetooth wireless technology to detect when someone who downloaded the app has spent time near another app user who later tests positive for the virus.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state launched an online portal to help adults seeking training and work during and after the coronavirus pandemic connect with educational opportunities. The program, RI Reconnect, is a partnership between the state Office of the Postsecondary Commissioner and a grant from the Lumina Foundation. “With RI Reconnect, adult students are matched with a navigator who will work with them to identify and meet their goals, whether that’s earning a certificate, a license for a trade, or finishing a college degree,” Tammy Vargas Warner, the agency’s assistant commissioner, said in a statement Monday.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state Senate is coming back into session in two weeks to mull over possible election law updates necessitated by the coronavirus outbreak. In a news release Monday, Senate President Harvey Peeler said state senators would return Sept. 2 to “make plans to protect the voter and the vote” given that the pandemic continues in the run up to the November general election. “If the COVID-19 pandemic is still prevalent in our state, the Senate must make plans to protect the voter and the vote,” Peeler said. “We don’t know what the situation will be like in November, but we need to prepare for safe and secure voting.” State lawmakers had already been slated to return in mid-September, purportedly to discuss possible election tweaks, among other issues. House Majority Leader Gary Simrill said Monday that chamber would stick to its plans to return Sept. 15, not earlier. Ahead of the state’s June primary elections, state lawmakers in May agreed to several changes including universal absentee voting and a waiver of the witness requirement for absentee ballots. Referencing the “bipartisan manner” in which those issues were handled, Peeler wrote he was “hopeful we can do it again and return later in September to address the remaining legislative business.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:Mayor Paul TenHaken said a mask mandate for Sioux Falls is possible if cases continue to rise but said the city is in a good position with COVID-19 hospitalizations as schools prepare to open in the area. TenHaken, who said he was “so proud” of how Sioux Falls has responded in the five months since a COVID-19 case was confirmed in the city, spoke positively about where the city is, noting that an increase in the city’s rate of positive cases over the past three months had not been met with an equal increase in hospitalizations. TenHaken was joined by officials from Avera and Sanford on Monday to provide an update on the city’s response to the pandemic. With school starting soon – TenHaken noted his children are heading back this week – the mayor said the leaders of districts and schools have “nearly impossible jobs right now,” and asked the community as a whole to work together to keep transmission down – and to be prepared for when, inevitably, there are COVID-19 cases in schools.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A state lawmaker who was criticized for not wearing a mask at a Republican party dinner has been hospitalized, and colleagues said he has the coronavirus. Rep. Mike Carter tweeted Monday morning that he’s feeling better but expects ups and downs during his recovery. Carter, an Ooltewah Republican, was getting treatment for COVID-19 on Sunday in the intensive care unit of Erlanger hospital, his colleagues told the Chattanooga Times Free Press. “Our friend and colleague is battling COVID, and he is in ICU in Erlanger and we covet your prayers and so does he,” said House Republican Caucus Chairman Jeremy Faison. He said he and Carter texted each other earlier in the day. Carter attended a July 31 Hamilton County Lincoln Day dinner where a number of prominent Republicans were criticized for not wearing masks or social-distancing. He posted a photo of himself with U.S. Senate nominee Bill Hagerty, neither of them wearing a mask, and later tweeted in response to criticism that guidelines don’t require mask-wearing while dining. When the local health department announced on Aug. 5 there was a virus exposure at the event, Hagerty’s campaign said the candidate tested negative for the coronavirus. Carter chairs the House Civil Justice Committee, but was absent during last week’s special legislative session.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin:The Central Texas Food Bank will distribute free food using its mobile food pantries to help those who are facing increased food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic from 8 to 11 a.m. Thursday at Nelson Field in Austin and Saturday at Del Valle High School in Del Valle. Attendees will receive one box of assorted produce, 1 to 2 gallons of milk, one protein box weighing 8 to 20 pounds containing pork or chicken products and/or an emergency box of shelf-stable items. To adhere to social distancing requirements, pickup will only be available to those in vehicles. No walk-ups will be allowed. For more information, visit centraltexasfoodbank.org.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Officials on Monday confirmed the first U.S. cases of mink infected with the coronavirus following outbreaks in Europe. Five infected minks have been identified at two farms in Utah, the Department of Agriculture announced. Testing began after the farms reported unusually high mortality rates among the small animals prized for their fur. The Utah mink farms have also reported cases among workers. Infected humans can spread the virus to animals during close contact, but there is no current evidence that animals spread the disease to humans, authorities said. The impacted farms in Utah have been quarantined to stop the spread of the virus. Scientists believe the coronavirus that first infected people in China initially came from an animal source, probably bats, and later spread from person to person. Some animals, including cats and dogs, have picked up the coronavirus from people as it spread around the world. Scientists are studying outbreaks in Denmark, Spain and the Netherlands and exploring whether workers could have caught the virus from minks and, if so, how much of a further threat that type of transmission might pose. More than 1 million minks were killed on Dutch farms with outbreaks to prevent the spread of the disease.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington:Dwindling sales because of the COVID-19 pandemic have prompted Nepali Dumpling House in Burlington’s Old North End to close at the end of the month. The only bright side for her customers, owner Sabitra Phuyel said, is “everything is on sale” at the family operated deli and store. Her business, which opened in 2016, sells clothing, food, toys, household items and groceries, as well as takeout meals. The going-out-of-business sale will end on Aug. 31, as will Phuyel’s lease. Phuyel said she plans to put everything that remains, with the exception of perishables, in storage in the off-chance that she (or someone else) might revive the business one day.\n\nVirginia\n\nFarmville: Two outside experts will be allowed to inspect an immigration detention center in Virginia that has seen the worst coronavirus outbreak at any such facility in the nation, a federal judge said during a virtual hearing Monday. U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema agreed to a request from attorneys of inmates who have filed a lawsuit over conditions to allow a medical expert to conduct an inspection at the private facility in Farmville. Brinkema also agreed to a request from attorneys representing those running the facility to bring in one of their own experts. The judge instructed attorneys on both sides to draft an order allowing the visit. She could sign it as early as Monday afternoon. The visit could occur as early as this week. More than 80% of the center’s 300 detainees have tested positive for the virus, and one of those detained has died. Last week, the judge ordered immigration authorities to halt transfers into the detention center. She also excoriated U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for accepting 74 transfers from facilities in Florida and Arizona. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sent in its own team to inspect the facility last week. Dr. Homer Venters, the expert hired by the inmates’ attorneys, wrote in recently filed court documents that he attended a debrief provided by the CDC after its team visited the facility. Based on CDC observations, Venters wrote that it was difficult to maintain social distancing in some areas of the facility. He also wrote that staff do not use personal protective equipment appropriately and that many staff had exhibited symptoms of COVID-19 and continued working. Jeffrey Crawford, the director of Immigration Centers of America-Farmville, responded in his own filing. “CDC officials stated that ICA Farmville was largely in compliance with CDC recommendations, with only a few minor operational recommendations offered at that time, all of which I intend to implement at the facility,” he wrote.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The State Department of Health on Sunday reported 576 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 15 deaths. King County continues to have the highest numbers in the state, with 17,623 cases and 694 deaths. Yakima County is second, with 10,625 cases and 221 deaths. Pierce is third with 6,150 cases. Statewide totals from the illness caused by the coronavirus are at 67,461 cases and 1,781 deaths, up from 66,885 cases and 1,766 deaths on Friday. Thirty-seven people with confirmed COVID-19 cases were admitted to Washington state hospitals on Aug. 8, the most recent date with complete data. Late March had two days with 88 people admitted, the highest numbers to date during the pandemic. The total number of tests conducted is temporarily unavailable, according to the DOH. On Aug. 8, 6,394 specimens were collected statewide, with 5.4% testing positive. The average positive test rate for the seven days prior was 7%.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A recently released color-coding system for West Virginia public schools to stay open during the coronavirus pandemic is being tweaked to focus more on community spread, Gov. Jim Justice said Monday. The model will still use four colors to classify the status of each county’s school system based on the seven-day average of new daily cases per 100,000 people. The colors range from minimal community transmission in green, moderate transmission in yellow, higher transmission in orange and substantial transmission in red. Schools in counties that have an orange or red coding will not be allowed to have athletic competitions, and red counties must suspend in-person instruction and activate remote learning plans, Justice said. The change will now count each employee of a nursing home or prison who contracts the virus as one case. Before, employees were counted as half of a case. The reason for the change reflects the thinking that those people go out into the community, potentially advancing the spread of the virus, officials said. The color-coding map is based on a Harvard University model. But Dr. Clay Marsh, West Virginia’s coronavirus czar, said the Harvard model does not separate congregate and community spread of virus cases. “We live in such a a small population state,” Marsh said. “We have basically decided we will just look at what is the community spread.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee:Temperatures in at least one Wisconsin prison have reached at least 87 degrees this summer, intensifying health concerns in prisons, already considered among the most dangerous environments during the coronavirus pandemic. Gov. Tony Evers has opted not to consider any clemency requests from inmates, and corrections officials have rejected nearly all applications for early release based on health conditions. Already overcrowded, the population in state-run prisons is rising again after months of decline, though still down since the beginning of the year. More than 21,000 adults are held in buildings designed to house fewer than 18,000. Inmates and their family members have reported troubling conditions, including poor ventilation, high temperatures and the impossibility of social distancing. In at least one facility, staff are forcing inmates to keep doors closed to restrict airflow in response to coronavirus risk. The American Civil Liberties Union has called on Evers to reduce the incarcerated population before further spread of the virus. More than 300 inmates in state prisons have been infected and 21 cases remain active. Outbreaks have been worse in other states’ prisons.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: The coronavirus pandemic has local high school musicians marching to a different drummer. That was evident during the morning hours of weeklong band camps for Campbell County and Thunder Basin high schools as band members practiced the fundamentals without their instruments. Whether shaking off rust for the seniors or introducing freshmen to high school marching band for the first time, the young musicians began the new band year marking time to a far-from-familiar cadence. The bands are the first high school activity returning to a semblance of normalcy for the upcoming school year. Fall sports practices began Monday. This fact registered with Thunder Basin band director Steve Schofield, and it was not something he takes lightly, the Gillette News Record reported. “I wouldn’t say it’s nervousness, but it’s a pretty heavy responsibility,” Schofield said. “We could really screw this up for everybody. If my band was to end up with half of them sick or whatever, then that could make people question whether schools should be opening up. So what I told the kids when we started was we have to be extremely serious about this.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/08/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/09/27/bomber-boneyard-flying-farmer-crashes-blueberry-bonanza-news-around-states/118952548/", "title": "B-1 bomber boneyard, Flying Farmer crashes, Blueberry bonanza ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery:The state is considering whether to use $400million in pandemic relief funds to build new prisons, a proposal Gov. Kay Ivey and Republican legislative leaders said would save state taxpayers’ money, but that critics argue is not for what the funds are supposed to be used. Lawmakers on Monday begin a special session focused on a $1.3 billion prison construction plan to build at least three new prisons and renovate others. The projects would be done in phases and funded with a $785 million bond issue, $150 million in general fund dollars and $400 million from the state’s $2.2 billion share of American Rescue Plan funds. Ivey and Republican legislative leaders have defended the use of the virus funds, saying it will enable the state to essentially “pay cash” for part of the construction and avoid using state dollars as well as paying interest on a loan.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The state reported more than 1,700 resident COVID-19 cases Friday, which state health officials said included reports from earlier this month as they work to clear a backlog that has built up during the latest case surge. Health officials encouraged looking at cases by their symptom onset date versus the date they were submitted to the state health department. Dr. Anne Zink, the state’s chief medical officer, also recommended looking at weekly trends. Zink said the high daily report includes a mix of current and older cases, “but it does not diminish the fact we continue to see tremendous COVID spread in our communities.” Dr. Joe McLaughlin, the state epidemiologist, told reporters there is no indication yet that Alaska has hit a peak.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: More than a dozen B-1 bombers decommissioned by the Air Force have been flown to a boneyard in Tucson. The last of the 13 bombers destined for storage or disposal at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson arrived Thursday after being flown from a base in California, an Air Force statement said. The Air Force decommissioned a total of 17 B-1s, with the other four going to various locations for testing and other purposes. With the retirements of 17 of the B-1 bombers, 45 others remain in the Air Force’s active inventory. In addition, four of the B-1s sent to Davis-Monthan will be stored in a manner that would allow them to be put back into use if needed. The Air Force said retiring some of its B-1s will allow it to give more attention to remaining B-1s to increase their readiness while the service transitions to a bomber fleet consisting of only two types of aircraft – rebuilt B-52s and a new model, the B-21.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The number of COVID-19 patients in Arkansas’ hospitals hit its lowest point in two months on Friday as the state reported more than 1,300 new coronavirus cases. The state Department of Health reported COVID-19 hospitalizations dropped by 62 to 894. It’s the lowest number of COVID-19 patients the state has reported since 875 were hospitalized on July 24. The state reported 1,365 new coronavirus cases, bringing its total since the pandemic began to 491,221. Arkansas ranks 23rd in the country for new cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: California will strike the word “alien” from its state laws, getting rid of what Gov. Gavin Newsom called “an offensive term for a human being” that has “fueled a divisive and hurtful narrative.” Newsom on Friday signed a law that removes the word from various sections of the California state code. California passed laws in 2015 and 2016 that removed the word from the state’s labor and education code. But the law Newsom signed on Friday finishes the job by removing the word from all state laws. The word will be replaced with terms such as “noncitizen” or “immigrant.” “By changing this term, we are ensuring California’s laws reflect our state’s values,” Newsom said. The federal government has used the term “alien” to describe people in the U.S. who are not citizens since at least 1798 with the passage of the “Aliens and Sedition Acts.” But Assemblywoman Luz Rivas, a Democrat from Arleta, said the word “has become weaponized and has been used in place of explicitly racial slurs to dehumanize immigrants.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Whistleblower allegations that the state health department’s air pollution division interfered with staff efforts to properly enforce federal air quality standards are unsubstantiated, according to an independent report released Friday by the Colorado attorney general’s office. The Colorado Department of Law, which is led by Attorney General Phil Weiser, hired the independent investigator after a complaint was filed with the Environmental Protection Agency’s office of inspector general in March. Three whistleblowers alleged that dozens of air pollution permits were issued unlawfully by the health department’s Air Pollution Control Division to companies, and that at least one whistleblower was asked to falsify data to get pollution estimates under permitted limits. They also alleged that health department division leaders ignored EPA regulations on modeling and permitting short-term pollutants from important Colorado industries – including mines, asphalt plants and oil and gas gathering sites. They said the permits were part of a larger problem of state officials allegedly catering to industry. The Denver Post reported the findings released Friday didn’t substantiate the claims of fraud and suppression.\n\nConnecticut\n\nDurham: A retired Connecticut physician and surgeon’s license was suspended Friday by a state medical board for allegedly providing people she had not treated with blank vaccine, mask-wearing and other exemption forms, so long as they sent her a self-addressed stamped envelope in the mail requesting the paperwork. The state Department of Public Health said it received an anonymous tip in July about Dr. Sue Mcintosh of Durham sending people fraudulent exemption forms. After an investigation, DPH called on the Connecticut Medical Examining Board to hold Friday’s emergency hearing and summarily suspend the doctor, saying she poses a “clear and immediate danger to public health and safety.” The panel voted unanimously in favor of the suspension. A full hearing on the merits of the case is scheduled for Oct. 5.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: A judge has refused to order a hospital to administer the anti-parasitic drug ivermectin to a man who is seriously ill with COVID-19. Vice Chancellor Morgan Zurn said in a ruling issued Friday that patients, even if they are gravely ill, do not have a right to a particular medical treatment. She also said a health care provider’s duty to treat is bound by that provider’s standard of care. “While ivermectin has been approved as safe and effective to treat human parasitic infections, and so is distinct from a wholly unapproved new drug, DeMarco still has no right to compel its use to treat COVID-19 outside the standard of care,” Zurn wrote. The ruling came a day after a hearing in a lawsuit filed last week by Mary Ellen DeMarco on behalf of her husband, David, against Christiana Care Health Services. Despite refusing to issue an injunction sought by Mary Ellen DeMarco, Zurn indicated she was prepared to quickly consider an application for an interlocutory appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Two women, a pastor and a college student, who live in the D.C. area, will headline CBS's “Survivor 41” that premieres at 8 p.m. Wednesday, WUSA-TV reported. Shantel Smith, 34, who is from Toronto, is a pastor at Emmanuel Brinklow Church,.and Liana Wallace, 20, who is from Evanston, Illinois, is a junior at Georgetown University. The Emmy Award-winning series returns this fall on CBS as 18 new castaways will compete for $1 million and the title of Sole Survivor.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: A ferret has tested positive for the coronavirus in Florida, the first ferret to test positive for the virus in the United States, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture news release. A ferret in the European nation of Slovenia previously tested positive for the virus. USDA officials said samples from the Florida ferret were tested after the animal showed symptoms that included sneezing and coughing. Officials believed the ferret acquired the virus from an infected human. The small mustelids are commonly kept as pets. Officials didn’t say where in Florida the infected ferret was found. COVID-19 has been reported in several animal species around the world, usually animals that come in close contact with infected humans, officials said. The USDA said the the risk of animals spreading the virus to people is low and doesn’t recommend routine testing for animals.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: The largest city in coastal Georgia is in talks about a new way to recycle glass that it’s burying in a landfill, even though it still accepts glass in recycling bins. WTOC-TV reported Savannah officials are in talks with Glass WRX SC, a South Carolina company that seeks to recycle glass into air and water filtration systems, road surfaces and prefabricated interior walls. The city stopped recycling glass more than five years ago after running out of users willing to accept the bulky material. It’s a common problem nationwide. Savannah still finds new users for paper, plastic and metals that it collects from all-in-one recycling bins. In 2020, about 25% of what the city collected from recycling bins, including about 1,000 tons of glass, were buried in the city landfill. Some of that was because materials were too contaminated for further use. City officials recently toured Glass WRX SC’s facility in Beaufort, South Carolina. One use is turning glass into rock-like water filters.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Hawaiian Airlines said a passenger assaulted one of its flight attendants in an unprovoked attack during a flight. The airline said the incident occurred shortly after flight HA152 left Honolulu for Hilo at 7:30 a.m. Thursday. The flight attendant was walking down the aisle at the time. The pilot returned the plane to Honolulu. Deputy sheriffs assigned to the airport arrested a 32-year-old male passenger for third-degree assault based on information they received from the airline, said Toni Schwartz, a spokesperson for the state Department of Public Safety. The FBI was investigating the matter, said agency spokesperson Joy Van Der Voort. Hawaiian Airlines spokesperson Alex Da Silva said the flight attendant was evaluated for injuries and released from work to rest. The flight took off again for Hilo at 9:09 a.m.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The U.S. Department of Defense is taking input on its plan to build an advanced mobile nuclear microreactor prototype at the Idaho National Laboratory in eastern Idaho. The department began a 45-day comment period on Friday with the release of a draft environmental impact study evaluating alternatives for building and operating the microreactor that could produce 1 to 5 megawatts of power. The department’s energy needs are expected to increase, it said. The draft environmental impact statement cited President Joe Biden’s Jan. 27 executive order prioritizing climate change considerations in national security as another reason for pursuing microreactors. The draft document said alternative energy sources such as wind and solar were problematic because they are limited by location, weather and available land area, and would require redundant power supplies.\n\nIllinois\n\nRockford:The northern Illinois city that figured prominently in the movie “A League of Their Own” might be getting a museum of its own. The Rockford Zoning Board of Appeals voted unanimously last week to grant a special-use permit to build a $10 million International Women’s Baseball Museum at Beyer Park on the city’s southeast side, the Rockford Register Star reported. The city and the league gained international fame in 1992 when the movie starring Tom Hanks, Geena Davis and Madonna was released. At the park, Beyer Stadium was the actual home of the real Rockford Peaches of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League in the 1940s and 1950s. To put the museum on the site, the Rockford Park District, which owns Beyer Park, plans to sell an acre of land at the north end of the park to the International Women’s Baseball Center. The vote came after a group called Friends of Beyer Stadium urged the zoning board to find a different site for the museum – an effort the group said will continue as the issue moves to a Rockford City Council committee on Monday and the full council on Oct. 4.\n\nIndiana\n\nMuncie:A beverage can company has started work on a factory in eastern Indiana where it expects to produce about 3.6 billion cans a year. A groundbreaking ceremony was held last week for the new aluminum can factory in Muncie that will be operated by Canpack, a subsidiary of the Polish company Giorgi Global. The factory is expected to ultimately employ about 340 people, according to the company. The new factory will help meet the demand for more beverage cans in the U.S., company executive Tom Johnson told The Star Press. Johnson said the company plans to start recruiting employees early next year and have the factory in operation by late 2022. Delaware County approved 15 years of property tax breaks for the new factory, while the state agreed to provide up to $6 million in tax credits and worker training grants.\n\nIowa\n\nWaterloo: At least 16 people in eastern Iowa were charged with gun crimes after a two-day sweep by federal authorities this week. Grand juries met Wednesday through Friday in the U.S. District Court for Northern Iowa and issued the indictments, the Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier reported. Many of those indicted have already been charged in state courts for weapons offenses. Most of the indictments were for felons in possession of a firearm or for having a firearm and using drugs.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly said the state will adopt the recommendation from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concerning Pfizer booster shots as part of the effort to fight COVID-19. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky ruled Thursday that people 65 and older, nursing home residents and those ages 50 and older who have chronic health problems such as diabetes should be offered a booster once they’re six months past their last Pfizer dose. Kelly, a Democrat, said in a news release that she has authorized all COVID-19 vaccine providers to begin administering Pfizer booster shots to eligible Kansans as of Friday. Kelly said the CDC’s announcement “will provide additional protection to the most vulnerable Kansans and our frontline healthcare workers.”\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Gov. Andy Beshear called on the state’s residents Friday to honor a 15-year-old Fayette County student who died from COVID-19 by lighting porches with green lights. In a statement posted to social media, he also urged Kentuckians to “encourage vaccinations among friends and family and to mask up indoors.” Sophomore Christopher “C.J.” Gordon Jr. died from virus, Fayette County Superintendent Demetrus Liggins confirmed Thursday in a news release. Gordon’s mother, Renita Wright Gordon, told the Lexington Herald-Leader that Gordon always put other people first and you rarely saw him “not smiling.” Earlier this month, a 15-year-old Shelby County student who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 before the school year began also died from the virus.\n\nLouisiana\n\nAlexandria: Next month, people can order firewood from the Rapides Parish Sheriff’s Office and in the process help out the community and inmates. Sheriff Mark Wood has started a firewood project that can help recycle the many trees felled by recent hurricanes and winter storms. Priority for the wood will go to elderly and disabled residents of the parish, but anyone can buy up to two ricks beginning Oct. 1. Each rick costs $60, and sales are handled with money orders only. Wood told The Town Talk the object isn’t to make a lot of money through the venture. Some of the proceeds will go toward the upkeep of chainsaws and log splitters, and some will go into the sheriff’s office Inmate Welfare Fund. Money from the fund is “used to purchase basketballs and other sports equipment and work clothes or work boots for those inmates who have an economic need,” according to a news release. Some inmates don’t have family to help them with things like shoes, he said. He said the fund can help provide that so inmates “can continue paying back their debts to society.” Residents interested in buying wood through the program can call (318) 709-8489 to check availability. The sheriff’s office also asks local tree surgeons or cutters to call them if they have hardwood trees needing disposal.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Maine’s wild blueberry growers had a bounce-back year this summer after struggling with low prices and small crops sizes in recent seasons. The only commercial-scale wild blueberry growers in the U.S. harvest the fruit in Maine, mostly in the rural Down East region. The 2020 crop was less than 48 million pounds, and that was the lowest number since 2004. But the 2021 season, which ended recently, appeared to be much better, said David Yarborough, emeritus professor of horticulture with the University of Maine. He said the crop was likely about 90 million pounds, which would be the most blueberries since 2016. Growers had a better year in part because of a cool, wet July, Yarborough said. Hot summers and droughts have hurt the crop in recent years. It was also a good season for pollinators, Yarborough said. Prices were also up to about 70 cents per pound to farmers, which would be an improvement of 10 cents from last year and more than twice the number from 2017, when prices cratered, he said. Wild blueberries are smaller than cultivated blueberries, and they serve a slightly different niche in the market. Although many cultivated blueberries are sold fresh, the vast majority of the wild blueberry crop is frozen. The berries are also used extensively in processed food products.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: City officials said two sewer discharges have released an unknown amount of sewage in residential neighborhoods. The City Department of Public Works issued a notice of the overflows Saturday. One occurred in the Reiserstown area northwest of downtown and affected the stream known as Gwynns Falls. The other happened in the Poplar Hill neighborhood north of downtown and impacted the stream known as Jones Falls. Officials urged people to avoid swimming or other contact with the impacted streams.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: City Councilor and mayoral candidate Michelle Wu has won the endorsement of her former political rival and current office holder, Acting Mayor Kim Janey. Janey made the endorsement Saturday, the Boston Globe reported. In a statement, Janey said Wu has the record and values to protect and build upon the city’s progress in becoming more “equitable, just and resilient.” “Important policies like our housing agenda, equitable vaccine distribution, and how we handle mental health crises are on the line in this election,” said Janey. “Moreover, Black and brown residents who are most impacted by systemic inequities need a leader in City Hall who will center equity and inclusion in all her policies, and ensure they have a seat at the table when real decisions are made.” Wu was the top vote-getter in Sept. 14′s preliminary election. City Councilor Annissa Essaibi George came in second and also advanced to the Nov. 2 general election, and three major contenders – City Councilor Andrea Campbell, Janey, and John Barros – were eliminated.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s office said she will declare unenforceable a Republican-written budget provision that seeks to ban indoor mask requirements for children. The Democrat had been expected to block the language as unconstitutional since $55 billion in spending was unveiled and quickly passed by Michigan’s Legislature earlier this week. Spokesman Bobby Leddy confirmed this week’s move in a statement, calling the proposed restriction “dangerous.” The provision, which is not tied to spending, would prevent the state health director and local health officers from issuing or enforcing orders that require children under age 18 to wear a face covering. More than a dozen counties, including most of the state’s most populated ones, mandate masking in schools to curb COVID-19. Various K-12 districts in other counties also require face coverings. The governor and GOP legislators did negotiate other language related to coronavirus vaccine exemptions and reporting requirements for epidemic orders.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: State regulators launched a court-ordered process for assessing the risks to clean water from waste from the proposed PolyMet copper-nickel mine in northeastern Minnesota. The Department of Natural Resources announced plans for a trial-like proceeding known as a contested case hearing, which was ordered by the Minnesota Supreme Court in April. The hearing will be confined to the narrow question of whether the bentonite clay lining planned for the mine’s waste basin would be sufficient to keep pollution contained. A prehearing conference has been set for Nov. 1. An administrative law judge will later schedule the hearing itself, which will be a potentially lengthy proceeding in which all sides can present evidence and call witnesses before the neutral judge, who will report his findings back to the agency. The open pit mine and processing plant near Babbitt and Hoyt Lakes would be Minnesota’s first copper-nickel mine. Environmentalists have fought it because of the potential for acid mine drainage.PolyMet said the mine will be safe and that the project has undergone more than a decade of thorough, public environmental reviews.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state will soon start rebuilding a section of highway that collapsed during torrential rainfall brought by Hurricane Ida, the head of the state Department of Transportation said. Two people were killed and nine injured Aug. 30 as seven vehicles plunged into a deep pit that opened up on the dark, rural stretch of Mississippi Highway 26 near Lucedale. One of the injured people died in a hospital on Sept. 11. Department of Transportation Director Brad White told legislative budget writers Friday that the department has completed a geotechnical review and will choose a company early next month to repair the damage for about $1.2 million. He said the highway could reopen in about 45 days. White said the area had received more than double its average annual rainfall before the hurricane, and then Ida dumped more than 12 inches of rain in less than a day. The stretch of highway is on a hillside, and White said the deluge blew out a pipe that ran under the roadbed.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: State lawmakers who want to halt all public funds to Planned Parenthood are recommending the Legislature give Republican Gov. Mike Parson’s administration authority to cancel abortion providers’ Medicaid contracts based on behavior in other states deemed illegal or unethical. The Senate Interim Committee on Medicaid Accountability and Taxpayer Protection approved a report with that recommendation on Thursday. Planned Parenthood is Missouri’s only abortion provider. Abortion providers are prohibited from using Medicaid funds for abortion except when the mother’s life is in danger or in the cases of rape or incest. Some lawmakers want to pull all public funds, including those for birth control, sexually transmitted disease treatments, cancer screenings and other health care for low-income women. Democrats warned that the move would trigger a confrontation with the federal government that could threaten the overall Medicaid program.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A therapeutic boarding school in northwestern Montana, which state inspectors learned had once made boys sleep outside in winter conditions without proper clothing as punishment, closed Friday. Staffers confirmed to the Montana State News Bureau on Tuesday that the 16-bed Wood Creek Academy near Thompson Falls was shutting down. A message had also been posted on the program’s website, which had been pulled down by Friday. Wood Creek Academy, a residential boarding school for boys ages 13 to 18, had been the subject of two complaints filed with the state within the past year and inspections uncovered other infractions. The state health department sent inspectors to the boarding school in January in response to a complaint. The inspection found two boys ran away from the school one morning in January and Wood Creek Academy staff waited for more than an hour before calling law enforcement. As punishment for running away, staff prohibited the boys from having any interaction with their peers for three days. Such punishment is prohibited under state regulations. The inspector reported the boys also were sent to sleep in shorts and T-shirts in tents as nighttime temperatures dipped as low as 28 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nNebraska\n\nKearney: Authorities in south-central Nebraska said a teenage girl survived after a car she was driving collided with a train. The collision was so violent that her car’s engine was ejected. The crash happened Wednesday at a rural railroad crossing west of Kearney, the Kearney Hub reported. Buffalo County Sheriff’s officials said Sydney Conner, 17, was traveling north on a county road about 7:45 a.m. when her car collided with a westbound Union Pacific train. Sheriff’s Sgt. Ramey Ristine said investigators believe Connor was blinded by the rising sun as she approached the crossing and didn’t see the train. There are no crossing arms at that railroad intersection, but it is marked with stop signs.\n\nNevada\n\nElko: A hospital in rural northeastern Nevada is pleading with residents to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and to take other precautions to help slow the spread of the coronavirus to “keep our health care system from being overrun.” The Northeastern Nevada Regional Hospital in Elko said Friday the virus was “running rampant”” in the region and that the hospital’s intensive care and medical-surgical units were near capacity and that it had postponed elective surgeries and added beds. “As a hospital staff, we are pleading with you to practice the precautions we know are effective in stopping COVID-19,” the hospital said in a statement posted on social media. “Avoid large gatherings, wear a mask when around people from outside your household, observe physical distancing, and practice good hand hygiene. Most importantly, please get vaccinated against COVID-19.” The hospital said wait times were longer than normal but that it was still able to safely provide medical care. “Please help us slow the spread of COVID-19 and keep our healthcare system from being overrun,” the hospital said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A former high school teacher accused of soliciting sexually explicit videos from a student for money and making and possessing child pornography has pleaded guilty to human trafficking and manufacturing child sex abuse images. Joshua Harwood, 38, of Manchester entered his pleas to the two felony counts on Wednesday, the Concord Monitor reported. Harwood had taught business at the high school, where he was hired in July 2020. Police were notified of the allegations involving a minor in December and Harwood was placed on administrative leave. He was later arrested and has been in jail since February. A sentencing hearing is scheduled for Oct. 19. On the trafficking charge, attorneys are recommending a sentence of 31/ 2 to seven years in jail, which may be suspended if Harwood completes a sex offender program. They’re recommending a consecutive sentence of 71/2 to 15 years, a portion of which may be suspended, for the manufacturing charge.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nCherry Hill:The New Jersey craft beer scene took home a few big honors at this year's Great American Beer Festival in Denver. Among the 265 breweries awarded 290 medals from the Brewers Association were Mechanical Brewery of Cherry Hill, which took home the gold in the English mild or bitter category for its Momentum. Departed Soles Brewing Co. of Jersey City and Spellbound Brewing of Mount Holly each took home silver medals. The Jersey City brewery was honored in a gluten-free beer category for None Shall PATH, and the Mount Holly brewery won for its wood- and barrel-aged beer for Porter Aged on Palo Santo. The Great American Beer Festival honored beers in 97 categories spanning 175 styles in the 35th edition of its competition, with judging held across 17 days and 34 sessions, according to a news release.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham visited southern New Mexico on Friday to talk with fellow elected Democratic leaders and business groups about economic development and to tour a military base near the U.S.-Mexico border where Afghan refugees are being housed. The Democrat’s visit was not made public until late in the afternoon. Her office said she walked through the processing area at Fort Bliss Army base, spoke with volunteers about the need for winter coats and other items for those at the facility and saw how the refugees were screened for COVID-19. “Whenever the federal government tells us they need our help, New Mexico is ready to help these families on their way,” Lujan Grisham said in a statement after the tour. There was no indication that Lujan Grisham visited the U.S.-Mexico border while in the area. She has faced criticism in recent months for not doing more to address the concerns of residents along the border amid the latest influx of immigrants.\n\nNew York\n\nHolbrook: Mourners began arriving at a Long Island funeral home viewing Sunday for Gabby Petito, whose death on a cross-country trip has sparked a manhunt for her boyfriend. A line had formed outside the funeral home in Holbrook, about 35 miles east of New York City, by noon, and groups of firefighters were seen filing past. A fire truck sat on each side of the building, each with its ladder raised. Across the street from the funeral home, a chain link fence was adorned with posters featuring Petito’s image and messages such as, “She touched the world.” Petito was reported missing Sept. 11 by her parents after she didn’t respond to calls and texts for several days while she and Brian Laundrie visited parks in the West. Her body was discovered Sept. 19 in a remote area in northwestern Wyoming. Laundrie and Petito grew up on Long Island but in recent years moved to Florida. Petito’s death has been classified as homicide, meaning she was killed by another person, but medical examiners in Wyoming haven’t disclosed how she died pending further autopsy results. The couple posted online about their trip in a white Ford Transit van converted into a camper. They got into a physical altercation Aug. 12 in Moab, Utah, that led to a police stop for a possible domestic violence case. Ultimately, police there decided to separate the quarreling couple for the night. But no charges were filed, and no serious injuries were reported. Investigators have been searching for Laundrie in Florida, and searched his parents’ home in North Port, about 35 miles south of Sarasota.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Authorities said a bank robber was caught after they determined he had taken his getaway vehicle for a test drive from a car dealer. The Raleigh-based U.S. Attorney’s Office said in a news release that 68-year-old Glenn Alin Martinoff was sentenced to more than four years in prison on Thursday after previously pleading guilty to bank robbery. The news release said Martinoff entered a Wilmington bank in January wearing a mask and gloves and brandishing a large screwdriver. He robbed the location of more than $6,000, authorities said. Investigators using surveillance video determined his getaway car was for sale at a nearby dealership. The news release said that authorities found out he had taken the car for a test drive to use as his getaway car. The news release said investigators found the cash and clothing worn during the robbery during a search of his apartment.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMakoti: The first car jumping attempt in five years by North Dakota’s version of Evil Knievel ended in disaster when the car driven by the man known as the Flying Farmer corkscrewed off the ramp and rolled. Authorities said John Smith, 57, was alert after the crash Saturday at a rural gravel pit and that he even tried to pull himself out of the car while talking to rescuers. He was eventually cut out and taken by a medical helicopter to a hospital, according to firefighters. The extent of his injuries wasn’t known. The crowd of about 300 spectators went silent when Smith crashed. Family members, including his daughters and wife of 34 years, Melinda, reacted emotionally, running to the mangled car, The Bismarck Tribune reported. Smith’s previous jump was in 2016, when he rose over towering flames to clear a burning trailer. Smith, who farms near Makoti, in western North Dakota, said he was inspired by the motorcycle daredevil Knievel while growing up. He has gained notoriety for his jumps at fairs and other attractions across the state. He has performed more than 100 jumps, even jumping on a frozen lake.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Gov. Mike DeWine’s top lobbyist, a man linked to an ongoing federal bribery investigation but never charged, resigned Friday after three years on the job. Legislative Director Dan McCarthy cited “the pace and grind” of the job and referred to predecessors who warned him against serving more than two years. “I know I’ve run quite a bit over my two year commitment but I think now is the right time to resign as your Legislative Director,” McCarthy wrote in his letter to DeWine. Federal prosecutors charged five individuals last year, including the then-House speaker, with orchestrating a $60 million bribery scheme to assure the 2019 passage of a bill bailing out two nuclear power plants. Prosecutors said the scheme also involved killing efforts to put a petition on the ballot to overturn the bailout. The power plants were operated at the time by a wholly-owned subsidiary of Akron-based FirstEnergy Corp. McCarthy is a former FirstEnergy lobbyist who was president of one of the dark money groups, Partners for Progress, which has been implicated in the alleged bribery scheme. McCarthy has said his actions were legal and DeWine’s office has said it has no indication McCarthy is a target of the investigation, which continues.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOkmulgee: Muscogee Nation voters have approved press protections for their tribe’s news enterprise. Citizens voted 1,914-596 last week to amend the tribe’s constitution to include press protections and mandate funding for Mvskoke Media, Indian Country Today reported. Although freedom of the press is guaranteed in the U.S. Constitution, many tribal nations lack such language in their constitutions. The Muscogee amendment allows the tribe’s news enterprise – which includes print, broadcast and digital operations – to operate “free from political interest or undue influence, harassment, censorship, control or restrictions from any department” of the tribe’s government. The effort traces to 2015, when the tribe passed the Free Press Act establishing independent media. Its governing body later repealed the law during an emergency meeting. Last year, tribal leaders unanimously restored the press freedoms by passing the Independent Muscogee (Creek) Press Act, which was viewed as a positive step.\n\nOregon\n\nNewberg: A school board has banned educators from displaying Black Lives Matter and gay pride symbols, prompting a torrent of recriminations and threats to boycott the town and its businesses. Newberg, a town of 25,000 residents situated 25 miles southwest of Portland in gorgeous wine country, has become an unlikely focal point of a fight between the left and right across the nation over schooling. The City Council has condemned the action by the Newberg School Board. So did members of color of the Oregon Legislature and House and Senate Democrats. The American Civil Liberties Union of Oregon is threatening to sue. The Oregon State Board of Education called on the school board to reverse course, saying student identities should be welcomed and affirmed. But the four conservative members of the seven-member board are digging in their heels. Member Brian Shannon, who proposed the ban, said lawmakers from Portland should keep out of the school district’s business and instead focus on Portland, where homelessness is an issue.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has joined a federal investigation of Pennsylvania’s largest pension fund and is seeking among other things records to determine whether improper “compensation and gifts” might have been offered staff, a newspaper reported. The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that the commission is also seeking records earlier sought by the U.S. attorney’s office about what officials of the $64 billion Public School Employees’ Retirement System have called a mistake in calculating the fund’s long-term investment performance. The newspaper reported that the subpoena given to the school pension plan Friday was the first indication that investigators are looking into possible presents or money from investment advisers and consultants. State employees are forbidden from accepting such gifts under a ban imposed by Gov. Tom Wolf. The Securities and Exchange Commission pursues civil rather than criminal complaints and has broad power to impose fines, discipline financial players and order changes. Pension fund system spokesperson Steve Esack said Saturday that the fund had no comment on the SEC action, the newspaper said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The man authorities sid leads the Rhode Island chapter of the Hells Angels motorcycle club has turned down a plea deal that would have sent him to prison for five years, and will now take his chances at trial. Joseph Lancia, 30, of Smithfield told a judge Thursday that he would rather go to trial, WPRI-TV reported. He faces multiple criminal counts stemming from two incidents. In one case, he is charged with shooting at a truck in June 2019 being driven by a former Hells Angels prospect with whom he had a dispute. He is charged with felony assault and battery in that case. He is also charged with knocking someone unconscious with a punch outside a Providence strip club in March 2020. Prosecutors initially offered a deal that came with eight years in prison, but after speaking with the judge, the sentence was lowered to five. Assistant Attorney General Joseph McBurney said if Lancia is found guilty at trial on all counts, he faces 61 years behind bars. Lancia, who is out on bail, refused to comment outside of court.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nSt. George: State transportation officials want to hear from the public about a project to widen part of Interstate 26 and improve one of the state’s key interchanges. The state is spending $19 million on preliminary engineering work to widen 22 miles of I-26 in Orangeburg, Berkeley and Dorchester counties. The project also will modernize I-26’s interchange with Interstate 95. The tight, curving off ramps often cause backups. The Department of Transportation is accepting comments about the project until Oct. 10 on its website. The project from Exit 165 to Exit 187 on I-26 will also improve interchanges and take other steps to make the highway safer. It is also part of a larger plan to have three lanes in each direction on I-26 from Charleston to Columbia by the end of the decade.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: A Missouri-based battery manufacturer has selected Rapid City for a factory complex that it said could employ up to 1,500 people. AEsir Technologies plans to construct four buildings. The first building will be a 150,000-square-foot manufacturing and distribution center capable of producing 1.2 million batteries annually. The company initially plans to hire 400 employees and expand to 1,200 to 1,500 employees. The first phase will cost about $90 million, with a total price tag of $300 million when all four phases of the development are finished, according to CEO Randy Moore. The company looked for an available labor force, an economic development incentive package and community support when searching for the ideal location for the new facility, Moore said. Twenty other communities were considered for the facility. Moore said easy access to rail, a state highway and Rapid City Regional Airport were also factors in the company’s decision to choose Rapid City. AEsir Technologies manufactures nickel zinc batteries that Moore said are two to three times more powerful than lithium ion batteries and last just as long. He said they use potassium hydroxide as the electrolyte, an active ingredient in soaps and shampoos, which makes the batteries environmentally friendly.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville:Tennessee Supreme Court Justice Cornelia Clark has died at the age of 71, the court announced Friday. She had been diagnosed with cancer. According to a news release, Clark died overnight after 16 years in her role, serving the longest tenure of her counterparts on the court while she was on the bench for more than 1,100 Supreme Court cases. Republican Gov. Bill Lee, who will select Clark’s replacement, called her a “trailblazer for women in the legal profession.” Clark was appointed to her seat in 2005 by former Democratic Gov. Phil Bredesen and served as chief justice from 2010 to 2012. Chief Justice Roger Page said Clark, better known as Connie, “loved the Tennessee judicial system and has made it better in immeasurable ways.” All but one of the remaining justices – Sharon Lee, whom Bredesen also appointed – were appointees of former Gov. Bill Haslam, signaling a likely shift further rightward for the court with an appointment by Lee. The Governor’s Council for Judicial Appointments will recommend three candidates to the governor, who will make his pick. The Legislature must confirm the selection.\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso:A group of 14 Mexican soldiers was detained Saturday after inadvertently crossing the border at the Bridge of the Americas in El Paso, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman said. The soldiers were returned to Mexico after being detained by CBP for about 5 hours. One of the soldiers was issued a civil fine for being in possession of a personal-use amount of marijuana, CBP said. The incident occurred shortly after midnight Saturday when CBP officers saw two Mexican military vehicles cross the international border line on the middle of the bridge, CBP said. The bridge is also known as Puente Internacional Córdova de las Américas and as the Puente Libre, or free bridge, because there is no bridge toll charge. CBP officers approached the military trucks and temporarily detained the soldiers and secured their weapons and equipment. Photos shared on social media showed soldiers sitting on the asphalt and a military pickup stopped near the CBP checkpoints at the foot of the bridge on the El Paso side. The soldiers told CBP that they did not realize they had entered U.S. territory. CBP contacted Mexican military leadership who soon arrived at the international bridge. Shortly before 5 a.m., all the soldiers, equipment and vehicles were returned to Mexico, CBP said. Similar border incidents have occurred over the years, often involving Mexican soldiers or federal police from other parts of Mexico who cross the borderline into the U.S. at the middle of the international bridges in El Paso.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The home arena of the NBA’s Utah Jazz announced Friday that it will require proof of vaccination against COVID-19 or a negative coronavirus test for all fans over the age of 12. Vivint Smart Home Arena, located in Salt Lake City, will require fans to present proof of vaccination or a negative coronavirus test taken within 72 hours of the event to enter the venue. Employees who work at the arena are required to be fully vaccinated. “As a community gathering place, we have a responsibility to protect our guests by putting health and safety standards in place,” Jim Olson, president of Vivint Arena and the Utah Jazz, said in a statement. “We believe this is the path forward to shut down this pandemic.” Guests under the age of 12 will be allowed inside the arena if they wear a mask at all times. Other guests are strongly encouraged to wear a face mask, but it is not mandatory.\n\nVermont\n\nWilliston: Three people were sent to a hospital with nonlife-threatening complaints Friday after being exposed to bear spray at a local hotel, the Williston Fire Department said. Emergency crews were sent to a local inn about 10:30 a.m. Friday after receiving a report that four employees were having difficulty breathing. The investigation determined a can of bear attack deterrent was left in one of the second floor rooms where it was accidentally discharged by housekeeping staff. Bear spray is stronger than police pepper spray. Officials said 30 people in the hotel were evacuated. Three people were taken to a hospital and a fourth was treated at the hotel and released. The firefighters ventilated the building. Occupants and staff of the hotel were able to reoccupy the building shortly after noon.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: The University of Virginia has announced plans for a new performing arts center funded by a $50 million donation. University President Jim Ryan said the gift is being made by Tessa Ader. The news release said the new center for dance, concerts, theater and other performances will be in the area known as the Emmet-Ivy corridor. “My late husband, Richard, and I long felt that a state-of-the-art performing arts center was needed by the University of Virginia,” Ader said in a statement to The Daily Progress. “I believe this new facility will be a wonderful asset to our community and am hopeful my gift will encourage others to come forward as well to make it a reality.” Although designs haven’t been completed, the university said the center will include a concert hall with more than 1,000 seats, a 150-seat recital hall and rehearsal studios. The center will also hold national touring artists. “The performing arts center will be a place that celebrates the arts as fundamental to the human condition, a university education and a democratic society,” Ryan said in the news release.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: An administrative law judge has recommended that a Native American tribe in Washington state once again be allowed to hunt gray whales – a major step in its decadeslong effort to resume the ancient practice. “This is a testament to what we’ve been saying all these years: that we’re doing everything we can to show we’re moving forward responsibly,” Patrick DePoe, vice chairman of the Makah Tribe on the remote northwestern tip of the Olympic Peninsula, said Friday. “We’re not doing this for commercial reasons. We’re doing it for spiritual and cultural reasons.” DePoe was in high school in the late 1990s when the Makah were last allowed to hunt whales – occasions that drew angry protests from animal rights activists, who sometimes threw smoke bombs at the whalers and sprayed fire extinguishers into their faces. Since then, the tribe’s attempts have been tied up in legal challenges and scientific review. A federal appeals court ruled in 2002 that the Makah needed a waiver under the Marine Mammal Protection Act; the tribe applied for one in 2005 but still hasn’t received one. On Thursday, nearly two years after he presided over a hearing on NOAA Fisheries’ proposal to approve the waiver, administrative law Judge George Jordan issued his 156-page recommendation to the U.S. Department of Commerce, finding that the tribal hunts would have no effect on the healthy overall population of the whales. The recommendation, along with a public comment period and further environmental analysis, will inform the department’s final decision, though no timeline for that has been set. As proposed, the waiver would allow the tribe to land up to 20 Eastern North Pacific gray whales over 10 years, with hunts timed to minimize the low chances of the hunters accidentally harpooning an endangered Western North Pacific gray whale.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice is urging residents who got the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine to get their booster shot, citing the rising number of hospitalizations involving vaccinated people. There were 16,223 active COVID-19 cases reported statewide on Friday, with 1,008 people being treated in a hospital, according to the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources. The number of fully vaccinated people who have been hospitalized has increased 20%, Justice said. “That tells us there’s a growing need, more and more and more, for people that are fully vaccinated to get their booster shot,” he said. He said booster shots are available, for the most part, for people age 18 and over who had their second Pfizer shot at least six months ago. Booster shots are not yet available for other vaccines. Justice also pleaded again for the unvaccinated to get the vaccine. He said 3,700 doses have been given since the last update, but that’s not enough. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, West Virginia ranks last among the states in doses administered per 100,000 population.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee:North America’s oldest polar bear living in human care at the Milwaukee County Zoo has died, zoo officials said Saturday. The Journal Sentinel reported 36-year-old Snow Lilly was euthanized Friday because of her declining health and subsequent quality of life concerns. According to the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, the median life expectancy for polar bears in human care is about 23 years. A recent wellness exam found Snow Lilly had heart disease and was undergoing other age-related changes, the release said. Snow Lilly came to the Milwaukee County Zoo in 2005 from the Bronx Zoo. “Snow Lilly was a visitor favorite at the Zoo and considered one of the iconic animals in the population,” said Zoo Director Amos Morris in a statement. “She will be sorely missed by both staff and visitors.” In recent years, the zoo called on Snow Lilly to stand in for a groundhog and usher in spring at a Groundhog’s Day celebration in 2018. She also shared a birthday with Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Christian Yelich. A necropsy will be performed, as important information can continue to be collected from it and help other polar bears living in human care. Final necropsy results will be forthcoming in the upcoming months.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: Kristi Gabriel, 42, who survived a brush with death with COVID-19 but also lost her father and aunt to the disease, is pleading for the public to get vaccinated. “Even though I’ve gone through what I’ve gone through, some of my family still doesn’t agree with the vaccine,” she said. “And it’s shocking. It’s difficult to try to explain things to them. … I know there is a lot of misleading information out there and I know sources are trying to cut down on that, but you can’t eliminate them all. It’s unbelievable some of the fictitious stuff that’s out there and people are buying into.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/08/24/paulies-push-sweet-connie-vr-brain-rewiring-news-around-states/118465756/", "title": "Paulie's Push, sweet Connie: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nPanola: General Store owner Dorothy Oliver has persuaded and helped almost everyone in her community to get their COVID-19 shots. In her decades living in Panola, Oliver has become one of the most influential people in the area. She is the vice president of the local day care center and on the board of the community center, in addition to owning her store. “All of them know me,” she said of her customers. “They come in, and I just start talking to them like I know them. I don’t have to know you to talk to you.” And she isn’t afraid to ask about their vaccination status. “Back in December, whenever vaccination started, I started with it,” she said. “I went to calling all the older people around in the community, trying to make sure how their mind is and make sure they started thinking on going and getting a shot whenever it got ready for them.” By the time doses were readily available in Alabama, there were not any vaccination sites in the immediate area, with the closest facilities about 40 minutes away. So Oliver volunteered to schedule neighbors’ appointments and drive them to and from the sites. According to Oliver’s records, only about 20 adults in the community of roughly 350 people are left unvaccinated. “I know all my people that haven’t got it,” she said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Three-time Super Bowl champion Mark Schlereth returned home to encourage people to get COVID-19 vaccines. Anchorage Daily News reports the Service High alumnus made a halftime appearance Friday night at West High, where his alma mater squared off against the West Eagles. “I just want to encourage everybody to do your part, to talk to your doctor, and if it’s the right decision for you, please get vaccinated,” Schlereth said. “Please take care of one another.” He has been advocating for COVID-19 shots on social media, and he said the NFL Players Association reached out to him about spreading the word in his home state. Almost 54% of Alaska residents 12 and older have been inoculated, according to the state dashboard. Schlereth, 55, was diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder in 1993 while playing for Washington. He said one of the reasons he got the vaccine was to visit with his mother, who has cancer. “I wanted to spend as much time safely with her as possible … so it was just a no-brainer for us,” Schlereth said. He said one of his high school coaches whom he considered a mentor died Thursday from COVID-19. “I just lost a dear, dear friend who refused to get vaccinated, so that hit home for me,” he said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Private businesses can require their employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19 but must allow reasonable religious and medical exemptions under state and federal law, Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich wrote in a legal opinion. And they can impose vaccine requirements on patrons as well, as long as they provide reasonable accommodation for customers who can’t take a vaccine because of a disability and don’t discriminate against those who won’t for religious reasons, the Republican wrote in Friday’s opinion. Public schools and universities and local and state government agencies are different because of laws enacted this year by the Republican-controlled Legislature and signed by GOP Gov. Doug Ducey. They are not allowed to require employees or students to get inoculated once the new laws take effect Sept. 29. But private schools can, if they allow exemptions for religious or health reasons. Ducey last week issued an executive order barring state and local governments from requiring vaccines, based on an existing law that says health agencies can’t force people to be treated if they comply with sanitary or quarantine rules. A violation carries criminal sanctions.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Connie Hamzy, a rock ’n’ roll groupie from the Natural State who was immortalized as “sweet, sweet Connie” in the 1973 Grand Funk Railroad hit “We’re an American Band,” has died. She was 66. “I was determined to become a famous groupie,” Hamzy, who lived in Little Rock, told KTHV in 2019. She told the station she was finishing her senior year of high school when the manager of Grand Funk Railroad called to say her name would be in a song. “I said, ‘Yeah I’ll have to see it to believe it,’ ” she said. But that summer, at the lake with friends, she heard a radio announcer introduce the new song and note that a local girl was in the first few lines, she said. “Out on the road for forty days. Last night in Little Rock put me in a haze. Sweet, sweet Connie, doin’ her act. She had the whole show, and that’s a natural fact.” Hamzy told KTHV she first got backstage at age 15 after her mother, who didn’t want to deal with traffic, dropped her off early to see Steppenwolf at Barton Coliseum. “We’d go out there, and then we’d wander around the backstage area, and one thing would lead to another,” she told KTHV. Hamzy, who worked for a time as a substitute teacher, hung out with groups including Queen, the Eagles and Kiss, KTHV reports. She told the station Van Halen was a particular favorite.\n\nCalifornia\n\nMalibu: Powerful surf washed away a section of a beach access road, and swimmers and surfers were urged to use caution as huge waves from a southern swell battered the Southern California coastline. The Los Angeles County Department of Beaches and Harbors tweeted photos Saturday that showed the ground under Westward Beach Road completely collapsed. Beach hazard advisories had mostly expired by Sunday morning, but officials warned that dangerous rip currents and localized flooding were still possible. “We cannot emphasize this enough: surf and swim in front of an open lifeguard tower,” the Department of Beaches and Harbors tweeted. “Check with the nearest lifeguard before entering the water.” Aerial video by CBS 2 News showed huge waves hitting the patio and second-story balconies of a hotel in the Orange County city of Laguna Beach.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: After taking last season off due to COVID-19 restrictions, Bustang rides to Denver Broncos home games are back with service from Fort Collins and Colorado Springs. The state Department of Transportation said the return of rides on its Bustang coaches will begin with the team’s final preseason game at 7 p.m. Saturday at Empower Field at Mile High against the Los Angeles Rams. Service was suspended last year due to the pandemic and restricted capacity at the stadium. This is the fifth season the service has been offered. The round-trip fare is $30 per person. Coaches are climate-controlled and equipped with Wi-Fi, restrooms, USB and power outlets, comfortable seats and wheelchair access. Face masks are required for drivers and passengers, and hand sanitizer wipes will be offered to passengers when boarding the bus. The buses are cleaned and disinfected upon completion of each route and each day’s routes, according to officials. Amber Blake, CDOT’s director of Transit and Rail, said the service provides an alternative for fans, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, provides a designated driver and enhances safety by reducing the number of vehicles on the road.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Slot machine revenues generated at the state’s two tribal casinos continue to rebound. Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods Resort Casino report seeing an influx of visitors over the summer as COVID-19 restrictions have eased. Both destinations closed for more than three months at the height of the pandemic last year. Mohegan Sun, owned by the Mohegan Tribe, generated $49.9 million in slot machine revenues in July after paying out winnings. That’s a 5% increase from July 2020 and the most money the casino has retained since August 2019, according to The Day of New London. Foxwoods, owned by the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation, kept $36.5 million in July, marking a 19.6% increase from the more than $30.5 million in generated in July 2020. It’s the casino’s highest amount since November 2019. Jason Guyot, CEO of Foxwoods, said slot revenues at the site increased by $7.1 million from June to July. To meet increased consumer demand this summer, he said the casino has offered new experiences, including an outdoor pop-up eatery and a “Cocktail Carnival.” Mohegan Sun has also rolled out more promotions and entertainment over the summer, helping to drive traffic, said Jeff Hamilton, the resort casino’s president and CEO.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: As housing prices soared over the past year, the dream of homeownership was less achievable in the First State, where buyers need more cash for closing the sale. Delaware has the highest real estate transfer tax in the nation, making the average closing costs the second-highest behind Washington, D.C. On a $250,000 home, the transfer tax due at settlement in Delaware is $10,000, which is usually split between the seller and buyer and must be paid at closing. The buyer can’t roll that amount into the mortgage and pay it off over time. Mia Burch, president of the Delaware Association of Realtors, said she has worked with buyers who were in good financial shape in almost every way but had trouble coming up with all the cash they needed at closing. She calls the transfer tax a “discouragement” tax. In 2017, the Legislature hiked the real estate transfer tax from 3% of the property’s sale price to 4%. It was only supposed to be a temporary increase to help solve the state’s budget deficit, said Rep. Mike Ramone, R-Pike Creek. But four years later, even after a $1 billion budget surplus, the 4% tax is still in place. “Seniors and young people are the ones getting squeezed,” Ramone said. In January, he introduced a bill to reduce the tax to its previous level, but it’s yet to make it to the House floor for a vote.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Ten years after an earthquake shook the nation’s capital, repair work is only half done on the National Cathedral, WUSA-TV reports. The Aug. 23, 2011, temblor registered a 5.8 on the Richter scale and dealt extensive damage to buildings across the area. “The quake lasted 58 seconds,” said Joe Alonso, National Cathedral head stonemason. He still can recall every single second of that shake that bent the historic cathedral’s beautiful spires, split its gargoyles and sent chunks of masonry to the ground. “I thought, ‘Wow we’ve got a task ahead of us, that’s for sure,’ ” Alonso said. Repairing the spires and towers is not as simple as slapping some glue on the pieces and putting them back up. “It’s just the nature of the work – everything is handmade, hand-done,” Alonso said. “But that’s how the cathedral was built.” For ten years, the stonemasons have had to reconstruct every single broken piece and reset it hundreds of feet in the air by scaffolding or crane. “What it costs to do this is very expensive, and we are doing (a) sort of a pay-as-you-go,” Alonso said. He believes the 58 seconds were the difference between a slow, tedious repair and complete reconstruction. “If the quake had lasted 2 or 3 more seconds, the stuff that was like a Jenga game would have just come completely down,” he said.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: The state’s power struggle over wearing masks in school landed Monday before a judge considering a lawsuit that challenges Gov. Ron DeSantis’ order reserving the decision for parents. The three-day hearing before Leon County Circuit Judge John C. Cooper pits pro-mask parents against the Republican governor and state education officials who say parents, not schools, should choose whether their children cover up inside schools. The hearings come as the highly contagious delta variant causes a surge in coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths across Florida, where the school year is already being disrupted. Charles Dodson, a former judge representing the parents challenging the governor’s order, in an opening statement that the delta variant affects children more than the previous virus strain and places them at greater risk in crowded schools. He said the Florida Constitution and state law give local school boards the authority to decide health and safety matters affecting their students. Michael Abel, a lawyer for the defendants, said the state’s experts will testify that requiring students to wear masks causes many harms – speaking difficulty, mood changes, breathing issues and depression – while scientists disagree on their effectiveness against the coronavirus.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A federal judge has found that part of the state’s sweeping new election law that broadly prohibits the photographing of a completed ballot is likely unconstitutional. U.S. District Judge J.P. Boulee on Friday granted a preliminary injunction on that section of the law, meaning it cannot be enforced for now. In the same order, he declined to block a number of other provisions that mostly have to do with monitoring or photographing parts of the election process. The judge’s order came in a lawsuit filed by the Coalition for Good Governance, an election integrity group, and others. Boulee wrote that the plaintiffs in the lawsuit “have shown a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of their claim” that the broad ban on photographing a voted ballot in both public and nonpublic places violates their First Amendment rights. The new law, known as SB 202, also adds a voter ID requirement for mail ballots, shortens the time period for requesting a mail ballot, results in fewer ballot drop boxes available in metro Atlanta, and gives the State Election Board new powers to intervene in county election offices and to remove and replace local election officials. There are currently eight federal lawsuits challenging parts of the 98-page law enacted earlier this year, including one filed by the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: State officials say a surge in tourists is leading to increased harassment of sea turtles on a popular North Shore Oahu beach. Hordes of people are crowding turtles at Laniakea Beach Park, known as Turtle Beach, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The state Department of Land and Natural Resources said increased patrols are being dispatched to enforce laws against approaching the turtles. “There are packs of 200 people at a time, throughout the day,” said Debbie Herrera, volunteer and education coordinator for turtle conservation group Malama na Honu. The state Division of Conservation and Resources Enforcement has assigned officers to Laniakea. “Typically, if there’s a uniformed officer standing on the beach, people are not going to break the law in front of them,” said Jason Redulla, division chief. Harassment of turtles and endangered Hawaiian monk seals led Gov. David Ige to warn that violators will be prosecuted if caught. Tourists at Laniakea Beach tell Malama na Honu they didn’t know touching turtles was illegal, Herrera said. Most follow the rules once informed, but there have been a “very few who refuse, despite dozens of cautionary signs or warnings from volunteers, to give green sea turtles on the beach or in the ocean wide berth,” she said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: One of two U.S. district judges for Idaho announced seven months ago that he’d take senior status in August, but there’s still no official nominee to replace him. U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill planned to continue to hear a full caseload when he took senior status Aug. 16, but expected Idaho to have a new district judge to replace him by then – effectively giving the state the third judge it has needed for decades, the Idaho Press reports. “We desperately need the help,” Winmill said. But there’s been no word from the White House about a nominee for the now-open second federal judgeship, though Idaho’s top Democratic elected officials interviewed candidates last winter and submitted an all-female shortlist of four nominees to the Biden administration in March: Idaho Falls attorney DeAnne Casperson, Boise attorney Keely Duke, Boise attorney Deborah Ferguson, and former U.S. Attorney for Idaho Wendy Olson. Traditionally, state senators are given a big say in federal district judge nominees, but that system was jettisoned under the Trump administration. The Senate – where Democrats hold a thin majority – must confirm any nominee by simple majority. It’s unclear what role Idaho’s Republican senators will play in the nomination.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Public health officials have dropped a “do not eat” advisory for sport fish in the Illinois River for the first time since the 1970s. The Illinois Department of Public Health relaxed the warning because concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, have declined, the Chicago Tribune reports. The toxic contaminants were banned in 1979 but stick around in the environment, prompting the advisory. IDPH issues advisories annually based on fish samples collected from 40 to 50 streams, rivers and inland lakes, as well as from four stations in Lake Michigan. They are geared toward vulnerable populations including pregnant and nursing women, along with children younger than age 15. The department said there is no known immediate health hazard from eating contaminated fish in Illinois. But there are “concerns about the effects of long-term, low-level exposure” to contaminants including PCBs. Guidance also was relaxed for some Lake Michigan fish, including whitefish and rainbow trout. Recommended consumption is now no more than one meal a week. Previous guidance was to limit consumption to once per month.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The Hoosier Lottery saw record profits in the past year as its ticket sales soared 26% from the year before. That big jump was fueled by 27% growth in scratch-off ticket sales that accounted for nearly 80% of the lottery’s $1.74 billion in revenue during the year period ending June 30, officials told the State Lottery Commission this past week. Lottery administrators had projected a slight drop in sales because of worries about coronavirus-related shutdowns and the possible economic impact. But the boost in revenue will result in the lottery sending a record $375 million in profits to the state – up about $71 million, or 23%, from the year before. That’s even higher than the $368 million profits that lottery officials had projected in May. “These are really extraordinary numbers,” Lottery Commission Chairman William Zielke said. “It certainly reflects the efforts of a lot of people who tried to keep it going (through the pandemic).” The state directs about $235 million of the lottery profits toward reducing auto excise taxes, with $60 million going to pension funds for teachers, police officers and firefighters. The scratch-off tickets sales growth follows the lottery’s long-term strategy to attract more players enticed by the regular release of new instant games.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: When state Sen. Joe Bolkcom asked in June how much it would cost to deploy Iowa State Patrol troopers to the U.S.-Mexico border, the Department of Public Safety said expenses wouldn’t be calculated until the mission was completed. The response ignored that the state agency had run its own internal cost estimate a week before the since-completed deployment had even been made public, according to records reviewed by the Des Moines Register. The department recently released more than 2,200 pages of emails in response to a joint records request from the Register and the Cedar Rapids Gazette. Gov. Kim Reynolds announced June 24 that troopers would be deployed to the border after Texas asked for help with an influx of migrants. The announcement led legislators and the media to ask questions of the Department of Public Safety and Iowa State Patrol. At the onset, Iowa officials issued scant details about the operations, citing concerns for officer safety. They did not cite that for costs. On June 17, Iowa State Patrol Maj. Robert Hansen sent top department officials an initial cost estimate: $383,700.24 to cover a 16-day deployment of 28 troopers of various ranks. Initial cost estimates after they returned were shy of $300,000, department Commissioner Stephan Bayens said at a July 28 news conference.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: If the Evel Knievel museum moves to Las Vegas, the owner of the museum dedicated to the daredevil has pledged to repay $117,000 it has received from the city of Topeka since it opened in 2017. It was reported earlier this month that the museum dedicated to the career of Robert Craig Knievel, who became known for his death-defying stunts and tricks on motorbikes, may move to the Las Vegas Arts District. Museum owner Mike Patterson told city officials in a meeting last week that he believes it is appropriate to repay the city even though it might not be required in the incentive contract the museum signed. Patterson said private loans were the main source of funding for the roughly $3.5 million museum. But it was also slated to receive up to $300,000 from the city over 12 years if it continued operating in Topeka. The money it received came from the city’s tax on hotel stays. City Council member Spencer Duncan said Topeka will make sure future incentive contracts with businesses include terms that require businesses to repay the incentives they received if they do leave the city.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Gov. Andy Beshear has declared this week Healthcare Heroes Appreciation Week in honor of the doctors, nurses, hospital and clinic staff, and others who have helped the Bluegrass State during the COVID-19 pandemic. “They are heroes. They have earned that title,” Beshear said at a press briefing Thursday, urging local businesses and community members to find ways to show gratitude for health care workers. The most important way, he said, is to get vaccinated against COVID-19. “Let’s make sure that everywhere these health care heroes go, they see how much we care,” the Democratic governor said. Following a Kentucky Supreme Court ruling impacting his executive authority, Beshear on Monday rescinded his executive order requiring masks in schools. The move came a day before a federal judge is scheduled to decide whether to continue a temporary restraining order preventing the mandate from being enforced. Without an order to block, the legal challenge is likely moot. A separate mask mandate for public schools from the Kentucky Department of Education still stands, as does a similar measure for child care centers from the Department of Public Health. Without a mandate in place, private schools across the state are now able to adopt mask-optional policies.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: More than 20 government agencies, universities and electric utilities in the state soon will be getting electric vehicle charging stations worth more than $1.7 million. The Department of Environmental Quality is awarding grants to 26 entities for 82 charging stations, using money from the state’s $19.8 million share from a settlement worth nearly $3 billion between the U.S. Justice Department and Volkswagen over violations of the Clean Air Act, The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reports. Volkswagen sold about 590,000 vehicles equipped with devices that worked against their air pollution control features, resulting in increased emissions of nitrogen oxide. Almost $12 million of Louisiana’s share of the 2016 settlement was set aside to replace 351 diesel engine buses owned by 16 school boards. The new engines will reduce nitrogen oxide emissions and other pollutants such as sulphur dioxide, volatile organic compounds and particulate matter. Another $7.3 million was given to the state Department of Transportation and Development and the Department of Agriculture to replace old diesel equipment and vehicles.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state’s $1,500 bonus to attract new workers back to the workforce this summer during the pandemic hasn’t been successful. Only about 5% of the 7,500 people whom the $10 million program could cover have been declared provisionally eligible, the Bangor Daily News reports. An extended deadline to file applications closed Friday. The bonus for new employees who work at least eight weeks and meet other criteria equates to about two weeks of unemployment pay. It may not have been enough to entice workers to give up benefits or to get overworked employers to handle the extra paperwork that the program entails, said Steve Hewins, executive director of the industry group HospitalityMaine. Maine’s neighbor to the west has had a bit more success. New Hampshire, which stopped the enhanced unemployment benefits in June, drew 700 applicants to its $1,000 return-to-work program in the first four weeks after it started July 19. In contrast, Maine had attracted only 400 applicants since mid-June.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The woeful record of the Baltimore Orioles is combining with the coronavirus pandemic to cost the state millions of dollars in rent payments. The Baltimore Sun reports the Major League Baseball team’s rent payments to the Maryland Stadium Authority have dropped precipitously in the past year due to low attendance and loss of ballpark-generated revenue. The Orioles paid $1.6 million in rent to the Stadium Authority for the use of Oriole Park at Camden Yards in the fiscal year ending June 30. The team’s average annual rent of its 30-year lease has been $6.8 million. The rent payments are based on a percentage of ticket sales, concessions, parking and stadium advertising. The team has the worst record in the majors, and attendance is sparse. During the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, fans were not allowed in the stadium at all. The rent money is used specifically for the maintenance of the ballpark. Stadium officials say they have curtailed maintenance expenses accordingly. The rent losses are in addition to the loss of admission taxes on ticket sales. The newspaper based its reporting on data obtained under the state’s Public Information Act.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nNatick: A retired flight attendant pushing an airline beverage cart more than 200 miles from Boston to New York City to honor colleagues who died during the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks is well on his way. Paul Veneto, 62, resumed his 20th anniversary journey Monday after a night at the Verve Hotel in Natick, two days after starting his trek at Logan International Airport and a day after braving drenching rains from the Henri storm system. He plans on pushing the cart – decorated with photos of all the 9/11 airline crews for inspiration and courage – to ground zero by Sept. 10. “I look on top of this cart, I see these crew members’ faces, every time my legs hurt, it’s cold, rainy, they’re smiling back at me, the pain goes away,” Veneto said Saturday before he departed. The walk called Paulie’s Push will benefit the families of his former colleagues as well as Power Forward 25, a nonprofit that assists people dealing with addiction. Veneto himself is in recovery from an opioid dependency caused in part by the attacks. “I turned my life around to be able to recognize these guys who were never recognized,” he said Saturday. United Flight 175, which was flown into the World Trade Center’s south tower, was Veneto’s regular run. But he had the day off Sept. 11, 2001. The Braintree resident spent 30 years as a flight attendant for five different airlines.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A Bloomfield Township woman who won the grand $2 million prize in the state’s COVID-19 vaccination sweepstakes said Monday that she and her husband will save money for their three kids’ college education, remodel their house and donate a portion to improve mental health services. When the pandemic struck in 2020, Christine Duval left her full-time job as a project manager for a language training company in Troy to help her daughter, now 10, with remote learning after her school closed. She and her husband got their first COVID-19 shots in early April and their second ones weeks later. Their 18- and 15-year-old sons also are vaccinated. Winning $2 million “will help us achieve all of our dreams,” Duval said. “We are really lucky and want to give back to those in need. The pandemic was tough on everyone, and we believe the need for providing services that promote positive mental health care is more important than ever.” The MI Shot to Win Sweepstakes program was designed to boost the vaccination rate in July. The weekly number of people getting a first shot across the state rose for four straight weeks between July 11 and Aug. 7 before dropping in the past two weeks. About 65% of residents ages 16 and up have received at least one dose, federal data shows.\n\nMinnesota\n\nRochester: Igor Vovkovinskiy, the tallest man in the United States, has died at age 38. His family said the Ukrainian-born Vovkovinskiy died of heart disease Friday at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester. His mother, Svetlana Vovkovinska, an ICU nurse at Mayo, initially posted about his death on Facebook. Vovkovinskiy came to the Mayo Clinic in 1989 as a child seeking treatment. A tumor pressing against his pituitary gland caused it to secrete abnormal levels of growth hormone. He grew to become the tallest man in the U.S. at 7 feet, 8.33 inches and ended up staying in Rochester. His older brother, Oleh Ladan of Brooklyn Park, told the Star Tribune of Minneapolis that Vovkovinskiy was a celebrity when he arrived from Ukraine because of his size and the flickering Cold War of the late 1980s. But Ladan said Vovkovinskiy “would have rather lived a normal life than be known.” Vovkovinskiy appeared on “The Dr. Oz Show” and was called out by President Barack Obama during a campaign rally in 2009, when the president noticed him near the stage wearing a T-shirt that read: “World’s Biggest Obama Supporter.” In 2013, he carried the Ukrainian contestant onto the stage to perform in the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Mississippi Poison Control Center officials say they are receiving an influx of calls from people trying to treat COVID-19 by using anti-parasite medicine purchased at livestock stores. At least 70% of recent calls to the center have been related to ingestion of livestock or animal formulations of ivermectin purchased at livestock supply centers, Mississippi Department of Health officials said. Some of the symptoms associated with ivermectin toxicity include rash, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, neurologic disorders, and potentially severe hepatitis requiring hospitalization, though no hospitalizations have been reported. Most callers – 85% – have had mild symptoms, according to the Department of Health. “Patients should be advised to not take any medications intended to treat animals and should be instructed to only take ivermectin as prescribed by their physician,” State Epidemiologist Dr. Paul Byers wrote in a memo Friday. “Animal drugs are highly concentrated for large animals and can be highly toxic in humans.” Ivermectin tablets are approved for human use at very specific doses for some parasitic worms, and there are topical formulations for head lice and skin conditions. Ivermectin is not a drug for treating viruses.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Two groups that work to overturn wrongful convictions argued in a petition filed Monday that a man who has spent more than 20 years in prison for killing his mother did not commit the crime. Michael Politte was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison in 2002. He was 14 when his mother, Rita Politte, was burned to death inside their home in Hopewell, eastern Missouri, in 1998. The Midwest Innocence Project and the MacArthur Justice Center argue in the petition filed with the Missouri Court of Appeals Western District that Politte was convicted because of a biased investigation, faulty science and an incompetent defense at trial. Michael Politte and a friend were sleeping when they awoke to smoke early Dec. 5, 1998. Michael told authorities he found his mother’s burning body in her bedroom as he and his friend tried to escape, according to the petition. She also suffered blunt force trauma to her head. The petition alleges fire investigators quickly decided the fire was started with gasoline, and police immediately zeroed in on her son as a suspect, although no blood or other injuries were found on him. Investigators also said he did not show much emotion or remorse in the following days. Law enforcement did not investigate other viable suspects, the attorneys say.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A judge has ordered the director of the state’s public defender office to appear before him next month to explain why her office is failing to assign public defenders to Billings-area cases in a timely manner and why she shouldn’t be held in contempt of court. District Judge Donald Harris set a Sept. 13 hearing for Rhonda Lindquist, The Billings Gazette reports. The director of the Office of Public Defender is required to ensure that qualified attorneys are immediately assigned after a judge assigns cases to the public defender’s office, according to Harris’ order, which was signed Tuesday. At times, public defenders have a conflict of interest in representing a defendant. When that happens, their case is assigned to the agency’s Conflict Office to hire an outside attorney. The managing attorney for the Conflict Office told Harris that as of July 31, his office had a backlog of 663 unassigned cases. State law requires the Office of Public Defender to immediately assign a lawyer to any case in which a judge designates the office as counsel. Harris said the office has not been able to meet this obligation for months, causing “significant delays in conducting court proceedings and jeopardizes the administration of justice.” The state’s jobs website lists postings for three public defenders and an appellate defender.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state currently appears relatively safe on some national websites tracking the spread of COVID-19, but state health officials say those maps aren’t accurate. The problem is that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been using different data for Nebraska since the state retired its website that reported coronavirus figures daily and started reporting updates weekly with fewer details. So two-thirds of Nebraska’s counties shouldn’t be colored blue on the CDC map, indicating low COVID-19 transmission rates, at a time when cases are surging statewide, the Omaha World-Herald reports. “The color blue on the map may not be an accurate representation of transmission rates,” said Olga Dack, a spokeswoman for the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services. Over the past two weeks, the seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Nebraska has nearly doubled from 374.14 new cases per day Aug. 6 to 727.57 new cases per day Friday. In its most recent update, the state said Wednesday that 2,676 cases had been reported in the previous week – more than 10 times higher than the 253 cases per week the state reported in late June. Dack said the state continues to report county-level virus data to the CDC, but the agency hasn’t been using that for some technical reasons.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Several organizations led by women of color have banded together to shed light on the ways the state’s low-income and diverse communities are disproportionately affected by climate change and pollution. The advocacy groups are creating a website, breathefreenv.com, that aims to raise awareness about climate change and steps that can be taken to reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, improve public health, and lower energy costs for families, especially in low-income communities. Erika Washington, executive director of Make It Work Nevada, one of the groups involved in the effort, told the Las Vegas Sun that Black communities have not received as much outreach about climate change or the environment as white communities. “It’s been very white-led for a very long time,” said Washington, who is Black. “You have to include the people who are closest to the issue in order to actually make any sort of change.” Along with Make It Work Nevada, other groups participating include Battle Born Progress, CHISPA, Make the Road Nevada, Mi Familia Vota Nevada, the Faith Organizing Alliance and the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada Action Fund. All seven groups are led by women of color.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The New Hampshire Department of Revenue has completed a three-year project aimed at providing a better online experience for taxpayers. The department, which collects more than $2 billion in taxes each year, launched the first phase of its online user portal and revenue management system in 2019. The final phase of the Granite Tax Connect portal was completed this month, allowing tax preparers and others to file taxes electronically, schedule automated payments, check on the status of refunds, and complete other tasks. Officials said the system could serve about 148,000 taxpayers. The portal also can be used to anonymously report suspected tax fraud.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state joined a small but growing list of places Monday to require COVID-19 vaccinations for teachers and state workers or for them to undergo regular coronavirus testing. Gov. Phil Murphy announced the new mandate during a news conference, saying pre-K-12 teachers and staff and state employees must be fully vaccinated by Oct. 18 or get tested once or twice a week. New Jersey has about 130,000 public school teachers, 1.3 million public school students and an estimated 70,000 state workers. “Scientific data shows that vaccination and testing requirements, coupled with strong masking policies, are the best tools for keeping our schools and communities safe for in-person activities,” Murphy said. The Democratic governor, who’s running for reelection this year, announced the move just as schools across the state prepare to begin the new academic year. The decision follows an announcement earlier this month to require staff, students and visitors to wear masks on school grounds. The state’s biggest teachers union, the New Jersey Education Association, supported the order, as did the state’s School Nurses Association and the state chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The ritual burning of a giant, ghostly marionette in the city will be a hybrid event this year. Organizers of the Zozobra burning said they are planning to limit in-person attendance to 10,000 while also broadcasting the event on television and online. The nighttime spectacle that’s been transformed by modern pyrotechnics is in its 97th year. A team of a dozen puppeteers heaves on cords to flex the groaning marionette’s arms, head and jaw. Will Shuster, a painter from Philadelphia who migrated to the Southwest, created Zozobra, a name derived from a Spanish word for “anguish.” Donations from energy companies ensured the event could move forward Sept. 3. It typically happens around Santa Fe’s weeklong community fiestas that include historic and religious processions. Anyone attending in person must prove they have been vaccinated against COVID-19 or tested negative for the coronavirus within 72 hours of the event. Face masks will be required for anyone who is not vaccinated. The Kiwanis Club of Santa Fe uses the event to raise money for youth charities. Organizers said they’ll tweak the event as needed to comply with federal and state public health orders.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Andrew Cuomo defended his record over a decade as governor and portrayed himself as the victim of a “media frenzy” Monday as he prepared for a midnight power transfer that will make Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul the state’s first female governor. Cuomo, a Democrat, was set to end his term at 11:59 p.m., just under two weeks after he announced he would resign rather than face a likely impeachment battle over sexual harassment allegations. In a prerecorded farewell address released at noon, Cuomo boasted of making government effective in his years in office, cited his work battling the COVID-19 pandemic and struck a defiant tone on the harassment allegations. He said the report that triggered his resignation – a scathing account of what Attorney General Letitia James said was sexual harassment or inappropriate touching of 11 women – was “designed to be a political firecracker on an explosive topic, and it did work,” Cuomo said. He also touted his “progressive” record and positioned himself as a bulwark against his party’s left-wing faction that he said wants to “defund the police” and “demonize businesses.” He touted New York’s long-awaited passage of same-sex marriage under his administration, as well as gun control legislation and a law setting an eventual statewide $15 minimum wage.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Tens of thousands of state residents who have been convicted of felonies but whose current punishments don’t include prison time can register to vote and cast ballots, a judicial panel declared Monday. Several civil rights groups and ex-offenders who sued legislative leaders and state officials in 2019 argue the current 1973 law is unconstitutional by denying the right to vote to people who have completed their active sentences or received no such sentence, such as people on probation. They said the rules disproportionately affect Black residents. In a brief hearing following a trial last week challenging North Carolina’s voting restrictions upon felons, Superior Court Judge Lisa Bell said two judges on the three-judge panel have agreed they will issue a formal order soon allowing more felony offenders to vote. The judges are acting before issuing a final ruling from the trial, as voting in October municipal elections begins next month. The law says felons can register to vote again once they complete all aspects of their sentence, including probation and parole. With Bell’s ruling, felons who only must complete these punishments that have no element of incarceration can register again.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A petroleum company has reported a saltwater spill in northwestern North Dakota to state regulators. The Bismarck Tribune reports Whiting Oil and Gas says the spill occurred Thursday. The company told regulators that a broken fitting in a pipeline system operated by Goodnight Midstream resulted in the spill at a well site 11 miles south of Stanley in Mountrail County. The company said 1,400 barrels containing 58,800 gallons of saltwater spilled but were contained, and most of the fluid has been recovered. Saltwater, also known as brine, can come up along with oil and gas from a well. The North Dakota Oil and Gas Division said a state inspector has visited the site and will monitor cleanup efforts.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: More than 120 activists, scholars, pastors, students and average citizens attended the first hearing Monday of a new panel charged with redrawing state legislative districts for the next 10 years, most advocating new maps that are more fair and representative. Witnesses at the first of nine public hearings of the Ohio Redistricting Commission at Cleveland State University maligned the current gerrymandered maps and called the process disheartening, embarrassing, demoralizing and unfair. “My vote doesn’t count,” Daisie Reish, 77, of Grafton, told the panel. “I call my representatives constantly, and they never vote for me. They always vote the opposite.” Person after person – young, old, Black, Muslim, immigrant, and people whose families have lived in the area for generations – told the panel they feel disadvantaged and unheard by their government as a result of the current district maps. Meanwhile, Tom Hach, executive director of Free Ohio Now, complained that all nine of the commission’s hearings will be held at universities, which he said don’t attract a diversity of political participation. He called the process unfair and said commissioners, the majority of whom are Republicans, were being bullied by Democrats. An Associated Press analysis has found Ohio to have some of the nation’s most gerrymandered maps.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Blocks from where she initiated one of the nation’s first sit-in movements, civil rights icon Clara Luper is now memorialized in the name of the city’s downtown post office. Luper’s descendants, former students and original “sit-inners” joined local dignitaries Saturday for the dedication of the Clara Luper Post Office Building, formerly called the Center City Station. Luper’s daughter, Chelle Luper Wilson, said her mother would want others to take it as a call to action against inequality. “One of the things I know she would say is she never wanted her name to just be a symbolic gesture,” Wilson said. “She was never about symbolism without any action. She was about structural and systemic change. I know she would want people whenever they see her name not to just think, ‘Oh great, what a great woman,’ but hope it sparks them to become passionate about a cause.” Luper, a longtime public school teacher, died in 2011 at age 88. The renaming coincided with the 63rd anniversary of the Oklahoma City sit-in movement. Luper and a group of Black schoolchildren arrived at the whites-only lunch counter of Katz Drug Store on Aug. 19, 1958, and refused to leave until they were served. It was the beginning of a successful six-year campaign to end racial segregation in Oklahoma City establishments.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Opposing rallies that drew hundreds of people sparked clashes Sunday. The two groups had gathered in different parts of the city after a far-right group changed the location of its event. The right-wing rally drew about 100 people in a parking lot of a former Kmart store, and clashes began as it wound down, KOIN-TV reports. A van tried to drive into the parking lot but crashed, and the driver ran away. Demonstrators then began igniting fireworks and similar devices. It was not immediately clear whether anyone suffered serious injuries. Later, shots were fired near demonstrators downtown. Dustin Brandon Ferreira, 37, a left-wing activist, told The Oregonian/OregonLive he was with others Sunday evening when a man used a slur against a Black man in the group and then fired multiple rounds in their direction. Portland police said the man was arrested. No one was injured. Demonstrations associated with anti-fascists had earlier drawn more than 200 people downtown. The plans for the opposing demonstrations had prompted Portland police to call in all available police personnel. Sunday’s event fell on the one-year anniversary of a particularly violent political clash in which opposing groups brawled on the street next to police headquarters for hours.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: More drivers have been hitting the road as coronavirus restrictions have loosened, and it’s showing in the number of those who have been caught speeding through photo-enforced construction zones. The state has issued more than 220,000 violations in the first seven months of this year, surpassing the total for all of 2020, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. Nearly $2.9 million has been collected in fines so far, higher than the $1.7 million remitted in 2020, said Jennifer Kuntch, a spokeswoman for PennDOT. Drivers receive a warning for the first offense, but second and subsequent violations carry a fine. Traffic volumes were down last year because of the pandemic, and that led to fewer violations than what might have been expected, Kuntch said. Meanwhile, the program remains on track to double its speed camera deployments this year. PennDOT is expecting to see a downward trend in violations through the rest of the year, Kuntch said. Based on evaluating Maryland’s trends and in having consistent deployments to the same work zones in Pennsylvania, drivers begin to comply with the speed limits, which leads to fewer violations, she said. In addition, drivers tend to watch their speed after getting their first warning.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Public health officials are warning residents about a fake form circulating that purports to give the bearer a medical or religious exemption from coronavirus mask requirements. The certificate even includes a Rhode Island Department of Health logo, the agency said in a tweet Sunday. “It was not developed by RIDOH or any official source, should not be filled out, and should not/will not be accepted by any entity, as the form is not legitimate,” the department wrote in the tweet. The agency did not say where the fake certificate originated. The state has recently been restoring mask mandates for some indoor spaces in an attempt to slow the spread of the coronavirus’ delta variant. Last week Gov. Daniel McKee issued an executive order requiring masks in K-12 schools for the upcoming school year regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status. Before the order, McKee had simply recommended masks for schoolchildren, leaving the final decision up to individual school districts. But state officials said more than a quarter of Rhode Island’s new coronavirus cases are among children under the age of 12 who are not yet eligible for a vaccination against the disease.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Prosecutors are now required to share evidence of innocence they find even after a defendant is convicted of a crime. The changes to the South Carolina Rules of Professional Conduct were announced last week, The Post and Courier reports. South Carolina is joining about two dozen other states with the rules, which were first developed by the American Bar Association in 2008. They require a prosecutor to disclose any information when they become aware of “credible, material” evidence that indicates a defendant was wrongfully convicted to the defendant or defense attorney as well as the chief prosecutor where the person was tried. Prosecutors who have “clear and convincing” evidence that a person was wrongfully convicted in their jurisdiction then have an ethical obligation to remedy the conviction, according to the new rules. Prosecutors will have discretion to determine what exactly crosses the threshold of the new rules, said John Freeman, professor emeritus for the University of South Carolina School of Law. The rules also protect a defendant even after exhausting all normal appeals, Freeman said. “What this says, basically, is that so long as there is a possibility of proof surfacing that shows that the guy is innocent, it ain’t over,” he said. “And, frankly, isn’t that the way it should be?”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: The state is facing a shortage of nurses at a time when they are needed most, officials say. South Dakota News Watch reports that stress, long hours and fear of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic have caused more nurses than usual to leave the field, move to other states or retire early. From 2015 to 2016, about 1,700 registered nurses left South Dakota. Last year, more than 2,500 nurses dropped out of the state workforce. “The pandemic just kind of burned them out,” said Michelle Bruns, a spokeswoman for the nursing program at Oglala Lakota College. “It’s a tough situation.” The state’s higher education system has not produced enough nursing graduates to keep up with a growing population and rising demand for health care services, and educators are scrambling to find ways to lure more students and produce degrees more quickly. Meanwhile, a shortage of nurses in other states has raised competition to attract new graduates and experienced providers, but South Dakota health care systems are at a competitive disadvantage because median pay for nurses in the state is the lowest in the nation, according to federal labor data.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The University of Tennessee announced Monday that it will extend its mask mandate to all indoor public spaces due to the ongoing spike in coronavirus cases and increasing hospitalizations. UT had been under a temporary mask mandate that only applied to classrooms, laboratories and indoor academic student events. Officials say the new requirement will extend to all indoor public spaces, but exceptions will include private offices, residence hall rooms and while engaging in fitness activities. According to a news release, the university will “re-evaluate the need for the expanded face-covering requirement by Sept. 7.” “While we are trying to do our part to keep our campuses healthy, we continue to stress the importance of getting the COVID-19 vaccine,” UT System President Randy Boyd said in a statement. As of Monday, Tennessee has seen 13,135 COVID-19-related deaths to date, according to researchers from Johns Hopkins. That death count is the 15th highest in the country overall and the 24th highest per capita at 194 deaths per 100,000 people. The state is averaging 2,508.3 current COVID-19 hospitalizations, according to data through Aug. 20 from the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Dell Medical School at the University of Texas is beginning a three-year study using video games and virtual reality to try to rewire the brains of teens with epilepsy. It’s taking the concept of neuroplasticity – that brains can create new pathways after an injury – and seeing if brains also can create the new pathways before the injury ever occurs. In this case, the injury is surgery to the affected area of the brain that is causing the epileptic seizures. The study is funded by a $2.5 million grant from the Coleman Fung Foundation. Fung is the founder of software company Open Link Financials Inc., and his Austin-based business venture, Blue Goji, is a wellness technology company that uses treadmills, virtual reality and video gaming to create a fitness experience. Dell Medical School will receive two Infinity treadmill virtual realty game systems from Blue Goji to use in the study. Dr. David Paydarfar, chair of Dell Medical School’s department of neurology and the study’s lead researcher, said that while people have studied neuroplasticity for decades, this study will actually implement the research. Previously, it was like studying rocket science without trying to go to the moon. The study is targeting 15- to 20-year-olds with epilepsy who need to have surgery to stop their seizures.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A ban on school districts requiring masks is forcing parents of vulnerable kids to wrestle with the painful choice of whether to risk coronavirus infections at school or keep them at home yet again, according to a lawsuit filed Monday. Parents like Jessica Pyper say a Utah law that blocks districts from passing mandates wrongly prevents children from getting a safe education. She wants her 10-year-old son, Ryker, to join his fifth grade classmates this year, but his Type 1 diabetes puts him at serious risk. “It just sort of seems like nobody cares,” she said. “Kids with disabilities often get left behind. They don’t get considered when these types of decisions are being made.” The case filed by a group of nine parents is the latest U.S. lawsuit of its kind from families and educators concerned about school without masks as the highly contagious delta variant surges. Officials, mostly Republican, contend that there are downsides to kids being masked all day and that parents should have the power to decide whether to put them on children, who tend to be less vulnerable to the virus than older adults. The lawsuit was filed against Republican Gov. Spencer Cox, whose office didn’t immediately respond to messages requesting comment, and Republican Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes, who declined comment.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The state’s Agency of Commerce and Community Development has launched its latest relocation program to get workers to move to Vermont – especially cooks, servers, child care workers, registered nurses, construction laborers, delivery drivers, elementary school teachers and retail salespeople. The reimbursement grants are for up to $7,500 for “eligible expenses” after moving. The online application for the grants requires proof of residency and documentation of eligible expenses. Grants will be awarded on a first-come, first-served basis. In 2018, the Legislature created the remote worker grant program, which offered reimbursement grants of up to $10,000 for workers who could relocate to the state and bring their current job with them. The next year, in 2019, the Legislature created the worker relocation grant program, which offered reimbursement grants to move to the state and take a job. The two programs together have awarded more than 300 grants to “newly settled Vermonters” in towns across the state, according to a news release. The worker relocation program is available to those who relocate to Vermont on or after July 1, 2021, and fill one of the qualifying positions with a Vermont employer. Remote worker grants are for those who relocate on or after Feb. 1, 2022.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Democrat Terry McAuliffe on Monday urged all employers to require COVID-19 vaccines for eligible workers, sharpening a policy debate in the governor’s race over how best to deal with the pandemic. McAuliffe’s call followed a decision by federal regulators to give full approval to Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine. The former governor now seeking a second term has previously urged Virginia health systems and school divisions to issue mandates and required his own campaign staff to be fully inoculated. McAuliffe is facing Republican Glenn Youngkin, a former business executive and political newcomer, in the November general election. Youngkin has consistently urged Virginians to get COVID-19 shots but said he opposes vaccine or mask mandates. At a campaign event last week, the former co-CEO of the Carlyle Group was asked about his approach to managing the pandemic as the delta variant drives up coronavirus cases and hospitalizations. “First of all, we pray it’s behind us every day,” he said. “My expectation is, this virus is tough. And so first thing that I would ask everybody to do is get the vaccine.” He said in a statement Monday that McAuliffe was trying to “bully” Virginians and businesses into compliance with a step that will “clearly evolve into closing down businesses and locking down Virginia again.”\n\nWashington\n\nBlaine: Authorities say they have found the first Asian giant hornet nest of 2021 in a rural area of the state, about a quarter-mile from where a resident reported seeing one of the hornets earlier this month. The Washington State Department of Agriculture narrowed the search area last week and located the nest east of Blaine, department officials said. Crews found the nest Thursday after they followed a hornet that was equipped with a tracking device, KOMO reports. Crews were able to net and tag three hornets between Aug. 11 and Aug. 17. State entomologists will now develop a plan to eradicate the nest, most likely this week. The 2-inch-long invasive insects, first found near the U.S.-Canadian border in December 2019, are native to Asia and pose a threat to honeybees and native hornet species. While not particularly aggressive toward humans, their sting is extremely painful, and repeated stings, though rare, can kill.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nPoint Pleasant: An annual festival that celebrates a local legend about a “Mothman” has been called off for the second straight year due to the coronavirus pandemic. Organizers of the Mothman Festival in Point Pleasant announced the festival’s cancellation Thursday. It had been set for next month. The organizers said in a statement that thousands of people pack the town along the Ohio River during the festival and that local health officials predict rising COVID-19 cases could peak around that time. “We are disappointed, but it was not an easy decision to make, we can assure you of that,” the statement said. Mothman is a mysterious creature with glowing red eyes that witnesses described seeing in 1966 and 1967. It was the subject of the 2002 film “The Mothman Prophecies.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Residents who get their first dose of COVID-19 vaccine between Aug. 20 and Labor Day will receive a $100 gift card, Gov. Tony Evers announced Monday. The reward being offered just as students return to school is Wisconsin’s latest incentive designed to entice those who have yet to be inoculated to receive the shots. As of Monday, just over 50% of the state’s entire population and 61% of adult residents were fully vaccinated, according to the state health department. Many other states have offered similar programs to get more people vaccinated. Recently in Wisconsin, attendees at the state fair who got vaccinated received a free cream puff. More than 600 fairgoers took advantage of that promotion. The $100 Visa gift card will be available to anyone age 12 and up who gets their first shot during the 18-day eligibility window that closes Sept. 6. To receive the gift card, those being vaccinated will need to fill out an application form, available at 100.wisconsin.gov. The cards will be mailed up to six weeks later. Coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths caused by the more contagious delta variant have spiked in Wisconsin and across the country in recent weeks.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson Hole: The outdoor gear and clothing company Patagonia has stopped providing its merchandise for sale at a Wyoming ski resort to protest the owners’ sponsorship of a Republican fundraiser featuring Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and other top supporters of former President Donald Trump. Well known for decades for its outspoken support of progressive causes and environmentalism, Patagonia in the past has brought unwanted attention to Facebook and Instagram and the Outdoor Retailer shows in Salt Lake City. Now, the company’s activism could spell trouble – among left-leaning skiers, at least – for Jackson Hole Mountain Resort. A major tourism destination in Wyoming, the resort known for its bright red gondola car and logo with a silhouetted bucking horse and rider is among the best-known brands from one of the most Republican states. “We join with the local community that is using its voice in protest. We will continue to use our business to advocate for stronger policies to protect our planet, end hate speech and support voting rights and a strong democracy,” Patagonia spokeswoman Corley Kenna said in a statement. The boycott, first reported by WyoFile, means Patagonia merchandise won’t be available in three shops at the resort that Kenna said were Patagonia’s largest account in Jackson Hole.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/07/19/red-tide-outbreak-fox-attack-confederate-statue-removed-news-around-states/117561024/", "title": "Red tide outbreak, fox attack, Confederate statue removed: News ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMobile: A south Alabama hospital that vaccinated thousands of people against COVID-19 plans to send a team to do immunizations in Peru, which has been hit hard by the pandemic. USA Health said more than 20 volunteers will travel to the country’s Cusco region. CerviCusco, a nongovernmental agency in Peru, sought the assistance, the health system said in a statement. “Our plan is to travel to Peru in mid-August, establish processes and protocols for safe and efficient vaccine distribution in the region with a goal of providing 5,000 doses to the people of Peru,” said Natalie Fox, assistant administrator and chief nursing officer for USA Health Physicians Group. USA Health has provided more than 75,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines on the Gulf Coast, including at mass clinics where more than 2,200 people received injections daily. To raise money for expenses, Mobile-based Synergy Laboratories is matching up to $10,000 in donations to the USA Health outreach campaign.\n\nAlaska\n\nSitka: Masks are now required in city buildings in Sitka after a spike of 60 new COVID-19 cases in the past week. “Mask up, whether you are vaccinated or not,” said Craig Warren, the emergency operations center incident commander. City officials said 18 of the 60 new cases were reported in people who were fully vaccinated. City Administrator John Leach said masks will be required in city buildings “if social distancing of at least 6 feet or more between individuals cannot be maintained,” the Daily Sitka Sentinel reported. The action comes after he said most citizens have done their part to help stop the virus’ spread. City officials said in a statement that the spike is not the failure of the vaccine. They said the vaccine does not provide 100% protection, but does decrease the severity of the illness, reduce hospitalizations and decrease the risk of death. City officials are asking people to wear masks, regardless of whether they are vaccinated; to maintain distance in public places; and to stay home if feeling ill.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A judge threw out a 6-year-old legal settlement requiring Arizona to improve health care for thousands of prisoners, saying corrections officials have shown little interest in complying with their obligations under the deal and that it would be absurd to expect the state to act differently in the future. In a ruling Friday, Judge Roslyn Silver opted against imposing additional contempt-of-court fines against the state for its longstanding noncompliance and instead said she will take the case to trial. The judge said the state’s failure to provide adequate medical care for prisoners has led to suffering and preventable deaths. Not only has the state failed to fulfill its obligations, Silver said it offered “erroneous and unreliable excuses for non-performance, asserted baseless legal arguments, and in essence resisted complying with the obligations they contractually knowingly and voluntarily assumed.” The Arizona Department of Corrections, Rehabilitation and Reentry declined to comment on the ruling. C.J. Karamargin, a spokesman for Gov. Doug Ducey, said the ruling was being reviewed.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The University of Arkansas said it has asked a former Razorback challenging Republican U.S. Sen. John Boozman to change his ads over their unauthorized use of the school’s trademarks. The school made the request after Jake Bequette launched his bid for the Republican Senate nomination with an online video touting his background playing for the Razorbacks and for the New England Patriots in the NFL. Boozman, a Republican, has held the seat since 2011. The video features footage and images of Bequette playing in his Razorbacks uniform, with a logo that reads: “Jake Bequette. Patriot. Veteran. Razorback.” Bequette’s campaign did not say whether it planned to change or withdraw the ad. UA made a similar request when Boozman, also a former Razorback, ran for the Senate in 2010. Boozman pulled a TV ad highlighting his time playing for the Razorbacks after the school asked that it be withdrawn.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Police arrested several dozen people and fired nonlethal projectiles to disperse an unruly crowd on Saturday after a dueling protest over transgender rights at a Los Angeles spa turned violent. The protests stemmed from a video that circulated online earlier this month, in which an irate customer complained to the staff at Wi Spa that a transgender woman was in the women’s section of the spa. The video sparked controversy after the spa defended its policy of allowing transgender customers in its facilities, the Los Angeles Times reported. Police declared an unlawful assembly in front of the spa in Koreatown about 11 a.m. when demonstrators against transgender access to the spa’s facilities clashed with counterprotesters and some in the crowd threw smoke bombs and other objects at officers, Det. Meghan Aguilar, a spokeswoman for the LAPD, said. Video posted on Twitter showed officers in riot gear hitting protesters with batons and firing bean bag rounds and other projectiles. At one point, a woman was hit in the abdomen, causing her to fall to the ground. Several dozen people were arrested for ignoring orders to disperse, and police found stun guns, knives and pepper spray discarded on the street, police later said.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins:Hundreds of people of all ages dressed in rainbow clothing and face paint, some wearing the flags that represented their identities on their backs, and marched through Old Town Fort Collins to celebrate Pride in Northern Colorado on Friday night. NoCo SafeSpace, the organization that hosted the march, estimated that the the third annual Northern Colorado Pride March attracted more than three times the participants it did last year, with roughly 700 showing support. Kimberly Chambers, executive director of NoCo SafeSpace who helped run the march, said although many Fort Collins Pride events won’t be celebrated until September this year, she kept the march in July because of warm weather and increased attendance, as well as to show support for the community outside of Pride month. COVID-19 vaccines were available at the end of the march. The Larimer County Health Department partnered with the march and Old Firehouse Books to distribute the vaccines, and provide chosen name vaccine cards to those who wanted them.\n\nConnecticut\n\nKent: A children’s weight loss camp that closed last week amid a state investigation into the safety of campers has had a history of regulatory violations, state records showed. Camp Shane shut down its Connecticut location at the South Kent School on Tuesday after its operator said it could not adequately staff the facility. The group has operated similar camps across the country. The state Office of Early Childhood and the state Department of Children and Families put out a joint statement confirming the state had launched an investigation “due to concerns about health, safety and well-being of children enrolled at the summer youth camp.” Camp Shane is among 417 camps in the state licensed by the Office of Early Childhood. State records showed that inspections conducted in 2019, when the camp was located in Pomfret, found 62 violations, including a failure to file plans for operating a youth camp, the improper medical training of staff and the improper distribution of medicine. Owner David Ettenberg told Hearst Connecticut Media on Thursday that any violations were minor. Messages seeking comment from Ettenberg on Friday were not immediately returned.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:Overdose deaths in Delaware increased in 2020 from the year before, new data showed. The state reported 447 overdose deaths statewide last year – up from 431 in 2019, the News Journal reported Friday. Fentanyl, a dangerously powerful opioid, was found as a contributor in 372 of those deaths, according to a report from the state Division of Forensic Science. Heroin was found in 94 of those deaths, and cocaine was present in 152. The U.S. government reported earlier this week that nationally, overdose deaths soared to a record 93,000 last year in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. That estimate far eclipsed the high of about 72,000 drug overdose deaths reached the previous year and amounted to a 29% increase.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:DC police are looking for a vehicle that the department believes was involved in the fatal shooting of 6-year-old Nyiah Courtney and are offering a $60,000 reward for anyone who can provide tips or information which leads to the arrest of the person or persons responsible, WUSA-TV reported. Those with information can call the police’s Command Information Center at (202) 727-9099 or text anonymously to 50411. A video of the vehicle was released on Twitter after a news conference that was attended by D.C. Police, Mayor Muriel Bowser, ATF and FBI officials. Police describe it as a gray or silver four-door sedan. Officers heard shots of gunfire at the corner of Malcolm X and MLK Boulevard in the 2900 block in Southeast D.C. about 11 p.m. Friday, according to D.C. Police Chief Robert Contee III. When people started to scatter and disperse in the area, officers arrived on the scene, they found six gunshot victims. Five adults were transported to area hospitals with nonlife-threatening injuries, and Courtney was the only one pronounced dead, police said.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: Amid the stench of dead fish, protesters marched Saturday along Tampa Bay to call for state assistance in dealing with a growing outbreak of harmful red tide. More than 100 people took part in the event along the St. Petersburg waterfront carrying signs and shouting, “Save our bay, make polluters pay.” Among other things, the protesters want Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis to declare a state of emergency that would free up more resources for the bay. The St. Petersburg City Council last week adopted a resolution calling for an emergency declaration. The governor’s office has said such a declaration is not necessary and that sufficient money is available for the outbreak from the state Department of Environmental Protection. Hundreds of tons of dead marine life has been removed from Tampa Bay in recent weeks because of red tide, a toxic algae bloom that occurs naturally in the Gulf of Mexico but is worsened by the presence of nutrients such as nitrogen in the water.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAugusta:Property owners in the old city limits might get a break and some suburban homeowners a new fee under streetlight fee changes headed for Augusta Commission approval. The city streetlight subcommittee, chaired by Commissioner Sammie Sias, approved a new fee schedule for all the nearly 80,000 Augusta land parcels, regardless of size. The new annual fees, included on an owner’s property tax bill, are $100 per residential property and $150 per commercial parcel. Residents within Hephzibah and Blythe are exempt. Most residents in the old city limits are paying for streetlights as a portion of their property tax bill, from which $85 is transferred to the streetlight fund. Most homeowners outside the old city limits pay an $85 fee, which was raised from $30 in 2018. The new fee is a 40% increase for business property owners, most of whom have paid $107.36 since 2018 when the commission adopted new fees.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A cargo airline whose plane ditched into the ocean off Hawaii has been grounded after investigators looked into the company’s safety practices before the accident. The Federal Aviation Administration said it will bar Rhoades Aviation of Honolulu from flying or doing maintenance inspections until it meets FAA regulations. The agency did not detail Rhoades’ alleged shortcomings. The company did not immediately respond to phone and email messages for comment. The decision to ground the carrier, which operates as Transair, is separate from the investigation into the July 2 ditching of a Boeing 737, the FAA said. Two pilots were rescued by the Coast Guard after the nighttime crash. The company had one plane still in operation this week, a Boeing 737-200 like the one that crashed. The FAA said it began investigating Rhoades Aviation’s maintenance and safety practices last fall and told the company about two weeks before the crash that it planned to revoke its authority to do maintenance inspections. The company did not appeal the FAA’s decision within the 30 days as required if it wanted the case reconsidered, the FAA said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Republicans in the state Senate are declining to reconvene the Legislature amid calls for legislation to prevent employers from requiring workers to get COVID-19 vaccinations, lawmakers said. Republican Senate Pro Tempore Chuck Winder and other leaders in a statement said they want meetings with Republican Gov. Brad Little, House leaders and businesses to find solutions. The statement followed an unusual online meeting of Senate Republicans on Friday to determine their wishes about a special session. Primary Health Group, Saint Alphonsus Health System and St. Luke’s Health System announced the vaccine requirement last week ahead of the busy cold and flu season and as coronavirus variants spread in parts of the U.S. Health officials in Idaho said vaccine requirements are intended to keep health care facilities open and employees and patients safe. The delta variant first detected in India has recently been discovered in Idaho. It spreads more easily because of mutations, which make it better at latching onto cells. Also, Idaho’s vaccination rate is among the worst in the nation, with only about 40% of the population having received at least one dose of vaccine. About 38% of the population is fully vaccinated, according to the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Cook County’s courts are moving to expand their capacity to hold trials as COVID-19 restrictions ease amid a looming backlog of felony cases. Cook County Chief Judge Timothy Evans said 86 county courtrooms will become available for trials starting Friday. Evans’ office said 76 of those courtrooms can be used for juries because of reduced social-distancing guidelines. The Leighton Criminal Court Building in downtown Chicago has been facing a serious backlog of felony cases because of pandemic-related court slowdowns. And prosecutors are bracing themselves for what might be a flood of demands for trials, once the speedy-trial clock begins ticking again Oct. 1, the Chicago Tribune reported. But in a news release, Evans said there are 159 cases which are ready for trial, and with the expanded capacity those trials can be “comfortably” accommodated by the end of September.\n\nIndiana\n\nPrinceton: Indiana prosecutors have charged four juveniles from southeastern Illinois with torturing and poaching more than 20 wild deer in the two states. After an investigation by Indiana conservation officers, the Gibson County Prosecutor’s Office recently charged four juveniles from Mount Carmel, Illinois, with committing a combined 119 wildlife violations in Indiana and Illinois over a two-year span. Illinois conservation officers also investigated the alleged poaching in Mount Carmel, Illinois, and Gibson County, Indiana, starting in January. The investigations in the two states found that the juveniles illegally killed more than 20 deer in both states during the 2019, 2020, and 2021 deer seasons, officials said in a news release. Prosecutors alleged that multiple deer were shot from trucks, shot with the aid of spotlights at night, and intentionally run over with vehicles, and then stabbed or kicked to death. The juveniles face misdemeanor charges and violations that include: torture or mutilation of a vertebrate animal, use of artificial light to take deer, hunting without landowner consent and criminal trespassing.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The site where the Yonkers department store burned seven years ago might soon become a park in downtown Des Moines. EMC Insurance, owner of the lot, said it plans to develop a neighborhood park that will include sports courts, public artwork, flower beds and sitting areas. The company said it hopes the park will open next summer. Mayor Frank Cownie said in a news release that the park will fill a void for the downtown area. The park must still receive approval from the city. The project also will include fixing and replacing sections of the skywalk near the site, and the addition of a new stair access from the skywalk to the park. EMC acquired the property in 2018, four years after it was destroyed by fire.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The federal government will shut down Dwight Eisenhower’s presidential library and museum again Monday as the faster-spreading delta variant fuels a growing number of new COVID-19 cases in Kansas. The decision to close sites in Abilene honoring the nation’s 34th president and the supreme Allied commander during World War II was a response to case numbers in their home of Dickinson County. “I am taking this action out of concern for the health of the staff and the visiting public,” David Ferriero, archivist of the United States, said in a statement from Washington. The sites were closed throughout the pandemic but reopened May 20. Dickinson County was 10th among the state’s 105 counties for new confirmed or probable COVID-19 cases per 1,000 residents during the 14 days ending Friday, according to Kansas health department data. The state reported 66 new cases there during those two weeks or 3.57 per 1,000 residents – more than double the statewide figure of 1.67 per 1,000 residents.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Kentucky’s county jails routinely awarded communications contracts without competitive bidding, the state auditor said in urging legislative action to better govern the contracting. Many Kentucky jails provide more than a traditional phone line for inmates to use. Vendors awarded the communication services contracts reviewed by Auditor Mike Harmon’s office can provide video, email or text options for inmates to stay in contact with their families. Harmon said his office surveyed county jails and examined communication services and equipment contracts in effect between July 1, 2019, and November 15, 2020. Some county jails reported having one contract in place during that period, while others reported having as many as three. The auditor delved into how the contracts were awarded and the financial benefits that jails reaped. Based on survey responses, 32 contracts were awarded by competitive bidding, while 81 contracts either were not bid or the respondents did not know whether the contract had been bid, Harmon said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLafayette:Spectators cheered Saturday as a stone statue of a Confederate general was hoisted by a crane and removed from a pedestal where it stood for 99 years in front of a city hall in south Louisiana. The Advertiser posted video of the work that happened a day after United Daughters of the Confederacy signed a settlement agreeing to move the statue of Gen. Alfred Mouton or let the city do so. A trial had been scheduled for July 26. “The Confederacy has surrendered,” attorney Jerome Moroux told The Advocate. Moroux represented the city and 16 city residents who wanted the statue gone. Mouton, whose full name was Jean-Jacques-Alfred-Alexandre Mouton, was a slave owner and son of a former Louisiana governor. He died leading a cavalry charge in the Civil War Battle of Mansfield. In 1980, outgoing Mayor Kenny Bowen wanted to move the statue to what was then the new Lafayette city hall. Although United Daughters of the Confederacy gave the statue to the city in 1922, the group fought the move, partly because Mouton’s father once had owned the statue’s site.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Maine health officials are hopeful a new COVID-19 vaccine clinic at the largest airport in the state will help drive up immunization rates. The Department of Health and Human Services is working with Portland International Jetport on the new clinic, which will be open to travelers and residents. The clinic, which does not require appointments, began Tuesday and is operating seven days a week. Maine has one of the highest COVID-19 vaccination rates in the country. More than two-thirds of the state’s eligible population are fully vaccinated against the coronavirus. The addition of the airport clinic is “another way to ensure that Maine is one of the safest places to be this summer,” said Maine Department of Health and Human Services Commissioner Jeanne Lambrew. The clinic will use the one-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine for coronavirus, state officials said. It will be open to anyone age 18 or older and it will be free, officials said.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis:State House Speaker Adrienne Jones announced her support for a referendum to legalize marijuana on next year’s ballot. Jones, a Baltimore County Democrat, also announced a panel to study how to implement a recreational marijuana program in Maryland, if voters approve. Jones also announced a group of lawmakers that will craft the implementation of a legalized cannabis program in Maryland, if the voters approve the ballot question in November of 2022. Eighteen states, including neighboring Virginia, as well as the District of Columbia have legalized recreational use and 37 allow for some sort of medical marijuana, including Maryland. Del. Luke Clippinger, D-Baltimore, who chairs the House Judiciary Committee, will lead the panel. He said it will establish the legal frameworks needed to fully implement legalized marijuana and learn from mistakes other states have made.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nGloucester: Shellfishing has been banned along large portions of the Massachusetts coast because of toxic red tide, state officials said. The state Division of Marine Fisheries banned harvesting of all softshell and razor clams, the Gloucester Daily Times reported Friday. That ban came the day after the harvest of blue mussels, carnivorous snails and whole sea scallops was prohibited because of elevated levels of paralytic shellfish poison, also known as red tide. The red tide affecting Massachusetts is different from the type killing fish in Florida, and swimming remains safe, Gloucester shellfish warden Peter Seminara said. Red tide is a neurotoxin produced by naturally occurring marine algae. “Filter-feeding shellfish ingest it and it gets concentrated in the meat,” he said. Eating contaminated shellfish, even when cooked, is potentially fatal to humans. The ban extends from Salisbury at the New Hampshire border, south to Cape Ann, the North Shore, Boston and to areas of the South Shore.\n\nMichigan\n\nPort Austin: Residents at the tip of Michigan’s Thumb have been passing the hat and helping each other recover from a June tornado that destroyed dozens of properties with its 120 mph winds. A recent fundraiser that included a silent raffle and cornhole tournament raised approximately $10,000, the Huron Daily Tribune reported. “We had one person who wrote a $1,000 check as a donation and other people donated $100 checks,” said Patrick Foogazi, who helped organize the event. “There were people just walking in and giving money. Even the guy who won the cornhole tournament donated the money he won back to the fund,” Foogazi said. The money was given to the Lions Club in Port Austin, which will distribute it to people in need. Dozens of properties were destroyed on June 26 by the tornado. “We don’t even know the full extent of the need,” Lions Club member Casey Bruce said. “I know the insurance companies are still working diligently to get claims processed and maybe we’ll never know the total of the damage caused.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Minnesota has now reached the threshold to trigger the “warning phase” under the statewide drought plan, the Department of Natural Resources said. And the department said it expects another threshold for public water systems that draw from the Mississippi River will be tripped in the coming days as stream flows drop. “Under current conditions, it will take at least 3 to 5 inches of precipitation spread over a period of about two weeks to significantly alleviate the drought,” the DNR said in statement. But the National Weather Service is forecasting below-normal rain and above-normal temperatures for Minnesota and the upper Midwest for the next two weeks, and at least a couple more days of hazy skies from northern wildfires. The updated U.S. Drought Monitor map released Thursday showed that 98% of Minnesota is now in a drought, with 52% of the state in a severe or extreme drought, and conditions are expected to grow drier. The “warning phase” triggers a series of steps, including the convening of a state drought task force made up of state, federal, regional and local experts, which last convened in 2012. Water conservation measures are being recommended, and in some cases mandated. The DNR advised residents and landowners to watch for notifications of restrictions from their local water utilities.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks has named the first African American chief of its law enforcement bureau. The state agency was founded in 1932. Col. Jerry Carter, a U.S. Army veteran, will oversee the work of 160 officers statewide. Carter began his career with the department in 1988 as a conservation officer assigned to his home area of Leflore County. Carter has served in many roles in the department, moving through the ranks as a boater and hunter education administrator, coordinator of communications, commander of the honor guard, emergency management coordinator and commander of the North Mississippi Law Enforcement Region. He earned his bachelor’s degree in criminal justice in 2018 from Mississippi Valley State University and is on track to complete all requirements for a master’s degree this year.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: Gov. Mike Parson said the state will “probably” provide funding for a site to help handle the overflow of COVID-19 patients in Springfield, where hospitals are struggling to keep up with a surge driven by the delta variant and vaccination hesitation. The Republican governor suggested that federal stimulus money also could help pay for the alternative care site health leaders in the city requested. Parson told the Springfield News-Leader that the state will “for the most part probably” fulfill the request. “We’re in the process of kind of going through that right now to see what we can deliver and what we can’t,” he said. “Those are things we’ve done before, so I think we’ll be able to do (the funding).” The fast-spreading delta variant has led to a surge in hospitalizations throughout southwestern Missouri. Springfield’s hospitals are seeing patient counts topping the previous peak in mid-winter. As of Friday, 228 people with COVID-19 were hospitalized there. Three weeks ago, the daily average patient count was fewer than 120.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Two transgender people sued over a new Montana law that makes it difficult for transgender people to change the sex on their birth certificates. Amelia Marquez and John Doe said in a lawsuit filed in Yellowstone County that the law signed this year by Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte violates their right to privacy and equal protection under the law guaranteed by the state Constitution. The law requires transgender people to change their sex by surgical procedure and receive a court order indicating that in order for them to change the sex on their birth certificate. Many transgender people choose not to undergo surgical procedures to affirm their identity. Such procedures are sometimes deemed unnecessary or too expensive. Before the new law passed, transgender residents seeking to change their birth certificate needed only to provide an affidavit to the state health department.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Four endangered indigo snakes are the newest babies at Omaha’s Henry Doorly Zoo & Aquarium, marking a first-time birth of the species at the zoo. The Omaha World-Herald reported that the snakes made their appearance Wednesday and Thursday. Their births are the result of an Eastern Indigo Species Survival Plan recommendation. The zoo said in a news release that such plans manage threatened and endangered species to ensure that they are healthy, genetically diverse and demographically varied across institutions accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. Eastern indigos are native to the southeastern U.S. and are considered the largest nonvenomous snake in the country. Some reach up to 8½ feet in length. Once they are able to feed on their own, the snakes will be moved to a habitat visible to the public.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Farmers, environmentalists and small-town business owners gathered at the Hoover Dam on Thursday to call for a moratorium on pipelines and dams along the Colorado River that they said jeopardizes the 40 million people who rely on it as a water source. They’re pushing for the moratoriums as parts of the U.S. West are gripped by historic drought and hotter temperatures and dry vegetation provide fuel for wildfires sweeping the region. Federal officials expect to make the first water shortage declaration in the Colorado River basin next month, prompting cuts in Arizona, Nevada and Mexico. “We’re here to say, ‘Damn the status quo,’” said Kyle Roerink, the executive director of the Great Basin Water Network. Hot temperatures and less snowpack have decreased the amount of water that flows from the Rocky Mountains down through the arid deserts of the Southwest into the Gulf of California. Scientists attributed the extreme conditions to a combination of natural weather patterns and human-caused climate change, which has made the West warmer and drier in the past 30 years.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPortsmouth:The U.S. Coast Guard rescued three people who were found clinging to the hull of their overturned sailboat about 20 miles off the coast of Portsmouth. A Coast Guard helicopter found the three waving from the water on Friday night. A distress call had come in at about 4:20 p.m. The three were safely hoisted into the helicopter and were taken to Pease Air National Guard Base, where they were evaluated by emergency personnel. No injuries were reported. It wasn’t immediately known what caused the 42-foot boat, Triad, to overturn. The vessel, which was covered by a tarp, was left for commercial salvage.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nFair Lawn: Friday was the last day for residents in Fair Lawn to smell the sweet aroma of freshly baked Oreo cookies as the community’s Nabisco plant shut down after 63 years in operation. Parent company Mondeléz International confirmed it was the last day of production at the plant, which has produced Oreos, Ritz crackers, Lorna Doone and Teddy Grahams since 1958. The plant’s approximate 600 workers have either retired, transferred or were looking for other jobs, the company said. Production began slowing when the company announced in February that it would close the plant in New Jersey and one in Atlanta. The Atlanta plant closed in June. A plant in Richmond, Virginia, remains open.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland visited her home state Saturday to celebrate what marks the largest wilderness land donation in the agency’s history. The 15-square-mile donation from the Trust for Public Land increases the size of the Sabinoso Wilderness Area in northeastern New Mexico by nearly 50%. The property includes rugged canyons, mesas covered by pinon and juniper woodlands, pockets of ponderosa pine trees and savannah-like grasslands. Haaland, who joined other officials at a remote site in San Miguel County, acknowledged that the area makes up part of the ancestral homelands of the Jicarilla Apache and northern pueblos of New Mexico. She said that, for generations, families have relied on the land for sustenance and that it means a lot to many people who visit the area in search of peace and quiet. The area supports an array of wildlife, from elk and deer to mountain lions, turkey and bears.\n\nNew York\n\nSaratoga Springs: State environmental officers and local police are investigating fox attacks and urging people in the area to be cautious outdoors. Melissa Thompson-Flynn told the Times Union of Albany that she was attacked by a fox Wednesday while jogging. She said the animal came up behind her and bit her leg. She said she pried the fox off her leg, but it then bit her right arm. Thompson-Flynn, 51, a retired U.S. Army officer who served in Iraq, grabbed the fox by the throat with her left arm. Police arrived as she was still fighting the fox and an officer killed the animal. Thompson-Flynn remained hospitalized Saturday and has begun a series of anti-rabies shots. On July 12 at a day camp for children hosted by Skidmore College, a fox bit a camp counselor and scratched a camper. They were treated for minor injuries and began receiving anti-rabies shots, a college spokesperson said. Officers with the state Department of Environmental Conservation and wildlife experts have been patrolling the area with local police and college officials and setting traps on the campus.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nStatesville: More than 40 birds have been removed from a park following reports of what was termed “extreme cruelty,” including one duck whose feet were cut off, officials said. The city approved a plan by Carolina Waterfowl Rescue to remove the birds to prevent further incidents from happening, the Statesville Record & Landmark reported. According to the agency, ducks had been used for target practice and another duck was beaten over the head in addition to the duck with its feet cut off. Jennifer Gordon, Carolina Waterfowl Rescue director, said it’s estimated that approximately 75 waterfowl were in the park, but 43 were recovered by the group. Gordon said it was likely the wild birds flew off while the domesticated ones stayed. The ducks were removed last week. Carolina Waterfowl Rescue said the birds will be available for adoption after a health screening.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A change to the state constitution that would place term limits on the governor and members of the Legislature is a step closer to bringing the matter to a public vote. Secretary of State Al Jaeger on Friday announced he approved for circulation a petition for the proposed measure. Supporters have one year to gather 31,164 signatures to put the measure to voters next year. The initiative would add a new article to the state constitution, effective Jan. 1, 2023, imposing term limits of eight cumulative years each in the House and Senate. The governor could not be elected more than twice. Term limits would not be retroactive, which means the service of current officeholders would not count against them. Citizen initiatives allow residents to bypass lawmakers and get proposed state laws and constitutional amendments on ballots if they gather enough signatures from voters.\n\nOhio\n\nNew Concord: John Glenn was honored over the weekend with a three-day festival marking what would have been the history-making astronaut and U.S. senator’s 100th birthday. Glenn, who died in 2016, was the first American to orbit Earth, making him a national hero in 1962. Before that, he served as a military fighter pilot in World War II and the Korean War and set a transcontinental air speed record. In 1998, he became the oldest person to go into space at 77. He spent 24 years as a Democrat in the U.S. Senate. The John Glenn Centennial Celebration Friday to Sunday was a collaboration between Cambridge, where Glenn was born on July 18, 1921, and nearby New Concord, where he grew up and met his late wife, Annie, who died last year at 100 of complications from COVID-19. Lyn Glenn, the late senator’s daughter, watched parade floats go by Saturday from the front porch of her father’s childhood home.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Board members of a southwest Oklahoma City school district have defied the state Board of Education and hired an interim superintendent. The Western Heights school board voted 3-1 on Thursday to name assistant Superintendent Kim Race interim superintendent, replacing Mannix Barnes. Barnes’ superintendent certification was suspended by the state board last month after the district was placed on probation by the state board in April for concerns including financial management, heavy staff losses and poor academic performance. The state board took over the district July 12 and on Tuesday, deputy state Superintendent Monty Guthrie was named to head the district for the next year. “I am definitely worried that what just happened is illegal,” said Briana Flatley, who cast the lone vote against naming Race interim superintendent. The three board members who voted for the move did not speak as they left the meeting.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Authorities are asking for the public’s help in investigating five fires that ignited in the same vicinity in northeast Salem early Friday. The fires were reported to police starting about 2 a.m., and all occurred in the area bordered by Market Street, Fisher Road, Silverton Road and Lancaster Drive NE, police officials said. Detectives are investigating the fires because of to their “suspicious nature,” though it’s unknown if the fires were set by the same individual, according to Lt. Treven Upkes, a spokesperson with the police department. There were no injuries reported, Upkes said. Officials did not immediately have cost estimates on damages from the fires. Police are asking anyone who might have witnessed suspicious activity in the areas of the fires to call the Salem Police Tips Line at (503) 588-8477. Authorities are also asking anyone in the area with video surveillance systems to check recordings around the time of the fires and report any findings to police.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The Philadelphia Zoo is gearing up to vaccinate its highest-risk animals with an experimental COVID-19 vaccine developed by Zoetis, a former subsidiary of Pfizer that develops drugs for animals. Although animals are not a major concern for spreading the virus to humans, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, they night still get infected. Cases have been reported in some big cats and gorillas at zoos, household pets, and farmed minks, motivating zoos nationwide to help their animals build up immune defenses. Gorillas at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park not only got infected with the coronavirus, but also developed unpleasant symptoms like coughing and congestion.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Nature trails and hiking paths across Rhode Island are getting $1.4 million worth of improvements through Federal Highway Administration grants, state officials said. The money administered by the state departments of Environmental Management and Transportation is being distributed to 22 communities and nonprofits to support erosion repair and control, resurfacing, accessibility improvements, signage and other improvement projects that will benefit hikers and other users. The grants provide up to 80% of the cost for eligible project components.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Riverbanks Zoo and Garden in Columbia is closing its aquarium and reptile building starting next month for about a yearlong renovation project. The zoo plans to change the building into a center for reptiles and animals who live in water, in a way that emphasizes conservation efforts the zoo does behind the scenes every day, officials said in a statement. The new center will include a number of habitats. One is called the Florida Reef Tract Rescue Project, where zoo workers have spent three years trying to care for 40 reef colonies being destroyed by an unknown disease. Zoo visitors can watch as researchers also try to save the animals who lived among the coral, officials said. Riverbanks Zoo is shifting several exhibits and sending some animals to other zoos, including two false gharial crocodiles that had been at the facility more than 30 years. Their old tropical habitat will become a desert biome in the new building.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:The remains of six Rosebud Sioux children who died at the government-run Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Pennsylvania between 1880 and 1910 were buried Saturday night in the Rosebud Sioux Tribe Veterans Cemetery. Three other children were buried in familial cemetery plots. Saturday was the final stop for the children after an emotional previous two days that included prayer ceremonies and remembrances. The nine children were brought to the former boarding school in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, in 1880. Some died from illness within months of arriving, others died years later after failed attempts of escaping the horrors of the school meant to “kill the Indian, save the man.” The effort to return the remains took nearly six years. A caravan of young adults tasked with bringing the remains home to the reservation set out Tuesday from the site of the former school, which is about 20 miles west of the Pennsylvania capital Harrisburg.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A death row inmate made a rare public appearance Friday during a court hearing about claims that he is intellectually disabled and should not be executed for the slayings of a mother and daughter more than 30 years ago. Wearing a checkered blue sports jacket, white shirt and paisley tie, Pervis Payne listened as attorneys argued over a request by prosecutors to obtain prison records as part of Payne’s planned mental evaluation by a state expert. Payne, 54, was brought to Memphis from Nashville, where has been held in a high-security prison since his conviction and death sentence for the 1987 stabbing deaths of Charisse Christopher and her 2-year-old daughter, Lacie Jo. Christopher’s son, Nicholas, who was 3 at the time, also was stabbed but survived. The stabbings took place in Millington, located north of Memphis. The last time Payne was seen outside prison was in 2007, when he attended a court hearing in Memphis.\n\nTexas\n\nSpring: A chemical leak at a Houston-area water park left dozens suffering from minor skin irritation and respiratory issues Saturday, authorities said. Twenty-nine people were taken to local hospitals following the incident at Six Flags Hurricane Harbor Splashtown, the Harris County Fire Marshal’s Office tweeted. Thirty-nine others declined to be taken to a hospital after undergoing decontamination procedures. KPRC-TV reported that some of those who became sick were children, including a 3-year-old who was hospitalized in stable condition. The chemicals involved included hypochlorite solution and 35% sulfuric acid, officials said. Authorities are investigating the cause of the incident, which they said was contained to one attraction at the park.\n\nUtah\n\nLund: Three workers on a freight train were injured when it derailed while crossing tracks covered with water in a remote part of southern Utah on Thursday night, authorities said. The train, which had nearly 100 cars, tipped on its side after derailing near Lund, about 85 miles from the Nevada border. The three workers were able to get out of the train, climbing out on top of the tilted locomotive but were trapped there because of flooding, the Iron County Sheriff’s Office said. Emergency crews had a difficult time getting to the train due to the weather and floodwaters but were able to reach the workers at around 1 a.m. Friday. After some time, they were taken off the train and taken to the hospital, the sheriff’s office said. Two of the workers were in good condition and the other was in stable condition.\n\nVermont\n\nBradford: The pilot of a hot-air balloon that had been carrying a total of five people is dead after becoming entangled in gear underneath the basket and then falling to the ground, state police said. The balloon took off from the Post Mills airport Thursday afternoon. Some time later, the balloon touched down in a field and one passenger fell out, but was not injured. At that point, the pilot became entangled in gear affixed to the balloon as it reascended. He eventually fell to the ground in a field where he was pronounced dead. After the pilot’s death, three other passengers remained in the balloon until it got caught in a grove of trees about 1.5 miles farther north in Piermont, New Hampshire, where they escaped without injury. The name of the pilot was not immediately released until his family could be notified. The incident is being investigated by officials from the National Transportation Safety Board, the Federal Aviation Administration and state transportation officials from Vermont and New Hampshire.\n\nVirginia\n\nAlexandria: A former senior NASA employee who cheated the government out of nearly $275,000 in pandemic-related financial assistance has been sentenced to 18 months in prison. The sentence imposed Thursday on Andrew Tezna, 36, of Leesburg was roughly in line with the 21-month sentence sought by federal prosecutors in Alexandria. Tezna’s attorney had asked for a sentence of home detention. Tezna pleaded guilty to fraud after submitting bogus applications under the government’s Paycheck Protection Program. He concocted businesses in his own name and that of his mother-in-law, and grossly inflated the scope of a side business owned by his wife. He also falsely filed for unemployment benefits on behalf of his mother-in-law, who was retired. During the fraud, Tezna was making more than $180,000 annually working in NASA’s financial offices. He used the money to pay off a swimming pool, credit cards, and a Disney timeshare. He also paid more than $6,000 to a dog breeder for a French bulldog. In all, Tezna admitted to applying for more than $350,000 in benefits and receiving more than $270,000.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: A record-shattering heat wave in the Pacific Northwest prompted fishing and conservation groups to ask a federal court Friday to order more spill from dams on the lower Snake and Columbia rivers next spring, which could aid the migration of endangered salmon and steelhead runs. Earthjustice, on behalf of a coalition of fishing and conservation groups, asked a federal court in Portland, Oregon, for more water to be released to help the fish navigate a series of dams in the river basins. Increasing the amount of water helps flush young fish along their river migration to reach the ocean where they mature. Four dams in eastern Washington – Ice Harbor, Little Goose, Lower Monumental and Lower Granite – slow passage along the lower Snake River, a major migration corridor linking pristine cold-water streams in central Idaho to the Columbia River and out to the Pacific Ocean. The dams plus rising water temperatures in the reservoirs make the passage increasingly deadly, conservation groups contended. Many are calling for the four dams to be breached.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice said he does not have plans to bring back restrictions to curb the spread of COVID-19 as the more contagious delta variant begins spreading in the state. He took a shot at Los Angeles County, where officials have reinstated an indoor mask requirement in the nation’s largest county. “We’re not Los Angeles. Thank God. And boy, do I ever mean that,” Justice said. There are 19 confirmed cases of the delta variant in West Virginia, according to state data. West Virginia lags behind all five bordering states in total vaccine doses administered per 100,000 people, according to federal data. The more transmissible delta variant is leading to a nationwide rise in cases again after months of decline. State data showd that 58.2% of all residents have received at least one dose of the vaccine. Justice set a new goal this week of vaccinating 85% of residents 50 and older, a group that has 81.5% coverage. He also wants 90% of those age 65 and older to receive a shot, while 88.7% currently have one.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Walmart Inc. lost a federal lawsuit when a jury sided with a sales associate who has Down syndrome and alleged that schedule changes exacerbated attendance problems that led to her firing. The jury in federal court in Green Bay awarded Marlo Spaeth more than $125 million in punitive damages on Thursday, but a Walmart spokesman said Friday that under federal law, that will be reduced to the maximum allowed, which is $300,000. The jury also awarded Spaeth $150,000 in compensatory damages, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said Friday in announcing the ruling. The EEOC brought the case against Walmart. Walmart spokesman Randy Hargrove said the retail giant was reviewing its legal options. He said Walmart does not tolerate discrimination of any kind and routinely accommodates thousands of employees every year. Spaeth worked for Walmart for about 16 years before she was fired from its Manitowoc store in 2015 because of excessive absenteeism. Changes to her work schedule following implementation of a new computerized system in 2014 created significant difficulty for her, the lawsuit alleged. The jury found that Walmart failed to accommodate Spaeth’s disability and fired her because of it, which is a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, the EEOC said.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: A new U.S. report said coal production in Wyoming, the nation's top coal-mining state, fell by 21% in 2020 from the previous year, caused in part by reduced demand during the coronavirus pandemic, low natural gas prices and a longstanding move away from fossil fuels to cheaper and cleaner-burning natural gas to generate electricity. A U.S. Energy Information Industry Administration report this week also said the nation's coal production in 2020 was at its lowest level since 1965, The Casper Star-Tribune reported. Wyoming produced 41% of the nation’s coal in 2020, the EIA said. Total U.S. coal production fell 24% in 2020 from 2019 and coal-fired power generation dropped by 20%. Coal exports were down 26%, the EIA said. Production has increased to meet rising electricity demand as the economy reopens this year. The EIA estimates that U.S. coal production this year will be 15% higher than in 2020. Travis Deti, executive director of the Wyoming Mining Association, said coal still provides 20% to 23% of U.S. electricity supply. Many of some 572 coal industry jobs lost last year in Wyoming are returning, Deti said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/04/26/school-satan-club-plane-swap-fail-amazon-helix-news-around-states/50142737/", "title": "After School Satan Club, plane swap fail: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: The state will remember the Holocaust, the systematic slaughter of Jews and other people by Nazis, with events planned for this week in Montgomery and Birmingham. The Alabama Holocaust Commission is sponsoring an annual gathering of remembrance Tuesday at the Alabama Department of Archives and History in the capital. A child survivor of the Holocaust, Inge Auerbacher, is scheduled to speak, and a state proclamation will be presented. A commemoration will also be held Thursday at Temple Beth-El in Birmingham. The program will feature George Nathan, the son of Alabama Holocaust survivors Henry and Sophie Nathan. The family lived in both Anniston and Birmingham after arriving in the United States. About 6 million people were killed by the Nazis in the early 1940s during World War II. The state Holocaust commission holds events each year to remember the victims.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Legislators are considering a request by Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s administration that the state take over part of a federal environmental permitting program, though some members of the state Senate’s budget-writing committee have expressed concerns with the potential costs. Administration officials have said the idea behind the proposal is to speed the construction of roads, bridges, mines and drilling projects, the Anchorage Daily News reports. While the state would have to follow federal standards, critics of the proposal say the state has traditionally favored development and underfunded oversight capabilities. Industry groups say the current permitting process is too slow. The House included a $4.9 million increase to the budget of the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, which expects to hire 28 new staff members. The funding was part of the House version of the state operating budget, which passed earlier this month; senators currently are working on their version. If the proposed increase is approved, department officials plan a two-year process to take over part of the federal Clean Water Act known as Section 404. Permits issued under that section determine whether a developer can fill wetlands, rivers or other bodies of water during construction.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Aviation history wasn’t made Sunday night, but disaster was avoided, as cousins Luke Aikins and Andy Farrington were unsuccessful in completing the first-ever “plane swap.” One plane spiraled out of control as the two pilots were thousands of feet in the air. Both pilots were safe with no reported injuries. The Red Bull-sponsored flight, which took place at an undisclosed location in Arizona, began as the two pilots ascended to the skies about 5:45 p.m. local time. Nearly an hour later, the two jumped out at 12,100 feet in the air with the airbrake system engaged on both planes. Aikins was able to successfully get into the other plane, but Farrington was unable to do the same. The plane spiraled out of control as Farrington could be heard saying on-air: “Blue plane is out of control.” Farrington then deployed his parachute and safely landed in a remote area. The uncontrolled plane had a parachute on it that automatically activated when it got to a certain altitude, and it was deployed before touching the ground. The condition and location of the plane weren’t immediately known. The 6-mile-per-hour winds created good conditions for the stunt, the pilots said leading up to the stunt, as the area had faster winds in the days leading up to the event. But Farrington was unsure what happened.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Friday said he was refusing most of $146 million in federal pandemic rental assistance the state was to receive, citing the state’s low unemployment rate and economic climate. With Hutchinson’s decision, Arkansas joins Nebraska in turning down the latest round of pandemic rental assistance funds. Hutchinson, a Republican, asked U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen that the state be allowed to use 39% of the funds — about $60 million — for “housing stability” programs offered by nonprofit groups that would include job training, education and treatment as well as some rental assistance. Arkansas still has about $20 million from the first round of rental assistance that was given to states. “Our economy has returned, there’s jobs aplenty out there and we have existing programs in place for rental assistance that were pre-pandemic,” Hutchinson told reporters at a news conference at the Capitol.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Nearly 2,000 homeless people died in Los Angeles County during the first year of the pandemic, an increase of 56% from the previous year, driven mainly by drug overdoses, authorities said. The findings released Friday in a report from the county’s Department of Public Health showed that despite initial fears, the coronavirus itself was not the main culprit in deaths among California’s largest-in-the-nation unhoused population. But it did cut people off from mental health and substance abuse treatment after services were drastically reduced to prevent the spread of the virus. Between April 1, 2020, and March 31, 2021, the county recorded 1,988 deaths of homeless people, up from 1,271 deaths during the same period a year earlier, the report said. During both of those years, drug overdoses were the leading cause of death, but they increased by 78% in the pandemic’s first year. In the pre-pandemic year, the Department of Public Health reported 402 fatal overdoses. In the year after the outbreak, the number nearly doubled to 715, the report said. The report found that 179 homeless people died from COVID-19 during the pandemic’s first year. A San Francisco study released last month showed similar findings: Between March 2020 and March 2021, there were 331 homeless deaths recorded in San Francisco, more than twice the number of any previous year, with the leading cause of death being drug overdose, according to a study conducted by the University of California San Francisco and the city’s Department of Public Health.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: Heading into what experts speculate may be one of the worst summers of wildfire the state has seen, Gov. Jared Polis and state fire officials are preparing for the future. “We are vastly improving our year-round fire response, expanding our arsenal of world-class firefighting tools and continuing to activate every tool we have to help our communities prepare for and respond to the threat of wildfires and climate change,” Polis said in a press release Friday. In the past two years, Colorado has experienced the three largest wildfires in state history – the Cameron Peak Fire, the East Troublesome Fire and the Pine Gulch Fire – and just five months ago it saw the most destructive fire in state history, the Marshall Fire. Just last week brought wildfires in Monte Vista, near Longmont; between Gypsum and Dotsero, in Custer County; and northeast of Las Animas, according to state officials. “Colorado could very well be headed towards the worst wildfire season in the state’s history. We need to take action,” state Senate President Steve Fenberg said. He is supporting legislation that would invest $15 million in first responders and communities to improve the state’s emergency dispatch system and add a second air tanker and two high-quality helicopters. The bill would also create the Office of Climate Preparedness.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew London: The recent appearance of two cruise ships in the city has raised hopes that Connecticut might stand to benefit from the return of an industry decimated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The two ships, part of American Queen Voyages, were on a tour of the East Coast and Canada and were the first cruise ships to stop in New London in four years. Both are scheduled to stop in New London on the way back south in the fall. The ships each brought about 90 passengers and 75 crew members and were met with gift bags, discounts in local restaurants and a driving tour of the city. Connecticut also has deep-water ports in New Haven and Bridgeport that can handle large ships, but the state often isn’t seen as a cruise destination. “It’s encouraging that with the industry just really trying to make a comeback, they picked New London,” Mayor Michael Passero told the New Haven Register. Connecticut ports could benefit from Canada’s reopening its own ports to cruises after two years, as well as from industry trends toward more domestic routes and smaller ships that cater to an older clientele, said Chris Gray Faust, managing editor of consumer review site Cruise Critic. “There has been a pivot toward more domestic cruises,” Gray Faust told the newspaper. “Some of these ports are ones that you don’t think of as cruise ports, necessarily.”\n\nDelaware\n\nNew Castle: The Wall That Heals, a traveling replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, is returning to the First State on Tuesday. The Vietnam War memorial will be escorted by Delaware State Police and veterans on motorcycles to New Castle, where it will be met by students and volunteers at Southern Elementary School about 1:45 p.m. Tuesday and at William Penn High school about 2:30 p.m. The Wall That Heals is a mobile exhibit that features a three-quarter scale replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. The replica, built in 1996, stands 7 feet 6 inches high at its tallest point and 375 feet long. Similar to the original, it is erected in a chevron shape and allows visitors to do name rubbings of individual service members’ names. Visitors can also experience the Wall rising above them as they walk toward the apex, a key feature of the Washington memorial. After arrival at William Penn High School – the first school in the nation to host the wall – the setup will begin Wednesday. The Wall will be open to the public 24 hours a day, starting Friday and ending Sunday at 2 p.m. More than 100 volunteers are needed to guard the wall, help with parking and assist with events in the coming days. An opening ceremony begins at 9 a.m. Thursday with a Prisoner of War keynote speaker. A candlelight vigil will be held at 8 p.m. Saturday to read the names of Hometown Heroes from the exhibit with a procession along the wall and a 21-gun salute.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Jon Stewart, accepting the Kennedy Center’s Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, warned Sunday night that speculation about the future of comedy amid increased audience cultural sensitivity was ignoring a true and enduring threat: authoritarian governments around the world. “Comedy doesn’t change the world, but it’s a bellwether,” Stewart said. “When a society feels under threat, comedians are who gets sent away first.” Stewart pointed in the audience to Egyptian comedian Bassem Youssef, whose Stewart-inspired political comedy show earned him both fame and self-imposed exile. Youssef’s story is “an example of the true threat to comedy,” Stewart said. The intersection of comedy and politics was the main theme as celebrities and comedy royalty gathered to honor Stewart, who set the modern template for mixing the topics during his 16-year run hosting TV’s “The Daily Show.” Stewart, the 23rd recipient of the prize, was honored in testimonials from fellow comedians and previous Mark Twain Prize recipients. And his political influence was apparent Sunday from a guest list that included House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and White House press secretary Jen Psaki. This was the first Mark Twain ceremony since Dave Chappelle’s in 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic scuttled the event in 2020 and 2021.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: The judge overseeing jury selection for a man who murdered 17 people at a high school declared Monday that the process will start over, conceding she should have questioned 11 potential jurors who said they would not follow the law before she dismissed them. In granting the motion filed by Nikolas Cruz’s prosecutors over the strong objection of his attorneys, Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer nullified two weeks of work by prosecution and defense lawyers, forcing them to begin the entire process anew Monday. As a result, almost 250 potential jurors who had said they could sit for a four-month trial will not be called back next month for further questioning. More than 1,200 candidates had been screened. Prosecutor Carolyn McCann made her argument after miscommunication caused 11 jurors who were improperly dismissed by Scherer two weeks ago not to be told to return to court Monday as had been planned for further questioning. Scherer said they would be brought in next week, but McCann argued that more time would be wasted if it turned out the potential jurors had to be struck anyway. She said the prosecution has just as much right to question potential jurors and to an untainted final panel as the defense. “This is not harmless error,” McCann said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Officials have put the brakes on the city’s largest road race. The Rock ’n’ Roll Marathon has brought tens of thousands of runners to Georgia’s picturesque founding city since first adding Savannah to its race roster in 2011. But Mayor Van Johnson said the city won’t be granting marathon organizers a permit or paying the $25,000 contract fee this year. Organizers released a statement saying a comeback in 2023 appears unlikely. They had intended to return to Savannah this fall, and runners had been registering for the race before City Hall announced its decision. Johnson told news outlets Savannah needs a break from the marathon to evaluate whether it’s worth the cost – not just in taxpayer money for sanitation and extra police but also in hassles to residents and businesses affected by street closures. He said the city has recouped “a relatively very small percentage” of what it has spent on the event. Visit Savannah, the city’s tourism bureau, reported the 2019 marathon had an economic impact of $23 million. Michael Owens, president of Savannah’s Tourism Leadership Council, said the race gave the city’s hospitality industry a needed shot in the arm during what’s otherwise a slow period for tourists right before the holidays. “To be honest with you, it’s devastating,” Owens told WTOC-TV. “I’ve gotten more phone calls about this than anything. I’ve gotten more calls about the cancellation of Rock ’n’ Roll than I did in the beginning of the pandemic.”\n\nHawaii\n\nWahiawa: The only skilled nursing and rehabilitation facility in central Oahu expects to close this summer. Wahiawa General Hospital said it plans to close its long-term nursing center July 22, citing insufficient insurance reimbursements and continued financial challenges, Hawaii News Now reports. It’s also been struggling to hire and retain staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. Wahiawa General, a small independent hospital, had received millions in taxpayers dollars to keep it afloat in the past, but it is still losing over a million dollars a year. It also doesn’t have the money to improve existing facilities, such as the long-term nursing center, which was built in 1966. Hospital administrators said many of the patients in Wahiawa are covered by the Supplemental Security Income program or Medicaid, which have low reimbursement rates. The long-term care center has 115 beds, according to its website. It currently has 60 patients. John McDermott, the state’s long-term care ombudsman, said Hawaii can’t afford to lose nursing homes, especially when the state’s senior population is increasing so rapidly. The nearest alternatives for skilled nursing and rehabilitation are in Kaneohe and Pearl City. Wahiawa General is giving 90 days’ notice and helping to relocate patients.\n\nIdaho\n\nLewiston: Jurors convicted a 17-year-old boy of first-degree murder after about three hours of deliberation Thursday. Demetri Ewing and his father Clyde Ewing were both charged with first-degree murder in connection with the Jan. 8, 2021, shooting death of Samuel Johns, The Lewiston Tribune reports. Clyde Ewing has pleaded not guilty, and his trial is scheduled to begin May 16. Ewing, who was 16 at the time of the shooting, was charged as an adult and could face up to life in prison when he is sentenced in June. During Demetri Ewing’s nearly two-week trial, Nez Perce County prosecutors said the father and son were in the midst of a family dispute over a missing gun and an Army bag that had belonged to Clyde Ewing’s late father. Prosecutors said the pair believed the bag had been left at Johns’ home, so they left their motel in Clarkston, Washington, and rode bicycles to Johns’ residence in the neighboring town of Lewiston, Idaho. Nez Perce County Prosecutor Justin Coleman said the Ewings used zipper-style cable ties to bind the hands of a woman in the home, and that one of them shot and killed Johns. Under Idaho law, prosecutors are not required to prove which defendant killed someone, only that a person was killed in the process of another planned felony like a burglary.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A man seen on video wheeling a bulky suitcase out of a woman’s apartment has been acquitted of murder. Cook County Judge Diana Kenworthy noted a lack of evidence against Jimmy Jackson, 75, and said the video was not enough to convict him. Daisy Hayes, 65, disappeared in 2018. Family members were stunned by the verdict Friday. “All I could do is scream and just run out the courtroom – like, what didn’t you see?” daughter Teresa Smith said of the video. Jackson, 75, and Hayes, 65, had an intermittent relationship. “You see him struggling with this suitcase. You see him actually put the suitcase in the dumpster. You actually see him take garbage from other dumpsters to put on top of her so it can be concealed,” Smith said. Jackson was arrested in Tennessee after Daisy disappeared.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Local native and 12-time Grammy-winning singer and producer Babyface will headline the Madam Walker Legacy Center on June 17 as part of a weekend­long Juneteenth celebration at the historic theater. Tours of the newly remodeled center, a family-friendly outdoor block party and other musical performances will be spread throughout Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Babyface, whose given name is Kenneth Edmonds, will also be inducted into the Madam Walker Legacy Center Walk of Fame. His credits include some 250 top-10 R&B and pop hits, working with the likes of Beyoncé, Aretha Franklin and Whitney Houston. He last performed in Indianapolis on the free stage of the Indiana State Fair in August.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The local school district plans to hold a series of discussions to address school violence following a shooting outside East High School last month. The five public meetings will give the school community a chance to talk about concerns related to violence in schools and communities and how to begin healing from the shooting death of Jose Lopez-Perez, 15. While Des Moines Public Schools is hosting the events, outside community groups will guide the conversations. Lopez-Perez was shot and killed outside the school March 7. Also injured were East High School students Kemery Ortega, 18, and Jessica Lopez, 16. Ten teenagers have been charged with Lopez-Perez’s death and the shooting. The meetings’ topics will be guided using information gleaned from earlier conversations with student following the shooting. East High School students focused their discussion on student health and well-being, school climate, culture, and safety, said Madeline Cano, the East community school coordinator. Students also said they wanted to see the school “bounce back from COVID.” The community school coordinators help support students and families within Des Moines schools and the community.\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: A Wyandotte County judge struck down a GOP-authored congressional map enacted earlier this year and ordered the Legislature to take steps to address what he considered to be gerrymandered district lines. It is the first time a state-level judge has waded into redistricting for the U.S. House, though the ruling is all but certain to be appealed, setting up a showdown at the Kansas Supreme Court. Wyandotte County District Court Judge Bill Klapper called the maps passed over the veto of Gov. Laura Kelly earlier this year “motivated at least in part by an intent to dilute minority voting strength” and said state courts had the right to take up redistricting cases. Three lawsuits were filed challenging the map, arguing the new district lines illicitly divide the Kansas City area and improperly place Lawrence in the sweeping 1st Congressional District dominated by western Kansas. Supporters say the decision to divide Wyandotte and Johnson counties, as well as splitting Kansas City between the 3rd and 2nd districts, was born out of simple math, with population growing in the region. But critics argue the endeavor amounted to nothing more than racial and political gerrymandering, something cited by Klapper in his 200-plus-page opinion that quoted everything from the French philosopher Montesquieu to folk music.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: An arson unit is investigating after a fire destroyed a synagogue and worship center on the final day of Passover. Rabbi Avrohom Litvin, regional director of Chabad of Kentucky, said the blaze started as a grease fire in a building adjoining Louisville’s Chabad House early Saturday, WDRB-TV reports. Firefighters brought it under control, but it apparently rekindled around noon, and the Chabad House caught fire. Litvin said the Chabad House was quickly engulfed in flames, and the roof collapsed. No one was injured, but the sanctuary and nearly everything in it was destroyed, Litvin said. Only the Torah scrolls were rescued, having been removed that morning for an off-site remembrance service due to electricity being cut off at the synagogue. Litvin said it was a “miracle” the 75 congregants – including 25 children – were not in the synagogue at the time of the larger fire and in harm’s way. “There’s a story of a man who was on his way to a big vacation, and he breaks his leg, and he feels so bad that God let his leg be broken just before his vacation,” he said. “And then he reads that the plane went down, and he says, ‘God saved my life by breaking my leg.’ “So I absolutely see the hand of God here. ... Yes, this leg got broken; the core of the building is gone. But we can rebuild the building.” Litvin said officials told him they have not uncovered any evidence of arson, though their investigation is ongoing, including determining if the second fire was a reignition of the first.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A small, historically Black university known for its success in getting graduates into medical school announced Thursday that it is now planning its own medical school. The coronavirus pandemic emphasized the need for greater diversity in medicine because representation and trust are part of the reasons for health disparities affecting underrepresented populations, said Reynold Verret, president of Xavier University of Louisiana. “Xavier was founded with the mission of promoting the creation of a just and humane society through education,” he said in a news release announcing plans for a medical school and graduate school of health sciences in New Orleans. “The establishment of graduate education programs dedicated to the preparation of more black healthcare professionals is a natural extension of our foundress’ legacy as we approach our second century of service. It is also where we are called to answer a critical need of our nation.” For decades, the Catholic school founded in 1925 has graduated more African American students and students of color who go on to get medical degrees and health doctorates than any other higher education institution in the U.S., the news release said.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Democratic Gov. Janet Mills asked tribal chiefs and legislative leaders in a letter made public Monday to drop their effort to amend a 1980 land settlement deal that gave the state of Maine some governmental power over tribes. Mills said the proposal to expand tribal sovereignty could be a setback in tribal relations with her administration, instead of building on recent successes. “I do not wish to have a confrontation,” she wrote in the letter. “It would serve no constructive purpose and only inflame emotions on all sides of the discussion.” The letter was written Thursday night, the day before the bill failed to advance in the appropriations committee. Maggie Dana, chief of the Passamaquoddy Tribe at Pleasant Point, said previously she hoped the governor would be “on the right side of history” and agree to the long-sought changes. For the tribes, it has been a long, frustrating battle since they traded some rights to the state under the $81.5 million Maine Indian Land Claims Settlement Act of 1980, signed by President Jimmy Carter. Because of the settlement, tribes in Maine have less autonomy than tribes elsewhere across the country, and their reservations are treated like municipalities, subject to state law. Critics of extending tribal sovereignty feared there could be unintended consequences and further litigation if that changed.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: A potentially lucrative revenue stream for struggling commercial fishermen and women could become a reality as the state begins to research a shrimp fishery in Maryland’s warming waters. The bill, introduced by state Sen. Mary Beth Carozza, R-Worcester, would allow the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to establish a shrimp fishery pilot program for certain commercial licenses. “As a lifelong commercial fisherman, I have seen changes to our environment, our fisheries and our livelihood,” said Sonny Gwin, a fisherman based in Ocean City. “An abundant amount of shrimp has been seen in Maryland waters, both in the Atlantic Ocean and its tributaries. We would like to have the opportunity to participate.” Gwin said the first step in diversifying the industry on the Delmarva Peninsula is understanding the impact it could have. Warming waters in the Atlantic Ocean are among the reasons much of the seafood caught off Maryland’s coast is becoming more diverse. White shrimp, which typically thrive in the Gulf of Mexico and south Atlantic Ocean, used to only venture as far north as North Carolina in any significant numbers. But as water temperatures rise off the coast of Maryland, shrimp have moved farther north.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nNantucket: Scientists at MIT are proposing releasing hordes of genetically altered mice on the posh vacation destination of Nantucket to combat the growing scourge of Lyme disease. Researchers with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab’s Mice Against Ticks project explained their plan to residents of the island off Cape Cod at a recent meeting, The Boston Globe reports. The scientists said hundreds of thousands of native white-footed mice engineered to resist the bacteria that causes Lyme could help slow disease transmission. They say if Lyme were less prevalent among mice, then fewer ticks would contract the disease, leading to less cases among humans. The proposal would require review from regulators, not to mention local support, but Joanna Buchthal, the project’s research director, argues the idea offers a “real, if revolutionary, way” to address the disease. “With so many people suffering from Lyme every single day, which is an awful disease, we need a solution urgently,” she told the newspaper. Nantucket is one of Massachusetts’ hot spots for Lyme disease, which is now the most common infectious disease on the island, the Globe reports. Incidents of Lyme disease have nearly doubled nationwide since 1991, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nMichigan\n\nTaylor: A person taking part in a suburban Detroit police training program suffered a gunshot wound and was hospitalized, Michigan State Police said. The shooting happened Sunday afternoon during the exercise at a Taylor city park for the city’s volunteer auxiliary police program. The civilian was a “role player” in a training scenario when an auxiliary officer in the training fired a shot from his service revolver, hitting the person in the abdomen, state police said. The person was taken to a hospital in stable condition. State police investigators were reviewing the shooting at the request of Taylor police. The volunteers with Taylor’s auxiliary police assist the city police force during emergencies and help with other duties such as home and business checks and anti-crime programs, according to the city website.\n\nMinnesota\n\nCrookston: Volunteers and National Guard members in northwestern Minnesota spent two days sandbagging to fortify the city from an expected record flood along the Red Lake River. Gov. Tim Walz authorized 100 members of the Guard to assist with the flood fight after heavy rains forced the the tributary of the Red River to spill its banks. At least 50 Guard members were on hand over the weekend to aid efforts through Sunday. The National Weather Service has been predicting the Red Lake River to near 29 feet Monday or Tuesday. The record high water mark was 28.4 feet in 1997. No injuries or damages have been reported, and the city has not asked anyone to evacuate, Crookston Police Chief Darin Selzler said. Officials were switching from a sandbagging to monitoring stage late Sunday, the Crookston Times reports. Several counties in the northwestern Minnesota region have declared local emergencies and activated their emergency plans, according to Walz’s office. Many county roads were covered with water or washed out, and officials warned motorists about attempting to drive through flooded areas. The Red Lake River flows into the Red River at East Grand Forks and Grand Forks, North Dakota, where officials from both cities have started to activate permanent flood protection measures.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state is enacting a new law that says state and local government agencies cannot withhold services or refuse jobs to people who choose not to get vaccinated against COVID-19. The ban applies to state agencies, city and county governments and schools, community colleges and universities. COVID-19 vaccination mandates have not been widespread in Mississippi, but some lawmakers said they were acting against the possibility of government overreach. Republican Gov. Tate Reeves said Friday that he had signed House Bill 1509, and it became law immediately. “Government shouldn’t be in the business of forcing Americans to choose between the COVID-19 vaccine & putting food on their tables, sending their kids to school, or visiting a small business,” Reeves said on Twitter. The law specifies that COVID-19 vaccinations cannot be required for children to attend school or day care. It does not change Mississippi’s other childhood vaccination requirements, which are some of most stringent in the nation. The law also says anyone in Mississippi can cite “a sincerely held religious objection” to avoid a public or private employer’s COVID-19 vaccination mandate.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A bill approved by the state Senate would impose limits on Missouri’s public records law to exclude certain types of documents and communications and no longer classify some meetings of elected officials as “public.” Senate Bill 741 was initially designed to limit personal information of constituents from being public in records requested by members of the public but was amended Thursday by Sen. Andrew Koenig, R-St. Louis, to include a litany of other adjustments to the Missouri Sunshine Law. The law allows for members of the public, press and other organizations to request and acquire government documents. Under the bill, documents and communications “that do not have substantial administrative or operational value” would not be considered public records and could thus be made unobtainable through a request. “A lot of times when you’re working on a bill, you’re going to go through many drafts, and you want to be able to think out loud with your staff a little bit, and it might not even be a good idea,” Koenig said. “When it’s not a working document, I think it’s appropriate for that to not necessarily be public.” The legislation allows the state to close any document kept by lawmakers and staff “that contains information regarding proposed legislation or the legislative process.”\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A judge has temporarily blocked enforcement of a state law that required transgender people to have undergone a “surgical procedure” before being allowed to change the sex listed on their birth certificates. District Judge Michael Moses of Billings ruled Thursday that the law is unconstitutionally vague because it does not specify what surgical procedure must be performed. The law also required transgender people to obtain a court order indicating they’d had a surgical procedure. Because he could grant the temporary injunction based on the vagueness issue, Moses said he did not further analyze the constitutionality of the law. “We are thrilled that the court recognized the substantial and unnecessary burdens this law places upon transgender individuals in violation of their constitutional rights,” said Akilah Lane, staff attorney at the ACLU of Montana, which challenged the law. The plaintiffs – Amelia Marquez, of Billings, and a transgender man who is not identified in court records – wanted to change the sex on their birth certificates without undergoing costly surgical procedures. Both argue having a birth certificate that does not match their gender identity puts them at risk of embarrassment, discrimination, harassment or violence if they are asked to provide their birth certificate.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Google says it will invest more than $750 million in the state in 2022, including construction of a data center in Omaha. The Omaha World-Herald reports the investment also includes an expansion of Google’s existing data center in Papillion. Company leaders did not provide specific financial details for that or any of the other projects during an event with elected leaders in Papillion. The new northwest Omaha data center will be the third Google data center to open in the region. Along with the facility in Papillion, Google has one in Council Bluffs. The Nebraska projects are part of Google’s investment of about $9.5 billion in offices and data centers across the U.S. A company official said Google didn’t have any job figures for the Omaha area.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: An electric scooter sharing program years in the making has finally launched. The City Council approved an exclusive three-year franchising deal with Bird, a company that partners with cities to provide e-scooters and e-bikes. On Thursday, city officials and Bird representatives met for a ribbon-cutting ceremony to mark the official start of the program, which aims to bolster “micromobility” transport options downtown and in Midtown. Bird’s e-scooter fleet will deploy in phases over the next eight weeks, with the full fleet reaching approximately 1,000 scooters, a schedule released by City Council shows. The program operates at no cost to the city, which will receive a cut of every scooter ride around town. Riders will pay $1 to start the vehicle and 39 cents a minute thereafter, with Reno receiving 25 cents per ride and $20 per scooter in registration fees, though certain riders can get a 50% discount. The Bird deal has been years in the making as the city opted for a cautious approach to reimplementing an electric vehicle sharing program after its first partner, Lime, saw its electric bikes vandalized at the rate of nine per week in 2018.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state Senate has killed a proposed expansion of New Hampshire’s education tax credit program, arguing it would diminish the benefits for current beneficiaries. House Bill 1298 would have raised the upper income limit for the state’s tax credit scholarship program from 300% of the federal poverty level to 500%. Created in 2013, the program provides scholarships for students by allowing businesses to donate to the scholarship fund that administers the program and receive a credit on their business taxes. The scholarships may be used for private school tuition. Advocates for the bill had argued that the expansion would allow the program to boost families in the middle class. Currently, the program can benefit any family of four making up to $83,250 per year; expanding it would allow a family of four making up to $138,750 to access the funds. But a bipartisan group of state senators said the expansion would only mean more students would be competing for the same pool of funds donated by businesses. “The (Senate education) committee heard concerns about the neediest of students receiving less funding from this tax credit program as this bill would open the pool to a larger population of students,” said Sen. Denise Ricciardi, R-Bedford Republican.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nOcean City: The developers of a wind energy farm off the southern New Jersey coast said Monday they have hired two companies to connect the project to the electrical grid on land. Ocean Wind 1 has signed contracts with companies that will build electrical substations on land and run power lines from the offshore wind farm to the onshore connection points. Ocean Wind 1 – a joint venture between Orsted, the Danish wind power company, and Newark-based PSEG – hired JINGOLI Power LLC and Burns & McDonnell Engineering Company Inc. The moves come as New Jersey is working aggressively to become the East Coast hub of the fast-growing offshore wind energy industry. In February, six companies bid a combined $4.37 billion for the right to build wind energy projects on the ocean floor off New Jersey and New York in the U.S. government’s largest such auction in history. Before that happened, New Jersey’s Board of Public Utilities approved three offshore wind energy projects: two by Orsted and one by Atlantic Shores. Those three projects combined aim to provide enough electricity to power more than 1.6 million homes. The Ocean Wind 1 project is among those three and could provide enough power for 500,000 homes.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nCarlsbad: State environmental regulators are reviewing plans submitted by Mosaic Potash to investigate and define the extent of groundwater contamination from discharges associated with potash mining along the Pecos River in southern New Mexico. The state Environment Department announced earlier this month that contamination had been detected in nearby groundwater monitoring wells between the company’s Laguna Grande lake and the river. As a result, the company was required to submit a plan for monitoring and dealing with the pollution. Potash mining is a main economic driver in Eddy County. A salt rich in potassium, potash is used mostly as a plant fertilizer and in animal feed. Carlsbad was the site of potash’s first discovery in North America in 1925 during oil drilling. The discovery led to a boom in development in the former ranching town that predated the area’s prominence in fossil fuels. Mosaic’s mine, about 16 miles east of Carlsbad, produces the ore both through its underground mining and via surface operations. Waste resulting from mining the ore is moved around the facility into multiple disposal areas, potentially leeching into groundwater supplies. Extracting potash from underground generates tailings that are disposed of along with salty brine water.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Several dozen teachers and other school employees in the city who officials said submitted fraudulent proof of COVID-19 vaccination were placed on leave as of Monday. The United Federation of Teachers is challenging the disciplinary action, which it says violates its collective bargaining agreement. The employees in question were placed on leave after investigators determined they had provided false vaccine cards, a spokesperson for the city Department of Education said. “Fraudulent vaccination cards are not only illegal, they also undermine the best line of protection our schools have against COVID-19 – universal adult vaccination,” the spokesperson, Nathaniel Styer, said in a statement. “We immediately moved to put these employees – fewer than 100 – on leave without pay.” A COVID-19 vaccination mandate took effect for New York City school employees last fall and was later expanded to include all city employees. The school vaccination rule was a key component of the city’s policy of opening all classrooms to in-person learning this academic year, rather than offering a remote option as some school districts did. The UFT said in a notice of claim that about 82 members were notified last week they were being placed on unpaid leave because they’d provided false proof of vaccination.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Leslie McCrae Dowless Jr., the key player in an absentee ballot fraud probe that led to a do-over congressional election, has died. His daughter, Andrea Dowless Heverly, wrote that her father “passed away peacefully” Sunday morning, according to a social media post. He had been diagnosed with an advanced form of lung cancer and died at his daughter’s home in Bladen County, his friend Jay DeLancy said. Dowless was in his mid-60s. The political operative was set to go on trial this summer on more than a dozen state criminal counts related to absentee ballot activities for the 2016 general election and the 2018 primary and general elections. A half-dozen others were also charged. Witnesses told state officials that Dowless, with help of his assistants, gathered hundreds of absentee ballots from Bladen County in 2018. Those workers testified they were directed to collect blank or incomplete ballots, forge signatures on them and even fill in votes for local candidates. The 2018 general election results for the 9th Congressional District were ultimately thrown out, and a new vote for the seat was ordered by the State Board of Elections, following an inquiry. Dowless was working in the 2018 congressional race for then-Republican candidate Mark Harris. No charges were filed against Harris.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Secretary of State Al Jaeger has approved the formatting of a petition for a proposed ballot measure to legalize recreational marijuana in the state. The sponsoring committee behind the petition must obtain 15,582 valid signatures by July 11 for the measure to be placed on November’s ballot. That figure amounts to 2% of North Dakota’s population. If supporters miss that deadline but obtain the signatures by April 21, 2023, the measure could be placed on the June 2024 ballot or come to a vote if a special election occurs before then. The proposed measure seeks to allow people age 21 or older to purchase and use marijuana under certain conditions, the Bismarck Tribune reports. It also sets up the framework for the sale of marijuana within North Dakota, a process that would be implemented by the state Department of Health and Human Services or another entity as determined by the Legislature. The department could register up to seven marijuana manufacturing businesses and 18 dispensaries. Similar petition drives have failed twice in recent years to gather enough signatures to place a measure on the ballot.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: State regulation of streams that flow temporarily after rainfall will be restricted under legislation signed into law by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine. Construction companies, the mining industry and other business groups say removing so-called ephemeral streams from regulation would make Ohio’s practice consistent with federal law. The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency created a permitting system for development projects affecting ephemeral streams after the government removed them from federal oversight in 2020 and left their regulation up to states. The EPA says about 36,500 miles of the state’s 115,200 miles of primary headwater streams are ephemeral streams. DeWine signed the bill last week, saying it strikes a balance between protecting state waterways and providing consistency in state regulations to support economic development. Environmental groups largely opposed the legislation, saying the streams play an important role in maintaining water quality. They also questioned why Ohio would remove the streams from regulation at the same time it’s spending millions to improve water quality under DeWine’s H2Ohio initiative.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: After calling for the disestablishment of a tribal reservation in eastern Oklahoma and criticizing the lingering impacts of the U.S. Supreme Court’s McGirt decision, a candidate for the 2nd Congressional District is receiving pushback from tribal leaders. John Bennett, 47, who is stepping away from his post as chairman of Oklahoma’s Republican Party to seek a seat in Congress, said he believes the court’s ruling continues to be an issue for law enforcement and needs to be reversed. “Congress needs to go back, and they need to de-establish the Muscogee (Creek) Nation reservation. I say once they do that, then they can carry on as they have, you know, all of these years,” Bennett told the Washington Examiner last week. “So when I get to Congress, this will be one of my priorities because it hurts everyone in my district, tribal and nontribal.” The Inter-Tribal Council of the Five Tribes, which includes the Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, Seminole and Muscogee Nations, said the anti-tribal rhetoric should not be welcome in Washington. In a statement signed by each of the tribes’ leaders, the group condemned Bennett’s comments for ignoring ongoing efforts to expand criminal justice systems alongside state and federal partners. They also said the call for a McGirt reversal is an attack on tribal sovereignty.\n\nOregon\n\nClatskanie: An investigator has determined that Clatskanie High School girls basketball players in northwest Oregon “more likely than not” used racist language against members of the De La Salle team during a December game. As a result, Clastkanie has been placed on probation by the Oregon School Activities Association until mid-February 2023, The Daily News reports. The association said the high school team’s players and coaches must engage with a guest speaker about equity and inclusion before next season, among other measures, and all Clatskanie student athletes and coaches must complete racial equity training and implicit bias training. A press release from Clatskanie High School athletic director and dean of students Ryan Tompkins on Wednesday confirmed the findings of the report more than two months after it was completed. Tompkins said the high school is prepared to meet the probation requirements. De La Salle North High School President Oscar Leong said he believes the drawn-out process of the investigation has resulted in positive change for student-athletes across Oregon. Additionally, the investigation found that Clatskanie school staff and referees assigned by the Lower Columbia Officials Association failed to address concerns about racially charged language after they were brought up during the game.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nDillsburg: A school board has denied a resident’s request form an After School Satan Club at Northern Elementary School. Hundreds from the community filled the auditorium for the Northern York County School District board meeting last week and erupted into applause when the votes were taken on the issue. Only board member Thomas Welch voted in favor of the club. The evening had more than two hours of citizen comments, with the majority opposed to the adoption of the club. Many comments focused on the age of the children the club would target, the cultural and biblical issues, and the content on the Satanic Temple’s website for the program. Many of the residents spent the evening rallying the crowd and quoting Christian scripture, saying regardless of any laws that allow freedom of speech, proposing the club is morally wrong. One said the introduction of the club would contribute to a social decline in school. “So nobody benefits from having an After School Satan Club, whether it be those who are against them or those who are in favor of them, because Satan always does harm all the time. That, philosophically, has been proven,” a resident asserted. There were some voices in support, saying that they understood the concerns but that the formation of the club was a constitutional right.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The U.S. Supreme Court will not take up a conservative advocacy group’s challenge to the state’s campaign finance laws. The Gaspee Project and national conservative legal groups appealed to the high court after two lower federal courts ruled against their 2019 lawsuit arguing Rhode Island’s campaign finance disclosure laws are unconstitutional. The Supreme Court denied Gaspee’s appeal petition Monday, according to Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha and the Campaign Legal Center, which defended the state’s campaign finance laws in the case. “To reduce political corruption, we need real transparency about who is spending big money in elections and to that end, voters in Rhode Island have a right to know who is attempting to influence their votes,” Campaign Legal Center Senior Vice President Paul Smith said in a news release. “This denial of review from the Supreme Court of the United States means that vital right will remain in place and continue to enable Rhode Islanders to be well-informed before heading into the voting booth.” The 2019 lawsuit from Gaspee and the Illinois Opportunity Project sought to strike down Rhode Island’s disclosure laws around “independent expenditures,” spending to influence an election that is not coordinated with any campaign.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nYork: A county is suing two cities inside its border, saying they are refusing to keep up with a deal to pay $73 per day to house jail inmates from the cities. York County said it will continue to take inmates from Rock Hill and Tega Cay until the court rules, The Herald of Rock Hill reports. Rock Hill officials said they don’t mind paying a fair fee, but York County has failed to give a detailed assessment of how it came up with a $73-a-day cost per inmate. The county originally wanted to charge $100 but lowered the assessment after Rock Hill asked for details, the city said in a statement. Documents obtained by the newspaper showed the cities were paying about $43 a day per inmate before the fees were increased. York County said other cities in the county like Fort Mill, Clover and the city of York have signed an agreement to pay the $73 fee. York County is asking a judge to decide if the county, which is legally required to have a jail, has to take inmates from cities without a written agreement on fees. Rock Hill officials said their residents and businesses pay York County $7.9 million in property taxes that help run the jail and the sheriff’s office.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Despite an annual $15 million given to the Bridge Improvement Grant program and other additional funding focused on bridges, the state continues to tread water when it comes to how quickly work is done, leaving hundreds of bridges requiring “high priority” corrective repairs and dozens closed. An analysis of data through the Federal Highway Administration’s National Bridge Inspection program focused on the vast amount of data that FHA collects on the nation’s bridges, looking at data from 2015 and the most recent data from 2021. To some, the bridge program, as well as other aspects of the 2015 transportation package, haven’t panned out the way they were supposed to. “I know I’m sounding a little bit negative about it, but I feel like we got duped a little bit,” Brown County Highway Superintendent Dirk Rogers said. The BIG program was created as a collaboration between the state and local governments. To be eligible to participate, counties had to enact local wheel taxes on vehicles so they had a source of local funds in the program. Since 2015, 37 counties have added a wheel tax, according to the South Dakota Department of Revenue, and only six counties in the state don’t have a wheel tax.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state will soon add harsh penalties against public schools that allow transgender athletes to participate in girls’ sports, under legislation signed into law by Republican Gov. Bill Lee. Lee quietly signed the proposal last Friday without comment. The governor had previously signed a measure last year mandating that student-athletes must prove their sex matches that listed on the student’s “original” birth certificate. If a birth certificate is unavailable, then the parents must provide another form of evidence “indicating the student’s sex at the time of birth.” This year, the GOP-controlled Legislature decided to add penalties to that ban, which is in effect even as a lawsuit challenging its constitutionality makes it way through court. A trial has been tentatively set for March 2023. According to the bill, Tennessee’s Department of Education would withhold a portion of state funds from local school districts that fail to determine a student’s gender for participation in middle or high school sports. The measure does not specify exactly how much money should be withheld by the state. The bill will go into effect July 1. “Telling transgender students that they can’t participate as who they really are amounts to excluding them from sports entirely – depriving them of opportunities available to their peers and sending the message that they are not worthy of a full life,” Henry Seaton, ACLU of Tennessee’s transgender justice advocate, said in a statement.\n\nTexas\n\nEagle Pass: Search crews on Monday recovered the body of a Texas National Guard member who went missing after jumping in the river on the U.S.-Mexico border to help a migrant who was struggling to swim across. The body of Spc. Bishop Evans was found three days after he was reported missing in the Rio Grande near the border city of Eagle Pass. The local sheriff has said Evans jumped into the river without his jacket or radio to help a woman who appeared in distress while trying to swim over from Mexico. “Our National Guard soldiers risk their lives every day to serve and protect others and we are eternally grateful for the way SPC Evans heroically served his state and country,” Gov. Greg Abbott said in a statement Monday. The body was found near the boat ramp of a bridge in Eagle Pass, said Democratic state Sen. Roland Gutierrez, whose district includes Eagle Pass. Migrant rescues are common in the river along the Texas border, and the attempted crossings are also sometimes deadly. Maverick County Sheriff Tom Schmerber said the bodies of as many as two migrants a week are sometimes found along his county’s section of the river. Evans was assigned to Abbott’s sprawling border mission known as Operation Lone Star. Gutierrez said Evans is at least the fifth Guard member known to have died during the mission that began last year. He called for an inquest into their deaths.\n\nUtah\n\nCedar City: Four people were killed when a single-engine airplane on a sightseeing tour crashed minutes after takeoff in rural southwestern Utah, authorities said Sunday. Deputies discovered the aircraft after responding to a report of a fire just before 7 p.m. Saturday about 5 miles east of Cedar City, the Iron County Sheriff’s Office said. Pronounced dead at the scene were pilot Steven Eatchel and his wife, Lindsay Eatchel, of Springville, Utah; Thomas Eatchel, of Heber City, Utah; and Danielle Deagostini, of Sandy City, the sheriff’s office said. The National Transportation Safety Board identified the aircraft as a Diamond DA-40 and said it was investigating the crash. No cause was immediately identified. The plane earlier in the day flew from Spanish Fork to Cedar City, where it had a layover of about 21/ 2 hours at the regional airport before taking off and heading east toward some mountains for a sightseeing tour of Zion National Park, the sheriff’s office said. Radar communication with the aircraft was lost about four minutes after it took off. The position of the downed aircraft and damage to foliage at the crash site suggested it was headed west when it crashed, the sheriff’s office said.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The share of Vermonters living with a disability is growing quickly, yet nobody is sure just how many people fall under this category – an uncertainty that may affect how the state allocates money for support. Vermont’s population of people who have at least one disability rose nearly 10% between 2011 and 2020 to over 14% of people in the state, according to a study by Avacare Medical Blog, which analyzed 2021 U.S. Census Bureau data. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says about 1 in 5 adults in Vermont has at least one disability. Even higher is the figure from the Vermont Department of Health, which says 24% of Vermont adults had at least one disability as of 2019. How people are polled and how disability is defined can make it difficult to understand the true number of those living with a disability in Vermont, said Sarah Launderville, executive director of the Vermont Center for Independent Living. “I think that there’s a bunch of people who might not think that they fit into that category of disability because of the way that we look at disability in society,” Launderville said. To be considered disabled by the Social Security Administration and receive financial support, a person’s disability cannot be “partial” or “short-term,” meaning a medical condition prevents ability to work, according to the agency website. However, not all types of disabilities prevent someone from working or living independently.\n\nVirginia\n\nFalls Church: The Arlington County Board gave unanimous approval Saturday to Amazon’s plans to build a unique, helix-shaped tower as the centerpiece of its emerging second headquarters in northern Virginia. Amazon announced the plans in February 2021 for the eye-catching, 350-foot tower to anchor the second phase of its redevelopment plans. The new office towers will support a second headquarters for Amazon that is expected to welcome more than 25,000 workers when complete. The helix is one of several office towers granted approval, but it stands out. The spiral design features a walkable ramp wrapping around the building with trees and greenery planted to resemble a mountain hike. Amazon has said the building is designed to help people connect to nature, and the outdoor mountain climb will be open to the public on weekends. The plans have gone through the famously thorough review process of Arlington County, including numerous public hearings. Earlier this month, the county planning commission voted 9-0 to support the project. On Saturday, the County Board voted 5-0 to approve the plans. They also include park space and will accommodate a community high school, along with ground-level retail. Amazon has said it hopes to complete the project in 2025.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympic National Park: The Olympic Peninsula has lost 45% of its glacier coverage since 1980, according to a new study by Portland State University professor Andrew Fountain and co-authors from Washington state and British Columbia. The peninsula’s remaining 250 glaciers, which covered about 2 square miles at last estimate, should be gone in another 50 years as humanity’s pollution continues to overheat the planet, the study found. Fountain told KUOW glaciers worldwide are getting a kind of double whammy, with less snow in the winter and more melt in the summer. Beyond the fascination they provide for a small community of researchers, glaciers serve as frozen reservoirs. “These glaciers provide water during the hottest, driest parts of the year,” Fountain said. Salmon and people in glacier-fed watersheds rely on nature’s ice chests to keep rivers flowing and cool each summer. Fountain said a rapid end to fossil fuel burning could delay the glacial melt-off by a few decades. “We have to encourage our lawmakers to start enacting legislation to cut greenhouse gases,” he said. “I think, for the foreseeable future, the fate(s) of the glaciers on the Olympic Peninsula are sealed.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nNorthfork: Several communities in the state’s southern coal fields celebrated the completion of a long-awaited project to bring clean water to local communities last week. The Elkhorn Water Project began in 2015 and included a new 400,000-gallon water storage tank on Elkhorn Mountain. The recently completed second phase brings county water to 112 McDowell County Service District customers in Upland, Kyle and Powhatan; 163 customers in Northfork and Algoma; and 101 in Keystone, the Bluefield Daily Telegraph reports. Many water systems in the area were installed in the early 1900s by coal companies and have been failing for years. Residents of Keystone, for example, were under a boil-water notice for more than a decade. U.S. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., met with local and state officials Thursday to celebrate the completion of the second phase. Capito said clean drinking water is among the basic infrastructure rights, which also include good roads and broadband access.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWaukesha: Five months after an SUV plowed through the crowd and killed six people at a Christmas parade, the city continues to have the tragedy in mind in legislative decisions. Various committees have studied proposals for things such as a permanent parade memorial, safety barricades and public consideration of how to address the 2022 parade. The actions complement an effort by nonprofit organizations to collect and disperse funds to aid the hundreds of victims in the parade tragedy. Waukesha’s Christmas Parade in 2021 will forever stand for the tragedy that it was, and a special commission with the city has begun to try to figure out how to memorialize those who died. The Waukesha Parade Memorial Commission has considered creating three sites: a permanent large memorial, possibly in Grebe Park, and one or two smaller sites along the parade route on Main Street. “It’s about what we can to help avoid this anytime in the future, not just for Waukesha but for any community,” said Jerry Couri, the commission’s chairman, whose business, Couri Insurance Agency, has long been a fixture on Main Street. The commission began with the expectation of having the permanent memorial in place in 14 to 15 months. Couri said members are keeping that time frame in mind as they develop ideas.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Conservation groups are still seeking protections for a rare plant that scuttled plans for a gypsum mine in the Bighorn Basin area, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. The Center for Biological Diversity has joined with two smaller groups in announcing plans to file a lawsuit against the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service if federal officials don’t finish a status review on the thick-leaf bladderpod by mid-June, saying the agency is violating its own deadlines, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/09/20/fire-advances-general-sherman-flags-mark-virus-deaths-news-around-states/118840688/", "title": "Fire advances on General Sherman, 660K flags mark virus deaths ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state could see its shipments of monoclonal antibodies reduced as federal officials take over distribution to equitably dispense the limited life-saving resource amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the state health officer said. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said the change was needed after just seven states – Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas – accounted for 70% of monoclonal antibody orders in the country. “Given this reality, we must work to ensure our supply of these life-saving therapies remains available for all states and territories, not just some,” the department said in a statement. The seven states are also among those that have the lowest vaccination rates in the nation. State Health Officer Scott Harris said Friday that federal officials told states providers would no longer be able to order the drugs directly but would have to place those orders through state health departments. “We are really sorry to say there are probably going to be some patients who aren’t able to access that drug who thought they were going to have that available to them,” Harris said. Doctors continue to emphasize that vaccination, rather than a secondary treatment after the fact, is the best way to prevent severe COVID-19 disease.\n\nAlaska\n\nJoint Base Elmendorf-Richardson: Military leaders on Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson have declared a public health emergency and encouraged all personnel to avoid places that do not require masks or social distancing in response to increasing COVID-19 cases across the state, officials said. “We’ve all seen COVID-19 cases continue to spread rapidly across our nation, the state of Alaska and in our local community,” U.S. Air Force Col. Kirsten Aguilar, 673rd Air Base Wing and JBER commander, said in a statement Friday. “After close consultation with JBER mission commanders, I have decided to declare a Public Health Emergency.” Aguilar said the declaration will remain in effect for 30 days but could be shortened or extended based on cases and community transmission of COVID-19. The base has also transitioned to Health Protection Condition Bravo, which means Aguilar will be able to implement additional measures to protect against the spread of the coronavirus, “including restricting access to off-base establishments,” the statement said. Hospitalizations and COVID-19 cases throughout the state have increased as a result of the highly contagious delta variant. Alaska on Friday reported more than 1,200 newly confirmed cases per 100,000 people over the past two weeks, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Board members overseeing Arizona’s most populous county reached an agreement Friday evening with the Republican-controlled state Senate that will end a standoff over a Senate demand that they hand over computer routers for use in an unprecedented partisan election review. The Maricopa County Board of Supervisors announced that a special master will take questions from the Senate’s election review contractors and provide them with information contained on the routers that they say they need to finish the election review. Supervisor Bill Gates said the deal will protect sensitive information contained on the routers while avoiding a massive penalty the county faced if they had not complied. Gates called the deal “a win for transparency, and it’s also a win for protecting sensitive data in Maricopa County.” Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich said in a decision last month that the county must comply with the subpoena issued by Republican Senate President Karen Fann or lose about $700 million in yearly state funding. The county agreed to drop a $2.8 million claim it filed with the Senate after election equipment it handed over to the auditor was decertified and needed to be replaced.\n\nArkansas\n\nRussellville: A former sheriff’s deputy was charged Friday with manslaughter in the fatal shooting of a white teenager whose death has drawn the attention of national civil rights activists. A special prosecutor announced the felony charge against Michael Davis, a former sergeant with the Lonoke County Sheriff’s Office, in the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Hunter Brittain. Davis faces between three and 10 years in prison if convicted. Davis shot Brittain during a June 23 traffic stop outside an auto repair shop along Arkansas Highway 89 south of Cabot, a city of about 26,000 people roughly 30 miles northeast of Little Rock. Davis told investigators he shot Brittain once in the neck after the teen reached into the back of his truck and did not comply with his commands to show his hands, according to the arrest affidavit. Brittain was holding a container – which his family members have said held antifreeze – and no evidence of firearms was found in or near the truck, the affidavit said. A passenger with Brittain said he and the teen had been working on the transmission for Brittain’s truck. The passenger told investigators he never heard Davis tell the teen to show his hands. Davis, who is white, was fired by Lonoke County Sheriff John Staley in July for not turning on his body camera until after the shooting occurred.\n\nCalifornia\n\nThree Rivers: Hot, dry weather Sunday added to the challenges facing firefighters battling to keep flames from driving farther into a grove of ancient sequoias, where the base of General Sherman, the world’s largest tree, has been wrapped in protective foil. Fire officials warned that stronger winds were also contributing to “critical fire conditions” in the area of the KNP Complex, two lightning-sparked blazes that merged on the western side of Sequoia National Park in the Sierra Nevada. The National Weather Service issued a red flag warning through Sunday, saying gusts and lower humidity could create conditions for rapid wildfire spread. The fires forced the evacuation of the park last week, along with parts of Three Rivers, a foothill community of about 2,500 people. Crews have been bulldozing a line between the fire and the community. More than 34 square miles of forest land have been blackened. The National Park Service said Friday that flames had reached the westernmost tip of the Giant Forest, where it scorched a grouping of sequoias known as the “Four Guardsmen” that mark the entrance to the grove of 2,000 sequoias. Giant sequoias are adapted to fire, which can help them thrive by releasing seeds from their cones and creating clearings that allow young sequoias to grow. But the extraordinary intensity of fires – fueled by climate change – can overwhelm the trees.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A civil rights investigation that was launched amid outrage over the death of Elijah McClain – a Black man put into a chokehold during an encounter with suburban Denver police two years ago – found a deeply ingrained culture of racially biased policing within the department, according to Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser. He said Wednesday that the investigation found the Aurora Police Department has long had a culture in which officers treat people of color, especially Black people, differently from white people. He said the agency also has a pattern of using unlawful excessive force, frequently escalates encounters with civilians, and fails to properly document police interactions with residents. It’s the latest mark against the Aurora department since Weiser’s office indicted three officers and two paramedics on manslaughter and other charges this month in connection with McClain’s death. “These actions are unacceptable. They hurt the people that law enforcement is entrusted” to serve, Weiser said. Police stopped McClain, a 23-year-old massage therapist, as he walked home from a store Aug. 24, 2019, after a 911 caller reported a man wearing a ski mask and waving his hands who seemed “sketchy.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nStonington: The town’s police force is warning residents to stay away from aggressive minks. In a recorded message sent to residents, Capt. Todd Olson of the Stonington Police Department urged people to stay away from a mink if they see one, The Day of New London reports. Olson said that even though they resemble a pet ferret, minks are territorial and are not friendly. One of them chased a person Wednesday, he said. Olson said the department’s animal control officer notified the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection about the minks, and the agency is looking into the situation. A mink farm once operated in the town.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: African folk music played through the Herman M. Holloway Sr. Park as the community gathered Saturday to participate in the 25th African American Family Festival. The festival, designed to celebrate “everything African,” also serves as an opportunity to raise awareness about social issues – including COVID-19. “We want to do good things for the people in our community so they don’t feel like all good things happen in majority-white neighborhoods,” said Harmon Carey, the event organizer. “A lot of African American festivals have moved away from the community, near white communities, or they have completely stopped doing events.” The aroma of African cuisines filled the park as children playfully jumped in a bounce house, and adults gathered around jewelry and clothing stalls, adorned with traditional African stones and colorful fabrics. A Mobile Health Unit set up by the Life Health Center conducted coronavirus tests and encouraged people to get vaccinated. “It is kind of a hit and miss, but every time I come out, I cross my fingers and hope that we get a good response,” said Kyme McCleary, a nurse at the mobile unit. The unit focused on vaccinating children ages 12 and up during the first half of the event, followed by adults for the later part of the day.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: More than 660,000 white flags are waving in the air on the National Mall, each honoring one American life that has ended due to COVID-19. The installation, called “In America: Remember,” covers more than 22 acres in 143 sections near the Washington Monument and the National Museum of African American History and Culture, WUSA-TV reports. Volunteers from Ruppert Landscape installed the flags over the course of three days, completed Friday. The installation will be up for a total of three weeks, lasting until Oct. 3. Visitors are invited to get involved in the memorialization, come to the mall and personalize a flag for someone they have lost. Those who can’t make it in person can dedicate a flag virtually on the installation’s website. Artist Suzanne Brennan Firstenberg conceived the idea, beginning last fall with 267,080 flags placed outside RFK Stadium in Northeast D.C. Firstenberg – described as a “social action artist” based in the D.C. area, according to the installation’s website – has also spent 25 years participating in hospice volunteering.\n\nFlorida\n\nTampa: The mayor says officials will revamp a program that allowed police officers to notify landlords when their tenants had been arrested, even in cases in which charges were later dropped. The decision to reform Tampa’s Crime-Free Multi-Housing Program was announced by Mayor Jane Castor on Saturday following an investigation by the Tampa Bay Times that showed police officers were reporting tenants after arrests for misdemeanor crimes and the arrests of juveniles, and about 90% of the 1,100 people flagged by the program were Black tenants. Under the announced changes, the city will inform landlords only about “certain serious drug and violent felonies.” A police captain must sign off on notices sent, and landlords will be notified only about arrests that happen on their properties. The program was created in 2013 with the goal of stamping out drug and gang crime in apartment complexes. At its peak, about 100 apartment complexes were enrolled. While Castor touted the program as having “improved the safety and quality of life for tens of thousands of people,” Yvette Lewis, president of the Hillsborough County NAACP, said it could still violate a renter’s civil rights by resulting in an eviction based solely on an arrest. “This program needs to be stopped,” she said. “You’re treating housing as though it’s a privilege.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A disaster relief organization founded by actor Sean Penn is boosting the state’s drive to inoculate people against COVID-19, though some of its pop-up vaccine clinics have struggled to attract people. CORE has offered COVID-19 shots at hundreds of sites in big and small communities around the state, including schools, farmers markets and meat plants. But it has had few takers at some locations – a likely reflection, at least in part, of skepticism about vaccines in Georgia. The percentage of people who are fully vaccinated in the state is well below the national average, and that’s a big factor in Georgia’s nearly three-month surge in COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations. On a recent weekday, one person came in to get inoculated over six hours at an Atlanta church where CORE was offering the Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer vaccines. State health officials say regardless of how many people show up at each site, the group has been a key partner in their mobile vaccination efforts. “We feel like every opportunity is not wasted if we can get a shot in an arm,” said Chris Rustin, a senior adviser to the commissioner of the Georgia Department of Public Health.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: At least seven people were injured Saturday in the collapse of a large tree branch in Waikiki, Hawaii News Now reports. A large branch of a banyan tree came crashing down about 12:15 p.m. at the Hilton Hawaiian Village in the heart of the popular tourist district, Honolulu Emergency Medical Services told Hawaii News Now. The seven people who suffered multiple injuries included some with serious head injuries and multiple cuts. Four of the seven were treated and transported to a nearby hospital, Honolulu EMS said. Among those seriously injured were a 50-year-old man, a 22-year-old woman, a 28-year-old woman and another woman whose age was not disclosed, according to Hawaii News Now. Three others evaluated at the scene refused to be transported. The banyan reaches a height up to 100 feet and spreads laterally indefinitely, with its branches dropping new roots to the ground, creating a structure that can appear to be composed of many separate trees. Hilton Hawaiian Village said in a statement after the incident: “Our thoughts are with those who have been affected and their families. Our hotel team along with several guests responded immediately and the proper authorities were contacted. The wellbeing, safety and security of our guests and team members are of paramount importance.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Republican state officials are warning President Joe Biden of legal action if his proposed COVID-19 vaccine requirement for about 100 million Americans goes into effect. Gov. Brad Little, Attorney General Lawrence Wasden, House Speaker Scott Bedke and Senate Pro Tempore Chuck Winder said in a letter Friday that there appears to be no legal basis for the requirement. “If you choose to continue to move forward in this direction, the State of Idaho will have no choice but to take the necessary legal actions to uphold its sovereignty, check the overreach of power by federal bureaucracy, and uphold the system of checks and balances our Constitution guarantees,” they wrote in the letter to Biden. Many Idaho Republican lawmakers are angry with the vaccine mandate that requires employers with more than 100 workers to require the workers either to be vaccinated or to be tested for the coronavirus weekly. The officials’ letter comes a day after the entire state entered crisis standards of care because of mostly unvaccinated COVID-19 patients filling hospitals. The standards allow health care providers to give scarce resources, such as ventilators, to the patients most likely to survive. The letter also comes as Republicans jockey for position ahead of the GOP primary early next year.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A kind of bird that not that long ago was so rare in Illinois that people traveled hours just to catch a glimpse of one has lately been winging its way through the Chicago area. Snow-white 30-pound birds called the American white pelican are on their semiannual migration through Illinois right now. The trip means hundreds of them stop to rest near the Four Rivers Environmental Education Center in Channahon, 50 miles southwest of Chicago. Thousands more stop for a bit about 150 miles beyond Channahon at the Emiquon National Wildlife Refuge in Lewistown. Among reasons this might be happening is that decades of wetland restoration across the country have helped increase the number of birds from about 40,000 in the 1960s to 180,000 today. As to why Illinois has seen so many more, American Birding Association webmaster Greg Neise told the Chicago Tribune that perhaps the birds that traditionally breed in Canada and the Great Plains and migrate to the Gulf Coast every winter started breeding in northern Wisconsin. He said another possibility might be that Asian carp that have invaded Illinois waterways in recent years are, as the pelicans have discovered, good eating.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state’s largest hospital system says more than 100 workers are no longer employed with the health network after they did not comply with its mandate for all employees to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Indiana University Health said Thursday that 125 employees had departed from the hospital system after a two-week unpaid suspension period that ended Sept. 14. Officials did not say whether those workers quit or were fired, saying in a statement that they “chose not to receive the COVID-19 vaccine and have left the organization.” IU Health did not provide details on what kinds of positions were affected or whether any of the employees worked in bedside care. The 125 former employees were a small percentage of IU Health’s work force of about 36,000. IU Health announced in June that it would require all its doctors, nurses and other employees to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by Sept. 1. The health system operates 15 hospitals and dozens of outpatient clinics around the state. Two weeks ago, IU Health said suspended employees would be allowed to return to work if they attested to partial or full vaccination. At the time, it said that fewer than 300 workers had been suspended, according to the Indianapolis Business Journal.\n\nIowa\n\nBurlington: Paint-A-Thon participants are hoping the goodwill it brings to the community each year will spread much like the virus that resulted in the cancellation of last year’s event. Each year, hundreds of Burlington and West Burlington residents work with their neighbors, co-workers and friends to paint houses for those most in need. “It’s like a good virus,” said Mark Rosenburg, team leader for Bethany Lutheran Church, who was painting a house on Elm Court. “It goes to the community and spreads.” The Burlington/West Burlington Paint-A-Thon is hosted each year by Two Rivers Bank and Trust in collaboration with Diamond Vogel Paint and Community Action of Southeast Iowa. One of the program’s goals is to beautify the homes of those who cannot afford a fresh coat of paint. This year’s event marks the 28th annual Paint-A-Thon. Last year’s was canceled because of COVID-19. When Paint-A-Thon first started in Burlington, an organizer reached out to all the churches in the city asking for help. Since then, it has become an annual tradition for many houses of worship. Individuals can apply to have their home painted or can be nominated by someone else. Community Action goes through a selection process in which members seek out the neediest homeowners to receive assistance.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: Sit-ins and marches have followed alleged sexual assault on two major university campuses in the state. Dozens of University of Kansas students staged a sit-in in front of the chancellor’s office Friday in an ongoing protest of the handling of allegations that a fraternity member sexually assaulted another student. A spokesman for Phi Kappa Psi has said the organization has been made aware of the allegations involving one of its new undergraduate members, and the university was immediately notified. Protesters are demanding that university officials take action against the fraternity as well as the alleged perpetrator, The Kansas City Star reports. They changed a placard at the entrance of the office of the chancellor, renaming it “Office of the Complicit,” and taped other signs with messages to the glass windows at Chancellor Doug Girod’s office. Meanwhile, more than 200 people marched to the Wichita State University police station to protest the handling of a reported rape in a dormitory. The Wichita Eagle reports students gathered Friday at Shocker Hall, where the sexual assault is alleged to have occurred Sept. 12. They then marched to the campus police station. Some carried signs reading: “We deserve a rape-free campus,” and “WSU, do better.”\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A $21 million project at the Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport will install geothermal wells to heat and cool the facility. Crews will drill 648 vertical geothermal wells that go 500 feet deep on the east side of the airfield. Geothermal wells use the earth’s natural temperature to heat and cool. The new system will cut carbon emissions by 80% and use 40% less energy than traditional systems, the airport said. “Not only will this innovative technology make systemwide improvements and increase efficiencies, but we are also setting an example in the industry to reduce carbon emissions and energy use,” said Dan Mann, executive director of the Louisville Regional Airport Authority. Airport officials held a formal groundbreaking Thursday for the project, which is part of a larger set of improvements to the airfield and terminal.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Garbage and debris are piling up along many streets almost three weeks after Hurricane Ida pounded southeast Louisiana as residents react with increasing anger and, in some cases, dark humor. Several residents told a City Council committee Friday that they haven’t had their garbage collected since days before the storm hit Aug. 29. “I was at the point of naming every maggot in my garbage, and I was going to put them on my income tax as dependents,” a woman told council members at City Hall. “This is not good government. This is just incompetence.” Mayor LaToya Cantrell’s administration has said much of the problem arises from labor shortages that have plagued the city for months, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and, then, the storm. The city sought bids from companies wanting to supplement its two main waste contractors, officials said Thursday. A Sept. 8 deadline was extended to Sept. 13 due to a lack of response. After the later deadline, one contractor was hired to aid trash collection efforts Thursday in part of the city. Another contractor who bid on another area had 20 trucks available – but no labor. On Thursday, Cantrell’s office announced a plan to use workers and equipment from various city agencies to supplement trash pickup.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The public gets an opportunity Monday to weigh in on Democratic and Republican proposals for reshaping the border of Maine’s 1st and 2nd Congressional Districts. Both proposals released Thursday focus on Kennebec County, and both parties agree on moving Augusta, the capital city, to the state’s northern district. There’s disagreement, however, on reshuffling a dozen other towns. Democrats want to move both August and Waterville, along with several other Democratic-leaning towns. Republicans targeted a different grouping of towns. Based on the 2020 election, the Republican proposal would have meant nearly 900 additional votes for President Joe Biden and the Democratic proposal would mean about 6,200 extra votes for Biden in the district, according to an analysis by the Bangor Daily News. Former President Donald Trump won the vote in the 2nd Congressional District, picking up one of Maine’s four electoral votes. Sen. Rick Bennett, R-Oxford, who is serving on the commission for Senate Republicans, said he’s optimistic the differences can be ironed out. “I think we are pretty close, at least on the congressional side,” he told the Portland Press Herald. The state’s bipartisan redistricting commission is racing to meet a Sept. 27 deadline.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Legislative auditors found that glitches in the cashless tolling infrastructure at the state’s bridges, tunnels and express lanes overbilled motorists thousands of dollars. The Baltimore Sun reports the Office of Legislative Audit’s report on the Maryland Transportation Authority comes about a year after the state announced it permanently ceased cash toll collections – put on hold during the coronavirus pandemic – and moved to fully electronic tolling systems. “We received allegations on our fraud, waste, and abuse hotline alleging that MDTA was not taking sufficient action to detect and address the overbilling of customers for electronic tolling due to issues with its new toll equipment,” Legislative Auditor Gregory Hook wrote in a letter to the legislature’s Joint Audit and Evaluation Committee. “Our audit disclosed that MDTA was inconsistent in its actions related to the impact of issues with its electronic toll collection system on its customers and potential customer overbillings.” The report identified tolling issues at the Fort McHenry Tunnel in Baltimore, the Francis Scott Key Bridge, the Intercounty Connector in Montgomery County and the Thomas J. Hatem Memorial Bridge in Cecil County.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nSalem: The city known for its witch trials more than three centuries ago will require a negative coronavirus test for people to attend some large Halloween events, officials said as they brace for the typical influx of visitors in the weeks ahead of the holiday. The Salem Board of Health voted Friday to require people to have a negative test taken within 72 hours to attend indoor events with more than 100 people at a public space. The requirement goes into effect Oct. 1 and lasts through Nov. 1. Masks are required inside all public businesses through mid-November. “The delta variant is so transmissible. We are seeing an increase in COVID case counts in Salem,” Mayor Kim Driscoll said. “Thankfully, more people are vaccinated, so we’re not seeing the crush of hospitalizations. But those numbers are up, too.” Details about rapid testing in the area will be announced soon. Vaccine mandates are in place for some events like the Horror Fest, which includes 50 indoor movies throughout October. “We’ll do whatever it takes to keep our audience safe,” said Kay Lynch, of Horror Fest. “We’ve capped our audience. We’ve required vaccination. Masks are required indoors.”\n\nMichigan\n\nJackson: After hearing from critics, including the homeless, city officials have rejected an ordinance that would have cracked down on panhandling. The measure would have stopped people in Jackson from asking for money by speech or sign near banks, building entrances or outdoor dining or on public transportation. A violation would have carried a $100 fine. Kevin Hardman, who said he’s homeless, told the Jackson City Council that finding solutions to poverty would be a better step. “To penalize me or anyone because I’m poor, I don’t dress nice – if you see somebody in that condition, why won’t you help them?” Hardman said. A first reading of the ordinance was defeated 5-2 on Tuesday, MLive.com reports. Council member Karen Bunnell, who voted for the ordinance, said panhandling is a serious issue downtown. “Those are not just my constituents. Those are also my business owners,” she said. Mayor Derek Dobies, who opposed the ordinance, said it violated free speech. “The city can’t say it’s OK for the Salvation Army or firefighters to collect donations in some of these places but not allow poor people to ask for spare change,” he said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Regulators have ordered Enbridge to pay more than $3 million for allegedly violating state environmental law by piercing a groundwater aquifer during construction of the Line 3 oil pipeline replacement. The state Department of Natural Resources said Enbridge, while working near Clearbrook in January, dug too deeply into the ground and pierced an artesian aquifer, which resulted in a 24 million-gallon groundwater leak. “Enbridge’s actions are a clear violation of state law, and also of the public trust,” said Barb Naramore, DNR deputy commissioner. “That is why we are using all of the tools in our authority to address the situation.” Enbridge said in a statement that it was reviewing the DNR’s order and would work with the agency on a resolution. It wasn’t until mid-June that the DNR discovered something was wrong after speaking to independent construction monitors who had observed water pooling in the pipeline trench near Clearbrook. The DNR has ordered Enbridge to put $2.7 million into escrow for restoration and damage to nearby wetlands. Enbridge is also required to pay $300,000 to mitigate the lost groundwater and $250,000 for long-term monitoring of the wetlands. Enbridge’s 340-mile Line 3 replacement pipeline, opposed by environmental groups and some Ojibwe tribes, is nearly complete.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: An interactive exhibit prompts visitors to speak aloud the names of people who were killed in acts of racist violence in the United States during the civil rights era – incantations in a darkened room to honor some 150 men, women and children whose lives were cut short. The names appear on lighted glass panels, backed by images of trees. Next to each name is a code that visitors can scan with their cellphones. “Say his name to begin his story,” or “Say her name to begin her story,” says the recorded narrator, journalist Charlayne Hunter-Gault, who made history in 1961 as one of the first Black students to enroll in the University of Georgia. The traveling exhibit, “Un(re)solved,” was created by PBS Frontline with artist, filmmaker and technologist Tamara Shogaolu. It is on display until Oct. 24 at the Two Mississippi Museums, which houses the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum and Museum of Mississippi History under one roof. The exhibit opened in downtown Jackson on Aug. 28 – 66 years to the day after Emmett Till, a Black teenager from Chicago, was abducted, tortured and killed in the Mississippi Delta after witnesses said he whistled at a white woman. “Un(re)solved” focuses on the federal investigation of more than 150 cold cases under a law enacted in 2008, the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act. Mississippi has 56 names in the exhibit – more than any other state.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A crowd gathered Saturday to celebrate the state’s bicentennial, with a World War II nurse leading the parade. KTVO reports Edith Harrington waved to the crowd from a military jeep, followed by about 100 entries that highlighted the history of the Show-Me State. The 98-year-old Harrington joined the United States Cadet Nurse Corps in 1943. The festivities also marked the election of state officeholders in 2020 whose traditional inauguration events were delayed because of the coronavirus. Missouri turned 200 years old last month. Territorial residents first sought statehood in 1818, but the request became bogged down in Congress by a dispute over whether slavery should be allowed. In March 1820, President James Monroe signed legislation known as the Missouri Compromise. Maine was allowed into the union as a free state and was allowed to draft a constitution as a slave state, so long as no other new slave states formed north of Missouri’s southern border. Missourians thought they had become a state, but the parties were premature. Missouri’s first constitution, which sought to exclude free “Negros or mulattoes” from the state, prompted further opposition in Congress. After a second compromise, Monroe signed legislation finally making Missouri the 24th state on Aug. 10, 1821.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Interior Secretary Deb Haaland signed the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes water rights compact Friday, settling a decades­long battle over thousands of individual water rights in Montana and on the Flathead Indian Reservation. The deal also created a $1.9 billion trust to settle claims and refurbish the Flathead Indian Irrigation Project. The tribes have claims to more than 10,000 water rights beyond their reservation land. The compact offered a deal in which the tribes relinquished their claims to most of the water outside of the reservation. In exchange, the tribes will receive 211 water rights on their reservation, 10 water rights outside the reservation and co-ownership of 58 other water rights, along with the funding. “Our elders continually remind us to protect our water, and this day marks the beginning of the water compact implementation that will protect the water for all generations to come,” Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes Chairwoman Shelly Fyant said in a statement. Montana lawmakers passed legislation approving the compact in 2015. Under the compact, the federal government will initially provide the tribes with $90 million over a 10-year period to rebuild the Flathead Indian Irrigation Project, which was built in the 1900s.\n\nNebraska\n\nAlvo: A massive, flammable mountain of scrap tires that had grown to more than twice the size allowed under state environmental rules in a small eastern Nebraska town now appears to be in compliance. The Nebraska Department of Environment and Energy said a report that B-Rose Tire Recycling of Alvo had made significant progress in coming into compliance with a Sept. 1 deadline to bring its inventory below 160,000 passenger tire equivalents, according to the Omaha World-Herald. In April, the business signed a consent agreement with state regulators to drastically reduce its pile of shredded tires or face fines or other sanctions. By the middle of last year, the business’ pile of tires in the town halfway between Lincoln and Omaha had grown to as much as 323,228 passenger tire equivalents. B-Rose fell short of benchmarks in the agreement for July and August, but after a warning letter from the state agency Aug. 9, B-Rose reported hauling out 123,176 passenger tire equivalents to the landfill during August, exceeding the number of tires hauled out in the months of May, June and July combined. Officials at the State Fire Marshal’s office said Wednesday that they hadn’t yet conducted an inspection to determine if the business had created fire lanes for emergency vehicles between the tire piles.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A fire burned the main building of the Mount Charleston Lodge in a forest area that is a popular retreat from summer heat for Las Vegas residents. A fire official and a representative of the company that owns the business said the building that houses the lodge’s restaurant was a total loss, but cabins used for lodging weren’t damaged. No injuries were reported, officials said. The fire was reported about 4:45 a.m. Friday. Its cause wasn’t immediately known. Photos posted online showed flames flaring from the building, and Clark County Assistant Fire Chief Thomas Touchstone said the lodge’s dining area was fully engulfed when the first units arrived about 5 a.m. The lodge was built in the 1960s after a previous lodge on the site that had been operating since at least 1948 was destroyed by a fire in December 1961, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. Since 2018, the property has been operated by Ellis Island Hotel & Casino. “The Lodge was a beloved landmark, and we plan on rebuilding and recreating the atmosphere and charm that so many were able to enjoy throughout the years,” Christina Ellis, the company’s marketing director, said in a statement. Touchstone said it appeared the fire started inside the building when no employees were there, and it was too dangerous for firefighters to enter the building to battle the blaze.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The head of the state’s health department on Friday accused a Republican lawmaker of spreading misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines. Department of Health and Human Services Commissioner Lori Shibinette was telling the Legislature’s fiscal committee that 90% of those hospitalized in New Hampshire due to the coronavirus are unvaccinated when she was interrupted by Rep. Ken Weyler of Kingston. “That is in doubt,” he said, adding that he has heard from emergency room workers who say 90% of those admitted have been vaccinated. “That is incorrect, and that is misinformation,” Shibinette told him, according to video of the exchange shared by WMUR-TV. “I have no idea why someone would say that, but that is incorrect, and that is the problem that we are having in increasing our vaccination rate: spreading misinformation about the COVID vaccine.” Republican members of the committee voted to table $27 million in federal virus relief funds that would have gone to the state’s immunization program.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A judge who suggested to a domestic violence suspect that men are “in control” has been suspended without pay two years after he made the comments. The state Supreme Court announced Friday that it adopted the recommendation of a panel on judicial conduct to suspend Municipal Court Judge Steven Brister for one month, beginning Wednesday. The panel wrote in 2019 that Brister, who has served in both East Orange and Newark, told the man that men “can’t punch; you can’t hit. At best, you treat as if you’re holding a feather, just to let them know you’re the man, and you’re in control.” The panel wrote that the comments violated conduct rules, were disparaging to women and could create the perception of bias. It also wrote that Brister allowed his personal religious beliefs to influence his judicial role because he referred to women as being created “with the curve of the rib of Adam.” In a subsequent response to the panel’s report, Brister didn’t deny the remarks and called them “well-meaning but undeniably misguided” and said he had completed several ethics courses. An email message seeking comment was left Friday with an attorney who represented Brister.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The state’s film industry has come roaring back to life this year and so far managed to avoid significant COVID-19 outbreaks. Many credit the stringent protocols put in place by the industry, the Albuquerque Journal reports. Film and TV productions in New Mexico got the green light to resume in September 2020. According to the New Mexico Film Office, from Sept. 1, 2020, through Sept. 1, 2021, there have been 176,598 coronavirus tests administered throughout the various productions. Of those, 183 were positive. “This is a testament to the film industry, as they want to mitigate and remain safe,” said Amber Dodson, director of the New Mexico Film Office. “There have been less than eight productions that have paused for their own safety during the last year.” As of Aug. 31, there were 18 film and 24 TV productions in various phases currently in the state. When the film industry paused in March 2020, leaders spent months developing protocols that would be put in place when it resumed. In June 2020, a white paper was created by a task force of the Industry-Wide Labor-Management Safety Committee describing health and safety guidelines to resume film and TV production.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Most nonviolent parole violations will not result in jail time under a new law signed Friday by Gov. Kathy Hochul. The “Less is More” law largely eliminates New York’s practice of incarcerating people for technical parole violations, including being late to an appointment with a parole officer, missing curfew, or failing to pay fees or to inform a parole officer of a change in employment. Starting in March, people on parole will land back behind bars only for drug or alcohol use if they were convicted of driving under the influence of those substances. Supporters of the law say that New York has one of the the nation’s highest rates of incarcerating people for technical parole violations and that the practice is costly and fuels the cycle of people landing behind bars again after serving their time. Criminal justice advocates applauded the law but urged Hochul and lawmakers to make it effective immediately. The move means an estimated 5,000 people who are behind bars for technical parole violations could eventually be eligible for release. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city will be releasing “hundreds and hundreds of people the right way.” The governor also said she would sign off on the release of 191 eligible inmates from the city’s notorious Rikers Island jail complex, troubled by years of neglect.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Judges struck down the state’s latest voter photo identification law Friday, agreeing with minority voters that Republicans rammed through rules tainted by racial bias as a way to remain in power. Two of the three trial judges declared the December 2018 law is unconstitutional, even though it was designed to implement a photo voter ID mandate added to the North Carolina Constitution in a referendum just weeks earlier. They said the law was rushed and intentionally discriminates against Black voters, violating their equal protections. The law “was motivated at least in part by an unconstitutional intent to target African American voters,” Superior Court Judges Michael O’Foghludha and Vince Rozier wrote in their 102-page order. “Other, less restrictive voter ID laws would have sufficed to achieve the legitimate nonracial purposes of implementing the constitutional amendment requiring voter ID, deterring fraud, or enhancing voter confidence.” The majority decision, which followed a three-week trial in April, will be appealed, Republicans at the Legislature said. A state appeals court had previously blocked the law’s enforcement last year. The law remains unenforceable with this ruling.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nGrand Forks: The Grand Forks Air Force Base has been selected for a military satellite mission, the state’s U.S. senators announced Friday. Republican Sens. John Hoeven and Kevin Cramer said the base will be home to a Space Networking Center, which is part of the Pentagon’s Space Development Agency’s new low-Earth orbit mission. NASA defines low-Earth orbit as having an altitude of 1,200 miles or less. Hoeven said the mission serves as the backbone for all U.S. military communications. “Grand Forks is the ideal location to house this new Space Networking Center,” Hoeven said in a statement. The mission “provides essential support for our national security and will help our nation stay ahead of our adversaries in developing critical new technologies,” he said. Hoeven’s office said a military installation in Alabama also was selected as a center for the mission.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: As Republican lawmakers try to limit drop boxes and early voting, a new report shows rural Ohio voters want more flexibility in how they can cast their ballots. A poll commissioned by the nonpartisan election group Secure Democracy found that roughly three-quarters of rural voters support allowing counties to provide multiple early voting and ballot drop-off locations, as well as expanding the types of acceptable voter identification. They also back 24-hour drop box access and the use of a secure website to request an absentee ballot. The poll comes as legislators push separate bills that would alter the state’s rules for conducting elections. Supporters say the changes are necessary to prevent fraud, but opponents contend they would sow confusion and suppress votes. One proposal would eliminate in-person voting on the Monday before Election Day, limit drop boxes to 10 days before Election Day and require Ohioans to request mail-in ballots no later than 10 days before an election. A stricter measure would ban drop boxes entirely and significantly reduce the number of days for early voting, among other provisions. Officials with Secure Democracy say the bills could hurt voters in 17 rural counties who relied on voting flexibility even before the pandemic drove people toward absentee and early voting.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state Supreme Court will expedite an appeal of an injunction limiting a ban on mask mandates in public schools. The court, in an order dated Wednesday, placed the appeal on its fast-track docket, giving Attorney General John O’Connor 20 days to file briefs in the case and opponents 20 days to respond. The appeal argued the law passed earlier this year by the Legislature is constitutional. “The Legislature may reasonably exercise its … power over public schools without regulating private schools,” the filing said. The appeal also said the state is immune from the lawsuit filed by the Oklahoma State Medical Association and four parents. District Judge Natalie Mai cited the fact the law did not apply to private schools in approving the temporary injunction. Mai’s ruling allows for exemptions to mask requirements for medical or personal reasons, which Oklahoma State Medical Association President Dr. Mary Clarke said some schools have adopted. “It’s disappointing to see the Attorney General appeal a decision that even Gov. Stitt supported,” Clarke said in a statement. “We’ve seen several schools implement masking programs with opt-out clauses.”\n\nOregon\n\nBend: About two dozen people have contacted the state’s poison center after self-medicating against COVID-19 with a drug used to treat parasites, with five becoming hospitalized and two winding up in intensive care units, authorities said Friday. The drug they used was ivermectin, which has no proven use against the coronavirus and is instead approved to treat some parasites in people and some animals. “COVID-19 is a devastating disease and can be very frightening, but the public does not need to use – nor should it use – unproven and potentially dangerous drugs to fight it,” said Robert Hendrickson, medical director of the Oregon Poison Center at Oregon Health & Science University. Between Aug. 1 and Sept. 14, the Oregon Poison Center at OHSU managed a total of 25 cases. Five of those cases involved hospitalization, and two people were so severely ill that they had to be admitted to an intensive care unit. Studies suggest that achieving the plasma concentrations necessary for antiviral efficacy would require administration of doses of the drug up to 100-fold higher than those approved for use in humans, the National Institutes of Health said. The Oregon Poison Center said its recent cases involved people experiencing mental confusion, balance issues, low blood pressure and seizures.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Democrats in the state Senate sued Friday evening in a state court to block a Republican-approved subpoena seeking voter information and to put a stop to what Republicans call a “forensic investigation” of last year’s presidential election. Democrats had said they would sue within days after the GOP-controlled Senate Intergovernmental Operations Committee voted Wednesday to issue a subpoena that seeks detailed state election records, including communication with counties and the names of who voted in last year’s presidential election, their birth dates, addresses, driver’s license numbers and the last four digits of their Social Security numbers. The subpoena is an outgrowth of former President Donald Trump’s baseless claims that he was cheated out of victory last November and ongoing pressure by Trump and his allies for battleground states where he lost to investigate the election. “The latest ploy by the Senate Republicans is unprecedented and completely unwarranted,” Democrats said in a statement. “All aspects of the certified 2020 election have been thoroughly reviewed and adjudicated in the courts with no findings of irregularities or fraud. The timeframe to contest the 2020 certified election results is long overdue.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A group of parents and grandparents has filed a legal challenge to Gov. Daniel McKee’s statewide school mask mandate. The lawsuit filed in Providence Superior Court on Thursday alleges the Democratic governor violated state law and the state constitution in both signing the K-12 mask mandate and declaring a new state of emergency due to the delta variant of the coronavirus, WPRI-TV reports. The 16 parents and grandparents from Glocester, Smithfield, North Smithfield and Warwick argue there is a double standard because the state no longer requires masks in restaurants, retail shops and other indoor spaces. They also question the science of mask-wearing, which state and national experts have said helps slow the spread of the virus. “Often, it appears that those at highest risk for the effects of COVID-19, the elderly, the obese, and those with multiple comorbidities, are willing to force the young and healthy, who are little affected by COVID-19, to suffer these irreparable harms on unproven science,” the complaint says. McKee spokesperson Alana O’Hare, citing the pending litigation, declined to comment. In the suit, the plaintiffs also say masks make it difficult for their children to breathe, hear and communicate, hampering the learning process.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The capital city will not allow people to carry guns in the open during protests, festivals or other events that need a city permit. The resolution passed unanimously earlier this month by the Columbia City Council also bans the open carrying of guns in city-owned buildings without written permission from the city manager, The State newspaper reports. The South Carolina General Assembly passed a law this year allowing people with a concealed weapons permit to carry those guns openly. But the law allowed local governments to ban open carry for specific events for a limited period of time. Columbia’s resolution will keep people safer, Mayor Steve Benjamin said. Concealed weapons permit holders “are incredibly responsible with the use of firearms, and I’m thankful for that,” Benjamin said. “But the ability for a good, hard-working police officer to be able to ascertain who’s who when someone has a sidearm on fully exposed is very difficult.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Legislative leaders on Friday distributed a petition to lawmakers asking them to support a special session to consider impeaching Attorney General Jason Ravnsborg for a car crash last year that killed a pedestrian. House Speaker Spencer Gosch released the text of the petition. Two-thirds of both the Republican-controlled House and Senate must sign on to convene the special session. Lawmakers would meet in November, the day after they are scheduled to hold another special session to consider new legislative districts. The petition says the special session would be called for “investigating and evaluating whether the conduct of Jason Ravnsborg … surrounding the death of Joe Boever, involved impeachable offenses.” Gosch has said that if the special session is approved, he will appoint a committee to investigate the conduct of the attorney general, a Republican whose term runs through 2022. The South Dakota Legislature has never tried to impeach an official as powerful as an attorney general. It would require a simple majority of the House to approve articles of impeachment, while two-thirds of senators must vote to convict and remove him from office. The attorney general pleaded no contest to a pair of misdemeanors last month, and prosecutors dropped a third misdemeanor.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A federal judge has indefinitely blocked Gov. Bill Lee from allowing parents to opt out of school mask requirements in Shelby County, saying Friday that evidence shows Lee’s order prevents children with health problems from safely going to school during the coronavirus pandemic. U.S. District Judge Sheryl Lipman issued the preliminary injunction after parents of students with health conditions argued that the Republican governor’s executive order endangered their children and hurt their ability to attend in-person classes by allowing others to opt out of a mask mandate. “It is that unmasked presence that creates the danger to these Plaintiffs,” the judge wrote Friday. Meanwhile, two families in Williamson County, just south of Nashville, sued in federal court Friday, also challenging Lee’s order. In Shelby County, Lipman had already issued a temporary restraining order on Sept. 3 stopping schools from allowing parents to opt out. It was set to expire Friday. The preliminary injunction continues blocking Lee’s order as the federal lawsuit proceeds. The injunction applies to all seven public school districts in Shelby County, which began classes Aug. 9 under a universal mask requirement issued by the Shelby County Health Department. Shelby County Schools is Tennessee’s largest, with 100,000 students.\n\nTexas\n\nNew Boston: A man linked to the “boogaloo” movement who livestreamed threats to kill police was sentenced Friday to 50 years in prison after being convicted of attempted murder of a peace officer. On Thursday, a jury in Bowie County found 38-year-old Aaron Caleb Swenson guilty of attempted capital murder of a peace officer and found he’d violated the Texas Hate Crimes Act, the Texarkana Gazette reports. On Wednesday, before testimony began before the judge, Swenson had pleaded guilty to terroristic threatening and evading arrest. The newspaper reports that on Friday, the jury sentenced him to 50 years in prison for attempted murder, 20 years for terroristic threatening with a hate crime enhancement and 10 years for evading arrest. Prosecutor Kelly Crisp said the terms will run concurrently. The jury also assessed maximum fines on each of the three charges for a total of $30,000. Swenson testified he was trying to be killed by police in April 2020 when he made the threats and never intended to hurt anyone when he streamed on Facebook Live while driving in Texarkana, Texas, that he was searching for a police officer to kill. Texarkana crime scene analyst Spencer Price testified about the two pistols, 12-gauge shotgun, handmade sword and 156 rounds of ammunition found in Swenson’s truck.\n\nUtah\n\nSouth Salt Lake: The Wasatch Youth Center is no more. Demolition crews began work last week tearing down the former long-term, secure lockup for child offenders. A backhoe knocked down brick walls and tore off the roof of a gymnasium. A stray office chair was picked up with some debris and thrown into the back of a dump truck. The juvenile detention facility is no longer necessary. “Because of some of the shifts in reforms in Utah in juvenile justice, this is a space where we don’t need this capacity anymore,” said Brett Peterson, the executive director of Utah’s Division of Juvenile Justice Services, told Fox13. “We’re able to reinvest our dollars in serving youth in their home, schools and communities.” It’s a result of a series of laws the Legislature passed beginning in 2017 dubbed “juvenile justice reform.” Instead of incarceration, the state has placed more of an emphasis on rehabilitation and community oversight for youth offenders. Funding has been shifted to ensure there are proper services to keep children facing what are termed “low risk” offenses out of detention facilities. The Utah Division of Juvenile Justice Services had actually planned to expand Wasatch Youth Center prior to the reform legislation. Instead, the land will be given back to the state for other needs.\n\nVermont\n\nSpringfield: The state plans to spend $25 million of its own funds to help redevelop old industrial sites. Historically, the costs of cleaning up former industrial sites that may be contaminated from previous industrial or commercial activities, known as “brownfields,” have been funded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Vermont officials traveled Thursday to Springfield, where they highlighted that some of the state funds will be used to help redevelop the 270,000-square-foot former Jones & Lamson Machine Co. building that once employed 1,500 factory workers. Other sites that will be redeveloped with some of the money are in St. Albans and Burlington. “It’s an understatement to say this is just another brownfield site,” said Bob Flint, the executive director of the Springfield Regional Development Corp., which owns the 14-acre property. “This beats them all.” The projects were announced by Gov. Phil Scott. “This presents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to address longtime challenges and finally make good on the promise to increase economic equity from region to region and bring growth to all areas of the state, not just Chittenden County,” Scott said.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Residents have a new digital option for proving they’ve been vaccinated against COVID-19. The Virginia Department of Health has added QR codes, barcodes that can be scanned with smartphones, to state COVID-19 vaccination records, officials announced Thursday. People will be able to prove they’ve been inoculated by showing a digital or printed QR code instead of a paper card, and they won’t need a special app. As more employers and businesses require employees and customers to be vaccinated, officials said this will boost the consistency and security of vaccination information while protecting individual privacy. Anyone vaccinated in Virginia can visit the department’s Vaccinate Virginia website to obtain their free vaccination record with QR code, which can then be saved to a phone gallery or printed out. The codes contain the same information as paper records, but the format offers more security, and the information is only available if a person chooses to share it, officials said. Because the digital records are digitally signed by the Department of Health, officials said they can’t be altered or forged. Businesses and employers can use a free app to scan the codes.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The Sauk-Suiattle Indian Tribe has filed a class-action lawsuit against the city on behalf of its members and the public, saying the electric utility’s green power claims are misleading and hurting the tribe. The lawsuit filed in King County Superior Court on Friday seeks to stop Seattle City Light from claiming that it’s a fish-friendly, green and environmentally responsible utility until Seattle provides fish passage at its three Skagit River dams. “Until that happens, they are not as green as they say they are,” said Nino Maltos, chairman of the tribe. More than 80% of City Light’s energy comes from hydropower, which doesn’t directly emit climate-warming carbon dioxide. The city of Seattle is in the midst of a relicensing process for the dams. The tribe insists the utility can’t claim its dams are green while they block salmon passage on the region’s premier salmon river. Julie Moore, spokeswoman for Seattle City Light, said the utility won’t comment on litigation. But she said the relicensing process “gives us the opportunity to update the research and determine what additional measures may be necessary to protect fish moving forward. This includes looking at fish passage.” Native wild Chinook salmon, steelhead and resident bull trout within the Skagit River drainage all are threatened with extinction.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state’s death toll from the coronavirus pandemic this month has already doubled the total from August. There have been 286 reported deaths from COVID-19 in September and at least 3,370 since the start of the pandemic, according to state health data. The September total includes at least 32 virus-related deaths added to the count after being reconciled with official death certificates. Deaths during the pandemic peaked in January, when there were 654 reported from Jan. 4 to Jan. 31. They slowed to 49 total deaths in July but picked up again in August with 148. “We’re going to have a bunch more die. That’s all there is to it,” Gov. Jim Justice said at a news conference Friday. “And the only way we can stop it from being a bunch more and then a whole lot more on top of that, in my opinion, is one thing, and that’s to get vaccinated. I’m going to continue to plead with you to do that because I don’t know anything else we can do.” Justice lifted a statewide indoor mask requirement in June as the number of cases dropped, and he’s balked at issuing a mandate vaccination or new mask requirements. He has said mandating masks is “penalizing” some people, but he’s not convinced it’s going to significantly help as the pandemic goes unchecked.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: The return of a popular annual music festival wasn’t what some vendors expected. After the event was canceled last year due to the coronavirus, Summerfest 2021 ended with mixed reports. Sellers who set up shop for the first time generally marked it a success, while longtime vendors saw it as a “total bust.” Vendors said during Saturday’s final day of the two-week concert that the crowds had picked up a bit more from the start but remained low compared to previous years. Surging cases of the delta variant of the virus and new pandemic protocols were cited as possible factors. “This was not what I expected,” said Kagan Tate, owner of Butterfly Connection. “A total bust.” Tania Espinoza Bonilla, owner of T for Textile, was selling for the first time at a large festival. Although she didn’t see the crowds she had hoped for, she said she was thankful for the exposure and connections she made for her business. “I’m sure the vaccine rule made a lot of people angry, but I supported it,” she said. Even before the pandemic, Summerfest had already experienced reduced attendance and in 2019 saw the lowest participation since 1986 with just more than 718,000 festivalgoers. Officials have not provided daily attendance numbers and would not comment on the numbers while the event was running.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Human remains found in a reservoir on the Wyoming-Idaho state line have been identified as a kayaker who drowned in 1995, investigators said. Kyle Martin, 24, was kayaking on the Hoback River when a companion lost his paddle. Martin went ahead but was never seen alive again. Relatives of Martin and sheriff’s officials briefly saw Martin’s body after a helicopter dislodged his kayak from a snag in the river a couple of days later, Teton County sheriff’s deputy Dave Hodges told the Jackson Hole News & Guide. “He separates, and he’s on the surface, but I didn’t expect him to then submerge almost as quickly as he emerged,” Hodges recalled. Last winter, Hodges saw an entry in Forensics Magazine about human remains found in Palisades Reservoir, downstream from the Hoback River. A DNA sample from Martin’s mother confirmed they were her son’s remains. Hodges called Martin’s brother with the news Sept. 10. “It was an incredible moment to call family after 26 years and say that your son and your brother is finally coming home,” Hodges said. “We both had a moment of tears. It was a sense of closure for a family that’s been waiting so long to have their son and their brother home.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/07/16/john-glenn-centennial-passport-office-pileup-museum-chinese-reopens-news-around-states/117547550/", "title": "John Glenn centennial, passport office pileup, Museum of Chinese ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A military base has ordered troops to show proof of vaccination in order to go without face masks as the state sees an uptick in COVID-19 cases – a rise attributed to low inoculation rates. The measure was put in place Tuesday at Fort Rucker, home of the Army’s aviation program. If a soldier is not wearing a mask, base leadership can ask to see a vaccination card. In a video posted to Facebook, base officials said the measure is needed because of rising case numbers on the base and in surrounding counties. Alabama, which has the lowest vaccination rates in the country, is seeing an uptick in COVID-19 cases. State Health Officer Scott Harris said that is likely driven both by the low vaccination rates and by the spread of the delta variant of the coronavirus. According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, the seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Alabama has risen over the past two weeks from 205.43 new cases per day June 28 to 559.57 new cases per day July 12. Only about 33% of the state’s population is fully vaccinated, compared to about 48% nationally, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “It’s not the vaccinated people that are getting infected for the most part, and if they do, for the most part they aren’t the ones getting sick in the hospital,” Harris said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The Biden administration said Thursday that it is ending large-scale, old-growth timber sales in the country’s largest national forest – the Tongass National Forest – and will focus on forest restoration, recreation and other noncommercial uses. The U.S. Agriculture Department, which includes the Forest Service, also said it will take steps to reverse a Trump administration decision last year to lift restrictions on logging and road-building in the southeast Alaska rainforest, which provides habitat for wolves, bears and salmon. A 2001 rule prohibits road construction and timber harvests with limited exceptions on nearly one-third of national forest land. The Trump administration moved to exempt the Tongass from those prohibitions, something Alaska political leaders had sought for years. Restoring those protections in the Tongass would return “stability and certainty to the conservation of 9.3 million acres of the world’s largest temperate old growth rainforest,” the Agriculture Department said. Under the plans announced Thursday, large-scale, old-growth projects that were being planned for the forest will not go forward, Moore said. Smaller timber sales, including some old-growth trees, will still be offered for local and cultural uses such as totem poles, canoes and tribal artisan use, the federal agency said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state’s largest county approved nearly $3 million Wednesday for new vote-counting machines to replace those used in the 2020 election, which were given to legislative Republicans for a partisan review of the results. The GOP-controlled Maricopa County Board of Supervisors said the machines were compromised because they were in the control of firms not accredited to handle election equipment. Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, had said she would seek to decertify the machines if the county planned to use them again. State Senate Republicans used their subpoena power to take control of Maricopa County’s voting machines after former President Donald Trump claimed without evidence that the 2020 election was rigged against him in Arizona and other battleground states. The Senate hired Cyber Ninjas, a small cybersecurity consulting firm led by a Trump supporter who has spread conspiracy theories backing Trump’s false claims of fraud, to recount all 2.1 million ballots and forensically review voting machines, servers and other data. The firm had no prior experience in elections, and experts in election administration say it’s not following reliable procedures.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The University of Arkansas on Thursday said it has asked a former Razorback challenging U.S. Sen. John Boozman to change his ads over their unauthorized use of the school’s trademarks. The school made the request after Jake Bequette launched his bid for the Republican Senate nomination with an online video touting his background playing for the Razorbacks and for the New England Patriots in the NFL. Boozman, a Republican, has held the seat since 2011. The video features footage and images of Bequette playing in his Razorbacks uniform, while a logo says: “Jake Bequette. Patriot. Veteran. Razorback.” “We have asked the campaign to modify its ads related to unauthorized use of the Razorback trademark for political purposes,” UA spokesman Mark Rushing said in an email. Bequette’s campaign did not say whether it planned to change or withdraw the ad. “Jake Bequette is proud of his time at the University of Arkansas where he was an academic All-American and All-SEC defensive end. He will continue to proudly call himself a Razorback,” the campaign said. UA made a similar request when Boozman, also a former Razorback, ran for the Senate in 2010. Boozman pulled a TV ad highlighting his time playing for the Razorbacks after the school asked that it be withdrawn.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Los Angeles County leaders are moving forward with a plan to return prime beachfront property to descendants of a Black couple who built a resort for African Americans but were stripped of the land by city officials a century ago. The Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Tuesday to pursue an action plan created by the county chief executive’s office on returning the land to the descendants of Willa and Charles Bruce once the state allows it. The county would be a sponsor of state legislation that is needed to enable the transfer. “We are on an important road to set a precedent that could be replicated across the country as we work to put actions behind our commitment to an anti-racist agenda and anti-racist county,” Supervisor Holly Mitchell said. The property that became known as Bruce’s Beach is along the shoreline in Manhattan Beach, now an upscale city. The land was purchased in 1912 by Willa and Charles Bruce, who built the first West Coast resort for Black people at a time when many beaches were segregated. They suffered racist harassment from white neighbors, and in the 1920s the Manhattan Beach City Council took the land away through eminent domain under the ruse of needing it for a park. The city did nothing with the property, however, and it eventually was transferred to the state in 1948.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A pre-pandemic shortage of licensed commercial drivers in the waste management industry has become worse, and now cities and companies are dealing with a shortage of workers to hoist trash and recyclables into trucks. Workers in the solid-waste industry were considered essential workers as COVID-19 started to spread, but now there aren’t enough of them, and many are likely looking for different lines of work or better pay, The Denver Post reports. Denver is working to hire more sanitation workers after cutting its budget and letting vacancies go unfilled when the pandemic hit, said Nancy Kuhn, a spokeswoman for the Department of Transportation and Infrastructure. The city provides trash and recycling collection services to 181,000 households and compost collection service to subscribers. Kuhn said Denver cut back on extra trash collection, which includes large items, from every four weeks to every eight weeks. In June, the city received 1,738 calls about missed trash pickup and 760 about missed recycling pickups. Denver makes about 724,000 trash collections a month. The solid waste industry is among those using signing bonuses to lure back workers as businesses emerge from cutbacks made because of the pandemic.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: State regulators have approved a plan to spur the building of infrastructure across Connecticut for charging electric vehicles. The state’s Public Utilities Regulatory Authority said the nine-year program approved Wednesday creates incentives for the building of fast charging stations, home charging stations and workplace charging stations, both for individuals with electric cars and for companies that have fleets of electric vehicles. The decision directs the state’s two largest electric utilities, Eversource Energy and United Illuminating, to provide incentives to customers who install the necessary equipment. Those include rebates of up to $500 to homeowners who make electrical upgrades to allow charging at home and up to $40,000 for owners of apartment buildings, condominium complexes and businesses that install charging areas. The program also would provide up to $250,000 for the creation of direct current fast-charging stations in the state. Those who install the equipment in low-income and distressed communities would get the largest incentives, PURA said. “We’re eager to bring a statewide charging program to our customers and are currently reviewing the details of PURA’s announcement to ensure it maximizes all potential benefits for our customers,” said Mitch Gross, an Eversource spokesperson.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: Residents of Donovan Smith Mobile Home Park say the untreated wastewater surfacing above an older septic system in the center of the park affects the environment, their safety and their quality of life. “This place started out as travel-trailers and weekenders. They didn’t need a big septic unit,” said resident Samuel Saunders. “Now people live here full time, and these tanks won’t hold that. It bubbles up, and it’s bad.” The park owner, Donovan-Smith MHP LLC, was issued a notice of violation from the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control on July 8 for unauthorized discharge to groundwater. According to the notice, the park never renewed its septic system permit after it expired in 2008 and has been operating without one since. The department continued to inspect the system annually despite being without a permit, the notice says. DNREC declined to provide inspection records, citing an “ongoing investigation.” Park manager Clara McNichols, when reached by phone, declined to comment.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The Metro Board of Directors Safety and Operations Committee approved a proposal Thursday to temporarily ban certain riders cited for sexual or firearms charges while riding the transit system, WUSA-TV reports. The full Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority board is expected to vote on the proposal at an upcoming meeting, but a date on that vote has not been set. Metro says it has seen an increase in sex offenses over the past 18 months. The hope is that a change to the passenger conduct policy would help cut down on those incidents. The first offense would carry a 14-day ban and the second a 30-day ban, but the third offense would bring a 365-day rolling suspension that starts the day the citation is issued. Transit agencies in other major cities have similar policies in place.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: The Walt Disney Co. said Thursday that it planned to build a new regional campus in central Florida to house at least 2,000 professional employees who will be relocating from Southern California to work in digital technology, finance and product development. In a letter to employees, Josh D’Amaro, chairman of Disney Parks, Experiences and Products, said the move would allow creative and business teams to be better integrated. The company already has a theme park resort outside Orlando, Walt Disney World, that is the size of the city of San Francisco. The new Disney campus will be located about 20 miles to the east of Disney World, in a neighborhood by Orlando International Airport. “Florida is known for its rich culture of hospitality and active lifestyle as well as a lower cost of living with no state income tax,” D’Amaro said in the employee letter. While the company is still figuring out which employees will be asked to relocate, they likely will be in the parks division. Workers asked to relocate will have 18 months to make the move, D’Amaro said. “As someone who has moved with my family from California to Florida and back again, I understand that relocation is a big change, not only for the employee, but also for their families,” he said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Former President Donald Trump is declaring his opposition to a high-ranking Republican’s bid for lieutenant governor, another sign of how state-level politics is being reordered by Trump’s insistence that all Republicans repudiate his 2020 election loss. Trump invited other Republicans to run against Senate President Pro Tem Butch Miller in a statement released late Wednesday. “I will not be supporting or endorsing Sen. Butch Miller, running for lieutenant governor of Georgia, because of his refusal to work with other Republican senators on voter fraud and irregularities in the state,” Trump said. “Hopefully there will be strong and effective primary challengers for the very important lieutenant governor position!” Trump weighed in as state Sen. Burt Jones of Jackson considers seeking the GOP nomination to succeed Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, whose support among Republicans collapsed after his outspoken defense of the Georgia election results that gave Joe Biden a narrow victory. Miller has not gone as far as Jones in promoting the false claim that Trump was cheated out of 16 electoral votes, but he counts Georgia’s restrictive new elections law among his top accomplishments and has said voters will support him as a conservative who gets things done.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: U.S. authorities launched an investigation and fined Louisiana tourists honeymooning in Hawaii after a video on social media showed a woman touching an endangered Hawaiian monk seal. The couple were “deeply sorry,” a man identified as Stephen told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. “We love Hawaii and the culture. We didn’t mean to offend anyone.” A video posted on TikTok and other social media showed a woman touching the seal at a Kauai beach in June. The video showed her running away after the resting seal raised its head and snapped at her. There are an estimated 1,100 Hawaiian monk seals in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands and 300 in the main Hawaiian Islands. It’s a felony to touch or harass a Hawaiian monk seal under state and federal laws, with penalties of up to five years in prison and a $50,000 fine. The newspaper reports authorities from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration contacted the couple over the weekend and assessed an undisclosed fine. Dominic Andrews, a spokesman for NOAA’s Office of Law Enforcement, said an investigation is underway and declined to comment further.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Prisons in the state are so understaffed that correctional officers often end up working mandatory 16-hour shifts, leaving them just eight hours to sleep, eat and see their families before returning to duty, a prison official said. Idaho Department of Correction Director Josh Tewalt told Board of Correction members about the staff shortages during a meeting Wednesday, saying roughly one-quarter of correctional officer positions are vacant. “We’ve seen a very alarming new trend in our staffing that is cause for concern for us,” Tewalt said, noting that there are about 180 vacant positions statewide. Most of the vacancies are in the five-prison complex south of Boise, where 156 correctional officer positions are vacant. That’s the lowest staffing rate the state has seen in the past six years, according to department data. The staff shortage means there are frequently not enough employees to allow prisoners to move normally throughout their daily schedule, forcing facilities to go on “restricted” status during which offenders may be denied time in recreational yards or day room areas. The shortage also means visiting hours can’t be held in some prisons. Prison understaffing can lead to dangerous conditions for workers and inmates and limit inmate access to programs designed to help them succeed upon release.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Frustrated with a lack of power to investigate unethical conduct by state lawmakers and an ethics reform bill on Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s desk that she considered counterproductive, the Illinois legislative inspector general said Wednesday that she will resign in December. Carol Pope, 67, a former Menard County state’s attorney and former circuit and appellate judge based in Petersburg, emailed members of the Legislative Ethics Commission to say she plans to leave Dec. 15. Pope’s term normally would be up in June 2023. Before Pope, the General Assembly went four years without a permanent inspector general. “The last legislative session demonstrated true ethics reform is not a priority,” Pope said, despite ethics reform legislation that overwhelmingly passed this year and was praised by Democrats and Republicans as a good first step. Pope, in her letter, said the legislative inspector general “has no real power to effect change or shine a light on ethics violations.” She said the position “is essentially a paper tiger.” Pope, a Republican and Melrose Park native who became legislative inspector general in March 2019, said the position needs more independence to be effective.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Less than one-third of elementary and middle school students recorded passing scores on the latest round of state standardized tests, results released Wednesday show, confirming education officials’ concerns that the coronavirus pandemic has fueled substantial learning losses. The Indiana Department of Education released results from the spring ILEARN exam that show 40.5% of students at or above proficiency standards in English/language arts and 36.9% at or above proficiency standards in mathematics. Only 28.6% of students statewide in grades three through eight tested as proficient in both English and math, a drop from 37.1% the last time the test was administered in 2019. State data showed “significant” gaps persist among racial, ethnic and socioeconomic student groups. For example, just 8% of Black students passed both the English and math sections, compared with 46.5% of Asian students, 34.7% of white students and 15.6% of Hispanic students. Indianapolis Public Schools, which has one of the highest proportions of disadvantaged students in the state, saw only 10% of its students pass both English and math. Neighboring Warren Township schools reported less than 8% of students tested proficient. In northern Indiana’s South Bend Community Schools, 7.5% of students had passing rates on both sections of the exam.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Nearly 20% more Iowans died of drug overdoses in 2020 than in the previous year, as the powerful narcotic fentanyl became more prevalent, and the COVID-19 pandemic compounded people’s anxiety and isolated them from addiction treatment services. A new report from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates Iowa suffered 419 drug overdose deaths last year, compared to 350 in 2019. Most neighboring states saw steeper increases in overdose deaths than Iowa did, although South Dakota was one of just two states in the country that recorded a decrease. “I think it really reflects how difficult the pandemic has been on people,” said Alison Lynch, a psychiatrist and family practice physician who runs the University of Iowa’s Addiction and Recovery Collaborative. “It’s shocking.” Lynch said in an interview that the pandemic sparked or worsened struggles with drug and alcohol abuse. Social isolation, economic stress and fears of catching COVID-19 often prompted people to drink alcohol or use drugs. And many people who had been in recovery from addictions lost the crucial support of in-person group sessions, such as Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A racial justice panel appointed by Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly has recommended expanding Medicaid, adding another income tax bracket for top-income earners, restoring a food sales tax rebate, and banning Native American mascots and team names in public schools. The 15-member Commission on Racial Justice and Equity created the recommendations after meeting with Kansas Department of Commerce officials, Kansas Department of Health and Environment staff and others, according to the report. Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly established the commission last year in response to the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The report comes months after the panel crafted recommendations primarily focused on policing. Some advocates in Kansas have pushed for Medicaid expansion for a decade. Kelly promised this year to continue to push to expand Medicaid in Kansas, despite top Republicans in the GOP-controlled Legislature opposing it. The panel wants to expand Medicaid eligibility to 138% of the federal poverty level and cited an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation estimating that about 82,000 uninsured non-elderly adults in the state would become eligible for coverage if Kansas expanded its Medicaid program.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Concerns about cybersecurity have led the state to extend its search for a company to modernize its pandemic-stressed unemployment insurance system, Gov. Andy Beshear’s administration said Wednesday. The need for additional safeguards against hackers means the state will go through a rebidding process, said Jill Midkiff, a spokeswoman for the state Finance and Administration Cabinet. In doing so, the state will request enhanced security measures to protect the personal and financial information of jobless claimants, she said. The state is seeking a contract partner to overhaul its outdated technology for processing jobless claims. That search began about 16 months ago, and lawmakers were told last month that the state was in the “latter stages” of selecting a company to revamp the claims-processing system. But the need to provide enhanced cybersecurity forced the state to cancel the prior solicitation and rebid the contract, Midkiff said Wednesday. “The procurement was out for bid when Kentucky and most other states were targeted by one of the most sophisticated cyberattacks on our unemployment insurance system in history, which meant that significant additional elements needed to be added to ensure people’s bank accounts, and other information, could not be accessed,” Midkiff said in an email.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A policy governing the use of online social media and platforms by employees of the city unconstitutionally limits free speech, a lawsuit filed Thursday by two of the city’s library system employees claims. The Tulane First Amendment Law Clinic filed the suit on behalf of two employees of the city’s library system. One, Andrew Okun, is identified as a writer and editor “engaged in substantial online communications.” The other is Erin Wilson, who the suit says has a strong online presence and “engages in online humor and social commentary about the transgender experience and challenges gender stereotypes on multiple social media platforms.” Both reluctantly signed documents outlining the policies as a requirement of employment, according to the lawsuit, which focuses on a policy memo adopted last year that says employees can face discipline, including firing, for violations. Language deemed vulgar or offensive is off limits, according to the policy. It also instructs employees not to “engage or respond to negative or disparaging posts about city departments, employees or policies.” It specifically mentions a host of online sites where social comment can be made, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, Slack, gaming sites and news websites.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The state plans to study the burden student loan debt has on college graduates. Democratic Gov. Janet Mills has signed a bill designed to study the impact of the debt. Democratic Sen. Mattie Daughtry, of Brunswick, proposed the legislation, which reinstates the state’s Commission to Study College Affordability and College Completion. Daughtry said Wednesday that the state needs to “make sure we understand how the cost of education, and the burden of student loans that come with it, is impacting Maine workers and our economy.” Daughtry cited that student loan debt in America is about $1.7 trillion, which is higher than the nation’s credit card debt. Maine’s average student loan borrower has more than $33,000 in school loans, Daughtry said. The senator said that is the sixth-highest average in the country. The commission is slated to provide a report to the Maine Legislature by January.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A jury on Thursday found the gunman who killed five people at a newspaper criminally responsible for his actions, rejecting defense attorneys’ mental illness arguments. The jury needed less than two hours to find that Jarrod Ramos could understand the criminality of his actions and conform his conduct to the requirements of the law when he attacked the Capital Gazette newsroom in 2018. The verdict means Ramos, 41, will be sentenced to prison, not a maximum-security mental health facility, for one of the deadliest attacks on journalists in the U.S. Prosecutors are seeking five life sentences without the possibility of parole. Survivors and family members of victims, some with tears in their eyes, embraced outside the courtroom and applauded prosecutors and jurors as they walked by after the verdict. “Having this going on for three years, it’s been a never-ending nightmare,” said Cindi Rittenour, the sister of Rebecca Smith, who died in the attack. “And then hearing that today – just all my anxiety over it, all the wonderings, the unknowns, it’s all gone away now, and all I feel is just relief and happiness. I feel like my sister can finally start to rest in peace.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The Boston School Committee has unanimously approved an overhaul of the way students are selected for admission to the city’s elite public schools based on grades, an entrance exam and socioeconomic status. “We have come to a place where we are ready to move this district forward,” committee Chair Jeri Robinson said at Wednesday’s meeting. Under the new system, students will receive a composite score based on an admissions test and grades, then invitations to Boston Latin School, Boston Latin Academy and O’Bryant School of Math and Science will go out based on rank within eight socioeconomic tiers. Each tier will be allocated about the same number of places. The plan was opposed by some parent groups that wanted 20% of the spots at the schools set aside for the best applicants regardless of socioeconomic status. Superintendent Brenda Cassellius said she supported the change because it is easy to understand, maintains academic rigor and increases opportunity for disadvantaged students. “What is being considered tonight I believe to be a huge step forward for our students, especially our students who have not been able to access our exam schools through no fault of their own,” Superintendent Brenda Cassellius told the committee.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The Canadian government has rejected a creative plan to have Ontario residents line up inside a U.S. border tunnel to tap into a surplus of COVID-19 vaccine held by Michigan, a mayor said. A white stripe was painted inside the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel in the Detroit River. Windsor Mayor Drew Dilkens proposed that Canadians would stand along the border while health care workers jab them. “We’re not trying to send a man to the moon here. We’re using the infrastructure to accomplish a shared goal,” Dilkens said. “This is a sensible, reasonable alternative to vaccines heading to the landfill.” Motor vehicle travel between the countries is prohibited during the pandemic except for commercial truck traffic and workers deemed essential. Dilkens said partnering with Michigan, which has a vaccine surplus, would reduce the waiting time for Canadians who need a second shot. But the Canada Border Services Agency told Dilkens that the tunnel clinic could disrupt travel and carry “significant security implications.” Separately, Public Health Agency of Canada warned there could be trouble if the person giving the shot reached across the tunnel’s white line into Canada. More than 500,000 vaccine doses held by Michigan are set to expire by early August, said Lynn Sutfin, spokeswoman at the state health department.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Gov. Tim Walz signed an executive order aimed at banning so-called conversion therapy Thursday but said it’s just a start and called on the Legislature to make it permanent. Minnesota is now one of about 24 states that, to varying degrees, ban mental health professionals from seeking to change a person’s sexual orientation. Eleven Minnesota cities already have local bans, including Minneapolis, St. Paul, Rochester and Duluth. Walz said conversion therapy is a “byzantine, tortuous practice” that’s not supported by any legitimate mental health organization. He said his order empowers state agencies to ensure that no Minnesotans under age 18 are subjected to it and that insurance companies don’t cover it. “There’s no place for hate in this state; there’s no room for division,” Walz said. “Our LGBTQ+ community is part, and a huge part, of what it means to be one Minnesota. When they are hurt or put through this, we all hurt. And when they succeed, we all succeed.” Attempts to get a ban through the divided Legislature failed in 2019. Sen. Scott Dibble, D-Minneapolis, said legislation is necessary to ensure a future governor doesn’t repeal the ban and to extend it to all Minnesotans. The Minnesota Family Council called the order an attack on the constitutional rights of patients, families and therapists.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A federal judge has ordered that an independent monitor be put into place to oversee the state’s embattled mental health care system. The monitor will be tasked with verifying data submitted by the state analyzing the success of its mental health services. A key measure will be whether it’s preventing unnecessary hospitalizations by allowing people to be treated in their communities. U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves ruled on a remedial plan for the Mississippi State Department of Mental Health late Wednesday. The order comes 10 years after the federal government issued a letter in 2011 saying Mississippi had done too little to provide mental health services outside mental hospitals. The Justice Department sued the state in 2016, and Reeves ruled Mississippi was in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Federal attorneys said during a 2019 trial that mentally ill people were being held in jails because crisis teams did not respond. They said people had been forced to live far from their families because mental health services were not available in their hometowns. They also said people made repeat trips to Mississippi mental hospitals because there was no effective planning for them to make a transition to community services, and the most intensive kinds of services were not being made available.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: The state’s health department on Thursday reported the highest daily count of new COVID-19 cases since the dead of winter, and the association representing the state’s hospitals is warning that the health care system is potentially on the brink of a crisis. The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services cited 2,302 newly confirmed coronavirus cases, the largest one-day count since mid-January, as the delta variant continues to spread in a state with one of the nation’s lowest vaccination rates. Hospitalizations ticked up statewide by 47 to 1,331, as did the number of patients in intensive care units, rising by 19 to 409. Nearly half of the ICU patients – 196 – are hospitalized in southwestern Missouri. Greene County and Springfield leaders are asking the state to fund an alternative care site since hospitals in Springfield are near capacity. The Missouri Hospital Association, in its weekly COVID-19 update, called the situation in southwestern Missouri “dire” and said signals for the rest of Missouri are “foreboding.” Mercy Springfield was reporting pandemic-high numbers of hospitalizations. Meanwhile, Gov. Mike Parson suggested Tuesday that some of that area’s health officials are trying to find someone to blame and want to scare people into getting vaccinated.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state’s watercraft inspectors have intercepted a record number of boats carrying aquatic invasive mussels this year with nearly half of the boating season remaining, the Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks said. Inspectors identified two infested boats last week, bringing this year’s total to 41, the Montana State News Bureau reports. The previous record was 35 boats intercepted last year. The number of inspections has remained about the same, officials said. Aquatic mussels have no natural predators and can clog water pipes and displace native species. All watercraft including non-motorized boats must be inspected when coming into Montana to prevent zebra and quagga mussels from becoming established in the state. Adult mussels can attach themselves to the bottom of boats and survive out of water for up to 30 days. Mussel larvae are microscopic and can float undetected in boat live wells, bilges and ballast tanks. Thomas Woolf, the state’s Aquatic Invasive Species Bureau chief, said there’s some continued increase in outdoor recreation due to COVID-19, and Montana residents have been buying boats in the Midwest, where mussels are established. “We’re also seeing people moving here bringing their boats,” he said.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Two weeks after the state quit publicly reporting daily coronavirus statistics, Nebraska launched a new website Wednesday to provide weekly updates on some of the information. The state’s decision to stop providing daily COVID-19 updates was widely criticized by health experts who use the data to track the virus’s spread. “I don’t think that was a well-timed decision,” said Dr. James Lawler, one of the leaders of the Global Center for Health Security at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha. “I think that if you are trying to drive down a rivet at night in the rain, blindfolding yourself is probably not the best idea.” Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services spokeswoman Olga Dack said the state’s new website will be updated on Wednesdays with some of the latest information about the virus’s spread. The site includes the number of virus cases, hospitalizations and deaths in the state along with statistics on the vaccination campaign, but it doesn’t include as much detail as the previous version of the dashboard. Dack said part of the problem is that much of the data the state had been reporting previously is covered by state and federal health privacy laws, which were suspended as long as the state’s official virus emergency continued, but that ended June 30.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The Washoe County Sheriff’s Office has been offering a “second chance” to motorists registered as organ donors by issuing a warning ticket as opposed to a fine for minor traffic violations. The Second Chance Organ Donation Awareness program was implemented this week through Friday because Wednesday marked the two-year anniversary of the death of Elizabeth “Lizzy” Hammond, a 9-year-old girl from Reno who saved three kids’ lives through the donation of her organs. At the discretion of the individual WCSO deputy, warning tickets are being handed out that note whether the offending motorist is an organ donor and give information about Donor Network West, the organization partnering with WCSO for the awareness campaign. “Through minor traffic infractions, we’ll pull people over and look at their card, and if their driver’s license indicates that they’re an organ donor, we thank them and then give them a second chance,” Washoe County Sheriff Darin Balaam said. “Because they’ve taken that opportunity to give somebody else a second chance at life.” Balaam clarified that the program is for minor traffic infractions such as running a stop sign, minor speeding violations or not putting on a turn signal. “It’s not for your DUI or reckless driving cases,” he said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nRochester: A nonprofit has announced its plans to convert a building in the city to a drop-in youth center for young adults and children facing housing insecurity. Currently, Waypoint supports about 130 young people in the state. The nonprofit offers a variety of social services including adoption, mental health counseling and child care, New Hampshire Public Radio reports. Erin Kelly, program director for Homeless Youth and Young Adult Services, said the center will be a safe place for young people to be able to drop in to receive support and resources from trained adults. The new center will also provide young people with meals, charging stations for phones, a food pantry, showers and group therapy. Kelly said the center will be officially open in 2022.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A white man captured on video yelling racist slurs at his Black neighbors and later arrested on harassment and more than a dozen other charges will remain in jail pending his trial, a judge ruled Wednesday. Edward C. Mathews, 45, of Mount Laurel, who stood silently from the Burlington County jail during a remotely held detention hearing, poses a “high risk of danger to the community,” Superior Court Judge Terrence Cook said Wednesday. Wednesday’s hearing marked the first time Mathews appeared in court on charges that stemmed from early July interactions with his neighbors at their Mount Laurel housing complex. He stood in an assembly room at the county jail during the proceedings, wearing orange and with his arms behind him. Prosecutors have charged Mathews with 14 counts, including harassment, stalking and weapons counts. Assistant Prosecutor Jamie Hutchinson on Wednesday said Mathews began harassing homeowners association board members, who were all of color, over a year ago, including by smashing windows of a neighbor’s vehicle with a rock and smearing their car with fecal matter.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: New Mexico spent $1.5 million to advertise the state during the Virgin Galactic space launch Sunday. The state paid the money to display New Mexico’s logo on video of the flight, KOB-TV reports. The flight saw Virgin Galactic founder Richard Branson briefly rocket into space aboard the company’s winged space plane for the first time. A third of the money came from a $500,000 special appropriation by the Legislature to market and promote the state during the flight, and the rest came from the Tourism Department’s budget, department spokesman Cody Johnson said. “We actually have a conservative estimate of around $3.5 million in media value just from the event itself – and, again, that’s a pretty conservative estimate – because we’ve seen so much coverage and viewership of the livestream that it’s going to grow over the coming days and weeks,” Johnson said earlier this week.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A museum dedicated to telling Chinese American history marked its reopening to the public Wednesday, with an exhibit on Asian Americans and racism that it curated partially through submissions gathered during the pandemic and a surge of anti-Asian bias incidents around the country. The opening was a long time coming for the Museum of Chinese in America, not only because of the more than yearlong pandemic shutdown but because of a fire that ravaged though the space where its collection was housed in January 2020. Luckily, most of the collection was salvaged. Looking back, there was a question of “how were we going to survive, but we kept pivoting,” said Nancy Yao Maasbach, the museum’s president. That included a lot of virtual programming, including the call for submissions that became part of “Responses: Asian American Voices Resisting the Tides of Racism.” The exhibition’s outer walls are a running history of sorts, a timeline showcasing the racism and bigotry that’s been turned toward Asian Americans throughout their generations in the U.S. They touch on how stereotypes connecting them and disease have a long history, along with more recent issues like the treatment of Middle Eastern and South Asian communities in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks and the anti-Asian bias of the pandemic.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state House gave its final approval to wide-ranging energy legislation during an unusual overnight session early Thursday. The chamber met briefly after midnight to complete the second of two required votes on the measure, which now heads to the Senate. The first vote happened early Wednesday evening, but Democrats unhappy with the legislation blocked an immediate second vote. House Speaker Tim Moore announced the Thursday session would begin at 12:01 a.m. because several colleagues would be unavailable to vote during the daylight hours. The bill pushed by Republican leaders would retire early several Duke Energy power plants fueled by coal and expand solar production. The measure also lets Duke Energy seek multiyear rate increases, rather than year by year, and directs the utility to find a location for a new type of nuclear power plant. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper and many manufacturers are among the bill’s opponents, citing in part costs to ratepayers and the shift of authority away from the state Utilities Commission. Environmental advocates say the coal-fired plant retirements rely too much on shifting to natural gas for electricity. Thursday’s final vote of 57-49 included five Republicans who voted against the measure. Roughly a dozen House members had excused absences.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The same stronger-than-forecast oil prices that are swelling the state’s treasury also could shrink dollars for road construction next year, officials said Thursday. Oil is used for road construction and making asphalt. The state Department of Transportation already has approved 174 contracts for road, bridge and other projects this year that total $350 million, agency spokesman David Finley said. Bids on those projects came in earlier this year before oil prices began surging, he said. Bids for next year’s construction projects will begin coming in November, but most will come in spring 2022, Finley said. Steve Salwei, DOT’s director of transportation programs, said none of the state-funded projects being done this year are affected by higher crude prices. Next year, however, things may be different. “We can only construct with money we have to pay for it,” he said. Contractors appear to be ample at present, and bidding competition could lower project costs, Salwei said. The state typically is required to match 20% of federal funding used road construction, Salwei said. North Dakota’s share of the funding won’t be known until a new federal highway bill is passed, he said.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: John Glenn’s birthplace and childhood hometown are joining forces to celebrate what would have been the history-making astronaut and U.S. senator’s 100th birthday with a three-day festival. Glenn, who died in 2016, was the first American to orbit Earth, making him a national hero in 1962. Before that, he served as a military fighter pilot in World War II and the Korean War and set a transcontinental air speed record. In 1998, he became the oldest person ever to go into space at 77. He spent 24 years as a Democrat in the U.S. Senate. Running Friday through Sunday, the John Glenn Centennial Celebration is a collaboration between Cambridge, where Glenn was born July 18, 1921, and nearby New Concord, where he grew up and met his late wife, Annie, who died last year at 100 of complications from COVID-19. The celebration will include a Friendship 7-Miler race between the two communities and a Friendship 7 parade, both named for the aircraft Glenn rode during his famous orbit. Also planned are a presentation by space shuttle astronaut and fellow Ohioan Don Thomas, rocket car rides, space movies, and rides in the type of biplane a young Glenn flew over Cambridge to become hooked on aviation.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: State health officials notified the Oklahoma County Detention Center on Tuesday that all juvenile inmates must be removed from the jail by Friday after a surprise inspection found numerous deficiencies at the problem-plagued jail. The Oklahoma State Department of Health notified the jail of numerous violations in a 61-page report from the June 23 inspection, including inadequate screenings of incoming inmates, failure to conduct proper inmate counts and obscured windows on cell doors that prevented proper “sight checks.” Jail administrator Greg Williams acknowledged in a statement that more improvements were needed but said he does not agree with all the report’s findings. “Decades of physical plant neglect and poor construction cannot be overcome in a few months,” Williams said. Only one current jail inmate meets the state’s definition of a juvenile, he said, and that person was expected to be transferred to the Oklahoma County juvenile detention facility before Friday’s deadline. Jail operations were taken over last July by a trust, which has drawn criticism for inmate deaths, escapes, assaults, and a hostage situation in which an inmate was fatally shot by police after beating and stabbing a jailer.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Nearly 50 years after the Macleay landfill closed, Marion County is considering turning the rolling field on top of it into a park. The county is gathering public input and fielding ideas about what the land 7 miles southeast of downtown could become. So far, contenders include a bike park, a disc golf course or maybe both. “It is beautiful,” said Tom Kissinger, program supervisor of Marion County. “On a clear day, you can see Mount Adams and Mount Hood, even Mount St. Helens.” Some neighbors are less enthusiastic about the idea, however. Discussions began after the county sold Auburn Park to Salem-Keizer Public Schools in 2019 for an expansion of the adjacent Auburn Elementary School. The 4.37-acre Auburn Park was bought in two parcels with Land and Water Conservation Fund dollars in 1977 and 1979. By law, any sale of LWCF land must be balanced by the acquisition of another park of equal or greater economic and recreational value. That’s when “the idea came up of using the old Macleay landfill” for a park, Kissinger said. But multiple commenters on the county’s Facebook post about the land expressed concerns about contamination from the landfill and said they foresee an increase in the problem of people using the vacant land for camping and waste-dumping.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Six of Pennsylvania’s 14 state-owned universities will be consolidated into two new institutions under a unanimous vote Wednesday by the State System of Higher Education’s governing board. Bloomsburg, Mansfield and Lock Haven universities in northern Pennsylvania will form one institution and California, Clarion and Edinboro universities in western Pennsylvania the other. The change will be phased in, starting later in 2022. They will have new names that have not been selected, but the plan is to keep all six campuses open with their own identities and brands, including existing sports teams. Both new institutions will have their own presidents and top administrators. The university system wants to cut student costs by 25% by getting them to graduate more quickly, enrolling high school students, raising more money from donors and grants, and expanding federal work-study offerings. There are 94,000 students in PASSHE, as it’s known, and enrollment has fallen by more than 20% since 2010. Chancellor Daniel Greenstein said students enrolled in the affected universities will be able to finish their degrees, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports. In-person instruction and residences on campus will remain.\n\nRhode Island\n\nPortsmouth: The only home on a small island in Narragansett Bay has been sold. The 600-square-foot, off-the-electrical-grid cottage on Patience Island – with the unique address of 0 Patience Way – sold for $365,000, according to public records, lower than the $399,900 asking price when it was first listed in April. Realtor Michael Russo announced the sale on his Facebook page Tuesday. “Congrats to all parties involved with this special sale!” he wrote. He did not disclose the buyer, and the sale had not been recorded in town property records. The seasonal cottage comes with just under a half-acre of land, two bedrooms, a kitchenette, a half-bath and what is described as a “picturesque front porch.” Even though it’s off the grid, a single solar panel provides some electrical services. The island, officially part of the town of Portsmouth, covers about one-third of a square mile. According to property records, the cottage was built in 1972 and had been owned by the same family since.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The University of South Carolina’s president has indicated he does not plan to ask the Legislature for permission to change the names of nearly a dozen campus buildings that a special committee says honors racists and Civil War figures. Instead, interim university President Harris Pastides said he will encourage school leaders to concentrate on honoring deserving people on new buildings with the same committee suggesting a number of prominent Black leaders. The police killing of George Floyd in May 2020 led to the removal of building names and statues to racists and Confederates across the South. None of that happened in South Carolina because of a law called the Heritage Act passed in 2000 that requires a two-thirds vote from the General Assembly to change the name of any building based on a historical figure. In the past 21 years, lawmakers have not even taken a vote on any request from the Civil War or segregation eras. The University of South Carolina has a special committee that has been studying building names across campus for two years. It found 11 that members felt were named for racists, including a health center named for U.S. Sen. Strom Thurmond, who died in 2003 and started his political career fighting against people who wanted to end segregation, according to a draft report obtained by The State newspaper.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem on Thursday fired the warden and deputy warden of the state penitentiary, following an investigation into an anonymous complaint that alleged supervising corrections officers regularly sexually harassed their fellow employees. The governor had suspended Darin Young, the former warden, on Tuesday, along with Secretary of Corrections Mike Leidholt. Noem said Thursday that she has also suspended Stefany Bawek, who was the director of a prison work program called Pheasantland Industries. The anonymous complaint released by Noem’s office alleges that supervising corrections officers at the prison were allowed to sexually harass employees and that attempts to report the harassment were ignored. The complaint says that schedules at the prison were adjusted so the officers could “work in the same vicinities as their interest/victims” and that employees who did not give in to the harassment were made to “suffer by being placed in less desirable posts.” The complaint further alleges that employee morale was low amid wages that lagged other industries, that corrections officers did not have body armor that was “up to standards,” and that promotions were based on personal connections. Nome’s statement said the investigation into the complaint is continuing.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state’s former top vaccination official received a dog muzzle in the mail a few days before she was fired this week in what she has said was an attempt to use her as a scapegoat to appease lawmakers. “Someone wanted to send a message to tell her to stop talking,” said Brad Fiscus, the husband of Dr. Michelle Fiscus. “They thought it would be a threat to her.” Michelle Fiscus had been facing harsh criticism from Republican lawmakers over the Tennessee Health Department’s outreach efforts to vaccinate teenagers against COVID-19. At a June legislative session, in which some lawmakers threatened to defund the Health Department, they specifically referenced a letter Fiscus sent to medical providers explaining the legality of allowing them to inoculate children 14 and up without parental consent. Fiscus was fired Monday. Her termination letter does not explain the reasoning for her dismissal, and a Health Department spokesperson has declined to comment on it. Brad Fiscus said his wife received a box in Amazon packaging containing a black dog muzzle at her office about a week before she was fired. But he said Michelle Fiscus was “taking it in stride” and continuing to “speak truth.” “She said, ‘Whoever sent that must not know me very well. That’s for a beagle, but I’m a pit bull,’ ” Brad Fiscus recalled.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Early in the pandemic, the Design Institute for Health, a joint program from Dell Medical School and the College of Fine Arts at the University of Texas at Austin, studied the best way long-term care centers could help staffers follow sanitation guidelines. The institute’s team looked at creating clear signage about personal protective equipment, for example, and how to design stations for putting on that equipment and sanitizing hands. One finding of that initial study, paid for by a $410,822 grant from the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation, was that the effectiveness of infection control was directly related to the satisfaction of the workforce in the long-term care centers. The Design Institute for Health now is running three new pilot programs at three local long-term care centers, all of which participated in the previous study. The city of Austin and Austin Public Health are funding the $90,000 project, which began Monday. The first pilot program tries different design strategies to make the physical environment better for the staff and create spaces for breaks. Traditional breakrooms have been closed to staff during the pandemic. The second pilot program looks at what resources and partnerships can be created to help people working in long-term care centers.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: The drought and COVID-19 pandemic have combined to make for a difficult year for agriculture, but the state’s farmers are finding ways to make the most of it. Utah farmers created a statewide food distribution program last year aiming to get food to hungry residents and their families, and managers announced this week that the “Miracle Projects” administered via the Miracle of Agriculture Foundation had helped serve more than 1.5 million pounds of food to more than 35,000 hungry people statewide. At the same time, farmers and ranchers were looking for additional ways to get their food products directly to consumers. Now, members of the Utah Farm Bureau are pushing to find new ways to fund the program and keep it going while still supporting area farmers and ranchers. Farmers Feeding Utah Inc., established to make buying local products convenient and reasonable, kicked off recently with a Utah-product-only subscription box that delivers new products to people’s doorsteps every month. Those interested can subscribe at Box.FarmersFeedingUtah.com. Each month’s box will include new products. Subscribers will also receive exclusive access to an online marketplace where they can purchase their favorite items from the boxes.\n\nVermont\n\nSt. Albans: The U.S. Passport Agency ended its no-appointment walk-in service at its Vermont office after it was overwhelmed by people seeking the documents amid a backlog of 1.5 million requests, the State Department said Thursday. Dozens of desperate travelers from throughout the Northeast had been traveling to the St. Albans office after getting word that people could get passports on the spot and struggling to make appointments at other offices. The Vermont Passport Agency had been offering appointment slots from no-shows to last-minute customers on its premises, the State Department said in a statement Thursday. The agency has “discontinued this practice due to unintended safety and security consequences,” it said. More than 20 people, including small children, were waiting outside the Vermont office Thursday despite the policy change. On Wednesday, the State Department said the wait for a passport is now between 12 weeks and 18 weeks, even if people pay for expedited processing, because of ripple effects from the coronavirus pandemic. Currently, the State Department is accepting appointments at the Vermont Passport Agency and other public passport agencies for life-or-death emergencies. A limited number of appointments for urgent, non-life-or-death travel within 72 hours can be made online.\n\nVirginia\n\nChincoteague: After a pandemic-enforced hiatus in 2020, a popular summer event is making a comeback. While COVID-19 restrictions forced the cancellations of the island’s biggest event – the Chincoteague Pony Penning held each year in July – a small event that still attracts hundreds each year during that same time period is returning. From July 22 to 24, blueberry aficionados can sample the juicy berry in a wide variety of creations while browsing through arts and crafts at what is billed as the “largest fine arts and crafts event on the Eastern Shore of Virginia.” The 33rd annual Blueberry Festival promises plenty of blueberry treats for attendees, along with live entertainment and both indoor and outdoor exhibits featuring artists and crafters from the Shore and beyond. The festival will take place from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. each day at the Chincoteague Center. In addition to popular blueberry=themed foods such as ice cream, pie and cakes, four food vendors will be on hand, offering options including pizza, seafood, and Middle Eastern and Mexican specialties. Live music will be offered throughout the three days of the festival, featuring popular returning and new acts.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A civilian police watchdog group has found that an officer repeatedly worked over 90 hours a week and earned so much overtime that he was the highest-paid city employee one year at more than $400,000 – and none of his supervisors noticed. The review by Seattle’s Office of Police Accountability of the case of Officer Ron Willis found 15 times in which he worked more than 90 hours a week in 2019 and identified numerous gaps in the Seattle Police Department’s ability to monitor overtime, The Seattle Times reports. In a letter to interim Chief Adrian Diaz, OPA director Andrew Myerberg urged the police department to track hours in a centralized database or require the department’s human resources staff to “flag employees who may be working excess hours.” As a result of the review, Willis was suspended for one day without pay for working more than the maximum hours allowed by department rules. A police spokesperson said Willis wasn’t available for comment, and efforts to reach him by the newspaper weren’t successful. The police department has long struggled to monitor overtime and has been the subject of multiple critical findings from city auditors and the oversight group.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nFairmont: Gov. Jim Justice visited Thomas Jackson’s office at West Virginia University’s Robotic Technology Center in Fairmont on Wednesday to present the latest million-dollar prize in the state’s vaccination sweepstakes, according to a news release. Justice was accompanied by his pet English bulldog – Babydog – who is the mascot of the “Do It for Babydog” vaccination sweepstakes. The Republican governor also surprised two residents with brand-new, custom-outfitted trucks and two more with four-year scholarships to any public institution in the state. Other West Virginians won lifetime hunting and fishing licenses, custom hunting rifles, custom hunting shotguns, and weekend getaways to West Virginia state parks. Earlier in the week, Justice confronted outlandish conspiracy theories about COVID-19 vaccines and set higher targets for vaccinating residents age 50 and older. He said at a news conference Tuesday that he recently had a meal with a group of people who believed in the baseless conspiracy theory that “there was something in the vaccine that would enable the federal government to track us.” The governor dismissed it and urged more people to get their shots. “It’s just a stretch beyond what I can believe,” he said. Justice noted that the phones people carry around with them have more tracking potential.\n\nWisconsin\n\nGreen Bay: Gov. Tony Evers joined local and state economic leaders in the city Wednesday to announce that he will direct $130million in federal funding toward workforce development programs. The funds, which come from the state’s American Rescue Plan Act allocation, will be spread across three programs that will help regions find solutions to workforce challenges and help unemployed or underemployed workers find job opportunities. The Democratic governor said there is “no one-size-fits all-solution” to workforce challenges. “I’ve heard from many Wisconsin business owners, employers, out-of-work job-seekers that while employment in Wisconsin continues to grow, our economy is facing obviously a workforce shortage. A shortage that existed well before I became governor but has been made worse obviously by this pandemic,” Evers said. Wisconsin’s unemployment rate in May 2021 – the most recent month reported by the state – was 3.9%, tied for the 10th-lowest in the country, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The largest block of funding will provide grants to at least 10 local and regional entities with about $10 million each to help meet needs including child care, transportation and housing. Evers said that funding would go out sometime in the fall.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: A magician and comic has canceled performances at libraries in northeastern Wyoming because of threats over a social media post about her being a transgender woman, she said. The Campbell County Library posted on its Facebook page that Mikayla Oz, 24, was canceling shows planned for Wednesday and Thursday in Gillette and Wright out of safety concerns for herself, library staff and patrons, the Gillette News Record reports. The fact that Oz is a transgender woman was shared on a social media post, leading to misinformation about her performances and calls to protest the events, library officials said. Oz, from Des Moines, Iowa, has performed at libraries, schools and other events. She said the show she planned is family-friendly and doesn’t have an LGBTQ message. She was initially willing to do her show despite some complaints, but then she started receiving violent and frightening threats online and by telephone, she said. Library director Terri Lesley said her staff also received threats from a patron. Oz’s gender identity was not previously known to library staff, nor is it something they consider relevant, Lesley said. “It just breaks my heart, especially when my show has absolutely nothing to do with my back story at all,” Oz said.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/16"}]}

There’s still an outstanding Senate race in Georgia, which will be decided by a December runoff and will determine how large Democrats’ majority will be.\n\nRepublicans’ victory in the House will end Democrat Nancy Pelosi’s second tenure as speaker in January. But its majority looks set to number a handful of seats, far short of initial expectations in a margin that will make managing a restive Republican conference a stiff task for party leaders.\n\nAnd while less impressive than party leaders had hoped for, it still represents a return of Trump-style ideology and chaos politics to Washington, given the strong influence the ex-president is likely to wield over his acolytes in the GOP conference. The former president announced his 2024 presidential bid on Tuesday night.\n\nThe new Republican-led House is certain to make life decidedly miserable for the White House for the rest of Biden’s term, as the president admitted before the election when he told reporters the loss of the Democratic majority would make things “more difficult.”\n\nBiden congratulated House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy Wednesday evening, saying in a statement that he is “ready to work with House Republicans to deliver results for working families.”\n\nBut Republicans will be able to activate their plans to target the White House, the administration and the president’s son, Hunter, with a relentless slate of investigations. Given the reality of divided power in Washington and Biden’s veto, the GOP will struggle to force its own agenda into law. But it may act as a political weapon for Trump by trying to damage Biden ahead of their possible 2024 rematch.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with CNN before the election, McCarthy pledged to prioritize the fight against inflation, rising crime and border security.\n\n“The first thing you’ll see is a bill to control the border first,” the California Republican said, when asked for specifics about his party’s immigration plans. “You’ve got to get control over the border. You’ve had almost 2 million people just this year alone coming across.”\n\nA smaller-than-expected Republican majority could create volatility in the conference by handing more influence to extreme, pro-Trump backers. The challenging job of managing the conference will require McCarthy to placate more moderate members whose seats will be most vulnerable in 2024 and who could fracture his governing majority on individual legislation if they defect to vote with Democrats.\n\nIn a news conference the day after the election, Biden offered to work with the new Republican majority. But he ruled out compromises on his priorities, including any effort to downsize Social Security and Medicare and to abandon his ambitious climate change goals.\n\nIn practice, that probably means that room for cooperation is limited. And given the sway extreme members are likely to have in a narrow GOP majority, there may be little appetite for cooperating with a Democratic White House anyway.\n\nDivided government is likely to cause a series of showdowns between the Republican House and the Democratic White House over tax policy, spending and even the extent of US aid to Ukraine.\n\nThe most dangerous potential clash could come over the need to raise the US government’s borrowing ceiling sometime. Republicans have vowed to demand steep spending cuts in return for voting for legislation on the issue, a stand that will spark criticism that they are holding the global economy hostage for political reasons. Failure to lift the debt limit would cause the United States to default on its obligations, throw the economy into a deep crisis and would cause global contagion. Controversies such as these will test McCarthy’s leverage over his coalition. Two of his predecessors, Speakers Paul Ryan and John Boehner, were driven to distraction by trying to deal with their most radical members. McCarthy’s task is likely to be even more complex given Trump’s influence with House Republicans and his desire to wound Biden politically.\n\nThe House Republican conference voted for the California Republican to be its leader on Tuesday, putting him in line to be the next speaker. He defeated longshot challenger Rep. Andy Biggs, a former chairman of the right-wing House Freedom Caucus. The Arizona congressman received 31 votes to the California Republican’s 188, according to multiple sources in the room. It was a secret ballot and McCarthy only needed to earn a simple majority of the conference. In January, McCarthy must win 218 votes, or a majority of the House, to become speaker.\n\nBut while the votes against him underscored the turmoil in the party after the GOP’s underwhelming performance last week, McCarthy enjoys significant support in the wider Republican conference, because of his prodigious fundraising, energetic campaigning and years of preparatory work designed to realize his ambition to be speaker.\n\nFor instance, Rep.-elect Michael Lawler, who defeated the chairman of the House Democrats’ campaign arm in a New York district, told CNN’s Erin Burnett last week said he would back McCarthy, citing his help during the campaign.\n\n“He was extremely supportive. He came to campaign with me and for me and I am a big believer in sticking with who brought you to the dance,” Lawler said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reaction.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/11/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/08/politics/midterm-election-results-recap/index.html", "title": "Democratic pick up in Pennsylvania boosts their hopes of holding ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nDemocrats will pick up a GOP-held Senate seat in Pennsylvania in a huge boost to their hopes of clinging to the chamber, while the red wave that Republicans hoped for has yet to materialize in the House.\n\nDemocratic nominee John Fetterman’s victory over Republican Mehmet Oz means Democrats have some slight breathing room in their bid to keep control of the 50-50 chamber as counting goes on in other key races in Arizona, Nevada, Georgia and Wisconsin.\n\nRepublicans went into the night needing a net gain of one seat in the chamber to take control. They must now hold on to Wisconsin and win two out of three Democrat-held seats in Arizona, Nevada and Georgia to win the majority.\n\nThe Democratic win in Pennsylvania – the rare swing state where President Joe Biden hit the trail this fall – is also a rebuke of former President Donald Trump, who had endorsed Oz ahead of the primary and also appeared in the commonwealth in the final weekend of the campaign.\n\nSenate Republicans fell short in New Hampshire and Colorado, where Democratic Sens. Maggie Hassan and Michael Bennet will win reelection, CNN projects.\n\nDemocrats also fell short in two Senate states that had proven surprisingly competitive heading into Election Day. Republicans will hold onto North Carolina and Ohio, CNN projects, denying Democrats opportunities to pick up seats that could have mitigated any future losses.\n\nRepublicans had hoped to sweep a trio of Virginia districts on their way to a landslide. They will pick up one in a bellwether district with Republican Jen Kiggans’ defeat of Democratic Rep. Elaine Luria, the only member of the select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection who was facing a competitive general election.\n\nLuria had put the fight to save American democracy at the center of her closing message but she fell short in a district that got slightly better for Republicans in redistricting. The race was among the most closely watched in the country – viewed as an early indicator of Republican strength on Tuesday night.\n\nBut in another key Virginia district, Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger will hold on to her seat, CNN projects, in a district that became bluer in redistricting. And in Michigan, Rep. Elissa Slotkin, another Democrat who came to the House in 2018’s blue wave, will win another term, CNN projected early Wednesday.\n\nElsewhere in the House, the GOP has made slower-than-expected gains, while Democrats have also picked up several seats. New Jersey Republican Tom Kean Jr., the son of a popular former governor, will defeat Democratic Rep. Tom Malinowski in a seat that got worse for Democrats, while Democrats will knock off GOP Rep. Steve Chabot, a perennial target, in an Ohio district that became much more favorable to them.\n\nSome of the most aggressive deniers of the 2020 election results will lose their 2022 gubernatorial races, CNN projects.\n\nThat includes Pennsylvania’s Doug Mastriano, who will fall to rising star Democrat Josh Shapiro, and Michigan’s Tudor Dixon, who falsely claimed Trump won Michigan in 2020 and will fall to Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.\n\nThe fate of several Trump-backed candidates who echoed his lies about the 2020 presidential election was still unclear as ballots were being counted in Arizona and Nevada, but Arizona gubernatorial nominee Kari Lake had already raised unfounded doubts about the vote – in a clear echo of some conservatives’ repeated attempts to cast doubt on Maricopa’s results in 2020.\n\nSeveral secretary of state candidates – including Republican Rayla Campbell of Massachusetts, Kim Crockett of Minnesota, Audrey Trujillo of New Mexico, H. Brooke Paige of Vermont and Kristina Karamo of Michigan – all lost their bids. Before the election, CNN tracked at least a dozen Republican nominees for secretary of state who denied the legitimacy of the 2020 election.\n\nIn Georgia, Republican Gov. Brian Kemp will defeat Democrat Stacey Abrams, CNN projects, in their rematch. Kemp had been targeted by Trump during the primary because he refused to overturn the 2020 presidential results. But Kemp largely ignored those attacks and ran on his record as a conservative who had helped the state’s economy recover after the Covid-19 pandemic. His strategy may offer a template for other Republicans who have crossed Trump.\n\nIn Florida, two early calls underscored GOP strength in the state. Sen. Marco Rubio will be reelected, CNN projects, defeating Democratic Rep. Val Demings. And Gov. Ron DeSantis, a potential challenger to ex-President Donald Trump in the Republican presidential primary in 2024, will win reelection in a victory that will supercharge his national ambitions.\n\nAnd in Alabama, Republican Katie Britt, who was backed by Trump, will easily win the seat being vacated by retiring GOP Sen. Richard Shelby, becoming the first elected female senator from the state. In another history-making race, CNN projects that Arkansas Republican Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Trump’s former White House press secretary, will become the state’s first female governor, a post that was once held by her father, former GOP presidential candidate Mike Huckabee.\n\nHistory was also made in blue states. In Massachusetts, Maura Healey will become the state’s first elected female governor and the nation’s first out lesbian governor, CNN projects. And Democrat Wes Moore will serve as Maryland’s first Black governor.\n\nEarly exit polls revealed a nation in the grip of economic pessimism. Roughly three-quarters of voters felt negatively about the economy with about 4 in 10 deeming it downright poor, according to the preliminary national results of the exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research. A third of the electorate said inflation was the most important issue to their vote while about 27% cited abortion – the issue Democrats hoped could give them a boost after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\nRepublicans have already promised to launch investigations into the administration and cripple its agenda if they win the House majority, and many of their nominees have echoed Trump’s election falsehoods, leading to Biden’s repeated warnings about threats to democracy.\n\nAppearing in Ohio on Monday night for Vance, the former president said he’d be making a big announcement at his Mar-a-Lago resort on November 15. CNN had previously reported his aides were eyeing the third week of November for a campaign launch – timing that would allow Trump to take credit for GOP successes in the midterms.\n\nAhead of a potential rematch with Trump, Biden’s dragging approval ratings had made him an unwelcome presence on the campaign trail in swing states. He spent election eve rallying in Maryland for Moore and in New York several days earlier for Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul.\n\nA divided government in Washington could allow Biden to wield his presidential veto to frustrate Republican plans of prolonging Trump-era tax cuts and any attempt to pass a national ban on abortion. But it could also trigger fiscal showdowns and the threats of government shutdowns. A clash could also be looming over raising the debt ceiling.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Maeve Reston Stephen Collinson", "Maeve Reston", "Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/11/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/08/politics/joe-biden-midterms-stakes/index.html", "title": "Biden readies for 'a horrible two years' if GOP takes control of ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAs if Democrats needed any more convincing Tuesday’s midterm elections carry enormous stakes, President Joe Biden offered a bluntly dire assessment during a fundraiser last Friday in Chicago.\n\n“If we lose the House and Senate, it’s going to be a horrible two years,” Biden told the small crowd gathered inside a hotel ballroom, where cameras weren’t allowed. “The good news is I’ll have a veto pen.”\n\nAfter two years of Democratic control of Congress, a change in leadership in the House or Senate – or both – would thrust Biden’s presidency into an entirely new phase. Biden himself has been projecting optimism in the final days of the campaign, but reality is setting in for Democrats their majority rule in Congress could soon end – and Biden’s ability to get his top priorities passed could go with it.\n\nWhite House officials have begun pointing out their losses aren’t likely to be nearly as bad as previous midterm wipeouts, including in 2010, and say the fact Democrats have a fighting chance at all is a positive sign for Biden. But his advisers privately acknowledge that they don’t see a viable path for Democrats to hold onto their House majority, though the president and his senior team are starting the day with the view that the prospect of Democrats holding on to their Senate majority is real – even if it’s one that may take days, or longer, to be fully realized.\n\nWith the intraparty blame game set to boil over in the weeks ahead, the White House moved Tuesday to separate Biden’s agenda – and the president himself – from the list of targets. The White House circulated an Election Day memo to allies more than two dozen individual poll results they say underscores the popularity of the key individual elements of Biden’s agenda, ranging from his cornerstone legislative achievements to his actions on student loans, marijuana and his administration’s response to Covid-19\n\n“Before all the votes have even been cast, pundits are declaring that these midterms have been a referendum on the president’s agenda – nothing could be further from the truth,” the memo, which was obtained by CNN, says in its introduction.\n\nYet even Biden has acknowledged that his agenda, no matter how it polls in isolation, hasn’t translated to an American public that has taken a largely negative view on the direction of the country.\n\n“We’ve passed so many good things,” Biden said at a fundraising event last week. “They’ve been so good people haven’t realized how good they are yet.”\n\nThe effort to get in front of expected losses comes after months of frontline Democratic candidates actively seeking to separate themselves from Biden, relegating the party’s leader mostly to Democratic states and districts as the party scrambled to save its majorities. It’s a reality advisers say Biden doesn’t take personally. After 36 years in the Senate, Biden’s view has long been that the candidates know what’s best for their state or district. But as Biden’s approval ratings started to inch up in the last few months, White House officials have bristled at the view that he was a singular drag on Democrats.\n\nThe defensive tone in the memo echoes a message Biden has repeatedly sought to emphasize in the closing days of the campaign, one that centers on the idea that the election represents a choice between two parties, not a referendum on Biden or his presidency.\n\nA loss of a few seats – Republicans need only pick up five seats to take control of the House – would mean dramatic changes for the president.\n\nHere are four areas that are at stake this Tuesday for Biden and his administration:\n\nGOP investigations\n\nRepublicans on Capitol Hill have made abundantly clear that if they take control of Congress, Biden should get ready: Investigations are coming his way.\n\nA majority in the House or Senate would hand GOP lawmakers powerful chairmanships on a number of oversight committees, giving them the ability to launch investigations targeting Biden, the White House and even members of the president’s family.\n\nAnd so far, Republican members have indicated that they’re eager to target all of the above.\n\nGOP lawmakers including Reps. James Comer and Jim Jordan, who are likely to chair the House Oversight and Judiciary committees respectively, are getting ready to probe a range of issues, from the business dealings of Biden’s son, Hunter; to what Republicans allege is political interference by the FBI and Justice Department; to the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAnd that’s not to mention the drumbeat of impeachment talk – for Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas or even the president himself.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Kevin McCarthy asked about impeaching Biden if GOP wins House. Hear his answer 02:29 - Source: CNN\n\nWhite House officials have been expecting and preparing for this new world for months, including by making personnel hires earlier this summer to beef up its oversight operations. Officials say if Republicans do in fact, take control of Congress, the White House is prepared to beef up those efforts even more with additional hires, and believe it will be ready to push back on future GOP investigations as lacking in merit, politically motivated and nefarious.\n\nWhile officials have been cautious not to get in front of any GOP actions or pre-judge the results of the election, they are also keenly aware of political dynamics that may work in their favor, people familiar with the matter said.\n\n“American people historically don’t respond well to egregious overreach,” one of the people told CNN, specifically citing a new Republican majority’s battles with former President Bill Clinton. “We’ll be prepared, but it’s tough to look at House Republicans and think this won’t wander into that territory.”\n\nAgenda\n\nThe historic likelihood that Biden would lose seats – and majorities – in Congress has loomed over the White House his entire term so far. It is part of what motivated the president’s ambitious legislative agenda, including major Covid-19 relief and a bipartisan infrastructure package, in the earliest months of his presidency.\n\nIf Republicans gain control of one or both chambers, the era of big, progressive bills will likely end. Instead, Biden will be on the defense as Republicans work to undo much of what he accomplished in the first two years of his term.\n\nThe GOP has already vowed to roll back elements of Biden’s signature legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act, including its new, higher taxes on corporations. And they could work to roll back or challenge some of the president’s climate initiatives that are included in the package.\n\nOther areas where the president has vowed action, like cementing into law the nationwide right to abortion, would have no chance of advancing if Republicans take control. And other programs, like student loan relief, could be subject to blocking efforts by the GOP.\n\nIn all of these areas, Biden is poised to wield his veto pen in rejecting potential Republican attempts to undermine his agenda. As president, Biden has not vetoed any bills, a facet of Democratic control on Capitol Hill.\n\nWhite House officials have already been quietly preparing for the areas where agreement is a necessity – spending bills and an increase of the nation’s debt limit. The two issues represent must-pass items that have been at the center of a series of Congress vs. White House battles over the last decade.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, has been among a number of House Republicans who have pledged to deploy similar tactics should they take the majority.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback McCarthy tells CNN first bill would be on border security if GOP wins House 02:05 - Source: CNN\n\nThe first concrete signs of how that may play out will quickly become apparent. Lawmakers will return to Capitol Hill this month with a matter of weeks to reach an agreement to fund the government.\n\nAt the same time, Biden has a long history of working with Republicans to advance pieces of legislation. And he vowed when running for office to find areas to work across the aisle, something he was able to do on several of his key cornerstone legislative wins.\n\nBiden advisers point to the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure law and the $250 billion semiconductor manufacturing and science bill as providing a road map to bipartisan success.\n\nBiden’s 2024 decision\n\nAs soon as the 2022 midterm election results are in, national attention will immediately turn to 2024 – including on the question of whether Biden will seek a second term.\n\nWhile Biden and his aides have been quietly thinking about his political future for months and they have accelerated conversations in the last month, those deliberations will accelerate with the close of the midterm cycle. Biden has pointed to family meetings during the holiday stretch as important to his decision-making, though people familiar with the matter say first lady Dr. Jill Biden and others are on board with another run.\n\nFor weeks, the president and his advisers have maintained that his intention, for now, is to run again. Biden moved quickly to transfer his 2020 operation to the Democratic National Committee after he defeated former President DonaldTrump. The party committee has spent the last two years maintaining and beefing up his grassroots list, fundraising pipeline and building out state-level infrastructure that would make up the critical infrastructure of a nascent campaign.\n\nThey’ve also said that no decision is final until the president has had ample opportunity to discuss his political future with his family. But Biden’s 2024 decision won’t just be a family affair – there will also be strong political dynamics at play.\n\nFor one, Trump’s decision to seek a second term – and the timing of that potential announcement – is expected to be a key factor. Biden advisers continue to believe that the president is best positioned to take on his predecessor, and are confident about a second Biden vs. Trump contest.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback See Al Franken's reaction to Trump's 2024 tease 02:57 - Source: CNN\n\nAnother consideration: How fellow Democrats respond to the results of Tuesday night. Polling from this fall indicates a majority of Democrats say they do not want Biden to run again in 2024. And losses for Democrats could only exacerbate the sense within the party that a change in direction is required.\n\nWhile many elected officials in Biden’s party have been loyal in expressing their public support for a second term, some others have openly called for change.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota, who said over the summer that he does not believe Biden should run again, told CNN on the eve of Election Day that he believes “a majority of Democrats” feel the same way.\n\n“Regardless of tomorrow’s results, I believe Democrats must rebuild our brand and repopulate our bench of future leaders – for both Congress and the White House,” Phillips said. “President Biden has fulfilled his promise to serve as a stabilizing ‘bridge’ to the future, and I expect a majority of Democrats will be seeking a next generation candidate to take the baton in 2024.”\n\nStaffing changes\n\nBiden has seen remarkably little turnover in the first two years of his tenure among his Cabinet and senior team. The halfway mark of his first term, however, could be a natural moment for staff changes.\n\nIt reflects a reluctance to shake up his team, despite calls at various points to dismiss members of his administration. Biden has refrained from firing or asking for the resignation of any members of his Cabinet and sought to lock in his senior team months ahead of this year’s midterms.\n\nThere has been turnover among his senior staff, including in top West Wing positions. His press secretary, White House counsel and senior adviser for public engagement all left earlier this year. Some officials decided to leave the White House around the one-year mark of the administration, while others departed at the start of summer.\n\nBut Biden’s inner circle remains mostly intact. That includes chief of staff Ron Klain, senior advisers Mike Donilon and Steve Ricchetti, deputy chiefs of staff Bruce Reed and Jen O’Malley Dillon, communications director Kate Bedingfield and top communications adviser Anita Dunn.\n\nOfficials have said changes are possible both to the president’s Cabinet and his senior White House staff later this year, though no moves are guaranteed. Should Biden announce his decision to run in 2024, several of the members of his core team are considered likely to shift over to the political operation.\n\nEarlier this fall, the White House established a talent search project to prepare for potential vacancies across Cabinet and senior administration roles following the midterm elections.\n\nKlain brought forward the talent search idea, which will be overseen by two Biden White House alums, Jeff Zients and Natalie Quillian. The pair served in similar roles during the 2020 presidential transition.\n\n“It’s just good government to make sure that you’re thinking ahead,” O’Malley Dillon said during an Axios event last week. “The people that are part of this and helping make that change are the people that you’d expect, and you want to see.”\n\nZients and Quillian – who both served in Covid-19 response roles at the White House earlier in Biden’s presidential term – have specifically been conducting a wide and diverse search for prospective candidates outside the administration to fill Cabinet, deputy Cabinet and senior administration roles.\n\nSome top officials, like Covid adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci, are preparing to leave soon. Climate envoy John Kerry has told CNN he plans to stay in the administration at least until this week’s major climate conference in Egypt – without indicating whether he’ll stay longer. And Biden recently appointed a seasoned veteran of Democratic White Houses, John Podesta, to serve as his climate adviser.\n\nThe future of other officials is unclear. Klain has been the subject of speculation, and it is typical for White House chiefs of staff to serve only a portion of a president’s term. But as Biden faces the inevitable personnel transition that all presidents experience after the midterms, Klain’s deeply ingrained role in all corners of the West Wing’s operations may create even more incentive for him to stick around, some officials note, even as they acknowledge he’s given no indication of his intentions.\n\nA potential replacement has been floated in Dunn, who would be the first woman to serve in the role.\n\n“I like the job I have,” Dunn insisted at the Axios event. She added, “I hope Ron Klain stays as long as Joe Biden is president.”", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak Mj Lee Phil Mattingly", "Kevin Liptak", "Mj Lee", "Phil Mattingly"], "publish_date": "2022/11/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/03/politics/house-midterms-2022-republicans-democrats/index.html", "title": "Will Republicans win back the House in 2022? Here's how the race ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe House committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol is racing against a political clock to get to the bottom of what happened that day, and in the lead-up to the attack.\n\nWhile two Republicans sit on the nine-member panel, it’s a committee created by a Democratic-controlled House that GOP leadership has tried to discredit. One of those Republican panelists, Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, is facing a primary challenger backed by former President Donald Trump. The other, Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, is not running for reelection. And the January 6 committee itself is likely to be disbanded if Republicans win back the House in November.\n\nSo how likely are Republicans to win this fall? Historically, very likely. The party in the White House traditionally loses seats in the first midterm election of a new president’s term. In fact, the president’s party has lost an average of 30 House seats in midterm elections over the last 100 years, according to Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales. Republicans only need a net gain of five seats to win the chamber this year.\n\nA reminder: A net gain of five seats is not the same thing as winning five seats. A party needs at least 218 seats to win control of the House. While Republicans are trying to flip seats this year, so are the Democrats – so any GOP wins will have to be offset by any losses they incur.\n\nThat said, losses are not a huge concern for Republicans right now. Given the historical trends working in their favor and the fact that President Joe Biden’s approval rating is 40% in the latest CNN average of national polls, the national environment seems to be working in their favor. And the uptick in retirement announcements by several longtime Democratic incumbents in recent months is a telling sign they weren’t looking forward to serving in the minority.\n\nBut it’s not all bad news for Democrats. The House map is not as favorable to Republicans as the majority party feared it could have been. The once-a-decade redistricting process is nearly complete (except for a handful of states), which has resulted in new congressional lines that Democrats think give them a shot at holding their majority.\n\nOverall, the biggest takeaway from redistricting is that the number of competitive House seats has shrunk, which means that in most states, primaries – rather than general election contests – will be the main event.\n\nSeveral states are hosting member-on-member primaries, in which two incumbents are running in the same district, either because their state lost a seat in redistricting or they were drawn into the same seat for partisan reasons. While those races can provide plenty of intraparty drama – and in some cases, a test of Trump’s enduring influence over the GOP – they’re mostly not expected to have any effect on the general election. In West Virginia, for example, two Republican incumbents – one who objected to certifying the 2020 presidential election and one who did not – are facing off in a heavily Republican district. Regardless of who wins the May primary, the seat is highly unlikely to fall into Democratic hands in November.\n\nSome states hold open primaries – in which candidates from all parties run on the same primary ballot with the top two or four candidates advancing to the general election. One of those states is Alaska, where former governor and 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin is running in a special election for the state’s at-large seat left vacant by the death last month of Republican Rep. Don Young. Barring any primary surprises, Republicans are expected to hold this seat.\n\nJust 61 House races (out of 435) are currently rated as competitive by Inside Elections. Of those, only 16 are rated as Toss-up races – seven seats held by Republicans, eight held by Democrats and one new seat in Colorado.\n\nA smaller landscape of competitive races means Republicans will be reaching deeper into Democratic territory to look for pickup opportunities. On Wednesday, for example, the National Republican Congressional Committee, the campaign arm of the House GOP, expanded its list of targets to 72 Democratic-held or newly created seats, including districts that now-President Joe Biden carried by double digits in 2020. Of course, these target lists evolve over time and don’t necessarily reflect where money ends up getting spent.\n\nOn the same day as the NRCC announcement, House Majority PAC – the leading Democratic super PAC focused on House races – publicized TV and digital advertising reservations of more than $100 million across 50 media markets. That’s nearly double the amount the group made in initial reservations in 2020.\n\nRepublican opportunities\n\nA top focus for Republicans is sure to be the Democratic-held seats that Trump won in 2020. That includes districts represented by Reps. Jared Golden of Maine, Cindy Axne of Iowa and Matt Cartwright of Pennsylvania, all of whom are in for tough races this fall.\n\nBut the majority of the NRCC’s targets are seats that Biden won. That goes to show just how few “crossover” districts – those that voted one way for president but backed a US House representative of a different party – are left for Republicans to try to flip.\n\nIncreasingly nationalized and partisan elections have done away with the likes of former Minnesota Rep. Collin Peterson, a Democrat whose district voted for Trump by the biggest margin – 30 points – in 2016. But after narrowly holding on to his sprawling, rural district in 2018, the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee went down in 2020.\n\nRepublicans were encouraged by their gains with Hispanic voters in 2020 and hope that trend continues this year, especially in places such as Texas’ Rio Grande Valley, where several House seats are in play.\n\nThey’re also hoping they may be able to make a play for some of the traditionally GOP-leaning suburban districts that moved away from them during the Trump era.\n\nDemocratic retirements have also set up a few enticing pickup opportunities for Republicans. Retiring Illinois Rep. Cheri Bustos, the former chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, has often touted her success in a Trump-voting district. Pennsylvania Rep. Conor Lamb, who is running for Senate, talks up his record of winning in Trump country. But both are leaving behind seats that will see competitive races, according to Inside Elections.\n\nDemocrats on defense\n\nDemocrats hoping to maintain their House majority need to defend the seats they have, while also looking to pick up a few more to help offset the inevitable losses they’re likely to incur in a midterm year with their party holding full control of Washington (the White House, Senate and House).\n\nHouse Democrats’ top defensive holds are incumbents the DCCC calls “Frontline” members. Many of these incumbents have had tough races before, and some of their districts became more favorable in redistricting, although perhaps not enough to ensure a comfortable reelection in a difficult national environment.\n\nGolden, a two-term incumbent from Maine, for example, has a history of overperforming the top of the ticket. His district’s White working-class voters twice backed Trump, while Golden won reelection in 2020 by 6 points. But even if he’s bucked the national Democratic Party on certain major votes in Washington, he’s still in for a tough race, potentially facing off against a better-funded and more organized opponent than he did two years ago. Former GOP Rep. Bruce Poliquin, whom Golden unseated in 2018 under Maine’s ranked-choice voting system, is running again. Inside Elections rates the race a Toss-up.\n\nMany of the DCCC’s Frontliners who won in 2018 – when Democrats flipped the House during Trump’s presidency – are used to raising huge sums of money. They set new quarterly records for hauls in the millions that put even some Senate candidates to shame. But not all Democrats who potentially face competitive races this year after redistricting are accustomed to that level of campaigning. Two longtime incumbents, Reps. Sanford Bishop of Georgia and Marcy Kaptur of Ohio, haven’t faced competitive elections in years.\n\nDemocrats believe they can remain competitive in the suburbs, which soured on Republicans under Trump. Still, Trump is not in office or on the ballot, which will be a test of whether Democrats can sustain base voter enthusiasm without him.\n\nDemocrats are also eyeing pickup opportunities, especially in GOP-held seats that Biden won. That includes a handful of districts in California and New York, although there’s new uncertainty over the district lines in the Empire State after a judge blocked the Democratic-drawn map on Thursday.\n\nAnd even if Trump isn’t on the ballot this year, he’s proving he still wants to be a force in GOP politics. For Democrats, that’s good news if he helps drive GOP candidates to the right in getting through primaries for competitive seats. In Michigan, for example, he’s backing a primary challenger to freshman Rep. Peter Meijer, who voted to impeach Trump, in a district that could be harder for Republicans to hold without the incumbent.", "authors": ["Simone Pathe"], "publish_date": "2022/04/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/07/politics/senate-races-democrats-no-room-for-error/index.html", "title": "Democrats have zero room for error in Senate races as GOP House ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe race for control of the 50-50 Senate has come down to the wire, with Democrats trying to hold a legislative line of defense as the prospect of a politically divided Washington grows increasingly likely.\n\nEven as the odds of House Democrats keeping their majority worsen – with the party spending millions to defend seats President Joe Biden would have won comfortably in 2020 – the Senate has remained more of a nail-biter. That alone has been encouraging for Democrats, especially amid dour economic news and the president’s low approval ratings, and has renewed debate about whether factors like candidate quality and fundraising can help defy a challenging national environment.\n\nBut in a Senate chamber that’s evenly split, with Vice President Kamala Harris holding the tie-breaking vote, Democrats have zero room for error as they look to prevent the GOP from gaining a two-chamber congressional majority and launching even more of the kinds of investigations that Republicans have already pledged to open if they win the House.\n\nRepublicans need a net gain of just one seat to win the Senate majority – with Nevada, Georgia, Arizona and New Hampshire among their key pickup opportunities. All of those races have tightened in their favor since the summer, including New Hampshire, which had appeared out of the GOP’s reach when the party nominated a more extreme candidate who had raised just a fraction of Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan’s millions.\n\nFor Republicans to pick up seats, though, they need to defend their own, including two in states Donald Trump won in 2020 but that have required more GOP spending than Republicans would have liked.\n\nWhile Republicans pummel Democrats over inflation and crime, Democrats’ strategy has been to try to paint contrasts between their candidates and the GOP – over issues of both character and policy, such as their late campaign charge that Republicans would endanger Social Security and Medicare.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, for example, where Lt. Gov. John Fetterman is Democrats’ best hope of flipping a GOP-held Senate seat, the Democratic nominee used his closing ad to tout his history of “fighting for people,” while saying that Republican opponent Mehmet Oz has “spent his life taking advantage of people.”\n\nOz’s struggles with his image – his favorability ratings are underwater in a recent Marist poll, for example – speak to the individual dynamics of Senate races, where some Trump-backed nominees in open-seat contests have struggled to raise money or consolidate Republican support after divisive primaries. The flip side of that equation for Democrats is that some of their vulnerable incumbents have been overperforming Biden in their states in recent polling.\n\nBoth of those factors underscore how Senate races can defy the national environment. House races – in which candidates are much less defined – tend to blow with the national winds. The 2018 blue wave, for example – when Democrats made significant gains in the House in response to Trump’s presidency – didn’t translate to the Senate. Republicans were able to pick up seats that year by knocking off some Democrats in red states.\n\nBut the question this year is whether the idiosyncrasies of Senate races can outweigh voters’ dismal perceptions of the economy and the desire to check the party in power in the White House. Nearly three-quarters of voters in a recent CNN/SSRS survey said things in the country were going in the wrong direction, with about the same percentage believing the US is already in a recession.\n\nMaking things worse for Democrats, Republicans have an enthusiasm advantage, mirroring the partisan gap ahead of the 2010 midterms, when the GOP picked up seats. The Supreme Court’s late June decision overturning Roe v. Wade boosted Democrats’ base enthusiasm, but four months later, it’s still the economy that appears to be motivating most voters, with abortion often falling significantly behind in state polling.\n\nNevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto is widely regarded as the most vulnerable Democratic incumbent as she runs for a second term in a state hard-hit by the Covid-19 pandemic and high gas prices. Democrats are hopeful that voters here, who backed Biden by 2 points, will come home for Cortez Masto in the final stretch, but given the population’s relative transience, that’s no guarantee. This is also the first midterm without Democratic Sen. Harry Reid, who was often instrumental in getting working-class and Latino voters to turnout.\n\nIn two states Biden narrowly flipped in 2020, relatively new Democratic incumbents have been campaigning since they won their special elections last cycle and have strong personal brands – and plenty of money to tout them. That initially gave Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock, the pastor of the late Martin Luther King Jr.’s church, and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, a retired astronaut, an advantage over Trump-backed challengers.\n\nBoth Arizona and Georgia, however, are used to voting Republican and concerns about the economy are increasing Democratic headwinds. GOP Senate hopefuls may also be able to ride the coattails of stronger gubernatorial nominees in both states. In Georgia, Republican Senate nominee Herschel Walker is well known as a former football star, but he could also benefit from voters pulling the lever for Gov. Brian Kemp, who’s been running ahead of Democrat Stacey Abrams in a rematch from four years ago.\n\nRepublicans need to hold their own\n\nThe number of Senate seats Republicans need to pick up increases if they lose any of their own. Chief among those at risk is Pennsylvania, which has dominated CNN’s rankings of the 10 seats most likely to flip for the entire cycle. The presence of Biden, along with former Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump, in Pennsylvania on Saturday underscored just how important the commonwealth – which voted for all three presidents at different points – is as a 2022 (and 2024) battleground.\n\nAlong with Pennsylvania, the other Biden-won state where Republicans are on defense is Wisconsin. GOP Sen. Ron Johnson, who broke his term limits pledge to run for a third term, has long been the most vulnerable GOP incumbent running for reelection. It’s increasingly rare for states to back presidential and Senate candidates from different parties, but that race seems to have moved in Johnson’s favor since the summer as outside groups have attacked his Democratic challenger throughout the fall.\n\nRepublicans also need to hold North Carolina and Ohio – two states that have remained surprisingly competitive for Democrats in a national environment that favors the GOP. North Carolina is a purple state that Biden narrowly lost, so tight margins are to be expected here. Democrat Cheri Beasley, who could be the state’s first Black senator, has been running as an outsider by casting GOP Rep. Ted Budd as a creature of Washington.\n\nOhio is a different story. Although it has one Democratic senator, the state – which Trump twice carried by about 8 points – has been trending increasingly red. Republican J.D. Vance, who won a nasty primary with Trump’s backing, has struggled with fundraising – so much so that the most powerful Senate GOP super PAC had to divert resources from battleground states to shore up what has become an increasingly red state. Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan was able to dominate the airwaves early with spots that tout his bipartisan bona fides. His closing ad, for example, spotlights his 2016 vote against Nancy Pelosi for speaker.\n\nRyan’s fundraising advantage has also underscored a hard truth for Republicans this cycle – despite their millions of super PAC dollars, candidates who can’t raise money are still a problem. That’s because candidates get more favorable advertising rates than outside groups on TV.\n\nAnd yet, if the national environment is the most important factor Tuesday night – and well-funded Democratic incumbents in top-tier seats go down – Republicans could also be zeroing in on races such as Colorado and Washington state, which Biden carried by about 13 points and 19 points, respectively.", "authors": ["Simone Pathe"], "publish_date": "2022/11/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/13/politics/midterm-elections-what-to-know-house-senate-control/index.html", "title": "What to know about control of Congress and outstanding votes in ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe battle for control of the House is now the biggest unanswered question of this year’s midterm elections after Democrats kept their narrow Senate majority.\n\nVictories in Arizona and Nevada, according to CNN projections, mean the party will enter 2023 with at least 50 Senate seats – and could add one more if Sen. Raphael Warnock defeats Republican challenger Herschel Walker in a Georgia runoff next month.\n\nBut there are other key races for other offices that are still outstanding.\n\nWhich party reaches the 218 seats necessary for a House majority will hinge on races in states with a large share of mail-in ballots – including California, where identifying winners in some races could take weeks, Oregon and Arizona.\n\nAnother high-profile contest remains too close to call: The Arizona governor’s race – where Republican Kari Lake, the Donald Trump-supported election denier, is facing Democratic secretary of state Katie Hobbs, a defender of the state’s election process.\n\nA Democratic upset keeps House majority hopes alive\n\nThe political world’s eyes are now on the battle for control of the House, where Republicans appear to be slowly inching toward a narrow majority but Democrats’ hopes have not yet fully faded.\n\nRepublicans have won 211 of the 218 seats they’d need to take the majority, according to CNN projections, while Democrats have won 204, with 20 undecided as of Saturday evening.\n\nDemocrats scored a major coup in Washington’s Republican-leaning 3rd District, where on Saturday CNN projected that Democrat Marie Gluesenkamp Perez would defeat Republican Joe Kent, who had aligned himself closely with former President Donald Trump.\n\nHer victory came largely as a result of Trump’s efforts to punish Republicans who voted to impeach him. Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, a moderate who was widely viewed as a lock for reelection, did not finish in one of the top two slots in the primary and therefore didn’t advance to the general election.\n\nMany of the undecided races are in California, where counting mail-in ballots can take weeks and significant shifts can occur late in that process. Other states with large quantities of mail-in ballots, including Arizona and Oregon, also have undecided races.\n\nRegardless of the ultimate makeup of both chambers next year, Republicans’ lackluster midterm performance has prompted a backlash against House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy.\n\nSenate win also boosts Biden’s power\n\nIn retaining their Senate majority, Democrats defied the historical trend of midterm elections breaking against parties in power and overcame anxiety about high inflation. Instead, voters punished Republicans who had opposed abortion rights and parroted Trump’s lies about election fraud.\n\nThe outcome is a huge boost to President Joe Biden over the remaining two years of his first term in the White House. It means Democrats will have the ability to confirm Biden’s judicial nominees – avoiding scenarios such as the one former President Barack Obama faced in 2016, when then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refused to hold a vote on his Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland. It also means that Senate Democrats can reject bills passed by the House and can set their own agenda.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer took a victory lap late Saturday night, saying that voters had vindicated Democrats’ agenda.\n\nHe said the Democratic Senate candidates “beat some very flawed challengers who had no faith in democracy, no fidelity to truth or honor. And even when the polls looked bleak, our candidates never gave up and never lost faith.”\n\nHe also touted Democrats’ ability to block any GOP measures that would ban abortion rights in the wake of the Supreme Court’s June decision to reverse Roe v. Wade.\n\n“Because the American people turned out to elect Democrats in the Senate, there’s now a firewall against a nationwide abortion ban threat that so many Republicans have talked about,” he said.\n\nAnother Georgia Senate runoff\n\nSenate control already being settled will take some of the national spotlight – and the television advertising spending – away from the Senate runoff in Georgia.\n\nBut the December 6 race between Warnock and Walker is still important. A win would give Democrats a meaningful majority, rather than the power-sharing agreement currently in place with Vice President Kamala Harris serving as a tie-breaker in the 50-50 chamber. It would also give them a pad ahead of a 2024 Senate battle in which the party must defend several seats in states that typically back Republican presidential candidates.\n\n“It’s just simply better. The bigger the number the better,” Biden, who is in the midst of an international trip, told reporters in Cambodia shortly after CNN and other news outlets projected Democrats would keep their Senate majority.\n\nWarnock’s campaign had already launched a television advertisement laying out the stakes for the runoff.\n\n“It’s about who has the competence and character to represent us; who’s willing to tell the truth; who has the knowledge needed for the job,” a narrator says in the spot.\n\nIt’s the second straight election in which overtime in Georgia, which is triggered when no candidate tops 50% of the vote in the general election, will be necessary.\n\nIn 2021, Democrats swept two Georgia Senate runoffs – Jon Ossoff’s race against then-Sen. David Perdue and Raphael Warnock’s match-up with then-Sen. Kelly Loeffler. Loeffler had been appointed to the Senate in 2019 when former Sen. Johnny Isakson resigned for health reasons. Warnock defeated her in the special election for the remainder of Isakson’s term.\n\nNow, Warnock faces Walker, the former University of Georgia football star backed by Trump, in a race for a full six-year term.\n\nArizona governor among key races still undecided\n\nThe Arizona governor’s race between Lake, one of the most prominent election deniers on the ballot this year, and Hobbs, remains tight, with Hobbs clinging to a 34,000 vote lead as of late Saturday with an estimated 290,000 votes to be counted.\n\nIf she wins, Lake would be a rare Trump-supported election denier to win a competitive statewide race this year. Other Republicans who had parroted Trump’s falsehoods about widespread election frauds lost governor’s races in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and secretary of state races in Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, and more.\n\nIn an interview with CNN Saturday afternoon, Maricopa County Board of Supervisors Chairman Bill Gates said that about 190,000 votes remain to be counted in Maricopa County.\n\nHe said he was confident that about 95% to 99% of those votes will be recorded by Tuesday. He said the county will continue to report about 85,000 votes per night until they are done.\n\nIt’s perhaps the most closely watched race that’s too close to call. But several other key races are also undecided.\n\nIn Alaska, the state’s at-large House seat and one of its Senate seats will hinge on ranked-choice results. Democratic Rep. Mary Peltola, who won a special election this summer, is in a strong position to eclipse the 50% mark. But Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski faces a stiffer challenge from Republican Kelly Tshibaka, who is backed by Trump as part of his bid for retribution against Murkowski and others who for his impeachment after the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.\n\nAnd in Los Angeles, Rep. Karen Bass on Saturday widened her lead over developer Rick Caruso in the mayor’s race.\n\nElection officials push back on disinformation\n\nOfficials in Arizona and Nevada continued to push back on election misinformation about the vote counting that was spread online by right-wing activists and by Trump on his Truth Social platform. Trump baselessly posted on Truth Social Friday night that Clark County, which is the most populous in Nevada, was “finding all sorts of ballots in Clark County” and “pulling out all stops to steal the Election from Adam Laxalt.”\n\nClark County Registrar of Voters Joe Gloria refuted Trump’s claim during a news conference on Saturday. In Nevada, ballots postmarked on Election Day could be counted as long as they arrived by Saturday.\n\n“We’re taking ballots in that we’re required to take in according to the law, there’s no way that we can find ballots,” Gloria said. “They’re brought here by the United States Postal Service. As long as it’s postmarked [by Election Day], we process those ballots and put them in the count.”\n\nLaxalt struck a different tone than Trump Saturday. Shortly before the Saturday evening ballot drop from Clark County, Laxalt was leading Cortez Masto by a mere 862 votes.\n\nStill, Laxalt acknowledged in a tweet Saturday morning that the mail-in ballots that had arrived over the past couple of days continued to break in higher Democratic margins than his team had calculated. “This has narrowed our victory window,” he tweeted. He said the race was coming down to the more than 20,000 Election Day Clark County drop-off ballots. “If they are GOP precincts or slightly DEM leaning then we can still win. If they continue to trend heavy DEM then she will overtake us.”\n\nUnderscoring the closeness of the race, Laxalt put out a series of tweets Saturday evening encouraging voters to “cure” their ballots to ensure that any ballots with technical errors with signature or other issues could be fixed to ensure they are counted. The deadline to cure ballots is 5 p.m. on Monday.\n\nIn Arizona, where CNN has projected that Sen. Mark Kelly will win reelection, GOP Senate nominee Blake Masters took a different approach – tweeting Saturday that all the votes should be counted before anyone predicts the outcome (even though Kelly continued to lead him by a significant margin).\n\n“For my people who knocked doors in 115 degree heat, and for the million+ Arizonans who put their faith in me, we are going to make sure that every legal vote is counted,” Masters tweeted. “If, at the end, Senator Kelly has more of them than I do, then I will congratulate him on a hard-fought victory. But voters decide, not the media; let’s count the votes.”\n\nMaricopa County Election officials pushed back on Masters’ earlier contention – one that Lake had also made – that the vote counting in Arizona was moving too slowly in Arizona’s most populous county.\n\n“It’s really, really unfortunate that some candidates, some activists are deciding to spread this misinformation,” Gates told CNN’s Jim Acosta. “We have spent weeks at Maricopa County, getting that word out that people should not anticipate results on election night or even the next day. That it does take this long.”\n\nGates added that candidates and activists who were stating that the count was taking too long have not been “paying attention to the history of how we have counted votes here in Arizona for decades now. The average time over the last couple of decades to get through our count is 10 to 12 days.”", "authors": ["Eric Bradner Maeve Reston", "Eric Bradner", "Maeve Reston"], "publish_date": "2022/11/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/14/politics/takeaways-midterm-election-analysis/index.html", "title": "Takeaways from a grim weekend for Republicans in the election that ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIt was a disappointing weekend for Republicans and ex-President Donald Trump as Democrats kept the Senate for two more years after holding off a red wave in the House, which remains uncalled six days after the election.\n\nThe weekend marked a moment of vindication for President Joe Biden, whose party defied history by staving off a midterm election drubbing, and a moment of truth for some Republicans who had tethered themselves to Trump’s election fraud lies.\n\nAnd even with the GOP appearing to slowly march toward House control – promising to make Biden’s life deeply uncomfortable for the rest of his term with investigations into his administration and even his son, Hunter – the probable Republican majority will be smaller, and therefore more fractious, with the most radical lawmakers having more leverage.\n\nAs Trump presses on with a campaign launch set for Tuesday, the GOP’s loss of the Senate and competitive races nationwide raised new questions about his chances of winning back the White House. Meanwhile, the defeat of several high-profile election deniers boosted Biden’s global campaign for democracy – a central part of his 2022 campaign message – as he heads into talks with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Cambodia and prepares for a possible rematch with his predecessor.\n\nDemocrats hold onto the Senate\n\nPolitical parties are pointless unless they win power. So it’s obvious why Democrats are celebrating the come-from-behind victory of Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto in Nevada Saturday night that handed them their 50th seat and control of the Senate.\n\nThey wouldn’t have held on at this point, though, without John Fetterman’s win last week in Pennsylvania, where Democrats picked up a GOP-held seat. Had Republicans held that seat, Senate control would have come down to the Georgia runoff in December, which, while still massively important for shaping the balance of power, will matter less than the 2021 runoffs that handed Democrats the Senate in the last election.\n\nSenate control is huge for multiple reasons, not least because by pulling it off in deeply unpromising political conditions, Democrats cemented the most stunning showing for an incumbent president’s party in a first-term midterm election since George W. Bush in 2002.\n\n“I think one thing that pundits and prognosticators missed was that in all the incendiary ads that blanketed the airwaves for weeks, people knew the Democrats were getting things done for them,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters on Saturday night after CNN and other media outlets projected the Nevada race.\n\nThe failure to pick up Nevada and Senate control is already having reverberations inside the Senate GOP, with calls from Florida Sen. Rick Scott, the chair of Senate Republicans campaign arm, and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham to delay Wednesday’s leadership elections until after the Georgia runoff. Scott said he’d been approached by “a lot of people” about standing against Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, with whom he’d had significant messaging disagreements during the midterms. Still, it likely won’t be lost on many lawmakers that the party fell short on Scott’s watch.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'Very good news' for Biden: CNN projects Democrats will keep control of Senate 03:05 - Source: CNN\n\nMore importantly, the Democrats’ continued hold on power gives Biden two more years to remake the judiciary and to counter the influx of conservative judges confirmed during Trump’s presidency. In the event that a vacancy arose on the Supreme Court, a Democratic-led Senate would have a good chance of installing a new justice to start to weaken the current conservative majority.\n\nThe failure of Republicans to capture control means that the White House will be spared a relentless onslaught of Senate investigations and subpoenas to match those likely to be pouring out of the House if, as expected, the GOP finally clinches a majority in that chamber. This represents a significant personal and political benefit for Biden.\n\nAnd while a Republican House would mean few legislative wins for the president, Schumer will be able to protect his senators from tough votes that could hurt them in reelection campaigns in 2024, when they’ll be defending seats in tough states like Montana, Ohio, Nevada and Arizona.\n\nThe unexpectedly strong Democratic performance, which will leave both chambers essentially split down the middle, means that the 2024 presidential election is even more critical. A popular candidate on either side could have strong coattails and sweep their party into a monopoly in power in Washington.\n\nWhy Georgia still matters for Democrats\n\nThe final numbers in the Senate will not be known until the runoff in Georgia on December 6 between Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican nominee Herschel Walker. If Warnock, who’s running for a full six-year term, hangs on, Democrats will have a 51-49 majority.\n\nA two-seat margin is clearly better for Democrats than having to rely on the tie-breaking vote wielded by Vice President Kamala Harris. It also gives them a small cushion if one of their members becomes sick or incapacitated and lessens the chance they will lose their majority at some point in the new Congress.\n\nA 51-49 margin would also be a Joe Manchin-proof majority, meaning that the West Virginia moderate Democratic senator might not enjoy the veto he has held the past two years over Schumer’s intentions. If Manchin decides to run for reelection in 2024 in a state where Trump won big twice, he’s likely to become an even tougher vote for Democratic leadership. Earlier this month, for instance, the coal state senator lashed out at the president over his climate change policies.\n\nAnd a clear majority for Democrats means that Schumer would not need a deal with McConnell on parceling out committee assignments and would have far more control over the process – a fact former veteran senator Biden noted in reacting to the Senate win in Phnom Penh over the weekend.\n\nThe Republicans still haven’t taken the House\n\nIn a moment of bravado late on Election Night, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy assured activists who put a victory party on hold, “When you wake up, we’ll be in the majority.” Six embarrassing days later, he’s still waiting. Final results now hinge on races in California, Arizona and Oregon that may not be finalized for days, underscoring the disappointing GOP performance. Republicans currently have 212 House seats and Democrats have 204. A total of 218 is needed for a majority.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'More shocking things I've seen': Enten on House race 02:44 - Source: CNN\n\nIt’s still most likely that the Republicans will control the House with a narrow majority. Democrats need an improbable near-perfect run through remaining seats to stay in power. But McCarthy’s predictions of a huge win backfired and are making his expected smooth path to the speakership rather rocky.\n\nHard-liners in the House Freedom Caucus are demanding large concessions – which could render his leadership toothless – in return for supporting him for the top job. Those more extreme lawmakers would also be able to leverage the thin majority in the GOP to weaponize the House in the service of Trump’s 2024 campaign. CNN reported Sunday that Arizona Rep. Andy Biggs is considering a challenge to McCarthy in the House leadership elections on Tuesday – a move that could ultimately weaken the current minority leader and expose anger over the GOP’s performance, even if his team insists he will have the votes to be speaker.\n\nWhile the pro-Trump radical right will seek to dominate the House GOP if the party does get a majority, Republicans did pick up some key Democratic-held House seats, with some of those incoming Republicans likely to be among the party’s most vulnerable members in 2024. How McCarthy will reconcile their needs with the Trump caucus, which is itching to impeach Biden, is unclear.\n\nWhile a battle is emerging over the Republican House leadership, the current limbo means an expected Democratic tussle to succeed Nancy Pelosi is frozen. The speaker said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday that she was making no decisions while the destiny of the House was undecided. After the brutal attack on her husband, the 82-year-old speaker said family and political considerations could weigh on her future. But she’s not tipping her hand.\n\n“I’m not asking anybody for everything. People are campaigning. And that’s a beautiful thing,” the California Democrat quixotically told CNN’s Dana Bash when asked whether she might feel motivated to stay on as leader. “I’m not asking anyone for anything. My members are asking me to consider doing that. But, again, let’s just get through the election.”\n\n‘Three strikes and you are out’\n\nTrump is being blamed by a broad group of Republican leaders and political analysts for saddling his party’s extreme, untested candidates with a failed message – an obsession with his 2020 election fraud falsehoods.\n\n“I think it’s basically the third election in a row that Donald Trump has cost us the race. And it’s like, three strikes, you’re out,” Maryland GOP Gov. Larry Hogan said on “State of the Union” on Sunday.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback GOP governor: 'Trump cost us the race' 02:05 - Source: CNN\n\nThe problem with Hogan’s analogy is that even when Trump has been down politically – after the 2018 blue wave in the House, his 2020 election loss and the 2021 Capitol insurrection – he’s never struck out with the fervent grassroots Republican base that set him on the way to the White House in 2016 and still adores him.\n\nTrump had expected to ride out of this weekend on a wave of Republican euphoria after a bumper election he’d hoped to claim as his doing and enlist it to power his campaign for the 2024 Republican presidential nod.\n\nYet some of Trump’s favored candidates, including Pennsylvania’s Mehmet Oz in the Senate race and Doug Mastriano in the gubernatorial race, lost. One of the most high-profile election deniers, Kari Lake, is still locked in a close contest with Democrat Katie Hobbs in Arizona’s governor’s race, which CNN has not yet projected.\n\nVoters might have been unhappy with the Democrats and Biden’s record on inflation. But they balked at handing power to Republican radicals in Trump’s election-denying and chaos-causing image.\n\nYet Trump, true to form, is powering ahead. His adviser Jason Miller confirmed on Steve Bannon’s podcast that the ex-president’s planned big announcement on Tuesday at Mar-a-Lago will be the launch of a new presidential campaign – even before the 2022 midterm election will be finalized. Trump’s recent rallies suggest he’s only doubling down on his election fraud lies, even though they were rebuffed by midterm voters.\n\nOne new wrinkle now is that there may be alternatives to Trump in the GOP. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, for instance, showed he knows how to build a strong majority with his thumping reelection victory. In 2021, Virginia’s Glenn Youngkin won the governorship in a state that Biden took by 10 points the year before.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, hasn’t won an election since 2016. Logically, and as Republicans try to woo a national electorate in 2024, there are better choices than Trump. But the former president retains an emotional hold over the party grassroots that will decide the nominee. And Tuesday’s launch, and the immediate aftermath, will offer early clues over whether the staggering resilience to scandals that would have doomed ordinary political careers is beginning to fade.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/11/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/07/politics/election-eve-campaigning/index.html", "title": "Frenetic last day on the trail as Republicans target big midterm ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nRepublicans are increasingly bullish on winning big in Tuesday’s midterm elections, as they slam Democrats over raging inflation and crime while President Joe Biden seeks a late reprieve by warning that GOP election deniers could destroy democracy.\n\nThe GOP has considerable momentum in its bid to win back the House of Representatives while the destiny of the Democratic-run Senate will come down to a handful of knife-edge races. A Republican triumph in either chamber would severely curtail Biden’s domestic presidency and set up an acrimonious two years of political standoffs ahead of the 2024 White House race.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with CNN, the potential next Republican House speaker, Kevin McCarthy, laid out his plans for power and vowed to tackle inflation, border security and rising crime. He promised broad investigations against the Biden administration on the Afghanistan withdrawal, the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic and how the administration has dealt with parents and school board meetings. And he didn’t rule out an eventual push to impeach Biden.\n\n“The first thing you’ll see is a bill to control the border first,” McCarthy told CNN’s Melanie Zanona.\n\nIn a sign of the critical stakes and the growing angst among Democrats, four presidents – Biden, Donald Trump, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton – all took to the campaign trail over the weekend.\n\nEx-President Trump, edging ever closer to announcing a 2024 White House bid, will wrap up a campaign he used to show his enduring magnetism among grassroots Republicans, in Ohio, with a rally for Senate nominee J.D. Vance on Monday. In a speech that concluded in pouring rain for Florida Sen. Marco Rubio on Sunday, Trump predicted voters would “elect an incredible slate of true MAGA warriors to Congress.”\n\nBiden, who spent Saturday getting out the vote in the critical Pennsylvania Senate race with Obama, warned that the nation’s core values are in peril from Republicans who denied the truth about the US Capitol insurrection and following the brutal attack on Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband Paul.\n\n“Democracy is literally on the ballot. This is a defining moment for the nation. And we all must speak with one voice regardless of our party. There’s no place in America for political violence,” Biden said.\n\nThe president will end his effort to stave off a rebuke from voters at a Democratic event in Maryland. The fact that he will be in a liberal bastion and not trying to boost an endangered lawmaker in a key race on the final night reflects his compromised standing in an election that has reverted to a referendum on his tattered credibility and low approval ratings.\n\nDemocrats are playing defense in blue-state strongholds like New York, Washington and Oregon and are waging a longshot struggle to cling to the House of Representatives. Republicans only need a net gain of five seats to win back control. A handful of swing state showdowns will decide the destiny of the Senate, currently split 50-50, including in Arizona, Nevada, Georgia and Pennsylvania. Republicans are also showing renewed interest in the race in New Hampshire between Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan and retired Army Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc, a pro-Trump candidate Democrats brand as an election-denying extremist.\n\nRepublican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel predicted on CNN’s “State of the Union” that her party would win both the House and the Senate and accused Biden of being oblivious to the economic anxiety among Americans with his repeated warnings about democracy.\n\n“Here’s where the Democrats are: they’re inflation deniers, they are crime deniers, they’re education deniers,” McDaniel said.\n\nFlorida Sen. Rick Scott, who heads the GOP Senate campaign committee, predicted his party would surge to a majority on Tuesday.\n\n“We’re going to get 52-plus,” he said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday referring to the tally of seats he was expecting to control.\n\nBut the president warned in a speech in Pittsburgh on Saturday night alongside Obama that Republican concern over the economy was a ruse and claimed that the GOP would cut Social Security and Medicare if they won majorities.\n\n“Look, they’re all about the wealthier getting wealthy. And the wealthier staying wealthy. The middle class gets stiffed. The poor get poorer under their policy,” Biden said.\n\nThe midterms are the first national vote since the chaos and violence triggered by Trump’s refusal to accept the result of the last presidential election and there are already fears that some Republican candidates may follow his example and try to defy the will of voters if they don’t win. Some, like Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, have already raised concerns about the integrity of the vote.\n\nIn another development on Sunday, a staffer at the headquarters of Kari Lake, the pro-Trump nominee in the Arizona gubernatorial contest, opened a letter containing suspicious white powder. Lake’s opponent, current Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, condemned the incident as “incredibly concerning.”\n\nFinal arguments\n\nOn a frenetic final weekend of campaigning, Biden and Obama tried to push Democratic nominee John Fetterman over the line in a Pennsylvania Senate race that represents the party’s best chance to pick up a GOP-held Senate seat. But Democrats are under fierce pressure in states like Arizona and Nevada that could flip the chamber to the GOP. Republicans need a net gain of just one seat to win the majority.\n\nThe first major clashes of the 2024 GOP nominating contest, meanwhile, broke out in Florida with Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis holding dueling rallies Sunday night. The ex-president, who is expected to launch a third White House bid within days, coined a new nickname Saturday for the man who could prove to be his toughest primary opponent: “Ron DeSanctimonious.”\n\nBut the Florida governor chose not to engage, turning his ire instead on Biden and calling his Democratic opponent, Charlie Crist, “a donkey” while taking credit for defying Washington officials and experts during the pandemic.\n\n“I was willing to stand out there and take the arrows so that you didn’t have to,” DeSantis said.\n\nAs he rallied for Rubio, who is seeking reelection, Trump didn’t repeat his mockery of DeSantis on Sunday but again teased the likelihood of a presidential run. In another sign the next presidential race is stirring, Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton, who has long eyed higher office, announced he would not join the Republican primary.\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton was also called into action on Saturday, stumping for New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul in Brooklyn. The Empire state should be safe territory for his party but Hochul’s closer-than-expected reelection race against Republican Rep. Lee Zeldin underscores the toughness of the national environment for Democrats.\n\n“I know the average election rally is just ‘whoop dee doo do vote for me,’ but your life is on the line. For young people in the audience, your life is on the line,” Clinton said.\n\nWith Americans struggling under the high cost of living, Democrats have failed to head off a referendum on Biden’s economic management and presidency with most polls predicting building Republican momentum that could deal the first-term president a classic midterm election rebuke.\n\nThere is growing second guessing over Democrats’ strategy and whether they are talking effectively about the issues voters care about most. Biden’s closing message on saving democracy from pro-Trump candidates might be an accurate reflection of fresh threats posed by the ex-president and his acolytes. But it does nothing to ease fears about the cost of groceries or a gallon of gas.\n\nBiden, however, has not managed to speak effectively and personally to Americans craving a return to normality after the pandemic or to get across that he fully understands the pain of rising prices in a 40-year-high inflation explosion that his White House once repeatedly branded “transitory.”\n\nIf Republicans win back the House, they can impose a vise on Biden’s legislative program and set up a series of perilous political showdowns on spending and raising the debt-ceiling. They are promising a relentless round of investigations and hearings into everything from the US withdrawal from Afghanistan and the surge in migrants across the southern border to Biden’s son, Hunter.\n\nA GOP majority would contain scores of candidates in Trump’s extreme image and would be weaponized to damage the president as much as possible ahead of a potential rematch with Trump in 2024.

That’s not surprising. The polls are aplenty, the personalities are numerous, and we have a pretty good idea of the races that will determine which party wins the majority.\n\nYet it’s the race for the US House that may be the more interesting one. Our CNN/SSRS poll last week had Democrats up by 3 points on the generic congressional ballot – within the margin of error and close to the recent average of polls, which has shown the parties about even. For reference, Republicans were ahead on the generic ballot at this point in the last two midterms when there was a Democratic president (in 2010 and 2014).\n\nIf the current tie on the generic ballot holds in the vote for the House, control of the chamber would be a toss-up. Indeed, a number of people, including me, have noted the possibility of House Democrats maintaining their majority.\n\nBut few nonpartisan analysts think that’s likely. Most acknowledge that Republicans are in a good position to take back the House this election.\n\nI’d make the argument, though, that we’re underselling the potential of a big Republican night. And the potential for a GOP blowout is where we begin our look at the week that was in politics.\n\nDon’t write off the chances of a ‘red wave’\n\nSix months ago, a massive GOP victory in the House seemed the most likely possibility. Republicans were doing better on the generic congressional ballot than at any point in history so far out from the election. Since then, a combination of events, including the US Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade, seemed to tip the scales toward Democrats.\n\nA look at some non-polling data and the fundamentals, however, suggests we shouldn’t lose sight of the possibility of Republicans achieving a large win next month.\n\nLet’s start with House race ratings. These are designations that places such as The Cook Political Report and Inside Elections give to individual district races based on a bevy of factors, including how those districts have voted in the past and internal polling data.\n\nI gathered all the final House rating data I could from Cook since 2000 – specifically, the number of races rated as either a “toss-up” or “leaning” toward one party right before the election. It turns out these ratings, in aggregate, have done an accurate job at telling the story of House elections.\n\nWhen one party has more races in these two designations, it tends to do poorly. Right now, there are 23 more Democratic-held seats than Republican ones in either the toss-up or leaning category, per Cook. Additionally, there are four Democratic seats that are rated as “likely” to flip to the GOP.\n\nTaking into account what has been a small, but fairly consistent, trend of Republicans slightly outperforming race ratings since 2000, this would translate into a GOP net gain of 26 seats next month. This would put Republicans at about 239 seats in total.\n\nEven without considering past Republican overperformance, the current race ratings would still translate to Republicans ending up with a net gain of 17 seats, for 230 overall.\n\nThis matches up with what Amy Walter, publisher of The Cook Political Report, noted in a recent analysis: One side tends to pick up the bulk of toss-up races. And that side has been the party not in the White House, in midterms going back to 2006.\n\nWhile it could be argued that Republicans getting to 230 House seats wouldn’t be a “wave” given their relatively high baseline heading into the election, 230 seats would be the same number Republicans ended up with after the historic 1994 midterm election, when they ended 50 years of uninterrupted Democratic control of the House.\n\nSpeaking of that 1994 election, President Joe Biden’s average approval rating (43%) going into this midterm is lower than Bill Clinton’s (45%) heading into the 1994 midterm. In fact, Biden’s approval is largely in line (at an average of 43%) with that of recent presidents.\n\nClinton, Barack Obama and Donald Trump all had average approval ratings of between 43% and 45% at this point in their first terms. Their parties all suffered net losses of between 40 and 63 seats in the House. The opposition party ended up with between 230 and 242 seats.\n\nThat’s what the race ratings suggest is the most likely range of House seats Republicans will hold after this election. (Of recent presidents, only George W. Bush had a higher average approval rating, at 62%. His party picked up House seats in 2002.)\n\nYes, other factors, most prominently the generic ballot, indicate that House Democrats are going to do better.\n\nBut as I pointed out last week, the generic ballot is far from a perfect predictor. If the generic ballot results hold through the election and House Republicans outperform it by as much as they did in 2020, they very likely will end up somewhere in the range of 230 to 242 House seats.\n\nElection models by FiveThirtyEight and Jack Kersting, which are based on a bevy of variables, give Republicans about a one-third chance of ending up with at least 230 seats. That’s still better than the chance either model gives Democrats of holding on to the House.\n\nWhy Biden went to Oregon\n\nSpeaking of Democrats being in trouble, one of the last places you’d expect them to be in trouble would be Oregon. It’s a state Biden won by 16 points in 2020.\n\nSo why was the President in the state on Friday and Saturday? It’s because it’s the rare deep-blue state where Republicans have a good chance of picking up the governorship, as well as a few US House seats.\n\nThe reasons why Christine Drazan could become the first Republican elected Oregon governor in 40 years are numerous.\n\nMost notably, Democrat-turned-independent Betsy Johnson appears to be siphoning votes from Democratic nominee Tina Kotek. While Johnson isn’t only taking from Kotek, her voters are more likely to identify as Democrats than Republicans.\n\nJohnson’s presence in the race means Drazan may only need 40% of the vote to win, not anywhere close to a majority.\n\nBut Oregon’s tight gubernatorial race isn’t only about Johnson. Kotek is looking to succeed Democratic Gov. Kate Brown, who is term-limited. Brown is one of the least popular governors in the nation, hurt by the rise in homelessness and the cost of living.\n\nKotek, herself, has been painted as too liberal.\n\nDrazan, on the other hand, has managed to escape one of the bigger charges levied against other Republicans running for blue-state governorships this year. She is firmly in the camp that believes Biden legitimately won the 2020 election.\n\nThat makes it harder to paint Drazan as too extreme.\n\nRepublicans are also looking for success down the ballot in Oregon. Election handicappers agree that the race in the 5th Congressional District is quite competitive. Biden would have won the seat by 9 points under the post-redistricting lines, but GOP chances rose significantly after Rep. Kurt Schrader was defeated by a more liberal challenger in the Democratic primary.\n\nAnalysts are more split on their views of Oregon’s 4th District and the newly created 6th District. But almost everyone agrees that the former is at least in play and the latter could easily be won by Republicans.\n\nIf Republicans, as expected, hold on to the rural 2nd District and win one of the three competitive districts, it would mark the first time they have held two House seats in Oregon in nearly 30 years. If they win two of these seats and the 2nd District, it would be the first time they’ve held at least half of Oregon’s House seats in nearly 50 years.\n\nThe bottom line: Republicans need to net just five seats nationally to win back the House majority, and more than half of those seats could be gained in Oregon.\n\nFor your brief encounters: Actually, people like their bosses\n\nMonday (the closest weekday to October 16) is Boss’s Day. I know the stereotype is for people to hate their bosses. They even made a pretty funny movie about it.\n\nThe data shows something a bit different, however. Gallup has polled people’s views toward their bosses since 1999, and most people actually give their bosses the A-OK.\n\nIn 2021, for example, 63% of Americans said they were completely satisfied with their current boss. That was tied (with 2020) for the highest percentage since 1999. It was significantly higher than the 47% who said they were completely satisfied in 1999.\n\nAdd in the Americans who were somewhat satisfied with their boss (25%), and nearly 90% of Americans were satisfied. Just 2% of Americans, meanwhile, were completely dissatisfied with their boss.\n\nFor the record, I like my bosses. (Yes, I am that much of a suck-up.)\n\nLeftover data\n\nSolar power use rises: The percentage of Americans who say they have installed solar power panels at home is up to 8%. That has doubled from 4% in 2016 and up from 6% in 2019, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nCovid-19 vaccination rates stabilize in nursing homes: A Kaiser Family Foundation analysis of government data shows that the percentage of nursing home residents and staff who have been vaccinated or received a booster has basically stayed the same for a number of months. About 87% of residents and 88% of staff have received the primary series, while 74% of residents and 51% of staff have received at least one booster.\n\nLayoffs in news drop: Only 11% of large newspapers experienced layoffs in 2021. Pew finds that’s down from 33% in 2020 and 24% in 2019. Among digital native outlets, 3% had layoffs in 2021. That’s down from 18% in 2020 and 11% in 2019.", "authors": ["Harry Enten"], "publish_date": "2022/10/16"}]}

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCape Canaveral, Florida CNN —\n\nThe historic Artemis I mission took flight in the early hours of Wednesday morning after months of anticipation. The milestone event kicked off a journey that will send an uncrewed spacecraft around the moon, paving the way for NASA to return astronauts to the lunar surface for the first time in half a century.\n\nThe Orion spacecraft’s spectacular first views of Earth were shared more than nine hours into the journey, with the vehicle about 57,000 miles away from our planet on its way to the moon.\n\nIt’s the first time since the final Apollo mission in 1972 that a spacecraft designed to carry humans to the moon has captured a view of Earth.\n\nThe Orion spacecraft shared its first view of Earth more than nine hours after launch Wednesday morning.

It emitted up to 9 million pounds (4.1 million kilograms) of thrust to haul itself off the launchpad in Florida and into the air, streaking vibrantly across the night sky.\n\nAtop the rocket was the Orion spacecraft, a gumdrop-shaped capsule that broke away from the rocket after reaching space. Orion is designed to carry humans, but its passengers for this test mission are of the inanimate variety, including some mannequins collecting vital data to help future live crews.\n\nThe SLS rocket expended millions of pounds of fuel before parts of the rocket began breaking away, and Orion was left to soar through orbit with just one large engine. That engine then set off two powerful burns to put the spacecraft on the correct trajectory toward the moon. Then, about two hours after liftoff, the rocket engine also fell away, leaving Orion to free-fly for the remainder of its journey.\n\nSpectators cheer as the Artemis I rocket lifts off from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, on Wednesday, November 16.

The burn sets Orion up for its lunar flyby and closest approach of the moon on November 21 before entering a distant retrograde orbit around the moon on November 25.\n\nOrion will come within about 60 miles (96 kilometers) of the lunar surface during its close flyby next week.\n\nThe spacecraft is outfitted with 16 cameras inside and outside to document its trip around the moon from different perspectives. One image shared Wednesday showed Commander Moonikin Campos, one of the Artemis mannequins riding in the capsule, decked out in a survival suit.\n\nCommander Moonikin Campos (left) can be seen sitting inside the Orion capsule. NASA\n\nOrion is expected to log roughly 1.3 million miles (2 million kilometers), taking a path that will lead it farther than any other spacecraft designed for human flight has traveled, according to NASA. After orbiting the moon, Orion will make its return trip, completing its journey in about 25.5 days. The capsule is then scheduled to splash down in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of San Diego on December 11, when recovery teams will be waiting nearby to haul it to safety.\n\nThroughout the mission, NASA engineers will be keeping a close eye on the spacecraft’s performance. The team will evaluate whether Orion performs as intended and will be ready to support its first crewed mission to lunar orbit, which is currently scheduled for 2024.\n\nThis mission also marks the debut flight of the SLS rocket as the most powerful ever to reach Earth’s orbit, boasting 15% more thrust than the Saturn V rocket that powered NASA’s 20th century moon landings.\n\nAnd this mission is just the first in what’s expected to be a long series of increasingly difficult Artemis missions as NASA works toward its goal of establishing a permanent outpost at the moon. Artemis II will follow a similar path as Artemis I but will have astronauts on board. Artemis III, slated for later this decade, is expected to land a woman and a person of color on the lunar surface for the first time.\n\nA long road to liftoff\n\nThe mission team encountered a number of setbacks in the lead-up to Wednesday morning’s launch, including technical issues with the mega moon rocket and two hurricanes that have rolled through the launch site.\n\nFueling the SLS rocket with superchilled liquid hydrogen proved to be one main issue that forced NASA to wave off earlier takeoff attempts, but on Tuesday, the tanks were filled despite leak issues that halted fueling hours before launch.\n\nRead more: The big numbers that make the Artemis I mission a monumental feat\n\nTo address that problem, NASA deployed what it calls a “red crew” — a group of personnel specially trained to make repairs while the rocket is loaded with propellant. They tightened some nuts and bolts to stop the fuel leaks.\n\n“The rocket, it’s alive, it’s creaking, its making venting noises — it’s pretty scary. So … my heart was pumping. My nerves were going but, yeah, we showed up today. When we walked up the stairs. We were ready to rock and roll,” red crew member Trent Annis said in an interview on NASA TV after launch.\n\nAs @NASA_Orion begins the #Artemis I mission to the Moon, the spacecraft captured these stunning views of our home planet. pic.twitter.com/Pzk3PDt7sd — NASA Artemis (@NASAArtemis) November 16, 2022\n\nOther NASA personnel at the launch site’s firing room, where agency officials make crucial decisions in the hours and moments before liftoff, celebrated a victory.\n\n“Well for once I might be speechless,” said Artemis I launch director Charlie Blackwell-Thompson, the first woman to hold such a role.\n\n“I have talked a lot about appreciating the moment that you’re in,” Blackwell-Thompson said in remarks to the engineers in the firing room. “And we have worked hard as a team. You guys have worked hard as a team to this moment. This is your moment.”\n\nBlackwell-Thompson then declared it was time for tie-cutting, a NASA tradition in which launch operators snip off the ends of their business ties. Blackwell-Thompson’s was cut by shuttle launch director Mike Leinbach, and she pledged to the others in the room, “I’ll stay all night if I have to. It’ll be my pleasure to cut ties.”\n\nSeveral astronauts were on-site for the launch, and NASA administrator Bill Nelson told reporters that he watched liftoff from a nearby rooftop with a few of the them.\n\n“There were a bunch there that would like to be on that rocket,” Nelson said.\n\nINTERACTIVE: Trace the path Artemis I will take around the moon and back", "authors": ["Jackie Wattles Ashley Strickland", "Jackie Wattles", "Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/11/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/19/world/artemis-1-launch-science-newsletter-wt-scn/index.html", "title": "Historic Artemis I mission is just beginning its lunar journey | CNN", "text": "A version of this story appeared in CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.

We’re going to play all nine innings here. We’re not ready to give up yet.”\n\nThe next opportunity to send the Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft on their journey is September 2, but whether or not another attempt is made that day depends on how testing goes.\n\nSarafin confirmed that “Friday is definitely in play” if the team can resolve the issue while the rocket sits on the pad within the next 48 to 72 hours.\n\nThe next launch window is September 2, opening at 12:48 p.m. ET and closing at 2:48 p.m. ET. The next window after that is September 5, opening at 5:12 p.m. ET and closing at 6:42 p.m. ET.\n\n“Launch controllers were continuing to evaluate why a bleed test to get the RS-25 engines on the bottom of the core stage to the proper temperature range for liftoff was not successful, and ran out of time in the two-hour launch window,” according to an update from NASA. “Engineers are continuing to gather additional data.”\n\nThe launch team knew that the bleed test was a risk because they weren’t able to include it in previous wet dress rehearsal tests simulating the launch, and Monday was the first time demonstrating that, Sarafin said.\n\nCurrently, the issue doesn’t suggest an engine problem, but rather an issue within the bleed system that is used to cool the engine, he said.\n\n“We need the engine to be at the cryogenically cool temperature such that when it starts, it’s not shocked with all the cold fuel that flows through it. So we needed a little extra time to assess that,” Sarafin said.\n\nThe team also saw an issue with the vent valve at the inner tank and the combination of issues convinced the team they needed more time, Sarafin said.\n\nIf a substantial fix is needed the team may require more time to address it and roll the rocket stack back into the Kennedy Space Center’s Vehicle Assembly Building, a process that takes 3 1/2 days.\n\nThe launch team still needs to troubleshoot the engine issue and will keep the rocket in its current configuration to gather data and assess what needs to be done. Both the Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft remain stable, according to NASA officials.\n\nPrior to the scrub, the countdown was extended into an unplanned hold as the launch team worked on a troubleshooting plan for one of the rocket’s four engines.\n\nThat’s because the launch team discovered an issue with an engine bleed in engine #3. Attempts to reconfigure it were unsuccessful.\n\nDuring engine bleeds, hydrogen is cycled through the engine to condition it for launch. Three of the four engines are performing as expected, but engine #3 experienced an issue.\n\n“There were also a series of weather issues throughout the launch window. We would have been a no-go for weather at the beginning of the window due to precipitation. Later on in the window, we would have been no-go for lightning within the launchpad area,” Sarafin said.\n\nPreviously, 80% favorable weather conditions had been forecast for the beginning of the window, which opened at 8:33 a.m. ET, but the weather changed as that time inched closer.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, who traveled to Kennedy Space Center in Florida with second gentleman Doug Emhoff to watch the launch, underscored the United States’ commitment to NASA’s Artemis program in comments made after the postponement.\n\n“While we hoped to see the launch of Artemis I today, the attempt provided valuable data as we test the most powerful rocket in history,” Harris said via Twitter. “Our commitment to the Artemis Program remains firm, and we will return to the moon.”\n\nThe 322-foot-tall (98-meter-tall) stack is sitting on Launchpad 39B at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\n\nNASA Administrator Bill Nelson addressed the scrub shortly after it was announced, stressing that Artemis I is a test flight.\n\n“We don’t launch until it’s right,” Nelson said. “They’ve got a problem with the gases going on the engine bleed on one engine. It’s just illustrative that this is a very complicated machine, a very complicated system, and all those things have to work. You don’t light the candle until it’s ready to go.”\n\nIt’s something Nelson has personal experience with. As an astronaut, he was on the 24th flight of the Space Shuttle. It was scrubbed four times on the pad and the fifth try resulted in a flawless mission.\n\n“Had we launched on any one of those scrubs, it wouldn’t have been a good day,” he said.\n\nSeveral issues cropped up after the rocket began fueling after midnight.\n\nOffshore storms with the potential for lightning prevented the team from beginning the fueling process, due to start at midnight, for about an hour.\n\nThe hold was lifted at 1:13 a.m. ET, and the tanking process began to load the rocket’s core stage with supercold liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen.\n\nThe team stopped filling the tank with liquid hydrogen twice due to an initial leak as well as a pressure spike, but tanking resumed for the core stage and began for the upper stage, or the interim cryogenic propulsion stage.\n\nThe team also discovered a line of frost on the inner stage flange. At first, engineers thought the frost may indicate the presence of a crack in the tank, but it turned out to be a crack in the external foam. The team shared that the issue had been resolved since the foam crack did not indicate a leak.\n\nEngineers also experienced an 11-minute delay in communications between the Orion spacecraft and ground systems. The issue could have impacted the beginning of terminal count, or the countdown that begins when 10 minutes remain on the clock before liftoff. The team was able to work through the issue, which was the result of a simple misconfiguration.\n\nIn addition to the visit by Harris, appearances by celebrities like Jack Black, Chris Evans and Keke Palmer and performances of “The Star-Spangled Banner” by Josh Groban and Herbie Hancock and “America the Beautiful” by The Philadelphia Orchestra and cellist Yo-Yo Ma were planned as part of the program.\n\nMission overview\n\nWhen Artemis I launches, Orion’s journey will last 42 days as it travels to the moon, loops around it and returns to Earth – traveling a total of 1.3 million miles (2.1 million kilometers). When it returns to Earth, the capsule will splash down in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of San Diego.\n\nWhile the passenger list doesn’t include any humans, it does have passengers: three mannequins and a plush Snoopy toy will ride in Orion.\n\nThe crew aboard Artemis I may sound a little unusual, but they each serve a purpose. Snoopy will serve as the zero gravity indicator – meaning that he will begin to float inside the capsule once it reaches the space environment.\n\nThe mannequins, named Commander Moonkin Campos, Helga and Zohar, will measure deep space radiation future crews could experience and test a new suit and shielding technology. A biology experiment carrying seeds, algae, fungi and yeast is tucked inside Orion to measure how life reacts to this radiation as well.\n\nCameras inside and outside of Orion will share images and video throughout the mission, including live views from the Callisto experiment, which will capture a stream of Commander Moonikin Campos sitting in the commander’s seat. If you have an Amazon Alexa-enabled device, you can ask it about the mission’s location each day.\n\nExpect to see views of Earthrise, similar to what was shared during Apollo 8 for the first time, but with much better cameras and technology.\n\nScience experiments and technology demonstrations are riding in a ring on the rocket. The 10 small satellites, called CubeSats, will detach and go their separate ways to collect information on the moon and the deep space environment.\n\nThe inaugural mission of the Artemis program will kick off a phase of space exploration that lands diverse astronaut crews at previously unexplored regions of the moon and eventually delivers crewed missions to Mars.\n\nThe rocket and spacecraft will be tested and put through their paces for the very first time before they carry astronauts to the moon on Artemis II and Artemis III, slated for 2024 and 2025 respectively.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/08/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/16/world/gallery/artemis-nasa-moon-mission/index.html", "title": "Photos: NASA's historic Artemis I mission | CNN", "text": "NASA's Orion spacecraft used its optical navigation camera to snap this black-and-white photo of the moon on day six of the Artemis I mission.\n\nNASA's Artemis I mission, the agency's next step in preparing to return humans to the lunar surface, lifted off early November 16.\n\nThe launch schedule had been riddled with delays, having been postponed twice due to mechanical issues.

Space correspondents Kristin Fisher and Rachel Crane will bring us moment by moment reporting from the launch along with a team of experts.\n\nCNN —\n\nFor the first time in 50 years, a spacecraft is preparing to launch on a journey to the moon.\n\nThe uncrewed Artemis I mission, including the Space Launch System Rocket and Orion spacecraft, is targeting liftoff on August 29 between 8:33 a.m. ET and 10:33 a.m. ET from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\n\nAlthough there is no human crew aboard the mission, it’s the first step of the Artemis program, which aims to return humans to the moon and eventually land them on Mars\n\nThe weather is looking good for launch. For the beginning of the Monday launch period, the chances of favorable weather have gone up to 80%, according to the 6:45am ET Sunday US Space Force forecast. However, closer to the end of the launch period the chances decrease to 60% as the chance for scattered showers and storms increases.\n\nThe welcome news was announced Sunday, one day after the mega moon rocket experienced multiple lightning strikes while sitting at the launchpad at Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Saturday.\n\nTeams worked overnight to assess the potential impacts of the five events recorded by the lightning protection system towers at Launchpad 39B during a thunderstorm Saturday afternoon.\n\nAfter determining that the strikes were likely low magnitude, the team decided that no significant retests were needed and “everything looks really good,” said Jeff Spaulding, Artemis I senior NASA test director.\n\nIf the rocket is unable to launch Monday, the next possible launch would be Friday, September 2 at 12:48pm ET.\n\nAlthough there is no human crew aboard the mission, it’s the first step of the Artemis program, which aims to return humans to the moon and eventually land them on Mars.\n\nThe Orion spacecraft will enter a distant retrograde orbit of the moon and travel 40,000 miles beyond it, going further than any spacecraft intended to carry humans. Crews will ride aboard Artemis II on a similar trajectory in 2024, and the first woman and the next man to land on the moon are slated to arrive at the lunar south pole in late 2025 on the Artemis III mission.\n\nThe agency will share live views and coverage in English and Spanish before, during and after the Artemis I launch on its website and on NASA TV. The broadcast will begin at 12 a.m. ET as supercold propellant is loaded into the SLS rocket.\n\nAppearances by celebrities like Jack Black, Chris Evans and Keke Palmer and performances of “The Star-Spangled Banner” by Josh Groban and Herbie Hancock and “America the Beautiful” by The Philadelphia Orchestra and cellist Yo-Yo Ma are also part of the program.\n\nOnce the launch has occurred, NASA will conduct a post-launch briefing, and later in the day, the agency will share the first Earth views from cameras aboard the Orion spacecraft.\n\nOrion’s journey will last 42 days as it travels to the moon, loops around it and returns to Earth – traveling a total of 1.3 million miles (2.1 million kilometers). The capsule will splash down in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of San Diego on October 10.\n\nCameras inside and outside of Orion will share images and video throughout the mission, including live views from the Callisto experiment, which will capture a stream of a mannequin called Commander Moonikin Campos sitting in the commander’s seat. If you have an Amazon Alexa-enabled device, you can ask it about the mission’s location each day.\n\nHere’s everything you can expect before, during and after the launch.\n\nCounting down to launch\n\nThe official launch countdown will begin on August 27 at 10:23 a.m. ET.\n\nThe call to stations will occur Saturday morning at Kennedy Space Center, as well as for teams offering support from various centers across the country. This is when all of the teams associated with the mission arrive at their consoles and report they’re ready, kicking off a two-day countdown.\n\nOver the weekend, engineers will power up the Orion spacecraft, the interim cryogenic propulsion stage (the upper part of the rocket) and core stage, charge batteries and conduct a final preparation for the engines.\n\nLate Sunday night into early Monday morning, the launch team will conduct a briefing to discuss weather conditions and decide if they are “go” or “no go” to begin fueling the rocket.\n\nIf everything looks good, the team will begin fueling the rocket’s core stage eight hours before launch. Five hours before, the upper stage will begin fueling. Afterward, the team will top off and replenish any of the liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen that dissipates during the fueling process.\n\nAbout 50 minutes before launch, the final NASA test director briefing will occur. A planned 30-minute countdown hold will start about 40 minutes before launch.\n\nThe launch director will poll the team to make sure that every station is “go” 15 minutes ahead of liftoff.\n\nAt 10 minutes and counting, things kick into high gear as the spacecraft and rocket go through the final steps. Much of the action takes place in the final minute, as the ground launch sequencer sends the command for the rocket flight computer’s automated launching sequencer to take over about 30 seconds prior to launch.\n\nIn the last few seconds, hydrogen will burn off, the four RS-25 engines will start, resulting in booster ignition and liftoff at T minus zero.\n\nJourney to the moon\n\nAfter liftoff, the solid rocket boosters will separate from the spacecraft about two minutes into the flight and splash down in the Atlantic Ocean, with other components also jettisoning shortly after. The core stage of the rocket will separate about eight minutes later and fall toward the Pacific Ocean, allowing for Orion’s solar array wings to deploy.\n\nThe perigree raise maneuver will occur about 12 minutes after launch, when the ICPS experiences a burn to raise Orion’s altitude so it doesn’t reenter the Earth’s atmosphere. Shortly after that is the trans-lunar Injection burn, when the ICPS boosts Orion’s speed from 17,500 miles per hour (28,163 kilometers per hour) to 22,600 miles per hour (36,371 kilometers per hour) to escape the pull of Earth’s gravity and set off for the moon.\n\nAfter this burn, the ICPS will separate from Orion.\n\nAround 4:30 p.m., Orion will make its first outbound trajectory correction burn using the European Service Module, which provides the spacecraft with power, propulsion and thermal control. This maneuver will put Orion on a path to the moon.\n\nThe next few days after launch, Orion will venture out to the moon, coming within 60 miles (96 kilometers) during its closest approach of the lunar surface on day six of the journey – or September 3 if the launch occurs as planned on August 29. The service module will place Orion in a distant retrograde orbit around the moon on day 10, or September 7.\n\nOrion will surpass the distance record of 248,654 miles (400,169 kilometers) – set by Apollo 13 in 1970 – on September 8 when it loops around the moon. The spacecraft will achieve its maximum distance from Earth of 280,000 miles (450,616 kilometers) on September 23 when it ventures 40,000 miles (64,373 kilometers) beyond the moon.\n\nREAD MORE: Artemis I by the numbers\n\nThis is 30,000 miles (48,280 kilometers) farther than Apollo 13’s record.\n\nOrion will make its second-closest approach of the lunar surface, coming within 500 miles (804 kilometers), on October 3. The service module will experience a burn that enables the moon’s gravity to slingshot Orion back on its way to Earth.\n\nJust before reentering Earth’s atmosphere, the service module will separate from Orion. The spacecraft will hit the top of Earth’s atmosphere moving at about 25,000 miles per hour (40,233 kilometers per hour), and its heat shield will experience temperatures of nearly 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit (2,760 degrees Celsius).\n\nThe atmosphere will slow Orion down to about 300 miles per hour (482 kilometers per hour), and a series of parachutes will slow it down to less than 20 miles per hour (32 kilometers per hour) before it splashes down in the Pacific Ocean at 11:53 a.m.\n\nSplashdown will stream live from NASA’s website, collecting views from the 17 cameras aboard the recovery ship and helicopters that will be waiting for Orion’s return.\n\nThe landing and recovery team will collect the Orion capsule, and the data collected by the spacecraft will determine what lessons have been learned before humans return to the moon.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/08/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/28/world/artemis-1-moon-rocket-mars-scn/index.html", "title": "Artemis 1: Why NASA wants to return to the moon before sending ...", "text": "Turn to CNN for live coverage from Kennedy Space Center in Florida this week. Space correspondent Kristin Fisher will bring us moment-by-moment reporting from the launch, along with a team of experts.\n\nKennedy Space Center, Florida CNN —\n\nBefore landing the first humans on Mars, NASA wants to return to the lunar surface – but in a way that we’ve never explored the moon before.\n\nWhen the uncrewed Artemis I mission launches on Wednesday, it’s just the first step toward the future of space exploration.\n\nThe last crewed landing on the moon, Apollo 17, was nearly 50 years ago. The final Apollo mission’s record for the longest crewed deep space flight still stands: 12.5 days.\n\nThrough the Artemis program, which aims to land humans at the unexplored lunar south pole and eventually on Mars, astronauts will go on long-duration deep space missions that test all of the bounds of exploration.\n\n“We’re going back to the moon in order to learn to live, to work, to survive,” said NASA administrator Bill Nelson during a news conference earlier this month.\n\n“How do you keep humans alive in those hostile conditions? And we’re going to learn how to use the resources on the moon in order to be able to build things in the future as we go – not a quarter of a million miles away, not a three-day journey – but millions and millions of miles away on a months and months if not years-long journey.”\n\nNew posters from NASA depict different stages of the Artemis I journey. NASA\n\nNASA astronaut Randy Bresnik discussed the importance of using lunar exploration as a way to prepare for landing on Mars.\n\nWhen camping in the Alaskan wilderness, you wouldn’t just rely on new gear and shoes that haven’t been broken in yet, he said. Mars isn’t the place to test out new gear for the first time, either.\n\n“We’re gonna go to some local places a little closer first,” Bresnik said. “Then you can come back home if your if your shoelaces break or something like that.”\n\nAstronauts have lived and worked aboard the International Space Station, which circles about 254 miles above the planet in low-Earth orbit, for more than 20 years. Their experiences, which can last between six months to nearly a year, have revealed how the microgravity environment affects the human body.\n\n“Every day that I personally spent on the space station, I looked at it as walking on Mars,” said NASA astronaut Reid Wiseman, Chief of the Astronaut Office at Johnson Space Center in Houston. “That is why we’re up there. We’re trying to make life better on Earth and we’re trying to expand humanity into our solar system.”\n\nREAD MORE: Artemis I by the numbers\n\nOn Artemis II, scheduled for 2024, astronauts will follow a similar path as Artemis I – circling the moon at a wider distance than any of the Apollo missions. Artemis III, slated for late 2025, will land the first woman and the next man at the moon’s south pole, where permanently shadowed regions may harbor ice and other resources that could sustain astronauts during long moonwalks.\n\n“Our moon serves as basically a celestial library right next door,” said Jacob Bleacher, NASA’s chief exploration scientist. “Lunar rocks and lunar ice basically serve as the books of this library. We can use them to begin to reveal how the solar system has evolved. This can really help us gain insight into what was happening here on Earth when life was establishing a foothold in the solar system.”\n\nThe Artemis program involves establishing a sustained human presence on the moon and putting an orbiting lunar outpost called the Gateway in place.\n\nThis illustration shows SpaceX's Starship human lander design that will carry the first NASA astronauts to the surface of the moon through the Artemis program. NASA\n\n“We want to stay on the lunar surface and learn on the lunar surface so that we can get the most science and know how we’re going to go to Mars,” said Jim Free, associate administrator for NASA’s Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate. “On Apollo, we did incredible science at the equator. This time, we’re going to the South Pole.”\n\nOver time, the SLS rocket will evolve, Nelson said. By the time the Artemis IV mission rolls to the launchpad later this decade to dock with the Gateway, the rocket will be taller and even more powerful than the version used for Artemis I.\n\nArtemis I is a test mission, Nelson stressed. It serves as the inaugural flight of the Space Launch System Rocket, the Orion spacecraft and its heat shield, as well as protective gear for future astronauts and measuring radiation exposure.\n\nA series of science experiments and technology demonstrations inside Orion and flying outside of it on small satellites called CubeSats, will gather additional data about the space environment future Artemis astronauts will face.\n\nThe lessons learned from Artemis I, which will be collected when it splashes down in October, could inform the next steps of the Artemis program.\n\nCurrently, the first five Artemis missions have been planned, and NASA is working on laying out the details for missions six through ten, Free said.\n\nTeams at NASA are “going through the broad exploration objectives and then narrowing down to an architecture which takes us out to Mars,” Free said. “We’re looking at rolling through that architecture, decisions and process in the early part of next year.”\n\nThe goal of landing humans on Mars by 2033 was set by the Obama Administration, and NASA administrators have upheld the goal ever since.\n\n“With the Artemis I launch, NASA is at a historic inflection point, poised to begin the most significant series of science and human exploration missions over a generation,” said Bhavya Lal, NASA associate administrator for technology, policy, and strategy.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/08/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/27/world/nasa-artemis-launch-science-newsletter-wt-scn/index.html", "title": "Artemis I prepares to launch on a historic lunar journey | CNN", "text": "A version of this story appeared in CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.

This mission will kick off NASA’s Artemis program, which aims to return humans to the moon and land the first woman and first person of color on the lunar surface by 2025.\n\nThe launch window will open at 8:33 a.m. ET on August 29 and stay open for two hours. If Artemis I launches then, the mission would last for 42 days and return to Earth on October 10.\n\nThe September 2 launch window opens at 12:48 p.m. ET and lasts for two hours and would result in an October 11 return, and the September 5 window opens at 5:12 p.m. ET and lasts for 90 minutes, resulting in a return on October 17.\n\nThe Artemis team arrived at these dates after successfully completing a crucial final test called the wet dress rehearsal for the Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft on June 20. The test simulated every stage of launch without the rocket leaving the launchpad at Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\n\nThe misssion team rolled the rocket back into the Vehicle Assembly Building on July 2 to assess issues that cropped up during the test, including a hydrogen leak.\n\nDuring repairs for the leak, engineers found a loose fitting on the inside wall of the rocket’s core engine section. The work of tightening the collet, a fist-size ring, is now complete, said Cliff Lanham, senior vehicle operations manager for NASA’s Exploration Ground Systems Program.\n\nAdditional testing and activation of systems continues while the rocket is in the building before it returns to the launchpad.\n\nThe launch dates could move and are “not an agency commitment,” Free said. “We’ll make the agency commitment after a flight readiness review just a little over a week before launch.” Weather and other factors could impact when the rocket launches.\n\n“We’re going to be careful,” Free said.\n\nThe Artemis I mission is a test flight with a number of objectives, including trying out how Orion’s heat shield holds up to the high speed and heat the spacecraft will encounter as it reenters Earth’s atmosphere after returning from the moon.\n\nIt will travel at about 24,500 miles per hour (39,429 kilometers per hour) and experience temperatures half as hot as the sun outside of the heat shield, according to Mike Sarafin, Artemis mission manager. This is much hotter and faster than when spacecraft return from low-Earth orbit.\n\nOther objectives include demonstrating operations and flight modes of the rocket and spacecraft ahead of crewed missions, retrieving Orion after it splashes down in the ocean, and completing the mission as planned, Sarafin said.\n\nThe team is prepared to adapt along the way to any challenges and some objectives may shift as a result, he said.\n\nThe Artemis team shared the update on the 53rd anniversary of the historic Apollo 11 moon landing.\n\n“Today’s anniversary is a good reminder of what a privilege it is to be a part of a mission like this,” Sarafin said. “It’s not just the Artemis I mission, but it’s a bigger picture of returning to the moon and preparing to go to Mars.”", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/07/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/03/world/nasa-artemis-1-saturday-launch-scn/index.html", "title": "Artemis I's next launch attempt may not happen until later this year ...", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nKennedy Space Center, Florida CNN —\n\nNASA will not pursue a launch of Artemis I for the remainder of the launch period, which ends on Tuesday, according to an update from the agency after a second scrubbed launch attempt Saturday.\n\nFuture launch periods, including those in September and October, depend on what the team decides early next week, but this results in a minimum of delays consisting of at least several weeks.\n\n“We will not be launching in this launch period,” said Jim Free, associate administrator for NASA’s Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate. “We are not where we wanted to be.”\n\nFree said the stack, including the Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft, has to roll back into the Vehicle Assembly Building, unless they get a waiver from the range, which is run by the US Space Force.\n\nNASA Administrator Bill Nelson reminded that the shuttle was sent back to the Vehicle Assembly Building 20 times before it launched – and noted that the cost of two scrubs is a lot less than a failure.\n\n“We do not launch until we think it’s right,” Nelson said. “These teams have labored over that and that is the conclusion they came to. I look at this as part of our space program, in which safety is the top of the list.”\n\nThe scrub was called at 11:17 a.m. ET, three hours before the beginning of the launch window.\n\nArtemis I had been slated to take off Saturday afternoon, but those plans were scrubbed after team members discovered a liquid hydrogen leak that they spent the better part of the morning trying to resolve. Liquid hydrogen is one of the propellants used in the rocket’s large core stage. The leak prevented the launch team from being able to fill the liquid hydrogen tank despite trying various troubleshooting procedures.\n\nPreviously, a small leak had been seen in this area, but it became a much larger leak on Saturday. The team believes an overpressurization event might have damaged the soft seal on the liquid hydrogen connection, but they will need to take a closer look.\n\n“This was not a manageable leak,” said Mike Sarafin, Artemis mission manager.\n\nIt’s the second time in a week that the space agency has been forced to halt the launch countdown in the face of technical issues. The first launch attempt, on Monday, was called off after several issues arose, including with a system meant to cool the rocket’s engines ahead of liftoff and various leaks that sprung up as the rocket was being fueled.\n\nThe liquid hydrogen leak was detected Saturday at 7:15 a.m. ET in the quick disconnect cavity that feeds the rocket with hydrogen in the engine section of the core stage. It was a different leak than one that occurred ahead of the scrubbed launch on Monday.\n\nThe launch controllers warmed up the line in an attempt to get a tight seal and the flow of liquid hydrogen resumed before a leak reoccurred. They stopped the flow of liquid hydrogen and proceeded to “close the valve used to fill and drain it, then increase pressure on a ground transfer line using helium to try to reseal it,” according to NASA.\n\nThat troubleshooting plan was not successful. The team attempted the first plan again to warm up the line, but the leak reoccurred after they manually restarted the flow of liquid hydrogen.\n\nThere was a 60% chance of favorable weather conditions for the launch, according to weather officer Melody Lovin.\n\nThe Artemis I stack, which includes the Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft, continues to sit on Launchpad 39B at Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida.\n\nThe Artemis I mission is just the beginning of a program that will aim to return humans to the moon and eventually land crewed missions on Mars. Nelson said that the issues during the first two scrubs have not caused any delays to future Artemis program missions.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Here's how NASA wants to send humans back to the moon 04:10 - Source: CNN Business\n\nIn the last few days, the launch team has taken time to address issues, like hydrogen leaks, that cropped up ahead of Monday’s planned launch before it was scrubbed. The team has also completed a risk assessment of an engine conditioning issue and a foam crack that also cropped up, according to NASA officials.\n\nBoth were considered to be acceptable risks heading into the launch countdown, according to Mike Sarafin, Artemis mission manager.\n\nOn Monday, a sensor on one of the rocket’s four RS-25 engines, identified as engine #3, reflected that the engine could not reach the proper temperature range required for the engine to start at liftoff.\n\nThe engines need to be thermally conditioned before super-cold propellant flows through them prior to liftoff. To prevent the engines from experiencing any temperature shocks, launch controllers gradually increase the pressure of the core stage liquid hydrogen tank in the hours before launch to send a small amount of liquid hydrogen to the engines. This is known as a “bleed.”\n\nThe team has since determined it was a bad sensor providing the reading – they plan to ignore the faulty sensor moving forward, according to John Blevins, Space Launch Systems chief engineer.\n\nMission overview\n\nOnce Artemis I launches, Orion’s journey will last 37 days as it travels to the moon, loops around it and returns to Earth – traveling a total of 1.3 million miles (2.1 million kilometers).\n\nWhile the passenger list doesn’t include any humans, it does have passengers: three mannequins and a plush Snoopy toy will ride in Orion.\n\nThe crew aboard Artemis I may sound a little unusual, but they each serve a purpose. Snoopy will serve as the zero gravity indicator – meaning that he will begin to float inside the capsule once it reaches the space environment.\n\nThe mannequins, named Commander Moonikin Campos, Helga and Zohar, will measure the deep space radiation future crews could experience and test out new suit and shielding technology. A biology experiment carrying seeds, algae, fungi and yeast is also tucked inside Orion to measure how life reacts to this radiation as well.\n\nAdditional science experiments and technology demonstrations are also riding in a ring on the rocket. From there, 10 small satellites, called CubeSats, will detach and go their separate ways to collect information on the moon and the deep space environment.\n\nCameras inside and outside of Orion will share images and video throughout the mission, including live views from the Callisto experiment, which will capture a stream of Commander Moonikin Campos sitting in the commander’s seat. And if you have an Amazon Alexa-enabled device, you can ask it about the mission’s location each day.\n\nExpect to see views of Earthrise similar to what was shared for the first time during the Apollo 8 mission back in 1968, but with much better cameras and technology.\n\nThe inaugural mission of the Artemis program will kick off a phase of NASA space exploration that intends to land diverse astronaut crews at previously unexplored regions of the moon – on the Artemis II and Artemis III missions, slated for 2024 and 2025 respectively – and eventually delivers crewed missions to Mars.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland Jackie Wattles", "Ashley Strickland", "Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/09/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/21/world/nasa-artemis-1-moon-flyby-scn/index.html", "title": "Artemis 1 mission: NASA's Orion spacecraft makes its closest ...", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.

The SLS rocket’s thrust exceeded that of the Saturn V rocket, which powered the 20th-century moon landings, by 15%.\n\nNASA's Orion spacecraft approaches its closest flyby of the moon during NASA's Artemis I mission. NASA/YouTube\n\nNow, Orion is on a 25-and-a-half day journey to circumnavigate the moon.\n\nMonday’s flyby of the lunar surface was the closest that the Orion capsule will be to the moon before it enters a “distant retrograde orbit,” meaning it will circle the moon in the opposite direction from which the moon travels around Earth.\n\nThe path is meant to “stress test” the Orion capsule, as Michael Sarafin, NASA’s Artemis mission manager, put it last week.\n\nAfter lapping the moon, the Orion capsule is expected to turn back toward Earth and make a gentle, splashdown landing in the Pacific Ocean on December 11.\n\nThe target landing site is just off the coast of San Diego, and NASA recovery ships will be waiting nearby to haul the spacecraft to safety, a practice run for future missions that include astronauts. And this time they’ll also be looking to recover some scientific instruments on board that have collected data to help NASA understand how astronauts might be affected by future flights.\n\nSarafin told reporters Friday that NASA has had to troubleshoot more than a dozen “funnies” with the Orion capsule, but, overall the spacecraft is performing “really well.”\n\nOne problem that cropped up was related to Orion’s star tracker, a system that uses a map of the cosmos to tell engineers on the ground how the spacecraft is oriented. Some data readings weren’t coming back as expected, but NASA officials chalked that up to a learning curve that comes with flying a new spacecraft.\n\n“We worked through that, and there was some great leadership by the Orion team,” Sarafin said.\n\n“We had an understanding of the system headed into the mission,” he added. “We had (predictions) — whether it was how much power would we consumed or how much propellant or how hot the vehicle would be — and we’re not exactly matching that. And in most cases it is performing better.\n\n“We’re seeing things that don’t quite match our predictions. And the team is spending the time to go through that with a fine-tooth comb to make sure that there isn’t something else there that is potentially a latent issue.”\n\nSarafin’s comments came before NASA made the final determination on Saturday to put the Orion spacecraft on a path to enter its distant retrograde orbit around the moon.", "authors": ["Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/11/21"}]}

Its end could now restore access to asylum for arriving migrants, allowing them to enter the US and make their case in immigration court.\n\nSullivan had found the Title 42 order to be “arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act.”\n\nPrior to Title 42, all migrants arrested at the border were processed under immigration law. Thousands of migrants sent back to Mexico have been waiting along the border in shelters. Officials have previously raised concerns about what the end of Title 42 may portend, given limited resources and a high number of people trying to enter the country.\n\nSullivan’s ruling also comes on the heels of the resignation of US Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Chris Magnus, who had been asked to resign by Alejandro Mayorkas last week. CBP Deputy Commissioner Troy Miller is now serving as the acting commissioner.\n\nCNN has reached out to the White House and Justice Department for comment.\n\nSullivan faulted the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which issued the public health order, for “its decision to ignore the harm that could be caused” by issuing the policy. He said the CDC also failed to consider alternative approaches, such as letting migrants self-quarantine in homes of US-based friends, family, or shelters. The agency, he said, should have reexamined its approach when vaccines and tests became widely available.\n\n“With regard to whether defendants could have ‘ramped up vaccinations, outdoor processing, and all other available public health measures,’… the court finds the CDC failed to articulate a satisfactory explanation for why such measures were not feasible,” Sullivan wrote.\n\nThe judge also concluded that the policy did not rationally serve its purpose, given that Covid-19 was already widespread throughout the United States when the policy was rolled out.\n\n“Title 42 was never about public health, and this ruling finally ends the charade of using Title 42 to bar desperate asylum seekers from even getting a hearing,” American Civil Liberties Union attorney Lee Gelernt, who argued the case, said in a statement.\n\nThe injunction request came from the ACLU, along with other immigrant advocacy groups, involves all demographics, including single adults and families. Unaccompanied children were already exempt from the order.\n\nThe ACLU does not oppose the Biden administration’s request for a stay of Tuesday’s ruling through December 21, the administration noted in their filing.\n\nIn a statement following the ruling, the Department of Homeland Security said that, if granted, “the delay in implementation of the court’s order will allow the government to prepare for an orderly transition to new policies at the border.”\n\nThe department added that it would continue to enforce immigration laws at the border, work with other countries to take action against smuggling networks and “address the root causes of irregular migration.”\n\nThe public health authority was invoked at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic and has been criticized by immigrant advocates, attorneys and health experts who argue it has no health basis and puts migrants in harm’s way.\n\nSullivan had previously blocked the Biden administration from expelling migrant families with children apprehended at the US-Mexico border.\n\nEarlier this year, in anticipation of lifting Title 42 and under pressure from lawmakers, the Department of Homeland Security released a 20-page plan to manage a potential increase of migrants at the border. A separate federal judge struck down the administration’s intent to end Title 42 at the time.\n\nThe CDC said at the time it’s no longer necessary given current public health conditions and the increased availability of vaccines and treatments for Covid-19.\n\nBut in May, a federal judge in Louisiana blocked the Biden administration from ending Title 42.\n\nSince that court order, the administration has continued to use Title 42 and most recently, expanding it to include Venezuelan migrants who have arrived at the US southern border in large numbers.\n\nIn October, there were more than 204,000 arrests along the US southern border and over 78,400 expulsions under Title 42, according to CBP data.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Priscilla Alvarez Tierney Sneed", "Priscilla Alvarez", "Tierney Sneed"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/16/politics/title-42-blocked-whats-next-explainer-cec/index.html", "title": "What is Title 42, and what happens now that a federal judge has ...", "text": "A version of this story was first published in April.\n\nCNN —\n\nA federal judge’s order blocking Title 42 raises many questions. But there’s no doubt the ruling has major implications for the Biden administration’s border strategy.\n\nUS District Judge Emmet Sullivan’s Tuesday decision requires officials to end a controversial Trump-era policy – something that officials predicted earlier this year would lead to a new influx of migrants trying to cross into the United States.\n\nThe Biden administration had criticized and vowed to end the use of Title 42 at the border, but more recently came to rely on the policy.\n\nBorder authorities used the public health restrictions to expel migrants nearly 2.5 million times in less than three years. And just last month officials announced they were expanding the policy.\n\nNow, after another ruling from the judge Wednesday, they have just over a month before they’ll have to end it.\n\nHere’s a look at some of the key questions and answers about Title 42’s history, the judge’s ruling, what’s happening on the ground and what could happen next.\n\nWhat is Title 42, and why are people talking about it again?\n\nIn the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a public health order that officials said aimed to stop the spread of Covid-19. The order allowed authorities to swiftly expel migrants at US land borders. The policy is widely known as Title 42, for the portion of US code that allowed the CDC director to issue it.\n\nThe border restrictions were controversial from the moment the Trump administration announced them. Immigrant rights advocates argued officials were using public health as a pretext to keep as many immigrants out of the country as possible. Public health experts also slammed the policy, saying it wasn’t justified by the circumstances.\n\nIn April, the policy became a political lightning rod and a topic of fierce debate as the Biden administration announced plans to end it. But ultimately, the policy remained in place after a federal judge in Louisiana blocked the administration’s plans to roll it back.\n\nAnd the national political conversation moved on to other targets. Immigration and border enforcement remained big points of contention, and a major theme that many Republicans emphasized in midterm election campaigns. But Title 42 was no longer the focus of debate.\n\nSullivan’s ruling places the issue front and center once again, and raises major questions about what will happen next at the border.\n\nWhat did the federal judge find, and what does it mean?\n\nSullivan, a federal judge in the District of Columbia, found the Title 42 order to be “arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act.” That act governs the process by which federal agencies develop and issue regulations.\n\nHe faulted the CDC for “its decision to ignore the harm that could be caused” by issuing the policy, and said the CDC had failed to consider alternative approaches. Sullivan also concluded that the policy did not rationally serve its purpose, given that Covid-19 was already widespread throughout the United States when it was rolled out.\n\nThe bottom line: Based on Sullivan’s ruling, the government can’t use the coronavirus pandemic as a justification to expel migrants anymore, and it never should have in the first place.\n\nImmigrants from Haiti, who crossed through a gap in the US-Mexico border barrier, wait to be processed by the U.S. Border Patrol on May 20, 2022, in Yuma, Arizona. Mario Tama/Getty Images\n\nDoes the administration have to comply?\n\nYes, and officials have indicated they will. But they asked the court for a five-week reprieve – a request the judge said he was granting Wednesday with “GREAT RELUCTANCE.”\n\nSullivan’s ruling striking down Title 42 will be on hold until December 21.\n\n“The delay in implementation of the court’s order will allow the government to prepare for an orderly transition to new policies at the border,” the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement.\n\nHow could this change what’s happening at the border?\n\nMigrants encountered under Title 42 are either expelled to their home countries or into Mexico. Under Title 42, authorities have expelled migrants at the US-Mexico border nearly 2.5 million times in less than three years, according to US Customs and Border Protection data. And the vast majority of those expulsions – more than 80% – have occurred under the Biden administration.\n\nBut migrants haven’t stopped trying to cross the US-Mexico border – a detail people on both sides of the debate have pointed to, with very different arguments about what it shows.\n\nThose who support Title 42 point to border arrests as they argue how essential the pandemic policy has been for blocking illegal immigration. Those who oppose the policy argue official statistics about encounters at the border inflate the severity of the situation, because the data include people crossing the border multiple times. They argue Title 42 has actually caused more border crossings.\n\nIf the order is lifted, the way migrants are processed at the border would go back to how it was before 2020. Under that system, migrants are either removed from the country, detained or released into the US while their cases make their way through immigration court.\n\nOfficials earlier this year said they expected lifting Title 42 would prompt a new influx of migrants trying to cross into the United States. At the time, they said they were preparing for different outcomes, including a worst-case-scenario possibility that up to 18,000 migrants a day could try to cross the border.\n\nThe number of migrants at the border can fluctuate seasonally, and the administration hasn’t released updated estimates since Sullivan’s ruling or revealed what new policies they plan to implement. But the Department of Homeland Security stressed in its statement Tuesday evening that even though Title 42’s days are numbered, it will remain in place “for some period.”\n\nAnd officials seemed to allude to the possibility that the court ruling could become fodder for smugglers trying to convince migrants to make the dangerous journey to the US.\n\n“We know that smugglers will lie to take advantage of vulnerable migrants, putting lives at risk,” the DHS said.\n\nWho has been subjected to Title 42?\n\nEarlier this year, the policy drew attention when authorities at first were using it to turn away Ukrainians at the border, then largely started granting exceptions that allowed thousands of Ukrainians seeking refuge to cross.\n\nAdvocates argued a racist double standard was at play as many migrants from Central America and Haiti continued to be turned back under the policy. Federal officials denied that accusation and said each exemption is granted on a case-by-case basis.\n\nIn August, a CNN analysis found that migrants from outside Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador were far less likely to be subjected to Title 42.\n\nBut for some migrants, that’s starting to change. Nearly 6,000 Venezuelan migrants were expelled under Title 42 in October after the Biden administration announced a new policy toward migrants from the South American nation.\n\nAdvocates say for many of those who are expelled, the situation is dire.\n\nSince Biden took office, Human Rights First says it’s identified nearly 10,000 cases of kidnapping, torture, rape or other violent attacks on people blocked or expelled to Mexico under Title 42.\n\nHow are critics and defenders of the policy reacting to the ruling?\n\nLee Gelernt, the American Civil Liberties Union attorney who argued the case before Sullivan, praised the ruling.\n\n“Title 42 was never about public health, and this ruling finally ends the charade of using Title 42 to bar desperate asylum seekers from even getting a hearing,” he said in a statement.\n\nImmigrant advocacy organizations and some Democratic lawmakers echoed those sentiments and called for the administration to swiftly dismantle the policy.\n\n“Asylum is a human right. Title 42 was a cruel, inhumane policy,” Rep. Jesus “Chuy” Garcia, D-Illinois, said on Twitter.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott and other Republicans were swift to condemn the judge’s decision.\n\n“This will further signal to cartels, human smugglers, & illegal immigrants that the border is wide open—inciting more violence & lawlessness. Disastrous,” Abbott wrote on Twitter.\n\nWhat’s the Biden administration’s stance on Title 42?\n\nThe Biden administration has sent mixed messages on Title 42, but lately had seemed more favorable towards the policy. Officials have been using Title 42 to try to change the conversation around the border and the situation on the ground.\n\nMany advocates expected President Biden would lift the order as soon as he took office, given his campaign promises to build a more humane immigration system. Instead, his administration extended the policy more than a year into his presidency and defended it for months in court.\n\nIn April 2022, the administration announced plans to end the policy, stating that it was no longer necessary given “current public health conditions and an increased availability of tools to fight Covid-19.”\n\nAfter the federal judge in Louisiana blocked that effort, the Justice Department vowed to appeal.\n\nBut months later, facing mounting political pressure over a marked increase in migrants crossing the border the administration announced in October that it was expanding the use of Title 42 to expel Venezuelans into Mexico.\n\nJust hours before Sullivan’s ruling, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told lawmakers the policy remained in place.\n\nMonths ago we heard officials allude to the plans they had for managing migration at the border once Title 42 was lifted. Now the judge’s ruling forces the Biden administration’s hand.\n\nWithout Title 42 at its disposal, it’s unclear what new steps the administration will take at the border. Whatever happens next is sure to face intense political scrutiny.\n\nAlready the judge’s decision is intensifying debate over the border once again.", "authors": ["Catherine E.

The CDC said at the time it’s no longer necessary given current public health conditions and the increased availability of vaccines and treatments for Covid-19. The decision sparked a flurry of criticism by Republicans and Democrats amid heightened concerns over a migrant surge when the authority lifts.\n\nBut just days away from Title 42 ending this month, Judge Robert Summerhays of the Louisiana Western District Court found that the Biden administration didn’t follow the right procedures in ending the authority and argued that while the administration may invoke an action under emergency conditions, those may not apply with respect to terminating it.\n\n“Simply put, the CDC has not explained how the present circumstances prevented the CDC from issuing the Termination Order through the required notice and comment process under the APA,” Summerhays wrote, referring to the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nThe termination of Title 42, the judge concluded, is not exempt from the notice and comment process, which can potentially take months. The public health authority, which has been fiercely criticized by immigrant advocates, will remain in effect for now.\n\nLee Gelernt, ACLU attorney leading lawsuits against Title 42 in Washington, DC, called the ruling “wrong.”\n\n“The ruling is wrong, inconsistent with the considered judgment of the CDC, and should be immediately appealed by the administration. The lawsuit is the height of hypocrisy; the States that brought it seem only to want COVID restrictions when it comes to asylum seekers,” he said in a statement.\n\n“Notwithstanding this injunction, a parallel injunction in DC prohibits the use of Title 42 to expel families who would face persecution or torture,” Gelernt added.\n\nDepartment of Justice spokesman Anthony Coley said Friday that the department intends to appeal the decision.\n\n“The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) invoked its authority under Title 42 due to the unprecedented public-health dangers caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. CDC has now determined, in its expert opinion, that continued reliance on this authority is no longer warranted in light of the current public-health circumstances. That decision was a lawful exercise of CDC’s authority,” Coley said in a statement.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the Biden administration disagreed with the ruling, but that it would “continue to enforce the CDC’s 2020 Title 42 public health authority pending the appeal.”\n\nIn the meantime, she said, the Department of Homeland Security “will continue planning for the eventual lifting of Title 42 in light of CDC’s public health judgment.”\n\nArizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, a Republican who was among the states suing the Biden’s administration for its decision to end Title 42, called Friday’s ruling a “great win” on Twitter.\n\n“Title 42 is upheld by a federal judge,” Brnovich, who is running for a US Senate seat in his state, wrote. “Our office will continue to do everything in our power to push back against the lawlessness of the Biden administration.”\n\nThe ruling stems from a lawsuit filed by Arizona, Louisiana and Missouri in April against the Biden administration’s decision to end Title 42. More than a dozen states, mostly GOP-led, later joined the suit.\n\nLast week, Summerhays heard arguments in the case in a more than two-hour hearing, largely focusing his questions on the harm to the states and whether the administration followed proper procedures, noting that emergency conditions have changed, potentially allowing for outside input. Summerhays had previously temporarily blocked the administration from winding down the public health order before the termination date.\n\nIn the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, the CDC issued the public health order, which officials said aimed to stop the spread of Covid-19. The order allowed authorities to swiftly expel migrants at US land borders, and it’s been extended multiple times. The policy is widely known as Title 42, for the portion of US code that allowed the CDC director to issue it.\n\nThe border restrictions were controversial from the moment the Trump administration announced them.

It effectively barred those seeking asylum from doing so and marked a departure from previous protocols.\n\nThere have been more than 1 million expulsions since Title 42 went into effect in March 2020, according to US Customs and Border Protection data.\n\nUnder former President Donald Trump, authorities also expelled nearly 16,000 children who had arrived at the US southern border without their parents until a federal judge blocked the administration from turning back minors in November 2020.\n\nFriday’s ruling, from Judge Mark Pittman in the Texas Northern District Court, stems from a lawsuit filed by Texas against the Biden administration. In the ruling, Pittman writes: “Here, the President has (arbitrarily) excepted COVID-19 positive unaccompanied alien children from Title 42 procedures—which were purposed with preventing the spread of COVID-19. As a result, border states such as Texas now uniquely bear the brunt of the ramifications.”\n\nThe ruling will take effect in seven days, allowing time for the government to appeal.\n\nPittman’s ruling stands in stark contrast with the skepticism expressed by the DC Circuit over the public health authority. During oral arguments in January, the panel of judges questioned the basis of the order, particularly the premise that it guards against transmission in congregate settings, or specifically US-Mexico border facilities.\n\nCircuit Judge Justin Walker, who wrote Friday’s opinion, reiterated those concerns, calling the administration’s claim that Covid-19’s spread is slowed through use of the order “questionable.”\n\n“But this is March 2022, not March 2020. The CDC’s § 265 order looks in certain respects like a relic from an era with no vaccines, scarce testing, few therapeutics, and little certainty,” the ruling reads, referring to the public health authority.\n\nThe panel of judges also states that Customs and Border Protection officials have access to precautionary Covid-19 measures such as vaccines, testing and face masks. “We are not cavalier about the risks of COVID-19. And we would be sensitive to declarations in the record by CDC officials testifying to the efficacy of the § 265 Order. But there are none,” the ruling says.\n\nLast month, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the public health authority should remain in effect, adding that it will continue to assess the order.\n\nThis story has been updated with further developments Friday.", "authors": ["Priscilla Alvarez Tierney Sneed", "Priscilla Alvarez", "Tierney Sneed"], "publish_date": "2022/03/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/19/politics/title-42-biden/index.html", "title": "Biden administration to defend controversial Trump-era border ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe Biden administration defended the use of a controversial Trump-era policy that’s resulted in the expulsion of more than 1 million migrants at the US-Mexico border during a court hearing Wednesday, arguing that it was necessary to avoid the transmission of Covid-19 in border facilities.\n\nThe public health authority, known as Title 42, was invoked at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, despite suspicions among officials that it was politically motivated. It allows authorities to swiftly remove migrants encountered at the US southern border, effectively barring those seeking asylum from doing so and marking a departure from previous protocol.\n\n“Under the Title 42 order, those non-citizens can be rapidly screened, and then quickly expelled, substantially reducing the risk of transmission,” Justice Department attorney Sharon Swingle told a three-judge panel.\n\nThe use of the authority has fielded fierce criticism by immigrant advocates, attorneys and health experts, who argue it has no health basis and puts migrants in harm’s way. The United Nations refugee agency has also pushed back on the authority.\n\nWednesday’s court proceedings stemmed from a lawsuit filed last January, when the American Civil Liberties Union and others challenged the Trump-era border policy on behalf of migrant families. The ACLU had also challenged subjecting unaccompanied children to the policy, though they are now exempt.\n\n“We are back in court because the Biden administration has chosen to continue this brutal policy against families, despite the absence of any support from public health officials,” said the ACLU’s Lee Gelernt, lead attorney in the litigation.\n\nThe judges appeared skeptical at times about the basis of the order, particularly the premise that it guards against transmission in congregate settings, or specifically in the case of the US-Mexico border, border facilities. Judge Sri Srinivasan, for example, noted that unaccompanied minors, who are exempt from the order, are not subject to it and pass through those same facilities.\n\nJudge Robert Wilkins, meanwhile, said he’d “be inclined to be very sympathetic” to the US government, but underscored the unprecedented nature of the order.\n\n“I’d be inclined to be very sympathetic to your position, but we have Supreme Court authority that says that when you know an agency is taking you know, unprecedented, you know, action or for exercising some unprecedented power that we were to look askance at that,” he said.\n\nPlaintiffs in the case had been in negotiations with the government for several months, and as part of the litigation, the ACLU referred some families to be admitted to the US.\n\nThose negotiations fell apart, though, when the Biden administration decided to keep the public health order in place, angering immigrant advocates who argue it should be ditched.\n\nAt the time, a senior Homeland Security official, who’s since departed the administration, painted a dire picture in a court filing of what would occur if the public health order were lifted, citing a migrant surge at the US-Mexico border that had overwhelmed facilities.\n\n“These encounter rates have strained DHS operations and caused border facilities to be filled beyond their normal operating capacity, impacting the ability to employ social distancing in these congregate settings. At the same time, DHS is also experiencing significantly increased rates of noncitizens testing positive for COVID19,” the August declaration read, arguing that the risk had increased because of the highly transmissible Delta variant of the coronavirus.\n\nA month later, a federal judge blocked the Biden administration from expelling migrant families with children under the public health order, but an appeals court stayed the ruling.\n\nThe administration continues to rely on the authority. And when asked about it, the White House has referred to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which, according to a spokesperson, deems it necessary given the Delta and Omicron variants.\n\nBut Judge Justin Walker contended that despite the evolving state of the pandemic, there are more precautionary measures that can be taken. “This isn’t March 2020. We have widespread available effective vaccines. We also have a whole host of testing that wasn’t as widely available and or treatments as well,” Walker said.\n\nGelernt leaned into a similar argument, saying that the government has not done enough to equip border facilities to take in migrants instead of expel them.\n\nSwingle argued that the government is trying to get back on track, but can’t rely on vaccines to prevent transmission of Covid-19.\n\n“Vaccines are more available, but vaccinating somebody upon encounter does nothing to reduce the risk that that person may spread Covid in a congregate setting, in the days after a vaccination when the vaccine has not yet become effective,” Swingle said.\n\nConcerns remain among immigration attorneys, advocates and public health experts about the expulsion of migrants to Mexico and other countries.\n\n“Today we heard the same unconvincing arguments from the Biden administration that we’ve been hearing for the last year about this xenophobic and baseless policy, arguments that have already been rejected in federal court. Title 42 unjustly and unnecessarily inflicts harm on families seeking asylum at our border, and we will continue to work tirelessly to ensure that this policy ends once and for all,” said Diana Kearney, senior legal adviser with Oxfam America, in a statement.\n\nIn a recently released report, Human Rights First found nearly 9,000 reports of kidnappings and other violent attacks against people who had been expelled to Mexico or blocked from seeking protection in the US.", "authors": ["Priscilla Alvarez"], "publish_date": "2022/01/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/16/politics/us-border-immigration-republicans-what-matters/index.html", "title": "US-Mexico border 'invasion' declaration panned as PR stunt | CNN ...", "text": "A version of this story appears in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up here.\n\nCNN —\n\nAmerica’s duct-taped immigration policy, which successive Republican and Democratic administrations and Congresses have all failed to fix in a comprehensive way, is about to be ripped in yet another direction.\n\nWith CNN projecting Republicans will take control of the House in January, Democrats want to use the last gasp of their House majority to make good on a yearslong effort to give certainty to hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants who were brought to the US as children.\n\nSome Republicans, meanwhile, are using the language of war and aiming to make the situation at the southern border a key part of their platform once their party seizes the megaphone of a House majority.\n\nA federal judge invalidated a Covid-era policy left over from the Trump administration that has been used to expel migrants millions of times in recent years.\n\nCommissioner Chris Magnus was US Customs and Border ProtectionCommissioner Chris Magnus was forced out of his role last week by Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.\n\nThe move will do little to quiet the criticism of Mayorkas by Republicans. They’ve promised to target him and his agency with scrutiny and investigations when they take the House majority next term.\n\n‘Invasion.’ Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, fresh from a commanding election win in last week’s midterms and keen to be viewed as the border security governor, said he would invoke a clause of the US Constitution and declare an “invasion” at the southern border.\n\nWhile he has used the term “invasion” before, his tweet suggested he would do more to militarize his state’s response and step in where he says the Biden administration has failed.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump also returned to that term – “invasion” – in announcing his latest run for the White House.\n\n“Our southern border has been erased,” he said falsely, “and our country is being invaded by millions and millions of unknown people.”\n\nAbbott argued his declaration would invoke a clause in the Constitution that gives states extraordinary power.\n\nThat text, from Article I, Section 10, reads like this:\n\nNo State shall, without the Consent of Congress, lay any Duty of Tonnage, keep Troops, or Ships of War in time of Peace, enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State, or with a foreign Power, or engage in War, unless actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay.\n\nThat Abbott and others are equating a stream of unarmed migrants with an invading army is a case of major false equivalence. They also point to drugs that come across the border with Mexico and the drug cartels behind the illicit activity as a major problem.\n\nThere is no invading army. Rather than marauding troops, CNN’s many profiles of migrants have found families fleeing poverty, climate change, persecution and violence, and approaching the US border after a treacherous trek, often on foot, across the Darien Gap linking South and Central America.\n\nThe Biden administration, following in the Trump administration’s footsteps, has sought to deter migrants, particularly from Venezuela, who have increased exponentially in recent years.\n\nJudge ends Title 42. A federal judge on Tuesday ended a Trump-era Covid-19 policy, which had been maintained by the Biden administration, to expel many border crossers from the country. In response to a request from the administration, the judge stayed his ruling Wednesday for five weeks to allow the administration to prepare.\n\nThe DC judge, Emmet Sullivan, called that policy “arbitrary and capricious” and said it was flawed from the get-go.\n\nCNN’s Catherine Shoichet has an in-depth look at the policy, which has been used to expel migrants nearly 2.5 million times under the two presidents over the past three years. That language is important – many of those expelled under the policy have been expelled more than once.\n\nReporting from the Texas border. CNN’s Rosa Flores is based in Texas and has reported from the region.\n\n“We’ve covered stories on the Mexican side of the border where thousands of migrants have been waiting for Title 42 to lift,” she told me in an email. “The anxiety and angst have been building on the border for years now.”\n\nThe uncertainty about US policy has only amplified the desperation of people trying to get into the US, Flores told me.\n\n“The net effect of the US immigration policy has been very dangerous for migrants/asylum-seekers,” she told me. “Thousands of them have been kidnapped, sexually assaulted or violently attacked, according to Human Rights First.”\n\n‘PR stunt’. Even hard-line immigration activists, like the former Trump Department of Homeland Security official Ken Cuccinelli, who has pushed for this “invasion” declaration, called Abbott’s version of invoking the invasion clause inadequate since Abbott will not, apparently, be seizing federal authority to expel migrants from the country.\n\nIt does, however, fit along with Abbott’s efforts to bus migrants out of Texas to cities like New York and Washington.\n\n“Saying you’re being invaded but not blocking the invaders from coming is a hollow shell,” Cuccinelli said, along with Russ Vought, president of the activist group Citizens for Renewing America. They dismissed Abbott’s move as a “PR stunt.”\n\nNo obvious change. Flores pointed out it does not appear that Abbott’s declaration has changed the stance of the Texas Military Department nor its rules of engagement on the border. Abbott’s budget director said the announcement does not reflect a change in overall tactics.\n\nBack in February, CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez traveled to the border and talked to National Guard members taking part in Abbott’s previous deployment of state forces to the border. She found some who said the mission was a waste of time and resources, since the power to enforce immigration policy and border security is held by the federal government.\n\nNot what the founders intended. Any more on the invasion clause from Abbott would be “flagrantly unconstitutional,” according to Joseph Nunn of the left-leaning Brennan Center for Justice, who pointed out Texas is not being invaded by an army.\n\n“The Founders foresaw such invasions being launched by ‘ambitious or vindictive’ foreign powers and groups, not unarmed migrants and asylum-seekers,” Nunn said in a Twitter thread.", "authors": ["Zachary B.

Trump\n\nFormer President Donald Trump announced Tuesday that he will seek the Republican presidential nomination in 2024. “In order to make America great and glorious again, I am tonight announcing my candidacy for president of the United States,” Trump told a crowd gathered at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach, Florida. Surrounded by allies, advisers, and conservative influencers, Trump delivered a speech filled with false and misleading claims about a variety of topics – from his record in office to his Democratic opponents, to the economy, the environment and foreign policy. He is widely expected to be challenged by both conservative and moderate Republicans who could announce their campaigns in the coming months.\n\n2.

Atop the rocket was the Orion spacecraft, which is set to orbit the moon and collect critical data along the way. The uncrewed capsule will complete its journey in about 25.5 days and will splash down in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of San Diego on December 11, when recovery teams will be waiting nearby to haul it to safety.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback See Artemis I rocket launch 01:13 - Source: CNN Business\n\n3. Immigration\n\nA federal judge on Tuesday blocked Title 42 – a controversial rule that has allowed US authorities to expel more than 1 million migrants who crossed the US-Mexico border. This leaves the Biden administration without one of the key tools it put in place to address the thousands of migrants arriving at the border on a daily basis and could restore access to asylum for arriving migrants. While the rule was drafted by the Trump administration during the Covid-19 pandemic, the Biden administration has relied heavily on it to manage the increase of migrants at the border. The administration has requested a stay on the ruling for five weeks, according to a court filing.\n\n4.

It is not known who fired the missile, or precisely where it was fired from. Officials briefed on initial US assessments said it appears the missile originated in Ukraine, even though it was Russian-made. Some analysts believe the missile was fired by Ukrainian forces, trying to intercept a Russian attack.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Ex-NATO commander explains articles 4 and 5 of NATO treaty 01:00 - Source: CNN\n\n5.

The measure allows border authorities to turn migrants back to Mexico or their home countries because of the public health crisis.\n\nDemocratic senators in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and New Hampshire – all top GOP targets this year – have already sought to distance themselves from Biden’s move, charging that the White House has not adequately planned for a surge in border crossings.\n\nThat criticism expanded this week into governor’s races in two Southwestern swing states, Arizona and Nevada. Katie Hobbs, the Arizona secretary of state and front-runner for the Democratic nomination for governor, urged Biden to reverse his “rash decision” and said lifting Title 42 “without a clear plan to secure our border would be a disaster.”\n\nIn Nevada, Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak warned the President in a letter of a “humanitarian crisis” at the southern border if the public health authority is repealed without a “comprehensive plan.”\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, are pouncing on the issue.\n\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Senate GOP’s campaign arm, on Thursday launched a $1 million television advertising campaign tying Sen. Mark Kelly to Biden’s move because of the Arizona Democrat’s August vote against an amendment that would have required the Department of Homeland Security to expel migrants who illegally enter the country and may contribute to the spread of Covid-19.\n\n“Kelly voted to allow restrictions to be lifted, which will cause a massive new border surge,” a narrator says in the ad. “Tell Sen. Kelly: Stop voting with Biden and against Arizona.”\n\nKelly campaign spokeswoman Sarah Guggenheimer countered by saying the senator “has delivered increased border security resources, introduced bipartisan legislation to address the crisis, and has stood up to both the Biden administration and his own party to ensure a safe, humane, and orderly process at the border.”\n\nBiden administration on defense\n\nThe Biden administration is on track to end Title 42 on May 23. The decision, made by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ignited concerns about a migrant surge.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told CNN this week his department has “plans” to address the expected surge. But he would not elaborate.\n\n“I think we have to be very mindful of the fact that we are addressing enemies, and those enemies are the cartels and the smugglers, and I will not provide our plans to them. We are going to proceed with our execution, carefully, methodically, in anticipating different scenarios,” he said.\n\nVulnerable Democratic lawmakers plan to use a House Judiciary Committee hearing featuring Mayorkas next week to distance themselves from the Biden administration’s decision, congressional aides say. They plan to grill the secretary, whose answers could offer a window into how the White House will defend its position.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday the administration was “planning and preparing” for the May 23 rollback of Title 42 but remains open to conversations with lawmakers about immigration reform.\n\nMore than 20 states, mostly GOP-led, on Thursday asked a federal judge in Louisiana to immediately block the administration from ending Title 42. The administration on Friday asked the judge to deny the request.\n\nThe Democratic divide over Title 42 pits candidates in swing states and vulnerable incumbents against not just Biden’s White House but more progressive Democrats and immigration advocates.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York is among the most vocal advocates of ending Title 42 border restrictions. Last month, Schumer, along with Democratic Sens. Alex Padilla of California, and Bob Menendez and Cory Booker of New Jersey, said there was “no public health benefit to sending asylum seekers back to harm” and urged Biden “to stop breathing new life into this inhumane Trump policy.” Three weeks later, the administration announced it would lift the pandemic restrictions.\n\nSome Democrats up for reelection this year, such as Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock, have faced condemnation from the left for criticizing Biden’s move to roll back Title 42.\n\nKelly and New Hampshire Sen. Maggie Hassan, who both visited the US-Mexico border earlier this month, signed on to a Republican-backed bill that would delay the rollback.\n\nNevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, who has also urged Biden to reconsider his plans, has faced criticism from Republicans for signing a June 2020 letter that urged Trump to back off what the letter called a “CDC asylum ban.”\n\nMichigan Sen. Gary Peters, who chairs Senate Democrats’ campaign arm, said this week that the Biden administration might need to delay the rollback of Title 42 until a clearer plan to mitigate the flow of migrants at the southern border is in place.\n\nThe Senate Homeland Security Committee chairman said he understands why his colleagues running for reelection might be willing to come out against Biden.\n\n“I think they are right to raise questions. This is a very serious issue,” said Peters, who is not up for reelection this year. “The senators have to take a position that they think is best for their state.”\n\nCriticism across the midterm map\n\nMeanwhile, Democratic opposition to the Biden administration’s move has mounted across the map of competitive Senate races in November’s midterm elections.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, an otherwise strong supporter of Biden’s policies, broke with the White House on Title 42.\n\n“I think there should be a little bit more thought given into that. And I don’t think we’re quite there just yet, quite frankly,” Fetterman said in an interview.\n\nUS Rep. Conor Lamb, another Senate contender in Pennsylvania, told CNN he is a “skeptic” of the planned rollback.\n\n“I will certainly listen to any argument that the administration wants to make,” Lamb said. “But you know, the pandemic is not over. That’s why Title 42 went into place was to just try to help control what was happening down there in light of the pandemic and how things can spread and particularly with these different variants.”\n\nIn Wisconsin, Democrats hoping to unseat Republican Sen. Ron Johnson this fall lambasted Biden over Title 42.\n\nLt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, state Treasurer Sarah Godlewski and Milwaukee Bucks executive Alex Lasry have all called for the administration to offer a plan to keep both asylum seekers and US residents safe before lifting the public health authority.\n\nFlorida Rep. Val Demings, who is challenging GOP Sen. Marco Rubio, was a top contender for Biden’s running mate in 2020. Her campaign spokesman Christian Slater said Demings, a former Orlando police chief, did not support lifting Title 42 “until there is a plan to put more boots on the ground and support our law enforcement officers at the border.”\n\nDemocratic Senate candidates in red-leaning states have also spoken out.\n\nOhio Rep. Tim Ryan, the leading Democrat in an open-seat Senate race, has co-sponsored a bill that would prevent the Biden administration from what he calls a “wrong and reckless” decision to lift the Title 42 restrictions.\n\n“Prematurely ending this policy without a path forward does nothing to keep Americans safe, support our Border Patrol agents, protect asylum-seekers, or bring about the comprehensive fix our immigration system needs,” Ryan said.\n\nAnd retired Marine Lucas Kunce, a top candidate for the open seat in Missouri, said, “Repealing Title 42 with no actual plan isn’t policy – it’s politics.”", "authors": ["Eric Bradner Alex Rogers", "Eric Bradner", "Alex Rogers"], "publish_date": "2022/04/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/07/us/migrant-asylum-immigration-backlog/index.html", "title": "Over 580,000 migrants have entered the backlogged US ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA 4-year-old girl wipes her mother’s tears inside a migrant respite center in El Paso, Texas.

Ron DeSantis – part of a series of moves by Republican governors to transport migrants to liberal areas to protest what they describe as the failure of the federal government to secure the southern border.\n\nAttorneys for the migrants have filed a class action lawsuit, saying they were misled in agreeing to the flights and had been told that they would arrive to find housing, jobs and help with the immigration process.\n\nIn response to the lawsuit, DeSantis’ office repeated what was previously said: The transportation of migrants from Texas to Martha’s Vineyard “was done on a voluntary basis.”\n\nCBP Commissioner Chris Magnus says the latest wave of migration is mostly driven by people fleeing the “failing communist regimes” in Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba, which is complicating the processing and removal of those individuals once they arrive in the US, as they are generally not subject to Title 42.\n\nTitle 42 is the pandemic public health order that since 2020 has allowed immigration authorities to swiftly expel some migrants to Mexico or their home countries.\n\nRising levels of repression, food shortages and economic stability are motivating Venezuelans and Nicaraguans to flee their homelands said Doris Meissner, who directs US immigration policy work at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute in Washington. “These populations … require different kinds of response,” Meissner told CNN recently. “We have not established an asylum system that is in any way up to the level of the challenge that this change brought about.”\n\n‘I don’t think this is sustainable long term’\n\nEl Paso's US Border Patrol sector erected this open-air triage processing center after immigration agents realized that the spike in migration was not an anomaly. Rosa Flores/CNN\n\nIn Del Rio, Texas, a small border town of about 35,000 residents, border patrol vans and buses constantly drop off migrants who have been processed by immigration agents at the Val Verde Border Humanitarian Coalition – the one migrant respite center in town. So far this year, more than 32,000 migrants have come through the center, a nearly 40% increase over last year’s total, according to Tiffany Burrow, the center’s director of operations.\n\n“It’s just been so consistently growing that we’ve been able to adapt. But I don’t think this is sustainable long term,” Burrow told CNN.\n\nEl Paso, which is about 400 miles northwest of Del Rio, opened its own migrant respite center last month after shelters there reached maximum capacity and people started pitching tents on the street.\n\nThat’s where CNN first met Yensel Castro and her daughter, in the children’s play area of the center.\n\nCastro’s voice broke and her eyes flooded with tears as soon as she started talking about her mother waiting for her in Chicago.\n\n“I miss her so much,” she said between sobs, explaining that she had no money to travel to Chicago, where her mom was waiting for her. She said her mother left Nicaragua for Chicago five months ago and had been working to rent a home for the three of them.\n\nA short drive from the respite center, El Paso’s Border Patrol Sector recently erected an open-air triage-style processing center under a highway overpass to help process migrants faster.\n\nCNN got access to the center, which includes sections for intake, medical care and a waiting area, last month. Buses equipped with processing technology were parked on-site. Migrants don’t stay there very long, a few hours at the most. They are swiftly processed and divided into two groups, those who will be expelled to Mexico under Title 42 and those who are allowed to stay, pending their immigration proceedings.\n\n“It’s like a mobile command center,” Magnus told CNN during an interview on-site. Magnus explained that people are given the opportunity to seek asylum, they are being vetted, and criminal backgrounds are being checked.\n\nFar from the border, other Texas cities are responding to the crisis. San Antonio recently opened a respite center and another one is in the planning stages in Houston. Chicago, New York and Washington, DC have been forced to respond after several Republican governors transported migrants in buses to their cities unannounced.\n\nAmerica’s backlogged immigration system\n\nA child sleeps at the El Paso airport after his family's one month journey from Venezuela. According to the child's father, the family is seeking asylum in the United States. Rosa Flores/CNN\n\nThe recently arrived migrants and asylum seekers are entering a highly complicated and backlogged immigration system. This fiscal year alone, U.S. immigration Courts recorded over 819,000 new immigration cases.\n\nAt the end of August, there were nearly 2 million immigration cases pending in immigration courts. That total includes 743,250 cases in which asylum claims have been made and are still pending, according to an analysis of government data by Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) at Syracuse University. There are hundreds of thousands more asylum cases going through US Citizenship and Immigration Services, the USCIS ombudsman told the National Law Review in July.\n\n“It can take many years for the government to even call them [asylum seekers] for an interview or to go to court,” says Conchita Cruz, the co-executive director of the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project (ASAP), a non-profit organization with more than 400,000 asylum seeker members from 175 countries.\n\nIn late May, the Biden administration launched an effort to speed up some types of asylum claims. The rule authorizes asylum officers – and not just immigration court judges – to consider asylum claims for those who assert a fear of persecution and pass the credible fear screening.\n\nThe effort, which is being implemented in a phased manner, is expected to shorten the process of some asylum applications, from several years on average to several months, according to the DHS.\n\nBut while that program rolls out, frustration over asylum application delays is compounded by another layer of the process. Individuals going through the asylum process have to apply separately for the right to work legally.\n\nCruz says asylum seekers are eligible to apply for a work permit 150 days after they file for asylum and, under the law, the federal government has 30 days to process applications.\n\nAt the end of March about 443,000 work permit cases were pending, according to a USCIS spokesperson.\n\nThat month USCIS established new goals to reduce the agency’s pending caseload, the spokesperson said.\n\nASAP and various other non-profit groups are in an ongoing legal battle with the federal government over work permit delays for asylum seekers. Cruz and her legal team are asking a judge to order USCIS to process its members’ work permit applications in 30 days, as the law requires.\n\n“The government should comply, and process asylum seekers’ work permits as quickly as possible whether they’re forced to by a federal judge and a court order or not,” Cruz said.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, USCIS said the agency does not comment on issues directly related to pending litigation; but the agency acknowledged the “historic volumes of employment authorization requests” and noted its efforts to curb delays.\n\n“USCIS set new agency-wide backlog reduction goals, expanded premium processing to additional form types, and implemented efforts to improve timely access to employment authorization documents. The agency remains committed to upholding America’s promise as a nation of welcome and possibility with fairness, integrity, and respect for all we serve,” a spokesperson told CNN by email.\n\nThe faces of America’s new asylum seekers\n\nCNN has met dozens of migrants and asylum hopefuls in respite centers and shelters along the US southern border in the past few months. It’s at these centers that migrants get the opportunity to charge their cellphones, contact family to let them know they’ve been processed by immigration authorities and released into the United States, and where they take buses and planes to the interior of the country.\n\nIsmael Martinez says he's renting a room in New York for $1,000 per month.

Ron DeSantis’ move last week to deposit two planeloads of migrants on the vacation island of Martha’s Vineyard, constitute one prong of a pincer strategy from Republican state officials to commandeer the course of national immigration policy.\n\nOn one front, through the migrant transfers and an executive order from Texas Gov. Greg Abbott instructing state law enforcement officials to apprehend undocumented migrants, the red states are looking to expand their own authority over immigration enforcement which is traditionally an area where courts have provided almost complete primacy to federal power.\n\nSimultaneously, shifting combinations of Republican-controlled states have launched a swarm of lawsuits, primarily before sympathetic Republican-appointed judges, looking to prevent President Joe Biden from unwinding many of the hardline immigration enforcement policies implemented by his predecessor, Donald Trump.\n\nWhat links these twin policy offensives is a “deeper desire to create far more autonomy and authority at the state level over immigration matters, which traditionally has been absolutely encased in federal authority,” said Doris Meissner, a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute, who served as commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service during Bill Clinton’s two presidential terms.\n\nEven this comprehensive campaign to wrest greater control over immigration policy represents just one front in the much larger drive unfolding across states where Republicans control the state legislature, the governorship, or both.\n\nThese Republican state officials have moved aggressively since Trump’s defeat to unravel what legal scholars call the “rights revolution” – the steady procession of moves by the Supreme Court and Congress since the 1960s to nationalize more rights, from abortion to contraception to interracial marriage, and to reduce the freedom of states to constrict those rights. Since Biden took office, red states have moved en masse to pass legislation prohibiting or restricting abortion; making it more difficult to vote; retrenching LGBTQ rights; limiting how public school teachers can talk about race, gender or sexual orientation; and making it easier for critics to ban books from public school libraries. In this drive, they have received critical support from GOP-appointed justices on the Supreme Court and Republican senators wielding the filibuster to block Democratic efforts to codify national rights on abortion, voting and, likely, on same-sex marriage.\n\nTaken together, all of these pieces – the torrent of socially conservative red state legislation; the flurry of lawsuits to constrain Biden’s ability to exert national power or to erase previously guaranteed national rights (like abortion); and the use of Republican filibusters to prevent Democrats from passing legislation restoring a national floor of rights amount to what I’ve called “an effort to define a nation within a nation – one operating with a set of rules and policies that diverge from the rest of America more than in almost any previous era.”\n\nThe moves by Republican governors to remove migrants in large numbers from red states to blue jurisdictions takes the idea of red and blue America as separate nations to a new, ominously literal extreme. To many critics, it echoes other examples of nations banishing unwanted populations across a border–as the US did with the mass deportations of undocumented workers to Mexico during “Operation Wetback” in the 1950s. Some even see in these actions echoes of the racist “ethnic cleansing” that has accompanied wars in Eastern Europe and is evident now in Ukraine.\n\n“The red states are deporting people,” David Leopold, former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, told me. “It an attempt at an internal mass deportation. … The spirit of cleansing an area of certain people, is so un-American and so repugnant to everything this country stands for.”\n\nIn 2021, the Biden administration frustrated civil rights and voting rights advocates by standing back for months as red states imposed new obstacles to voting before shifting gears with lawsuits against some of the state laws, much harsher rhetoric from Biden, and a belated (and ultimately unsuccessful) push for national voting rights legislation.\n\nSomething of the same frustration may be building again around the red state relocations. Biden and other administration officials have forcefully condemned the migrant removals, particularly DeSantis’ relocation to Martha’s Vineyard. But White House and Department of Justice officials through Monday pointedly dodged questions about whether the administration was considering any legal or executive actions to combat the relocations. And with DeSantis pledging more such flights, and Abbott and Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey continuing to bus migrants to blue jurisdictions, the White House is likely, sooner than later, to face growing questions about whether it is doing enough to push back.\n\n“They should use every tool in their toolkit, including litigation, to stop red state politicians from seeking to wrest that control that belongs with the federal government,” said Jane Bentrott, a lawyer at the Justice Action Center, an immigration advocacy group based in California.\n\nIn turn, the Republican governors argue that they are only acting to protect their states from the impact of what they universally call Biden’s failure to secure the border. “Instead of their hypocritical complaints about Texas providing much-needed relief to our overrun and overwhelmed border communities, President Biden and Border Czar [Kamala] Harris need to step up and do their jobs to secure the border – something they continue failing to do,” Renae Eze, Abbott’s press secretary, said in an emailed statement.\n\nImmigration experts across the ideological spectrum agree that the large flow of asylum seekers and other undocumented migrants has created enormous strains for communities near the Mexican border. “This is an unsustainable situation at the border,” Meissner said. “It’s unsustainable for Customs and Border Patrol, for the administration, for critics of the administration, for the country. Even though we can as a country take very large numbers of people … this way of doing it is not sustainable. It’s just not the right way to be doing business.”\n\nBut most experts also agree that the question of whether the burden of responding to the migrant flow should be more widely shared across the country is a very different issue than whether the Republican governors are justified in shipping large numbers of undocumented people to other cities without notice or planning. Abbott’s office said Texas has already bussed more than 10,000 migrants to other cities, in some cases dropping them off on sidewalks without providing any notice to the receiving jurisdictions.\n\nLeopold said the fact that the migrants “are being shipped across state lines … right there triggers federal jurisdiction.” But Meissner said the pivotal issue in determining whether the transfers are violating any federal laws “probably comes down almost entirely” to whether migrants consented to the trips or were coerced or misled to participate.\n\nIn response to written questions, Abbott’s office provided a copy of a waiver it said all of the bussed migrants have signed in which they “agree to be transported by the State of Texas or its designated agency officials to locations outside of Texas.”\n\n“These migrants willingly chose to go to Washington, D.C., New York City, or Chicago,” Eze said.\n\nMeissner agreed that even if shipping undocumented individuals to other cities without any coordination is questionable policy and “fiendishly cynical,” it’s likely “a lot of migrants were entirely willing and pleased to be able to get this bus transportation because in the normal course they are responsible for paying for their transportation once they are in the country.”\n\nThe flights to Martha’s Vineyard that DeSantis organized are drawing more scrutiny precisely because of indications the migrants on board were misled about where they were going and promised work and housing benefits that never materialized. In a letter last weekend to the US attorney for Massachusetts, a legal group representing some of the migrants wrote, “Our clients were induced to board airplanes and cross state lines under false pretenses. Individuals, working in concert with the Florida Governor, made numerous false promises to our clients, including of work opportunities, schooling for their children, and immigration assistance, in order to induce them to travel.”\n\nThe group, Lawyers for Civil Rights Boston, said the flights potentially violated several federal laws and called on the Justice Department to open a federal investigation. “This type of conspiracy to deprive our clients of their liberty and civil rights and interfere with federal immigration proceedings must be thoroughly investigated for violations of criminal laws,” the group wrote. On Monday evening, the county sheriff in Bexar County, TX, which is centered on San Antonio where the flights originated, announced that he is launching an investigation into the maneuver.\n\nApart from the question of whether the flights triggered any criminal liability, immigration advocates also want the administration to pursue a federal court injunction stopping future transfers. “I am quite confident that this is enough of an interference with exclusive federal responsibility [over immigration] that they could take action,” said Thomas Saenz, the president and general counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund.\n\nLike Abbott, DeSantis has insisted that no migrants were misled, all participated voluntarily, and the flights represent a justified response to “reckless” Biden immigration policies. “We’re continuing to … use every tool at our disposal to insulate the state of Florida from the negative ramifications” of the Biden administration’s policies, DeSantis declared last week.\n\nThe flights fit into a pattern of red states pushing at the boundaries of federal authority over immigration policy. In July, Abbott signed an executive order authorizing Texas law enforcement officials to return migrants they find in the state to ports of entry at the border. (Abbott’s office cited that executive order Monday as the legal authority for the program of bussing migrants out of state.) To critics, that executive order represents a clear intrusion into federal control of immigration enforcement.\n\nThe Supreme Court as recently as 2012 reaffirmed the primacy of federal authority over immigration law in a case striking down a hardline Arizona statute that also empowered state police to target undocumented immigrants. “The National Government has significant power to regulate immigration,” the court majority wrote at the time. “Arizona may have understandable frustrations with the problems caused by illegal immigration … but the State may not pursue policies that undermine federal law.\n\nMeissner said that through the migrant transfers, and especially the Texas executive order authorizing state law enforcement to apprehend and relocate migrants, the Republican governors may be trying to create a legal test case that would allow the new, more conservative Supreme Court majority to overturn that decision. That’s what red states did by passing the severe abortion restrictions that ultimately created the Mississippi case the justices used to overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\nWith its immigration enforcement directives, Texas “may be purposely overreaching in the way that has been done with the abortion case for years and years in order to generate a lawsuit that then can get to the Supreme Court with the view that this Supreme Court would rule differently on that precedent,” in the 2012 Arizona case, Meissner said.\n\nThese red state challenges to federal primacy over immigration enforcement come even as shifting combinations of the same states are pursuing multiple lawsuits to constrain federal authority and to prevent Biden from changing hardline Trump policies. Bentrott said her group counts at least 20 active lawsuits from different coalitions of red states against Biden’s immigration policies. As part of that offensive, immigration advocates are bracing for a decision from the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals within weeks, if not days, striking down the DACA program that provides legal protections to young people brought to the country illegally as children.\n\nAmid all of these provocations, the Biden administration has generally dodged full-scale confrontation with the red state governors over immigration. The Justice Department has won a temporary federal injunction against one aspect of Abbott’s immigration agenda – a mandate for state troopers to pull over private vehicles believed to be transporting migrants who might be infected with Covid.\n\nBut while Biden criticized last week’s flights, and Rachael Rollins, the US attorney for Massachusetts, has said she will look into them, the administration has conspicuously avoided promising legal action. And the Justice Department has not filed suit against Abbott’s broader executive order authorizing state law enforcement officials to move undocumented migrants to the border, even though many immigration lawyers consider it a clear violation of federal primacy.\n\nFrank Sharry, executive director of America’s Voice, an immigration advocacy group, said the administration’s muted response likely makes sense from a short-term political perspective. “In the cold calculus of midterm elections, Biden and most Democrats have decided to close on abortion and ignore immigration,” he said. “They do not want to give oxygen to a desperate GOP attempt to change the subject.”\n\nYet the choice not to fully engage, Sharry said, carries a long-term cost in terms of making it more difficult to consider any comprehensive response to the immigration dilemma – like the bills that passed the Senate with bipartisan filibuster-proof majorities in 2006 and 2013 that coupled tougher enforcement with a pathway to citizenship for millions of undocumented migrants. “You can’t win an argument you don’t engage in,” Sharry argued, “and leaving the framing of the issue to the GOP and Fox means you – and our issue – will lose a great deal of ground.”\n\nWith these aggressive new maneuvers from DeSantis and Abbott, immigration has now joined issues such as abortion, voting and LGBTQ rights in the red state attempt to carve out a separate sphere of influence that sets its own rules and repels federal attempts to maintain a national baseline of guaranteed rights.\n\n“There’s absolutely no doubt that what is going on is a kind of tug of war between Washington and state capitals about where the balance of power is going to go,” said Donald Kettl, a professor emeritus of public policy at the University of Maryland and author of the 2020 book, “The Divided States of America.”\n\nPreviously the sharpest division among the states, of course, came in the years before, during and after the Civil War when first slavery and then the federal efforts to protect rights for the freed slaves during Reconstruction sundered the north from the south. But experts like Kettl note that today’s divisions involve more states, and span more issues, than even those divides. By, in effect, deporting undocumented migrants from red areas to blue ones, Abbott and DeSantis have underscored how thoroughly they view blue America as fundamentally a different country than their own.\n\n“We tend to look at the theater that Abbott and DeSantis have staged,” Kettl said. “But there are more fundamental battles at play here and there is very little attention being given to them … or where this is likely to take the country.”", "authors": ["Ronald Brownstein"], "publish_date": "2022/09/20"}]}

It is not known who fired the missile, or precisely where it was fired from, though the Polish Foreign Ministry has described it as “Russian-made.”\n\nBoth Russian and Ukrainian forces have used Russian-made munitions during the conflict, with Ukraine deploying Russian-made missiles as part of its air defense system.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after holding an emergency meeting with G7 and NATO leaders on the sidelines of the G20 summit, US President Joe Biden said preliminary information suggested it was “unlikely” the missile was fired from within Russia, but was unable to say conclusively until the investigation was complete.\n\n“We agreed to support Poland’s investigation into the explosion … And I’m going to make sure we figure out exactly what happened,” Biden said, adding the leaders offered sympathy over the death of two people. “Then we’re going to collectively determine our next step as we investigate and proceed. There was total unanimity among the folks at the table,” he added.\n\nFollowing Biden’s statement, a NATO military official told CNN the missile had been tracked by an alliance aircraft flying above Polish airspace at the time of the blast.\n\n“Intel with the radar tracks [of the missile] was provided to NATO and Poland,” the NATO military official added. The NATO official did not say who launched the missile, or where it was fired from.\n\nThe missile strike within Poland’s borders on Tuesday “would not have happened without Russia’s horrific missile attacks against Ukraine,” Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said in a statement online Wednesday.\n\n“The G7 and present NATO members convened a meeting this morning in Bali during the G20 to discuss the incident in Poland last night. We are united in our message that we first need to establish the facts and therefore support Poland’s investigation,” Rutte wrote.\n\nIn comments earlier Tuesday, Polish President Andrzej Duda noted that while it was not clear who launched the missile, it was “most likely” made in Russia. “We are working calmly and in a very calm manner,” Duda said during an address from the Bureau of National Security in Warsaw.\n\nThe Kremlin has denied involvement in the explosion, with Russia’s Defense Ministry calling the reports by Polish media, who first reported the deaths,”a deliberate provocation in order to escalate the situation,” according to a short statement late Tuesday.\n\nIt added that the photos of wreckage published by Polish media “from the scene in the village of Przewodow have nothing to do with Russian weapons.”\n\nThe Russian mission at the United Nations on Wednesday said “the incident in Poland is an attempt to provoke a direct military clash between NATO and Russia,” adding the incident would be the focus of attention at the UN Security Council meeting later in the day.\n\nPolish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said Tuesday that evidence suggests the missile that landed in Przewodów was a “single act” and there is no evidence of further missile strikes.\n\nBut while urging calm, Morawiecki said Poland would increase its military readiness and was contemplating the activation of Article 4 of the NATO Treaty. Article 4 is a consultation method that allows members of the 30-country alliance to bring an issue – usually about security – for discussion at the North Atlantic Council, its decision-making body.\n\nWhatever the outcome of the Polish-led investigation, the incident has reinforced longstanding concerns related to the risk of battlefield miscalculation triggering NATO-Russian conflict.\n\nWitness to the blast described hearing a terrifying “whoosh” as the projectile flew over the town and the force of the explosion shook nearby windows.\n\nVideo taken by a resident, which was geolocated and confirmed by CNN, shows a large smoke plume in the center of the village.\n\nAt the site of the explosion, local media showed an image of a crater and upturned farm vehicle. CNN cannot independently confirm the photos.\n\nIn his address, Duda said the US would send experts to investigate the site as part of joint operation.\n\nSpeaking after a call with Duda Tuesday, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said it was “important that all facts are established.”\n\n“I offered my condolences for the loss of life.

Surrounded by allies, advisers, and conservative influencers, Trump delivered a speech filled with false and misleading claims about a variety of topics – from his record in office to his Democratic opponents, to the economy, the environment and foreign policy. He is widely expected to be challenged by both conservative and moderate Republicans who could announce their campaigns in the coming months.\n\n2.

Immigration\n\nA federal judge on Tuesday blocked Title 42 – a controversial rule that has allowed US authorities to expel more than 1 million migrants who crossed the US-Mexico border. This leaves the Biden administration without one of the key tools it put in place to address the thousands of migrants arriving at the border on a daily basis and could restore access to asylum for arriving migrants. While the rule was drafted by the Trump administration during the Covid-19 pandemic, the Biden administration has relied heavily on it to manage the increase of migrants at the border. The administration has requested a stay on the ruling for five weeks, according to a court filing.\n\n4. Ukraine\n\nWorld leaders are attempting to defuse a potential escalation in the months-long Ukraine war after a Russian-made missile landed in eastern Poland on Tuesday, killing two people. The incident marks the first time a NATO country has been directly hit during the conflict. NATO’s collective defense clause requires all 30 members – including the US, Canada, UK and France – to defend against an attack on another member. It is not known who fired the missile, or precisely where it was fired from. Officials briefed on initial US assessments said it appears the missile originated in Ukraine, even though it was Russian-made.

The latest measures also targeted Belarus' defense and security industries along with 24 Belarusian individuals and entities for the country's role in the attack on Ukraine.\n\nBiden said the new economic measures would \"limit Russia's ability to do business in dollars, euros, pounds and yen to be part of the global economy.\"\n\nThe president also announced the U.S. would deploy additional forces to Germany to help bolster the NATO alliance along the eastern flank.

Biden insisted the latest measures \"exceed SWIFT\" and suggested it was a move that European allies were hesitant to make.\n\nThe president said additional Russian oligarchs and their families would face new sanctions but he declined to say why he has yet to sanction Putin personally, only adding that \"it's on the table.\"\n\nBiden also issued a chilling warning that he believes Putin \"has much larger ambitions\" that extend beyond Ukraine's borders.\n\nTranscript of Biden's speech:President Joe Biden addresses Russia's 'brutal assault' on Ukraine\n\n\"He wants to, in fact, re-establish the former Soviet Union,\" Biden said. \"His ambitions are completely contrary to the place where the rest of the world has arrived.\"\n\nRussia's military operation has the goal of overtaking the Ukrainian government and installing a Kremlin-backed one, according to a senior U.S. military official who was not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nHere's what to know about the attack on Ukraine:\n\nWHEN DID THE INVASION START?

It’s foul and will never be forgiven.”\n\nIn addition, he said 316 others have been wounded since Russian launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Each of the Ukrainians who have died will be posthumously awarded the title “hero of Ukraine,” Zelenskyy said.\n\n“This is the sound of a new iron curtain, which has come down and is closing Russia off from the civilized world,” he said. “Our national task is to make sure this curtain does not fall.\"\n\n- Associated Press\n\nUkraine president orders general military mobilization amid invasion\n\nZelenskyy ordered a “general mobilization” of the Ukraine population Thursday to support military efforts as Russia attacks Ukraine.\n\nA decree signed by the president orders conscripts and military reservists to mobilize within 90 days to assist the Armed Forces of Ukraine.\n\nZelenskyy ordered the mobilization “in connection with the military aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine and in order to ensure the state’s defense, maintain combat, and mobilization of the Armed Forces of Ukraine,” the decree reads.\n\nThe move comes as Ukraine has banned all males between the ages of 18 to 60 from leaving the country, according to Ukraine’s State Border Service, CNN reported.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nWhite House 'outraged' over reports Chernobyl workers being held hostage\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki condemned Thursday what she said are “credible reports” that Russian soldiers are holding hostage staff at the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant facility in Ukraine.\n\nThe facility, scene of the worst nuclear disaster in history, was taken over by Russians during their invasion of Ukraine, the Associated Press reported.\n\n“We're outraged by credit credible reports that Russian soldiers are currently holding the staff of the Chernobyl facilities hostage,” Psaki said. “This unlawful and dangerous hostage-taking – which could upend the routine civil service efforts required to maintain and protect the nuclear waste facility – is obviously incredibly alarming and greatly concerning. We condemn it and we request their release.”\n\nThe Ukrainian Foreign Minister raised concerns on Twitter about Chernobyl, which is located about 80 miles north of the Ukraine capital of Kyiv.\n\n“In 1986, the world saw the biggest technological disaster in Chornobyl,” he said.

Putin chose this war.”\n\nBiden said Russia’s attack on Ukraine is unfolding as officials predicted and that Russia \"rejected every good faith effort the United States and our allies.\"\n\nBiden said members of the European Union including France, Germany, Italy as well as the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and others have joined a global coaliton to amplify a united response.\n\nBiden said G-7 leaders agreed to limit Russia's ability to do business in dollars, euros, pounds and yen.

At the time, Grandi described it as “sobering and alarming.” Thursday’s report explores the trends behind it in greater detail.\n\n“With millions of Ukrainians displaced at the time of writing, as well as further displacement elsewhere this year, notably in Burkina Faso and Myanmar, total forced displacement now exceeds 100 million people,” the report says.\n\n“This means 1 in every 78 people on earth has been forced to flee – a dramatic milestone that few would have expected a decade ago.”\n\nUNHCR says the latest forced displacement figure includes 60.1 million internally displaced people, 32.1 million refugees, 4.5 million asylum seekers and 4.4 million Venezuelans displaced abroad. That adds up to a number that’s larger than the population of most countries.\n\nDavid Miliband, president and CEO of the International Rescue Committee, described the 100 million figure as an “appalling mark” that shows “global failure.” It “will be the prelude to higher and higher numbers without urgent action,” he warned, calling for increasing refugee resettlement commitments and boosting humanitarian aid to crisis zones.\n\nMillions of Ukrainians have been forced to flee\n\nThe UN report released Thursday largely focuses on 2021, noting that year was “perhaps most notable for the sheer number of existing conflicts that escalated and new conflicts that flared up.” But its authors note that developments in early 2022 were impossible to ignore.\n\nMore than 7 million Ukrainians were displaced within the country due to war, and more than 6 million refugees have fled Ukraine, the report says.\n\n“It is one of the largest forced displacement crises since World War II, and certainly the fastest,” the report says.\n\nTurkey hosted the largest refugee population in 2021\n\nIn 2021, the report says, Turkey hosted the world’s largest refugee population, nearly 3.8 million people.\n\nChildren stand in a refugee camp along the Thai-Myanmar border.

Sign up here.\n\nHong Kong CNN —\n\nShanghai officials on Tuesday said they had achieved “zero-Covid at the community level” in what appeared to be a turning point in a heavy-handed and costly campaign to tame an Omicron outbreak – but many residents remain skeptical the city will reopen anytime soon.\n\n“Zero-Covid at the community level” means infections are no longer found outside centralized quarantine facilities or neighborhoods under the strictest lockdowns – and is a prerequisite for those measures to be lifted.\n\nZhao Dandan, deputy head of the Shanghai Municipal Health Commission, said at a news conference Tuesday that all 16 districts of the Chinese financial hub had now achieved that distinction. But 860,000 people remain under the strictest lockdown level, meaning they cannot leave their homes.\n\nSince China’s leader Xi Jinping vowed to endure with his zero-Covid policy on May 5, Shanghai authorities have taken increasingly hardline measures, canceling food deliveries in some neighborhoods, forcing residents who tested negative for Covid into government quarantine and disinfecting their homes without consent.\n\nHowever, while the tough measures have fueled discontent among residents, they also appear to have brought infections down. Shanghai reported fewer than 1,000 new cases on both Sunday and Monday – the first time under four figures since March 24, according to the city’s health commission.\n\nThe announcement comes a day after Shanghai pledged to gradually ease its Covid lockdown and return life to normal in June, following seven weeks of a government-enforced standstill that inflicted great pain on residents and dealt a devastating blow to the economy.\n\nAt a news conference Monday, Shanghai officials declared the outbreak to be “under effective control” as 15 of the city’s 16 districts had stopped the community spread of Covid, with fewer than 1 million of its 25 million residents still in strict lockdown.\n\nOfficials said the city’s reopening will come in three phases, with the goal of restoring life to normal and fully restarting factories in June.\n\n“From June 1 to mid- and late June, under the premise of controlling the risks of a rebound in infections, we will make epidemic prevention and control a normalized routine, and fully restore normal production and life in the city,” Deputy Mayor Zong Ming said.\n\nSupermarkets, convenience stores and pharmacies began to reopen on Monday, Zong said, adding they would be followed by hair salons and wholesale agricultural markets.\n\nTrain services to and from Shanghai have also been gradually resuming since Monday, followed by domestic flights. Starting May 22, bus and subway services will resume. Passengers will need a negative Covid test – taken within 48 hours – to board public transport, according to Zong.\n\nShanghai residents unconvinced\n\nThe reopening roadmap was met with skepticism by some Shanghai residents who have lost trust in the local government.\n\nIn March, Shanghai authorities repeatedly denied the city would go into lockdown. Police even arrested two people accused of “spreading rumors” that such a measure was imminent.\n\nWhen the local government announced a two-stage lockdown in late March, it said it would last for only four days and promised daily supplies would be sufficient. But days turned into weeks, and many struggled to secure access to food and other daily necessities.\n\n“You can fool me, but please don’t do it too many times,” said a user on China’s Twitter-like Weibo platform, in a widely circulated comment.\n\nOn Chinese social media, some Shanghai residents said they were still not allowed to go outside despite their neighborhoods reporting no recent cases. Others lashed out at state media reports claiming life in the city is returning to normal.\n\nMeanwhile, an article on the website of the People’s Daily, the Communist Party’s mouthpiece, featuring pictures purporting to show reopened restaurants, cafes and supermarkets was lampooned.\n\n“Although I’m not allowed to go out in Shanghai, I can feel a real sense of warmth from your fake news. Thank you People’s Daily!” said one resident in a social media post under a hashtag that loosely translates as “the smell of cooking is coming back in Shanghai”.\n\n“Is that Shanghai in a parallel world?” asked another user under the same hashtag.\n\nThe hashtag, which has been viewed 140 million times, appears to have caught the attention of China’s internet censors; by Tuesday afternoon only posts published by official accounts under that hashtag could be viewed.\n\nSome Shanghai residents even left sarcastic comments on the official Weibo account of the “National Anti-Fraud Center,” an app launched by China’s Ministry of Public Security to fight phone scams.\n\n“Please go after the Shanghai government and let them shut up.

She will defeat one of the most prominent defenders of former President Donald Trump’s lies about the 2020 election. Her challenger, Republican Kari Lake, had repeatedly said she would not have certified President Joe Biden’s win in Arizona in 2020 and began baselessly sowing doubts about the governor’s race before it was called. Hobbs’ projected victory is a major win for Democrats in the battleground state that is turning more purple. Arizona is among four states that have flipped control of governorships: Arizona, Maryland and Massachusetts for Democrats; Nevada for Republicans.\n\n2. UVA shooting\n\nClasses at the University of Virginia remain canceled today as the school “continues to work through the emotional toll” of Sunday’s shooting that left three football players dead and two other people injured. The alleged 22-year-old gunman was arrested Monday about 80 miles east of Charlottesville, Virginia. Police have not yet shared a motive for the attack. The three football players who died in the shooting have been identified, including one junior who was a top wide receiver for the school this season. The university held a candlelight vigil Monday, drawing hundreds to the campus, as seen in this photo posted by the school’s football team. At least 68 shootings have unfolded this year on US school grounds, including 15 on college campuses, CNN data shows.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Police chief learns shooting suspect is in custody on live TV.

Air Travel\n\nSeveral airlines have been forced to pay more than $600 million in refunds to passengers for canceled or changed flights since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Department of Transportation announced this week. The department is also issuing more than $7 million in fines against six airlines for the “extreme delays in providing those refunds to passengers,” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said. Meanwhile, understaffed airlines are struggling to keep up with a rapid rise in demand for air travel and say they are bracing for a holiday vacation surge next week. More than 54 million people in the US are expected to travel over the Thanksgiving holiday period, according to AAA. If you have a flight booked in the near future, travel analysts recommend reserving airport parking spaces beforehand and allocating extra time for longer-than-usual TSA lines.\n\n4. Covid-19\n\nHealth officials say they’re planning to push this week for people to get boosted against Covid-19 in order to offer maximum protection around Thanksgiving, but overall uptake remains low. Just 10% of people ages 5 and older have received an updated booster dose, despite 73% of that population having gotten their first two shots, according to data from the CDC. Additionally, a new study published Monday said higher Covid-19 vaccination rates among US children could prevent thousands of pediatric hospitalizations and millions of missed school days. Preventing Covid hospitalizations would also help ease the strain on pediatric hospitals, which have been dealing with an increase in flu and RSV cases for several weeks as the respiratory virus season sweeps the US earlier than usual.\n\n5. Ukraine\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky presented a 10-point peace plan to end Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in a video speech to G20 leaders today. The steps include a path to nuclear safety, food security, and a special tribunal for alleged Russian war crimes, according to a transcript of the speech. Zelensky also urged G20 leaders to use all their power to “make Russia abandon nuclear threats” and called on Moscow to stop bombing Ukraine’s energy infrastructure as winter approaches. “Let Russia prove by its rejection of terror that it is really interested in the restoration of peace,” he said. Moscow has been isolated at this year’s G20 summit as multiple Western leaders vowed not to have any contact with its Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who is in attendance on behalf of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback He's orphaned by the war in Ukraine.

Provisional data from the CDC also shows the US surpassed the death milestone during the week ending on May 14, and a CNN analysis of data released by the agency shows that severe outcomes disproportionately affected older Americans and minority populations.\n\nAbout three-quarters of all Covid-19 deaths have been among seniors, including more than a quarter among people 85 and older, according to CDC data. And while racial and ethnic disparities have lessened over the course of the pandemic, the risk of dying from Covid-19 has been about two times higher for Blacks, Hispanics and American Indians compared to Whites in the US.\n\nLast week, President Joe Biden issued a proclamation marking a million deaths and ordered the American flag to fly half-staff, writing that the nation “must not grow numb to such sorrow.”\n\n“To heal, we must remember,” the President said in a statement. “We must remain vigilant against this pandemic and do everything we can to save as many lives as possible.”\n\nProvided to CNN\n\nAnd it all comes as Covid-19 cases are rising again across the country, with reported infections more than doubling over the past month in the US overall.

Still another is that Russia has a demographic challenge of huge proportions.”\n\n“There are also wider issues,” he continued, one of the most pressing questions being: “Can the world feed more than 10 billion people without intolerable strains on the planet’s resources?”\n\nDoes overpopulation drive climate change?\n\nThe idea that the world’s burgeoning human population could have serious consequences for the planet’s natural resources has been around since the late 1960s and early 1970s, with the publication of Paul Ehrlich’s The Population Bomb and Donella Meadows’ The Limits to Growth.\n\nAnd it is an idea that persists today. In 2020, at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, “famed primatologist Dr Jane Goodall remarked at the event that human population growth is responsible for the climate crisis, and that most environmental problems wouldn’t exist if our numbers were at the levels they were 500 years ago,” noted Heather Alberro, associate lecturer in political ecology at Nottingham Trent University, in The Conversation.\n\nBut although a seemingly “innocuous” comment, it is an argument that has “grim implications”. Most importantly, “focusing on human numbers obscures the true driver of many of our ecological woes”, especially as the rate at which the global population grows is slowing, she argues.\n\nIn 2018 the planet’s top emitters, North America and China, accounted for nearly half of global CO2 emissions. The comparatively high rates of consumption in these regions generate so much more CO2 than their counterparts in low-income countries that “an additional three to four billion people in the latter would hardly make a dent on global emissions”, she writes.\n\nIndeed, since the start of the millennium, “UN reports show that global resource use has been primarily driven by increases in affluence, not the population”, said The Washington Post.\n\nThis is “especially true in high- to upper-middle-income nations, which account for 78% of material consumption, despite having slower population growth rates than the rest of the world”, said the paper.\n\nMeanwhile, in low-income countries, whose share of the global population has “almost doubled”, the demand for resources has “stayed constant at just about 3% of the global total”.\n\n\n\nAnd concentrating on global population numbers isn’t just “misguided”, it can be “dangerous”, added the paper. When concern about population becomes central to environmental policy, said researcher Betsy Hartman, “racism and xenophobia are always waiting in the wings”.\n\n\n\n“It just shifts the discourse away from the real problem of who has power and how the economy is organized.”\n\nChallenges await\n\nNevertheless, “the challenges the pessimists anticipate aren’t imaginary”, said Vox. We have yet to figure out how to provide almost 11 billion people with a good standard of sustainable living in the year 2100.\n\nBut green and sustainable technology has been “rapidly improving” for some time, and with the population peak set to hit in almost 100 years it is helpful to remember that “almost all the technology that we have today to make civilization sustainable sounded like wild science fiction 80 years ago”.\n\nAnother reason for hope is that almost all analysts and population models agree that “without any totalitarian or coercive measures, populations will start declining”. The main point of disagreement “is simply when”.\n\nWhile the slow down of population growth comes with some concerns, such as ageing and shrinking workforce, “on the whole, we are much better positioned for sustainable growth than it looked in 1950”, said Vox.", "authors": ["The Week Staff"], "publish_date": "2022/07/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/11/20/michigan-covid-case-rate-face-mask-advisory-issued/8688930002/", "title": "1 in 10 COVID-19 cases in US are from Michigan as case rate soars", "text": "On the same day Michigan's fourth coronavirus surge hit a grim new milestone, shattering the record highest case rate thus far in the pandemic, the state health department issued an advisory imploring everyone ages 2 and older to wear masks indoors.\n\n\"Today, we are at another crucial point,\" Elizabeth Hertel, director of the state Department of Health and Human Services, said Friday in announcing the public health advisory that recommends — but does not mandate — mask wearing. \"We have a chance to turn the tide and these rising numbers around. ...

Gretchen Whitmer lifted all pandemic restrictions in the state — including mask requirements, the strategy has shifted to stressing personal responsibility around taking COVID-19 vaccines, wearing masks and taking other steps to reduce risk of transmission. They've urged local school districts and health departments to set their own mask requirements as well.\n\nDespite ad campaigns and incentives, including a statewide lottery, Michigan's COVID-19 vaccination rate has stagnated in recent months.

Anyone over age 5 is eligible for a free vaccine, and we strongly encourage it. Booster shots will soon be readily available for all adults, and we strongly encourage getting one of those as well. There is a growing toolbox of therapeutics to treat and manage COVID-19 cases.\n\n“In short, people this year are in a much better position to take steps to protect themselves and their loved ones. So, the growing trend around Michigan sees local health officers moving from mandates to advisories.\"\n\nHertel wouldn't say Friday what threshold of coronavirus cases or hospitalizations might trigger a new mask mandate statewide or for K-12 schools.\n\n\"Unfortunately, I can't predict the future,\" she said. \"And what we've all learned is that we really can't predict the future when it comes to COVID-19.\n\n\"We'll continue to watch case rates and other indicators very closely and make determinations as we see what transpires across the state. However, it is my most sincere hope that Michiganders will take this message very seriously going into the holidays as they start meeting with their close friends and families and the people that they love and do everything that they can to protect themselves and the people that they are around.\"\n\nDerusha said protecting yourself and others from the virus comes own to \"the same common-sense steps\" that have been recommended since the beginning.\n\n\"If you plan to be indoors in a crowded place for a significant length of time, use a mask,\" he said. \"Wash your hands frequently. If you’re not feeling well, stay home. If you believe you have COVID-19, get tested immediately and seek treatment early.

More than 35% of eligible Americans, including 28% of adults, still aren't fully vaccinated.\n\nNew cases in the U.S. climbed from an average of nearly 95,000 a day on Nov. 22 to almost 119,000 a day this week, and hospitalizations are up 25% from a month ago. The increases are almost entirely from the delta variant, though omicron has been confirmed in at least 21 states and is sure to spread even more.\n\nDeaths are running close to 1,600 a day on average, back up to where they were in October.

The second indication is consistent with what scientists have observed in South Africa, where the variant was first identified.\n\nDr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the CDC, told the Associated Press on Wednesday that of the 40-plus people known to be infected by omicron so far in the U.S., more than three-quarters were vaccinated, and one third had received a booster shot.\n\nHowever, she added that almost all the cases resulted in mild illness -- with cough, congestion and fatigue as the main symptoms. Only one case required hospitalization, and no deaths have been reported.\n\nAlso Wednesday, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that of the 12 people infected by omicron in an East Bay outbreak, 11 were vaccinated and boosted staffers of an Oakland hospital who attended an out-of-state wedding. The newspaper said all have mild symptoms.\n\nPfizer says booster shot provides protection against omicron\n\nA third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine appears to protect against omicron, the troubling new variant of the coronavirus that has been confirmed in at least 21 U.S. states and more than 50 countries.\n\nThe companies said Wednesday that two doses of their vaccine may provide protection from severe disease but may not be sufficient to protect against infection with omicron, according to preliminary lab data. A third dose offers more robust protection, providing a level of neutralizing antibodies against omicron similar to the level observed after two doses against the original coronavirus and other variants.\n\nAntibody levels predict how well a vaccine may prevent infection with the coronavirus, but they are just one layer of the immune system’s defenses. The companies are also developing an omicron-specific vaccine.\n\n\"The first line of defense with two doses of vaccination might be compromised (by omicron), and three doses of vaccination are required to restore protection, Özlem Türeci, BioNTech's chief medical officer, said in a Wednesday news conference.\n\nScientists and health officials are still conducting studies to learn more about omicron. Early information indicates it could be more contagious but perhaps less dangerous than previous variants such as delta.\n\n– Contributing: Karen Weintraub\n\nMost Americans are concerned about omicron but won't nix holiday travel, poll shows\n\nLess than two weeks after news of the omicron variant of the coronavirus spread worldwide, the vast majority of Americans have heard of it. While most are at least somewhat concerned about the variant, few say they will change their holiday plans because of it.\n\nAn Axios-Ipsos poll conducted Dec. 3 through Dec. 6 found that 94% of Americans have heard of omicron. Forty-seven percent of Americans said they've heard of it but know almost nothing about it.\n\nNearly three-quarters of Americans, 71%, said they were at least somewhat concerned by the variant. But only 23% said they would cancel holiday travel, and 28% said they would stop gathering with people outside their households, the survey found.\n\nJudge blocks Biden's vaccine mandate for federal workers\n\nA federal judge has ruled in favor of seven states and several contractors in the legal battle over enforcement of a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for federal contractors.\n\nIn a 28-page order released Tuesday, U.S. District Court Judge R. Stan Baker granted the states a preliminary injunction that halts enforcement of President Joe Biden's executive order that required all federal contractors to have their employees vaccinated.\n\nQuoting a federal judge in Kentucky who also granted an injunction halting the enforcement of vaccine mandates last week, Baker wrote: \"This case is not about whether vaccines are effective. They are.\" And Baker acknowledged the tragic toll of COVID in the United States and around the world.\n\n\"However, even in times of crisis, this court must preserve the rule of law and ensure that all branches of government act within the bounds of their constitutionally granted authority,\" Baker wrote.\n\n– Sandy Hodson, The Augusta Chronicle\n\n91-year-old UK woman reflects on being first to get COVID vaccine one year later\n\nMargaret Keenan told the BBC on Wednesday that she has had a \"wonderful year\" since becoming the first person to get a COVID-19 vaccine in the West's first mass immunization program. And she's still encouraging others to get vaccinated.\n\nKeenan, 91, got her Pfizer-BioNTech shot in the UK on Dec. 8, 2020, dubbed \"V-Day\" or \"Victory Day\" by then-Health Secretary Matt Hancock – a phrase that typically refers to the Allied victories in World War II. Images of Keenan rolling up her sleeve made news outlets worldwide and video showed hospital staff applauding.\n\nThe landmark moment in the coronavirus pandemic came less than a year after the disease first emerged.\n\nKeenan, a former jewelry shop employee originally from Northern Ireland, told BBC that when strangers approach her in the street to thank her, she tells them to \"please, please do have the jab.\n\n\"Don't think about it. Just go and have it done,\" she said.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/12/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/01/us/eid-al-fitr-ramadan-muslim-american-milestones/index.html", "title": "Eid al-Fitr Ramadan 2022: These young Muslim Americans have hit ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nSix months after Mussab Ali started his first year of Harvard Law School, he was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and underwent chemotherapy during Ramadan.\n\nAli was 23 at the time and had just become the youngest school board president to lead Jersey City public schools in New Jersey – a feat he strove toward for years – just as the district was navigating the coronavirus pandemic in winter 2021.\n\nSuddenly, the virus was not only a health issue discussed during intense board meetings on how to safely reopen schools.\n\nAs a Hodgkin’s lymphoma cancer patient, Ali’s life depended on not catching the virus that had already killed hundreds of thousands of Americans. He also felt pressured to meet his obligations as a law student and a school board official – all while battling cancer.\n\n“The struggle aspect of it was this impossible balancing act,” Ali told CNN. “I think back, having gone through that and coming out the other side, it’s kind of ridiculous.”\n\nAt the time, Ali was living with his family in their Jersey City home while undergoing chemotherapy and attending law school virtually. His mother quit her job as a teacher in New York to avoid catching the virus, and his father and siblings went to great lengths in their months-long quarantine.\n\n“It was very lonely. I didn’t have a sense of community. I didn’t get to feel this very special month where you get to see people and celebrate every night,” Ali recalled.\n\nDue to his treatment, Ali couldn’t fast during Ramadan, which is one of the most communal times of the year for millions of Muslims around the world.\n\nRamadan serves as a spiritual resetting for Muslims who use the holy month to become closer to God through increased prayer, Quran reading, giving to charity and the general practice of good deeds.\n\nThe annual ritual is marked by abstaining from food, drink and sexual activity from a little before the sun rises until the sun sets in a practice of self-discipline and patience. The general goal is to nurture those habits and maintain them beyond Ramadan, which ends Sunday at sundown this year.\n\nMuslims usually gather with family and friends for iftar, the meal after sunset that breaks the daylong fast – a tradition Ali described as “Thanksgiving every night for 30 days.”\n\nBut last year, Ali didn’t experience any of that.\n\n“I just remember struggle,” Ali said.\n\nAli, now 25, said he’s filled with gratitude to experience his first Ramadan this year as a cancer survivor after praying to reach the milestone.\n\n“For some people, especially for non-Muslim people, that might be a weird thing to have been asking for – asking to have the ability to not eat all day,” Ali said. “But that’s something that I really wanted.”\n\nMussab Ali survived cancer last year after being diagnosed during his first year of law school. Carlos Khalil Guzman\n\nFor millions of Muslims, this Ramadan marks a particularly special milestone. It’s the first time many have been able to safely celebrate together since the pandemic began. It’s also the first time many are observing the holy month after undergoing significant changes in their own lives.\n\nCNN spoke with Muslim Americans who reflected on how this year’s Ramadan marks a turning point for them. Here’s what they had to say.\n\nFirst Ramadan as a Muslim convert\n\nAmanda Rushlow’s soul-searching journey began with an existential question: “I remember asking God, ‘What do I need to do to get into heaven?’”\n\nThe question came during a plant medicine ceremony in Peru last year at a time in her life when she was on a search for spirituality and trying to get closer to God.\n\nThe answer was an epiphany that led her to read the Bible extensively and explore Christianity, but she noticed what she described as “dissonance” in the faith between what was often preached versus what the Bible taught.\n\nThen she started having conversations about faith with a Muslim friend. To her surprise at the time, their beliefs had overwhelming similarities.\n\n“I remember so much would be aligning,” Rushlow told CNN. And she asked herself, “How is this true? … One of us has to be wrong, and I was very convinced that I was the one who was right.”\n\nWithin the US, there are about 3.45 million Muslims, according to 2017 estimates by the Pew Research Center.\n\nAnd while the population has been steadily growing, more than half of Americans say they don’t personally know someone who is Muslim, according to a 2021 Pew Research Center report. Another survey showed that 52% of Americans said they either know “not much” or “nothing at all” about Islam.\n\nAmanda Rushlow says she converted to Islam in January. The born-and-raised Catholic says a conversation with a Muslim friend first opened her eyes to the faith. Courtesy Amanda Rushlow\n\nRushlow took her friend’s advice to research Prophet Mohammed, whom Muslims believe is the messenger of the faith, but with the goal to find fault with the beliefs. And after going down the Internet rabbit hole where she sifted through articles and videos – it was time to go to the source: the Quran, Islam’s holy book.\n\nShe listened to it on a trip from her home in Michigan to Arizona.\n\n“I just couldn’t stop listening. I had headphones on the whole time I was hiking. Headphones on the entire flight there and back,” Rushlow told CNN.\n\nAnd then it hit her: “This is my God,” she said. “I was overwhelmed.”\n\nAs she reflects on her first Ramadan as a Muslim, she was filled with heartwarming emotions, especially during her first visit to a mosque during night prayers. She has also found community in the Detroit area with other women who converted to the faith.\n\n“My heart felt so raw and open,” she said.\n\nRushlow has spent the month reading the Quran, journaling and building the habit to pray the five daily obligatory prayers.\n\n“It felt like such a gift receiving Islam. It’s an honor … I will not eat happily out of obedience and out of submission,” she said. “It warms my heart so much to be able to participate.”\n\nFirst Ramadan in a new city as a queer Muslim\n\nFor the past five years, Sharmin Hossain has been missing out on the Ramadan spirit.\n\nThe 29-year-old was in a relationship and lived in New York City with a partner who didn’t observe the holy month. She also didn’t tend to her other spiritual practices.\n\n“I just did not have anybody to break fast with,” she said. “I remember how alone I was.”\n\nFor Hossain, this Ramadan has marked a new phase in her life. She’s single for the first time in five years, and she’s using the time to go to Friday prayers more, “which is a big deal for me,” Hossain said, adding that she goes offline for two hours to attend the weekly sermon and prayer.\n\nSharmin Hossain is single for the first time in five years and has been spending more time on spiritual practices during this Ramadan. Courtesy Sharmin Hossain\n\nShe’s also marking the holy month in a new city after moving to Philadelphia a few months ago.\n\n“The first few days were actually surprisingly some of the most beautiful days because all my friends would break fast with me every day,” Hossain said.\n\nOne of her close friends who isn’t Muslim has also been working out and breaking fast with her.\n\n“The communal part of it is something I didn’t know was really missing from my experiences and why previous Ramadans were so much harder just getting through the day,” she said.\n\nThis year, Philadelphia’s slower pace has also allowed for more community gatherings.\n\n“It just feels very close and tender,” she told CNN. “This was definitely a more special Ramadan being single and being able to intentionally fast differently and go out to prayers by myself.”\n\nAs a queer Muslim, she said she’s often on the receiving end of people’s surprised reactions when they learn she practices the faith.\n\nAfter her divorced parents learned of her queer identity about five years ago, she became estranged from her mother. But her father has been accepting and supportive of who she is.\n\n“When I’m in a mosque, I’m not thinking, ‘Oh, I’m a queer Muslim. May Allah forgive me and accept my prayers,’” she said. “I go into the mosque knowing that I’m a divine creature of the most Divine, and Allah knows that I worship Him and Him only, and I’m here to do that and not a sinner because I exist as a queer Muslim.”\n\nFirst full Ramadan away from family\n\nLiving alone for the first time brings its own set of challenges, and with Ramadan coming at a time when Mohsin Mirza was taking on a new job thousands of miles from family and friends, it added to the emotionally and mentally challenging experience.\n\n“I definitely miss the community environment. There are people whose faces you don’t see except for a few months of the year, and this is one of those months,” said Mirza, 28, who recently moved to Washington, DC, from California’s Bay Area.\n\n“There’s more homesickness now than there would be in another month,” he noted. “So there’s a certain detachment.”\n\nMohsin Mirza says his homesickness has intensified during his first Ramadan away from family. Courtesy Moshin Mirza\n\nMirza belongs to the Shia sect of Islam, which comprises of about 10-13% of the world’s Muslim population, according to a 2011 Pew Research Center report. Most Muslims follow the Sunni sect of the faith.\n\nRamadan is one of those times when Mirza feels a heightened sense of being a minority within a minority in the US because there are slight differences in how people in both sects choose to practice. Shia Muslims break their fast a little later than Sunni Muslims and commemorate certain days during the holy month in specific ways.\n\nWhile Mirza said he feels Ramadan brings the entire Muslim community together, he felt the distinctions more this year when he went to iftar events and was surrounded with Sunnis who rushed to break their fast before him.\n\n“It makes you feel a little different and puts you on the spot,” he said. “There’s always a hint of awkwardness. … It can be the source of some discomfort.”\n\nAt another event, times to break the fast were announced for both Shias and Sunnis.\n\n“It’s a kind of small example of respect and inclusion that helps those of us who are a minority within the broader Muslim community feel like institutions that have been set up for the Muslim community are for us as well,” he said.\n\nMirza also described experiencing some difficulty accessing a mosque for Shia Muslims in the DC area without a car. He has attended prayer at his local mosque, but he prefers to visit a Shia mosque when possible.\n\nOverall, Mirza said the experience has affirmed his view that the Muslim community worldwide is more similar than different.\n\n“In so many spaces, our communities are integrated and working together,” he said. “When those differences come up, they’re an opportunity to have discussions about why, and that can lead to mutual respect and understanding.”", "authors": ["Aya Elamroussi"], "publish_date": "2022/05/01"}]}

This story is a compilation of the dozens of stories produced. Read them all here.\n\nHurricane Irma swallowed the state of Florida in mid September, causing flooding and damage from Key West to Jacksonville. The Treasure Coast remained in the cone of uncertainty for days and at one point, Irma's eye was forecasted to pass directly over Martin County.\n\nIrma's path moved west and took aim at the Florida Keys, Marco Island and Naples.\n\nThe storm was so massive though, St. Lucie County saw wind gusts up to 100 mph and more than 20 inches of rain in some areas, according to the National Weather Service, Melbourne.\n\nTop rainfall amounts by county\n\nSt. Lucie: 21.7 inches\n\nIndian River: 14.2 inches\n\nFinal rainfall amounts for Martin County were not listed as of Sept. 12\n\nTop wind speeds by county\n\nSt. Lucie: 100 mph on South Hutchinson Island\n\nMartin: 75 mph at South Fork High School\n\nIndian River: 62 mph at Vero Beach City Hall\n\nTop sustained winds by county\n\nSt. Lucie: 71 mph on South Hutchinson Island\n\nMartin: 55 mph in Jensen Beach\n\nIndian River: 37 mph at Vero Beach City Hall\n\nBefore\n\nWith the Category 4 storm nearly a week away, many Treasure Coast residents spent their Labor Day, Sept. 4, shopping for hurricane supplies.\n\nBy Monday afternoon, shelves of water had been emptied at Walmart in Vero Beach, and a water-filling station stayed busy at Peter's Hardware Center in Palm City.\n\nGov. Rick Scott that same afternoon declared a state of emergency for Florida's 67 counties. He issued the executive order to give local governments time, resources and flexibility to prepare for Irma.\n\nBy Sept. 6, Treasure Coast emergency management officials urged residents to put up storm shutters as soon as possible. Gov. Scott suspended tolls on toll roads as many residents had decided to evacuate. Irma now was a Category 5 with winds up to 185 mph and the National Weather Service was predicting a hit to South Florida\n\nAnticipating a “severe and ferocious” impact from Hurricane Irma, companies like Florida Power and Light and Xfinity began steeling for damage the unprecedented storm could bring.\n\nMore: A look inside FPL's Hurricane Irma 'bunker'\n\nTreasure Coast officials began planning to open emergency shelters, but because Hurricane Irma's expected track still was unclear details on shelters varied by county.\n\nMore: Irma prep bittersweet for Palm City woman who recently lost son\n\nOn Sept. 7, there were mandatory evacuations of the Glades communities south of Lake Okeechobee in an \"overabundance of caution\" ahead of Hurricane Irma.\n\nMeanwhile, there was heavy traffic moving north out of the Treasure Coast as many residents opted to evacuate ahead of the storm. Some drivers ran out of fuel or broke down on the area's two major roadways, but Florida Highway Patrol Sgt. Kim Montes said officials got the cars out of the way and managed to help drivers get back on the road.\n\nHurricane Irma was being called the most powerful Atlantic Ocean hurricane in recorded history and some were using the term \"Apocalyptic\".\n\nThere was talk of Irma cutting a new inlet along Hutchinson Island and whether Lake Okeechobee water could flow over the top of three work sites along the Herbert Hoover Dike began to circulate.\n\nOfficials let out a sigh of relief early Sept. 8 as the direct path of Hurricane Irma was projected to shift away from the Treasure Coast.\n\nStill, many areas remained under a mandatory evacuation beginning Sept. 9, including South Hutchinson Island and the Jupiter barrier island.\n\nSt. Lucie County, however, lifted its mandatory evacuation order of the barrier island, mobile homes and low-lying areas, but asked residents to consider voluntary evacuation.\n\nPreparing for the worst, places like downtown Stuart were completely shuttered, vacant of most people. Bridges to the barrier islands closed and some counties cut water to the islands.\n\nMore: Homeless abandon tents in the woods for shelter as Irma nears\n\nScott closed Florida public schools and universities for several days ahead of Irma.\n\nBy 11 p.m. Sept. 8, Irma strengthened back to a Category 5 hurricane with maximum sustained winds up to 160 mph, with higher gusts. As the storm was making landfall in Cuba, the Treasure Coast was put under a hurricane warning.\n\nDuring\n\nFlood watches were announced Sept.9 as the Treasure Coast began feeling the affects of Irma's outer rain bands.\n\nBut that didn't stop people from heading out before hunkering down. White City Park was dotted with downed palm fronds and just a handful of visitors late Saturday morning.

Indian River County Fire Rescue workers rescued a pregnant woman who was trapped in her home because of flood waters, and got her to the hospital in time to deliver a baby girl.\n\nNearly a quarter of a million people lost power on the Treasure Coast, part of the 7 million without power statewide.\n\nCounties received \"numerous\" reports of roads being flooded and water breaching homes. Several drivers were rescued who underestimated the depth of the water on several roadways. Law enforcement responded to calls until \"wind limitation\" was reached.\n\nAfter\n\nBy Sept. 12, Irma had moved on. The storm hammered some yet spared others on the same streets in the same neighborhoods. Stoplights were out, trees were down, beaches were eroded and thousands remained without power.\n\nResidents fighting cabin fever headed out anyway despite pleas from officials to stay home.

Read USA TODAY's text-only storm updates.\n\nNEW ORLEANS — After slamming into Louisiana's coast as a Category 4 storm Sunday, Ida has been downgraded to a tropical storm Monday morning, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nIda has been blamed for at least one death. Late Sunday, the Ascension Parish Sheriff's Office confirmed a storm-related death but released few details, adding that deputies responded to a home in Prairieville, Louisiana, on a report of someone injured by a fallen tree.\n\nThe person, who was not identified, was pronounced dead. Prairieville is between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, and Ida's eye appeared to have passed close by, according to radar images.\n\n\"Tonight, we have confirmed at least one death and sadly, we know there will be others,\" Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said in a statement late Sunday. \"Thousands of our people are without power and there is untold damage to property across the impacted parishes.\"\n\nEdwards said President Joe Biden officially declared Ida a disaster, releasing federal funds to assist with rescue and recovery efforts, which will begin in earnest Monday morning.\n\nIda's winds when it came ashore — it's tied for the fifth-strongest hurricane to ever hit the U.S. mainland — also snapped trees and flipped over trucks. Its storm surge submerged cars, flooded streets and temporarily reversed the Mississippi River's flow near Belle Chase, according to preliminary data from the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nAs it was downgraded early Monday to a tropical, its maximum winds dropped to 60 mph 7, and centered 95 miles south-southwest of Jackson, Mississippi\n\nShortly after 7 p.m., the New Orleans Office of Homeland Security & Emergency Preparedness confirmed the city had lost power.\n\n\"Due to catastrophic transmission damage, all of Orleans Parish is currently without power,\" utility company Entergy texted customers. The company said it was providing emergency power to the city's Sewerage and Water Board but that residents should not expect electricity to be restored overnight.\n\nThe howling winds peeled off the roof of the 25-bed Lady of the Sea General Hospital in Galliano, Louisiana, although authorities said no one was hurt.\n\nLate Sunday, the National Weather Service issued a flash-flood warning for Central Jefferson Parish in southeastern Louisiana, saying local law enforcement reported a failing levee in the Lafitte and Jean Lafitte areas, with 200 people endangered.\n\nSunday evening in New Orleans’ Mid City, the usually lively Esplanade Avenue was empty of cars and devoid of light save for the few houses where generators kept the power alive. Pieces of the street’s iconic oaks lay in dark heaps in the middle of the road. For longtime New Orleans residents, the storm wasn’t anything they hadn’t seen before.\n\nJosh Pedigo, a 50-year-old local bartender, watched the storm from his porch in Mid City. He had spent the morning gathering supplies but said the storm “ain’t that bad.”\n\nHalf a block away, Michael Nuwer sat at home with his candles lit. He said it was strange seeing the street so empty, but that he had seen stronger storms in his 31 years of living in the city.\n\n“It’s about the same as Hurricane Zeta,” Nuwer said, referring to the 2020 hurricane that was the strongest to hit New Orleans since Hurricane Katrina. “It’s just lasting a bit longer. I feel completely safe.”\n\nInstead, Nuwer said he worried for those further south where Ida had brought its full force earlier in the day. Comprehensive damage estimates won't happen until daybreak.\n\nNuwer said he knew people in Bayou Gauche whose neighbors saw their roof torn off. Standing outside his front door, watching the strongest winds of the day whip through his city, Nuwer said his thoughts were elsewhere.\n\n“I really feel for those people in Houma and Thibodeaux,” he said. “It’s awful over there and it’s going to be a long time before things get back to normal.\"\n\nThe storm first crashed ashore near Port Fourchon, less than 100 miles south of New Orleans. A short time later it made a second landfall a few miles to the north, near Galliano. By then, power was out to more than 300,000 homes and businesses in the state, according to the tracking website poweroutage.us. That figure closed in on 750,000-plus by early evening as it moved through Houma and headed toward New Orleans, where officials urged calm for those who chose to not to evacuate.\n\nForecasters said Ida remained highly dangerous as it approached more populated areas already inundated with hours of rain. Ida is expected to remain a hurricane overnight but weaken to a tropical storm by Monday afternoon.\n\n\"A turn toward the north is expected overnight, followed by a slightly faster northeastward motion by Monday night and Tuesday,\" the National Hurricane Center said Sunday evening. \"On the forecast track, the center of Ida will move farther inland over southeastern Louisiana tonight. Ida is then forecast to move well inland over portions of western Mississippi Monday and Monday night, and move across the Tennessee Valley on Tuesday.\"\n\nEdwards, the governor, said Ida could be the most powerful hurricane to hit the state in more than 160 years. Hurricane Katrina, which flooded most of New Orleans, killing almost 2,000 people and causing damages estimated at $125 billion, made landfall 16 years ago to the day – as a lesser Category 3 storm.\n\n“This is going to be much stronger than we usually see and, quite frankly, if you had to draw up the worst possible path for a hurricane in Louisiana, it would be something very, very close to what we’re seeing,” Edwards told The Associated Press.\n\nMore:Hurricane Ida rips off part of roof at Lady of the Sea hospital after Louisiana landfall\n\nEdwards acknowledged Sunday that the state faced a difficult few weeks. But he said levees rebuilt in the wake of Katrina should stand up to the challenge and help minimize the harm.\n\n\"All the models that we've seen ... show the hurricane storm damage risk-reduction system will hold and perform as intended,\" Edwards said. \"Will it be tested? Yes. But it was built for this moment.\"\n\nBiden, speaking at the Federal Emergency Management Agency's National Response Coordination Center in Washington, said the damage is likely to be \"immense.\" He said resources, equipment and response teams were prepositioned and urged residents to follow the instructions of emergency officials and first responders.\n\n\"We are praying for the best and preparing for the worst,\" Biden said.\n\nDon't miss crucial coverage:Stay updated on the latest news about Hurricane Ida and its aftermath with the Daily Briefing\n\nIda was forecast to move well inland over portions of Louisiana and western Mississippi on Monday night. The National Weather Service issued a tornado watch for parts of Louisiana, including New Orleans, as well as parts of Florida, Mississippi and Alabama. Flooding was already underway in parts of Mississippi on Sunday morning.\n\nNew Orleans officials urged residents who did not evacuate to remain sheltered until the city can assess damage, likely Monday morning.\n\n\"Be calm in the midst of this storm,\" Mayor LaToya Cantrell said. \"You have everything you need. We will get through this together.\"\n\nCity officials also expressed confidence in the flood protection system, which underwent a $14 billion upgrade after failing during Katrina. Hurricane Ida could dump up to 20 inches of rain on the city, Deputy City Administrator Officer Ramsey Green said.\n\nHowever, a levee overtopped in Plaquemines Parish south of New Orleans, prompting officials to issue a warning.\n\nNew Orleans residents were asked to conserve water because of an electrical outage affecting the sewer system. Local utility Entergy New Orleans said it had provided extra generators and is working to find the cause of the outage, which did not affect the pumping system that clears the city of floodwaters, Green said.\n\nStill, \"it's an incredibly fragile system. That system can change at any point,\" Green warned.\n\nIda intensified so swiftly over three days that Cantrell said last week there was no time to organize a mandatory evacuation. She had, however, urged the city's 390,000 residents to leave voluntarily and warned those who stayed to prepare for long power outages.\n\nResidents of the capital city of Baton Rouge, about 80 miles northwest of New Orleans, were also advised to leave for safer ground, but not all had the capability.\n\n“Our bank account is empty – we can’t afford to leave,” said Robert Owens, 27, who had little choice but to ride out the storm at his family's duplex apartment with his wife, mother-in-law, roommate and four pets, lacking the money for gas and a hotel room to go elsewhere.\n\nIda, moving over the extremely warm waters of the Gulf, saw its top winds grow by 45 mph in five hours. The phenomenon, known as \"rapid intensification,\" is typically defined as a tropical cyclone whose wind speeds increase at least 35 mph in 24 hours, according to Colorado State University meteorologist Phil Klotzbach. That can happen when a storm encounters an extremely conducive environment such as very warm water, low vertical wind shear and high levels of mid-level moisture.\n\n\"This is a sight no one wants to see on satellite,\" the National Weather Service tweeted as Ida advanced, calling the storm a \"serious, life-threatening situation.\"\n\nThe winds began whipping through New Orleans on Sunday as the outer edge of Ida approached. As the power outages commenced, Entergy said 16,000 crew members were ready to assess damages and restore power when conditions allowed.\n\n\"Conditions will be extremely hazardous,\" the city Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness tweeted. \"Power lines may fall and debris could become projectiles. Get inside and stay inside.\"\n\nResidents were heeding the warnings. Aside from the gusting wind, the scene was eerily quiet in New Orleans' empty streets as the storm approached. During lesser storms, cars park atop curbs or pack onto grassy medians that divide many of the roads. But ahead of Ida, few cars could be seen, a sign that many local had fled ahead of the storm.\n\nUSA TODAY Hurricane Tracker\n\nA few miles northeast of Port Fourchon, Grand Isle Police Chief Scooter Resweber said the roof of the police station was imperiled on the barrier island.\n\n\"We're still in the middle of this thing.\" Resweber said. \"The lower floor and all of the police cars are flooded.\"\n\nIn Terrebonne Parish, 50 miles southwest of New Orleans, Sheriff Tim Soignet said at least 60% of residents had evacuated. The Terrebonne Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness posted on its Facebook page that, because of dangerously high winds, emergency medical services were no longer operating there.\n\n\"Please remain indoors and away from windows,\" the post said. \"Stay safe Terrebonne!\"\n\nThe nonprofit Cajun Navy Foundation is planning to send its Cajun Navy Ground Force to Houma, Louisiana, in Terrebonne Parish, on Monday once the situation is safe, foundation founder Rob Gaudet said.\n\nHe estimated that more than 100 volunteers will descend to the area to help with cleanup and other related efforts.\n\n“We feel an even greater sense of urgency to be prepared,” Gaudet said. “And we went, actually last night, and purchased about three more chainsaws and kits.”\n\nVolunteer Jay Carter, of Georgia, said his son texted him while he was on his way to Louisiana. His son didn't want Carter to leave.\n\n“I basically told him that we all do this because one day if you’re ever in trouble, our kids, ourselves, then hopefully someone like the Cajun Navy will come along help us as well,” Carter said.\n\nMore than 2,000 FEMA emergency personnel were deployed to Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas, including seven FEMA Incident Management Assistance Teams in Louisiana and Mississippi, the agency said.\n\nStorm preparations were complicated by the pandemic. Louisiana has been overwhelmed with cases, and most hospitals were preparing to continue operating through the storm. Ochsner Health, Louisiana's largest hospital system, equipped its hospitals with power generators and boilers to ensure the availability of hot water and power.\n\nHere's what you need to know about flash floods: 'They can occur in all 50 states'\n\nEdwards said shelters would operate with reduced capacities to reflect the \"realities of COVID.” Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Customs and Border Protection agencies said they would not conduct immigration enforcement at locations where disaster and emergency relief was being provided.\n\nOn Saturday, more than 90% of the Gulf of Mexico’s oil production was shut down as Ida churned through the western Gulf of Mexico. About 85% of the Gulf’s natural gas production had also been halted, according to the federal Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement.\n\nWorkers had been evacuated from at least half of the 560 production platforms in the Gulf, according to the bureau.\n\nFive named systems have reached the U.S. this year, but Ida was the first to make landfall at hurricane strength.\n\nBacon reported from Arlington, Virginia.

The Florida Medical Examiners Commission reported a death in Martin County, an additional death in Manatee County and an additional death in Sarasota County attributed to Hurricane Ian, according to a news release from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.\n\nIan also claimed the lives of four people in North Carolina.\n\nThe storm slammed into Florida as a furious Category 4 hurricane last Wednesday. Days later, some residents of island communities are cut off from the mainland, hundreds of thousands of people are without power and many Floridians have found themselves homeless.\n\nAs of Tuesday evening, about 400,573 customers in Florida were without power, according to PowerOutage.us. Many outages remain in hard-hit Lee and Charlotte counties, with 208,263 outages in Lee County and 75,721 outages in Charlotte County. Outages also continue to be tracked in Sarasota, Manatee, Collier, Hendry, Hardee, and Desoto counties.\n\nIn some cases, government officials dealing with recovery efforts are among those who lost their homes.\n\nFort Myers Beach City Councilman Bill Veach said his 90-year-old cottage is in ruins, with only one section that was a recent addition left standing. Pieces of his home were found two blocks away, he said.\n\n“When you are walking around the ruins, it’s an apocalyptic scene,” Veach said of his neighborhood.\n\nStill, even in the wreckage, there have been moments of hope, he said.\n\n“You see a friend that you weren’t sure was alive or dead and that brings you joy. A joy that is so much more than the loss of property,” he added.\n\nDebris lies around Bill Veach's badly damaged home in Fort Myers Beach. Bill Veach\n\nRescuers have been coming to the aid of trapped residents via boat and aircraft. Statewide, more than 2,300 rescues have been made and over 1,000 urban search and rescue personnel have checked 79,000 structures, Gov. Ron DeSantis said during a news conference Tuesday. The governor also announced the opening of the first Disaster Recovery Center – or “one-stop shop” – in Fort Myers for residents and businesses that have been affected by Hurricane Ian.\n\nLive updates: Hurricane Ian’s aftermath in Florida\n\nSome residents who were anxiously waiting to hear from their loved ones have received unimaginable news.\n\nStacy Verdream told CNN she and her brother found out Monday their uncle, Mike Verdream, died in the storm. Mike Verdream decided to ride out Hurricane Ian in Matlacha, Florida, and planned to go to his boss’ two-story home if things got too bad.\n\nStacy Verdream said she spoke with her uncle briefly on Wednesday. Her cousin spoke with him later that day and he said the water was 4 feet deep before telling her he had to go.\n\n“It was a very brief call because he said he was very scared and she’d never heard him like that, because he wasn’t that type of person. He’s always put on a brave face,” Stacy Verdream said. “But she said he sounded absolutely terrified.”\n\nThe family was unable to reach Mike Verdream because his phone was wet, his niece said. A detective told Stacy Verdream on Tuesday that her uncle was found in a canal on Friday. The condition of his body was consistent with other victims that had been recovered, Verdream said. Authorities used medical records to identify her uncle because his face was not recognizable, Verdream said. An autopsy is scheduled for Wednesday.\n\n“He was always there for me growing up, teaching me how to drive and taking me to the fair,” she said. “The cool uncle that would buy me like a dirt bike and bought the Jet ski for us to, like, go out on the lake. He just loved us to death.”\n\nA home lies in ruins Monday in the wake of Hurricane Ian in Fort Myers Beach. Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nElizabeth McGuire’s family said they last spoke with her Wednesday and had been having trouble reaching her. They learned Friday that the 49-year-old had been found dead in her Cape Coral home.\n\nPolice told her family she died in her bed holding her cell phone and it looked like she died instantly, her son Andrew Chedester said.\n\nMcGuire’s mother, Susan McGuire, said the destruction of the storm “is massive.”\n\n“One hundred blizzards will not cost you what one hurricane will cost you,” said Susan McGuire, who moved to Florida from Maryland a few years ago. “My husband’s business whipped out, my daughter is dead … I never had a blizzard take anything away from me.”\n\nHomes are ‘unlivable’ on islands cut off from the mainland, with ‘alligators running around’\n\nOn Sanibel Island, now cut off from the Florida peninsula after Ian wiped out a portion of the roadway connecting them, every house shows damage, Sanibel Fire Chief William Briscoe said.\n\n“There are a lot of places that are not livable. There are places off their foundation, and it’s very dangerous out there,” Briscoe said. “There are alligators running around, and there are snakes all over the place.”\n\nCrews have evacuated 1,000 people from Sanibel since Ian ripped through the island, Briscoe said.\n\nSanibel Mayor Holly Smith told CNN Tuesday that residents will be allowed back on the island Wednesday to assess the damage to their property, but the island is still “extremely unsafe.”\n\n“Roads are 90% clear on the island … meaning that there’s enough vehicular access that has been cut through the debris so vehicles and employees servicing the island can get through,” Dana Souza, Sanibel city manager, said.\n\nSanibel remains under a 24-hour curfew. Tomorrow, residents and business owners can access the island between 7 a.m. and 7p.m., Souza said. The National Guard will work with police to enforce checkpoints throughout the island, making sure that only those with a resident ID or hurricane pass are onsite.\n\n“We’re only allowing people who are Sanibel residents, business owners or property owners, back on the island and you must have those credentials. If you don’t have them, they will ask you to leave,” Souza said.\n\nA similar situation is playing out on nearby Pine Island, the largest barrier island on Florida’s Gulf Coast. Just days ago, it was a tranquil fishing and kayaking destination known for its small-town atmosphere. Now it’s a scene of carnage, with cracked roadways and destroyed homes.\n\nIan destroyed the only bridge to Pine Island, making it only accessible by boat or aircraft. Supplies are now being airdropped to the island by helicopter as some residents choose to stay, authorities said.\n\nCounty officials are trying to get a temporary ferry service for Sanibel, Sheriff Carmine Marceno said Tuesday. For Pine Island, work is underway to install a temporary bridge, with a goal to have it ready by the end of the week, DeSantis has said.\n\nEmergency physician Dr. Ben Abo, who joined rescuers on Pine Island, said crews are encountering residents who were in denial the storm would hit the area and are now running out of supplies.\n\n“I’m seeing a lot of despair, but I’m also seeing hope,” Abo said. “I’m seeing urban search and rescue, fire rescue, bringing hope to people that we’re going to get through this. But we have to do it in stages.”\n\nThe National Guard will also be flying power crews to Sanibel and Pine islands to start working on restoring power. It could take at least a month to restore power for some places on those islands, Lee County Electric Cooperative spokesperson Karen Ryan said Tuesday.\n\nDeSantis said Tuesday he has already visited Pine Island and will likely visit Sanibel Island Wednesday, one week after it was ravaged by Hurricane Ian.\n\n“We’re gonna have that bridge patched this week,” DeSantis said Tuesday of Pine Island. “Yesterday we had 130 (Florida Department of Transportation) trucks that were there working to get this temporary bridge fixed. It will be done this week.”\n\nDeSantis also directed the state’s transportation department to prioritize the repair of the Sanibel Causeway. A contract for the repair was awarded Tuesday with the end goal of having the causeway fully repaired by the end of the month, according to a news release.\n\nRight now, emergency repairs to the causeway will help first responders and emergency services access the barrier island to aid with recovery efforts, power restoration, and removal of debris. Long-term repairs will follow, giving residents “drivable” access to and from the mainland.\n\n“The Sanibel Causeway was affected when the land that the road was built on was washed away,” FDOT Secretary Jared Perdue said in a statement. “A bridge stability analysis will be performed, and repairs needed range from repairing bridge approaches to restoring the roadway across most of the causeway.”\n\nAt Fort Myers Beach, where storm surge and wind combined to wipe out numerous homes and businesses, it may also take a month to restore power due to damage to the electrical infrastructure,” Lee County Manager Roger Desjarlais said.\n\nFlorida Army National Guard members help Tim Tuitt, left, and John Davis as they are evacuated from Fort Myers Beach on Monday. Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nAs rescue efforts continue, it’s unclear how many are still missing\n\nIt’s unclear how many people remain unaccounted for after the storm. Florida Division of Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie said authorities are working to consolidate a list of the missing.\n\nSearch teams have been combing a 7-mile stretch of Fort Myers Beach for days, looking for anyone still in need of help. One of the teams, South Florida Task Force 2, found 150 people trapped in homes in its first 48 hours in the community, some of whom had ascended to attics to avoid floodwater, it said.\n\nOn Monday, the team still was helping people off the island town, as well as telling them where to get food and water. The team has found people who died at Fort Myers Beach, but it has not said how many.\n\nBob and Rosemary Kopsack were among those the team helped off the island Monday, after the storm ruined virtually everything inside their home. Bob Kopsack still didn’t know the fate of at least one of their friends on the island.\n\n“Our best friend, we have not been able to contact him … and he’d said he’s not leaving the island. And I hope he did,” he said. “His phone’s out. … I’ve sent the police over to his home.”\n\nIn Lee County, which includes Fort Myers and Fort Meyers Beach, more than half the schools had at least some damage from Ian – and 14% had major damage, the school district said. Schools will reopen as quickly as possible, Superintendent Christopher Bernier said, without providing a timeline.\n\nAt Fort Myers Beach Elementary, mud lined a cafeteria; damaged desks, toppled supplies and other debris were piled up in a hallway; and water marks reached nearly to the tops of doorjambs, photos released by the district showed.\n\nDebris litters Fort Myers Beach Elementary in this photo released by the school district Monday. Lee County Schools\n\nCharlotte County Public Schools will be closed until further notice, according to spokesperson Mike Riley, who said that several of their 22 schools have been damaged by the storm.\n\nRiley said the district is having all the buildings inspected to make sure everything is safe before students and staff return.\n\n“The storm lasted here for over 12 hours, just hammering away. Nothing is safe right now,” he said.\n\nA Fort Myers man clung to branches for hours – and his daughters thought him lost\n\nSome residents who lost property and belongings are recounting narrow escapes.\n\nWhen Ian hit Florida’s west coast and floodwater surged through Fort Myers, Stan Pentz, 69, texted his daughter, Stephanie Downing, and told her the water was rising in his condo and he might drown. Then, he lost phone service, he told CNN on Tuesday.\n\nMore than an hour away, Downing assumed the worst. When she saw her sister the next day, “we just held each other and we just cried because we truly thought he was gone.”\n\nPentz managed to get out, however. Upon escaping his home, he was “swished away,” he recalled, and he latched onto some branches, clinging to them for hours, “with the wind blowing and the water gushing over my head. It was a long time.” After a while. the wind and water shifted and he reached the second floor of a building, where he huddled in a corner till sunrise, he said.\n\n“It just kept going and going. It wouldn’t stop and I was just thinking about my kids and my grandkids and just everybody I know, and they just kept me going in my mind,” he said.\n\nThe storm passed, and Pentz found someone to text Downing for him. Downing’s sister and brother-in-law drove down to Fort Myers and retrieved him.\n\nWhen Downing finally saw her dad, “I laid my head on his chest and I said, ‘Hey, Michael Phelps, you had a nice swim,’” she recalled as Pentz chuckled, playfully pantomiming slapping his daughter.\n\nPentz lost everything. He kicked his own submerged automobile as he swam to safety, he said. Downing said he’s now staying with her family at their Rotonda West home. A GoFundMe has raised thousands and a generous friend brought her dad some clothes and shoes. He was able to replace his cell phone and driver’s license Tuesday, Downing said.\n\n“We’re getting somewhere,” she said.\n\nMan says he moved through nearly half a mile of floodwater to rescue his mother\n\nA Naples man, meanwhile, trekked through nearly half a mile of floodwater to save his 85-year-old mother after Ian hit.\n\nJohnny Lauder, a former police officer, told CNN he sprang into action after his mother, who uses a wheelchair, called in a panic and said water was rushing into her home and reaching her chest.\n\nHe arrived at her home to find her neck-deep in floodwater, but happy to see her son.\n\n“The water was up to the windows, and I heard her screaming inside,” Lauder said. “It was a scare and a sigh of relief at the time – a scare thinking she might be hurt, a sigh of relief knowing that there was still air in her lungs.”\n\nLauder was able to bring his mother to safety as floodwaters began to recede.\n\nHospitals in Florida have been experiencing “significant pressure” on capacity since Ian hit, said Mary Mayhew, president and CEO of the Florida Hospital Association.\n\nEmergency departments have sustained damage, staffing has been impacted as many hospital workers have been displaced or lost their vehicles in the hurricane, and facilities lost reliable access to water.", "authors": ["Nouran Salahieh"], "publish_date": "2022/10/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/26/politics/key-dates-2022-midterm-election/index.html", "title": "Key dates for the 2022 midterm election | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nVoting ends in the first primaries for the 2022 midterm elections in a matter of days.\n\nTexas will kick things off on March 1, and the primary process will wrap up more than six months later on September 13 in Delaware, New Hampshire and Rhode Island. Those contests will tee up Election Day on November 8, when control of the House and Senate will be up for grabs as well as several high-profile gubernatorial races in key battleground states.\n\nThe outcome of November’s elections will serve as a referendum on President Joe Biden’s first two years in office and set the table for the 2024 presidential campaign. Biden and congressional Democrats have scored some legislative victories and are poised to confirm a history-making pick to the Supreme Court in Ketanji Brown Jackson. Yet economic anxiety punctuated by inflation concerns combined with exhaustion over the coronavirus pandemic has tilted the political environment in favor of Republicans, who also have electoral history on their side. There is also a unique dynamic to these midterms, with former President Donald Trump eyeing a potential return to the White House and looking to lay the groundwork by endorsing candidates in GOP primaries who have embraced his lies about the 2020 election results.\n\nThe majority in the Senate, currently split 50-50 with Vice President Kamala Harris serving as a tiebreaker, is expected to come down to a handful of competitive races. There are four Democratic incumbents running in battleground states Biden won in 2020: Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and New Hampshire. Republicans have incumbents seeking reelection in Wisconsin and Florida, and they’re defending three open seats in Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Ohio. In total, 34 Senate seats will be decided in November.\n\nIn the House, Republicans need a net gain of five seats to win control of the chamber. More than 40 members, mostly Democrats, have announced they are leaving Congress. Some of those decisions were driven by redistricting, the once-a-decade process of redrawing congressional and state legislative boundaries. In states with partisan control of the process, both parties have tried to draw new maps to their advantage: to pick up more seats, shore up incumbents or reduce the number of competitive districts.\n\nThere are currently 27 Republican governors and 23 Democratic governors – with 36 seats up for grabs this November – including several in battleground states that could play a significant role in deciding the outcome of the 2024 election. Beyond elections for governor, state races for secretary of state and attorney general will receive unprecedented attention, as the battle over how elections are handled intensifies in the aftermath of the 2020 campaign.\n\nHere are the key dates and contests to watch as the 2022 primary process plays out:\n\nMarch 1: Texas primaries\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott Lynda M. Gonzalez/Pool//Getty Images\n\nThe Lone Star State is home to a few intriguing GOP statewide primaries and a House Democratic primary that highlights the ideological divide within the party.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott is seeking reelection to a third term, which could set the stage for a potential 2024 bid. First, he must get through a GOP primary that includes challenges from former (Florida) Rep. Allen West and businessman and ex-state Sen. Don Huffines.\n\nThere is also a contested Republican primary in the race for state attorney general, with incumbent Ken Paxton being challenged by state Land Commissioner George P. Bush, US Rep. Louie Gohmert and former state Supreme Court Justice Eva Guzman. Paxton’s rivals have taken aim at his legal problems, but Trump has thrown his support behind the incumbent, who led a failed effort to challenge the 2020 election results in four battleground states at the US Supreme Court.\n\nIn south Texas, there is a rematch of a 2020 Democratic primary in the 28th Congressional District between centrist Rep. Henry Cuellar and immigration attorney Jessica Cisneros, who has received the endorsement of progressive leaders, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The FBI searched Cuellar’s home and campaign office in January, but the nine-term congressman released a video a week later vowing to seek reelection despite the “ongoing investigation.”\n\nThe Dallas-area 3rd Congressional District is the site of a battle over how the GOP should handle the 2020 election and the events of January 6, 2021. Rep. Van Taylor is a conservative Republican, but he voted to accept the 2020 presidential election results and supported an independent commission to investigate the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. (He opposed the select committee that was eventually created.) He’s now facing several primary challengers who question the results of the election, criticize Taylor’s vote on the commission and downplay the Capitol insurrection. The district also became much more Republican in redistricting, so while the seat shouldn’t be competitive in November, it could be easier for a more right-wing candidate to defeat Taylor in the primary.\n\nApril 5: Special election primary in California’s 22nd Congressional District\n\nFormer GOP Rep. Devin Nunes JIm Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFormer GOP Rep. Devin Nunes set off this special primary contest with his resignation from Congress in January to join Trump’s new social media venture. Assuming no candidate gets a majority of the vote in the all-party primary, the top two finishers will face off in June, when California holds its general election primaries, giving the eventual winner about six months to represent this Central Valley seat in Congress. The district will have new boundaries for the election held in November.\n\nMay 3: Indiana and Ohio primaries\n\nOhio Gov. Mike DeWine Paul Vernon/AP\n\nThe Buckeye State has a pair of Republican primary battles that could offer early clues about the GOP electorate heading into the heart of the nominating calendar.\n\nRepublican Gov. Mike DeWine is seeking a second term. His management of the coronavirus pandemic has become the target of fierce criticism from opponent Jim Renacci, a former GOP congressman who has accused DeWine of governing Ohio “like a blue-state liberal.” On the Democratic side, it’s a battle between two former mayors, with Dayton’s Nan Whaley and Cincinnati’s John Cranley squaring off for the nomination.\n\nIn the GOP Senate primary, the crowded contest has at times veered toward political theater as several top contenders – most notably former state Treasurer Josh Mandel and “Hillbilly Elegy” author J.D. Vance – have sought to burnish their conservative pro-Trump credentials with incendiary rhetoric and inflammatory displays of opposition to public health precautions. Former state GOP chair Jane Timken and businessman Mike Gibbons are also making plays for the Trump base, while state Sen. Matt Dolan is testing the theory that there is still room in the party for a candidate who doesn’t fully embrace the former President.\n\nAfter a history of teasing potential statewide bids only to pass, Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan decided to take the plunge (with a helpful shove from redistricting) and launched a bid for US Senate. He faces a primary challenge from consumer protection attorney Morgan Harper. While Ohio has been trending red in recent years, Ryan is hoping to follow a similar blue-collar blueprint that has helped Sen. Sherrod Brown win statewide three times, most recently against Renacci in 2018.\n\nMay 10: Nebraska and West Virginia primaries\n\nWest Virginia Rep. David McKinley Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc./Getty Images\n\nWest Virginia is poised to hold the country’s first incumbent vs. incumbent primary of the 2022 cycle, featuring GOP Reps. David McKinley and Alex Mooney. The Republicans were drawn into the new 2nd Congressional District after the state lost a House seat following the 2020 census. The matchup will be an early test of Trump’s sway in GOP primaries, with the former President backing Mooney over McKinley, who did not object to counting the Electoral College vote and supported the bipartisan infrastructure bill. Mooney objected to the Pennsylvania electoral count, but not Arizona, and voted against the infrastructure package.\n\nIn Nebraska, outgoing Gov. Pete Ricketts urged Trump to stay out of the GOP primary to replace him, but the former President spurned the request and threw his support behind businessman Charles Herbster last October. Ricketts later endorsed Nebraska University Regent Jim Pillen, setting up a proxy battle between the two GOP leaders who both carried the Cornhusker State by wide margins.\n\nMeanwhile, in Nebraska’s 1st Congressional District, embattled GOP Rep. Jeff Fortenberry is facing a primary challenge from state Sen. Mike Flood, who has been endorsed by Ricketts and former Gov. Dave Heineman. Fortenberry was indicted last fall for allegedly concealing information and lying to federal authorities investigating illegal campaign contributions. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\nMay 17: Idaho, Kentucky, North Carolina, Oregon and Pennsylvania primaries\n\nCelebrity doctor Mehmet Oz Brad Barket/Getty Images\n\nThe fight for the GOP Senate nomination in Pennsylvania could be one of the nastiest and most expensive primary contests of the entire 2022 cycle, with hedge fund executive David McCormick and celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz trading pointed attacks over their personal ties to foreign countries. Both contenders are pumping massive amounts of their personal wealth into TV ads. The crowded field also includes former US ambassador to Denmark Carla Sands, who, like the top contenders, is relying on her personal wealth, and Jeff Bartos, the party’s 2018 nominee for lieutenant governor. The race to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Pat Toomey was upended last November when Trump-backed candidate Sean Parnell ended his campaign amid scrutiny of his turbulent personal life. So far, the former President has held off on throwing his support behind another candidate, a move that could shake up the trajectory of the primary.\n\nDemocrats see the Keystone State as perhaps the party’s best opportunity to flip a Republican-held Senate seat. The competition on the Democratic side features candidates with distinct backgrounds who represent divergent ideological factions within the party. Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, an outspoken progressive and strong fundraiser, and Rep. Conor Lamb, a Marine Corps veteran and former federal prosecutor, are seen as the top contenders. Rounding out the field is state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta, who has won the backing of some progressive groups.\n\nThere is also a wide-open race for governor in Pennsylvania, with Democrat Tom Wolf term-limited. The lone Democratic candidate is state Attorney General Josh Shapiro, who was one of the leading officials rebutting false claims about the commonwealth’s 2020 election results. The GOP field includes state Senate President Pro Tempore Jake Corman, former US Rep. Lou Barletta, former US Attorney Bill McSwain, state Sen. Doug Mastriano and businessman Dave White. Trump, and his lies about the election, are expected to be a driving factor in the primary.\n\nIn North Carolina, Trump’s early surprise endorsement of US Rep. Ted Budd failed to clear the GOP Senate primary field, with former Gov. Pat McCrory, former US Rep. Mark Walker and Army veteran Marjorie K. Eastman also in the running to succeed retiring Republican Sen. Richard Burr. Walker announced in January he would stay in the Senate race, defying Trump’s effort to get the former congressman to drop his bid and run for a House seat. On the Democratic side, the party has largely cleared the field for former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Cheri Beasley.\n\nIdaho is another state home to a GOP civil war, with Gov. Brad Little getting a primary challenge from Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin. The two have engaged in a political tug-of-war, with McGeachin on multiple occasions using her powers as acting governor to issue executive orders while Little was out of state, only to have the governor rescind them upon his return. Trump endorsed McGeachin last November, calling her a “a true supporter of MAGA from the very beginning.”\n\nMay 24: Alabama, Arkansas and Georgia primaries; Texas runoffs (if necessary)\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp Megan Varner/Getty Images\n\nThere is perhaps no state on the 2022 map where Trump is seeking to exert his influence on the Republican Party more than Georgia, where he rolled out a “Trump ticket” of candidates, including two who are challenging GOP incumbents the former President attacked after they rejected his efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nThe top target for Trump is Gov. Brian Kemp, whose decision to certify Biden’s narrow win in Georgia unleashed fierce and frequent attacks by the former President. The attacks culminated with Trump’s endorsement of former US Sen. David Perdue after he launched a primary challenge against Kemp. Perdue lost his Senate runoff to Democrat Jon Ossoff in January 2021, which some Republicans blamed, in part, on Trump’s efforts to undermine the state’s election results. Now Perdue is making Trump’s lies about the 2020 election a cornerstone of his bid to defeat Kemp. The winner of the GOP primary will likely face Democrat Stacey Abrams, who lost the 2018 gubernatorial race to Kemp by less than 2 percentage points.\n\nWhile the GOP primary for governor is unsettled, Republican Herschel Walker has plenty of running room in the Senate race. The former football star has Trump’s support as he seeks to defeat Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, who scored a 2-point victory in a Senate special election runoff against Republican Kelly Loeffler last year. Warnock has been a prolific fundraiser, beginning 2022 with nearly $23 million in the bank.\n\nGeorgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger stood up to Trump’s demands that he “find” the votes to overturn the 2020 election results in the state. Now the question is whether the state’s top election official can withstand a primary challenge from Trump-backed US Rep. Jody Hice, who embraced the former President’s false claims about the election. Among the Democratic contenders are state Rep. Bee Nguyen, who succeeded Abrams in the state legislature, and former Fulton County Commission chair John Eaves.\n\nThe Atlanta area will host the year’s first Democratic member vs. member primary, with Reps. Lucy McBath and Carolyn Bourdeaux running in the newly redrawn 7th Congressional District after the GOP-controlled state legislature turned McBath’s current seat safely red. Both Democrats flipped suburban districts previously held by Republicans – McBath in 2018 and Bourdeaux in 2020.\n\nGeorgia won’t be the only state testing the power of Trump’s endorsement on this primary day. In Alabama, US Rep. Mo Brooks is hoping the former President’s support will help deliver him the GOP Senate nomination. But the conservative firebrand is running against two well-funded opponents: Katie Britt, a former top aide to retiring Republican Sen. Richard Shelby, and Mike Durant, an aerospace executive and former Blackhawk helicopter pilot. Brooks has struggled to take command of the field, prompting frustration from the former President.\n\nAlabama Gov. Kay Ivey is running for a second full term but is being challenged by several candidates in the GOP primary, including Lindy Blanchard, who served as ambassador to Slovenia in the Trump administration. Blanchard initially launched a bid for the open Senate seat but switched gears to run for governor last December.\n\nIn Arkansas, Sarah Huckabee Sanders – a former White House press secretary under Trump and daughter of former Gov. Mike Huckabee – has a clear path to the Republican nomination as she seeks to succeed GOP Gov. Asa Hutchinson. With Trump having carried the Natural State by more than 20 points in 2020, Sanders is poised to follow in her father’s footsteps and become Arkansas’ first female governor.\n\nJune 7: California, Iowa, Mississippi, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico and South Dakota primaries; special election in California’s 22nd Congressional District (if necessary)\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nLast September, California Gov. Gavin Newsom became the second governor in US history to defeat a recall. Now the Democrat appears to be coasting toward a second term in office – which could serve as a platform for a national run down the road. There are already signs of a brewing feud between Newsom and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a top GOP 2024 prospect.\n\nSen. Alex Padilla, appointed by Newsom to the seat vacated by Harris ahead of her becoming vice president, is running for a full six-year term. At the same time, Padilla must run in a special election for the remaining weeks of the original Harris term.\n\nCalifornia is losing a US House seat for the first time in the state’s history because of slower population growth. The new congressional maps, drawn by an independent commission, have scrambled the Golden State’s political landscape. With the potential for as many as 10 competitive House races this fall, the state’s top-two primary system could be a major factor in shaping the battleground map.\n\nGOP Rep. David Valadao is running in the newly drawn 22nd District in the Central Valley, which became more favorable to Democrats under redistricting. Valadao is the only House Republican running for reelection who voted for to impeach Trump in 2021 for inciting the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol and doesn’t have a challenger endorsed by the former President (yet). Among his Democratic challengers is Rudy Salas, a California assemblyman and former member of the Bakersfield City Council.\n\nAnother race to keep an eye on is the new 27th District around Los Angeles, where GOP Rep. Mike Garcia is a top target of Democrats. His challengers include former state assemblywoman Christy Smith, who is running for a third time against Garcia. She lost a special election and general election to him in 2020, with the latter race decided by a margin of just 333 votes. Democrat Quaye Quartey, a retired Navy intelligence officer, is also running.\n\nPrior to serving as Trump’s interior secretary, Ryan Zinke spent about two years representing Montana in the US House. Zinke is now eyeing a return to Capitol Hill after Montana gained a House seat following the 2020 census, though he’s facing scrutiny about his current ties to the state.\n\nJune 14: Maine, Nevada, North Dakota and South Carolina primaries\n\nNevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc./Getty Images\n\nNevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto is one of the most endangered Senate Democrats running this year, looking to carry a state Biden won by less than 3 points in 2020. The top contender in the GOP field is former state Attorney General Adam Laxalt, the party’s 2018 nominee for governor, who has managed to unite the Trump and Mitch McConnell wings. Still, he is facing a primary challenge from Army veteran Sam Brown, who has demonstrated some fundraising strength.\n\nIn the Silver State’s race for governor, incumbent Democrat Steve Sisolak is seeking a second term, with several Republicans lining up to run against him, including former US Sen. Dean Heller and Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo.\n\nThe fate of two Trump targets could be decided this day in South Carolina, where the former President has endorsed primary challengers to GOP Reps. Tom Rice and Nancy Mace. In the 7th Congressional District, Trump has backed state Rep. Russell Fry against Rice, who was one of the 10 House Republicans to vote in favor of Trump’s impeachment last January. Mace, who represents the 1st District, voted to certify the election results (but not for impeachment) and has tried to walk the Trump tightrope, criticizing his actions at times and embracing the former President at others. Trump has thrown his support behind former state Rep. Katie Arrington, who defeated former Rep. Mark Sanford in the 2018 GOP primary for the 1st District, only to lose to Democrat Joe Cunningham in the general election.\n\nIn Maine, a pair of Republicans are attempting political comebacks – with former Gov. Paul LePage and former US Rep. Bruce Poliquin both running for their old jobs. LePage is looking to challenge Democrat Janet Mills, who won the 2018 race to succeed him. Poliquin is eyeing a rematch in the 2nd Congressional District with Jared Golden, the Democrat who defeated him four years ago.\n\nJune 21: DC and Virginia primaries; runoffs in Alabama, Arkansas and Georgia (if necessary)\n\nVirginia Rep. Abigail Spanberger Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nLast November’s victory by Republican Glenn Youngkin in the race for Virginia governor boosted the GOP’s hopes that 2022 would be a strong year for the party in the commonwealth and beyond. This year, the battleground in the Old Dominion will center on two competitive House races featuring a pair of Democrats first elected in the 2018 blue wave – Reps. Abigail Spanberger and Elaine Luria. A handful Republicans have lined up to challenge Spanberger in the new 7th Congressional District, which was redrawn to include more of the Democratic-leaning exurbs in Northern Virginia but no longer includes the congresswoman’s home near Richmond. Luria’s 2nd District, meanwhile, became more favorable to Republicans under redistricting, with state Sen. Jen Kiggans seen as a top contender in the GOP primary.\n\nJune 28: Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, New York, Oklahoma and Utah primaries; runoffs in Mississippi and South Carolina (if necessary)\n\nIllinois Rep. Mary Miller Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc./Getty Images\n\nThe Land of Lincoln is the scene of not one but two dual incumbent House primaries after Illinois lost a seat based on the 2020 census.\n\nThe GOP contest in the 15th District will provide another test of Trump’s endorsement strength, with Reps. Mary Miller and Rodney Davis facing off. The former President rebuffed the advice of GOP leaders to remain neutral and threw his support behind Miller, a freshman member who has stirred controversy since arriving in Congress. Davis, now in his fifth term, is an ally of House Republican leadership and poised to become a committee chairman if the GOP wins control of the chamber.\n\nDemocrats have their own incumbent vs. incumbent primary in the 6th District, where Reps. Sean Casten and Marie Newman will compete for the party’s nomination. Casten flipped a GOP-held seat in 2018 while Newman narrowly defeated conservative Democratic Rep. Dan Lipinski in a 2020 primary before winning her general election race by double digits.\n\nOn the same day, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul will face off against US Rep. Tom Suozzi and New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams in the Democratic primary as Hochul seeks a full term in office. Hochul became the first female governor of the Empire State last August after Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo resigned amid allegations of sexual harassment. Among the candidates on the Republican side are Rep. Lee Zeldin, 2014 GOP gubernatorial nominee Rob Astorino, businessman Harry Wilson and Andrew Giuliani, the son of former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani.\n\nWith popular Republican Gov. Larry Hogan unable to run for a third term in Maryland, Democrats are hopeful about their prospects of retaking the governor’s mansion after eight years of Republican rule. That optimism has produced a crowded Democratic field, which includes former US Labor Secretary Tom Perez, state Comptroller Peter Franchot, author and former nonprofit chief Wes Moore and former US Education Secretary John King. Trump has endorsed state Del. Daniel Cox, who is running in the GOP primary against Hogan’s preferred candidate, state Commerce Secretary Kelly Schulz.\n\nJuly 26: North Carolina runoffs (if necessary)\n\nThe calendar in July is rather bare, unless any of the North Carolina primary contests in May require a runoff to decide the winner. Candidates only need to top 30% of the vote to avoid that scenario.\n\nAugust 2: Arizona, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri and Washington primaries\n\nArizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs Ross D. Franklin/AP\n\nTwo states at the center of Trump’s lies about the 2020 election will vote on this day – Arizona and Michigan.\n\nSparked by the former President’s falsehoods, GOP lawmakers in Arizona launched a months-long partisan review of the results in Maricopa County, home to Phoenix, which ultimately confirmed Biden’s victory there. That fact has failed to dissuade Republican candidates from embracing Trump’s baseless claims. The former President has endorsed former TV anchor Kari Lake, who is running for governor, and state Rep. Mark Finchem, a candidate for secretary of state, both of whom have cast doubts about the 2020 election results.\n\nCurrent Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, is running for governor, putting her defense of the state’s elections at the center of her candidacy. In addition to Lake, the other Republican contenders include former US Rep. Matt Salmon, developer and former Arizona Board of Regents member Karrin Taylor Robson and businessman Steve Gaynor.\n\nFinchem is joined in the GOP secretary of state primary by state Sen. Michelle Ugenti-Rita, who has advocated for so-called election integrity legislation. The Democratic candidates hoping to succeed Hobbs include Adrian Fontes, the former Maricopa County recorder, and Arizona House Minority Leader Reginald Bolding.\n\nTrump has yet to endorse in the Arizona GOP Senate primary, but his impact on the field has been felt in how the leading candidates are positioning themselves to align with the former President’s policies and politics. That list of hopefuls includes state Attorney General Mark Brnovich, businessman Jim Lamon and venture capitalist Blake Masters, who has the backing of tech billionaire Peter Thiel and the anti-tax Club for Growth.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Mark Kelly and his massive campaign war chest await whichever candidate emerges victorious on the Republican side. The former astronaut is running for a full six-year term after defeating appointed Republican Sen. Martha McSally in a 2020 special election.\n\nIn Michigan, Trump has endorsed two statewide candidates who’ve spread election falsehoods – Kristina Karamo for secretary of state and Matthew DePerno for state attorney general. They are seeking to challenge incumbent Democrats Jocelyn Benson and Dana Nessel, who have pushed back on Trump’s efforts to undermine the state’s 2020 election results.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer Bill Pugliano/Getty Images\n\nDemocratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who was on Biden’s short list for vice president, is also seeking a second term. Businessman Kevin Rinke and former Detroit police chief James Craig are among a packed field of GOP candidates looking to challenge Whitmer.\n\nThe new congressional map in Michigan has set up an all-incumbent primary battle in the 11th district featuring Democratic Reps. Haley Stevens and Andy Levin. The district’s new lines make it a safer seat for Democrats than the one Stevens flipped in 2018. Levin has deep political roots in the state, with his father, Sander, serving in the US House for more than 30 years and his uncle Carl Levin serving six terms as a US senator.\n\nGOP Rep. Peter Meijer is running for reelection in Michigan’s 3rd Congressional District after voting for impeachment and faces a primary challenge in John Gibbs, a former Trump administration official who has the backing of the former President.\n\nTrump has also endorsed state Rep. Steve Carra, who had launched a bid against Rep. Fred Upton, another GOP member who voted to impeach. But Upton has not yet officially announced if he’s running for another term, which would mean having to face off against fellow GOP Rep. Bill Huizenga in the newly drawn 4th District.\n\nTwo House Republicans from Washington who voted for Trump’s impeachment – Jaime Herrera Beutler and Dan Newhouse – will also face GOP primary voters on this day. Both have Trump-backed opponents in their all-party primaries. Retired Army Special Forces officer Joe Kent is challenging Beutler, while failed 2020 gubernatorial candidate Loren Culp is seeking to oust Newhouse. Like in California, the top two finishers in the primary advance to the general election, regardless of party affiliation.\n\nIn Missouri, there is a crowded GOP primary to succeed retiring Republican Sen. Roy Blunt in a state that should favor the party. Some Republicans are concerned that if former Gov. Eric Greitens emerges as the nominee, it could put the seat in play for Democrats, given his scandal-plagued past. GOP Sen. Josh Hawley has endorsed US Rep. Vicky Hartzler in the primary, with state Attorney General Eric Schmitt, US Rep. Billy Long, state Senate President Pro Tempore Dave Schatz and St. Louis attorney Mark McCloskey also in the mix. On the Democratic side, Marine veteran Lucas Kunce appears to be the leading contender.\n\nAugust 4: Tennessee primaries\n\nFormer State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus Gabriel Aponte/Getty Images South America/Getty Images for Concordia Ameri\n\nTennessee Republicans cracked Democratic Rep. Jim Cooper’s Nashville-based seat in redistricting, diluting the power of the vote in Davidson County, spreading it across three GOP-leaning districts. The move prompted Cooper to announce his retirement. It has also sparked a GOP showdown for the new 5th Congressional District. Trump is backing Morgan Ortagus, a former State Department spokesperson, while two top allies of the former President – US Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Madison Cawthorn – are supporting social media influencer Robby Starbuck. Former state House Speaker Beth Harwell is running for the redrawn seat as well.\n\nAugust 9: Connecticut, Minnesota, Vermont and Wisconsin primaries\n\nWisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson is the only Republican senator seeking reelection in a state Biden carried in 2020. A dozen Democrats have lined up to take on the two-term incumbent, who has evolved from a tea party insurgent during his first run in 2010 to a promoter of Covid-19 and January 6 conspiracies. The leading Democratic challengers appear to be Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, Milwaukee Bucks executive Alex Lasry and state Treasurer Sarah Godlewski.\n\nThe GOP field to take on Democratic Gov. Tony Evers is less crowded, with former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch, state Rep. Timothy Ramthun and Kevin Nicholson, who lost in the 2018 Senate Republican primary, among the contenders.\n\nThe last time a Republican candidate won a statewide office in Minnesota was 2006, when former Gov. Tim Pawlenty was narrowly reelected. Several Republicans are running to prevent Democratic Gov. Tim Walz from winning a second term. Misinformation about Covid-19 and the 2020 election have been key issues in the GOP primary. One leading candidate is Scott Jensen, a former state senator and family doctor, who has voiced vaccine skepticism and opposition to mandates. Another physician, Neil Shah, has suggested he took an unproven drug to treat coronavirus. At a forum last December, none of the five candidates who participated were willing to answer a plain “yes” when asked whether they thought Biden won a “constitutional majority in the Electoral College.”\n\nUltimately, whether Republicans lean toward a candidate like Jensen or Shah or a more mainstream pick like state Sens. Paul Gazelka or Michelle Benson, the primary may well be decided long before August. The state GOP will endorse a candidate at its convention in May and most, if not all, of the other candidates could drop their bids if they don’t earn that nod.\n\nVermont is the only state in the union that’s never sent a woman to Congress. But Democratic Sen. Pat Leahy’s decision to call it quits after almost 50 years in the Senate started a domino effect that could change that. Democratic Rep. Peter Welch, the state’s lone House member, is trying to move across the Capitol to succeed Leahy. That’s set up a Democratic primary in which two of the leading candidates are women. Lt. Gov. Molly Gray and state Sen. Becca Balint both declared for the seat shortly after Welch made his announcement.\n\nVermont Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican who leads one of the most Democratic states in the nation, will also be up for reelection (Vermont governors serve two-year terms) but he’s yet to announce his plans.\n\nConnecticut Gov. Ned Lamont and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, both Democrats, also face voters this year.\n\nAugust 13: Hawaii primaries\n\nHawaii Lt. Gov. Josh Green State of Hawaii\n\nTerm limits prevent Hawaii Gov. David Ige from seeking a third term, and several Democrats have lined up to succeed him. The primary field includes Lt. Gov. Josh Green, a doctor who has been one of the main faces of the state’s pandemic response, former Hawaii first lady Vicky Cayetano and former Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell. US Rep. Kai Kahele has also been mentioned as a potential candidate.\n\nHawaii is one of the most Democratic states in the country, so the winner of the Democratic primary will be heavily favored in November.\n\nAugust 16: Alaska and Wyoming primaries; South Dakota runoffs (if necessary)\n\nWyoming Rep. Liz Cheney Oliver Contreras/Pool/Getty Images\n\nTwo of Trump’s top GOP targets in 2022 are Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski. The coincidence of both states holding primaries on the same day sets up an epic test of the former President’s sway in the GOP.\n\nThere is arguably no Republican who has drawn Trump’s ire more than Cheney, who voted in favor of impeachment last year and is the vice chair on the House select committee investigating the events surrounding the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. Trump has endorsed Harriet Hageman, a onetime critic, as the candidate to fulfill his goal of ousting Cheney. So has House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. And the Republican National Committee took the unprecedented step of censuring the congreswoman. Working in Cheney’s favor are her family’s deep roots in the state and her massive campaign war chest. She also might benefit from the fact that she could win the primary without receiving a majority of the vote, as Hageman has not cleared the field of Cheney challengers despite Trump’s support.\n\nMurkowski is the lone Republican running for reelection this year who voted to convict Trump at his impeachment trial in the Senate. The former President has backed Kelly Tshibaka, who formerly led Alaska’s Department of Administration. But the race in Alaska will be complicated by the state’s new election system, with all the Senate candidates running on a single ballot and the top four finishers, regardless of party, advancing to the general election, which will be decided by ranked-choice voting. Given that, Murkowski is almost certain to advance to the November vote, where she could benefit from the reallocation process. The senator has faced tough reelection campaigns before – winning as a write-in candidate in 2010 after losing the GOP primary to a tea party challenger. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and his allies are firmly behind Murkowski’s bid.\n\nAugust 23: Florida primaries; Oklahoma runoffs (if necessary)\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, who has made himself a national figure with a laissez-faire approach to the Covid-19 pandemic and willingness to embrace hot-button conservative causes, might be eyeing another office in a few years. But first, he needs to win a second term, with the possibility of a decisive victory likely to only spark further speculation about his ambitions beyond the Sunshine State.\n\nThree Democrats are hoping to derail DeSantis’ rise, with US Rep. Charlie Crist, a former Republican governor, trying to reclaim his seat as Florida’s chief executive. Crist leads the Democratic field in fundraising. The other contenders to take on DeSantis are state Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried and state Sen. Annette Taddeo.\n\nBefore DeSantis, Sen. Marco Rubio was seen as the GOP’s rising star in Florida. His failed 2016 presidential bid upended that trajectory and led Rubio to reverse course and seek reelection to the Senate. Now he’s seeking a third term, with the onetime tea party darling turned Trump critic having fully embraced the former President amid Florida’s shift to the right. US Rep. Val Demings, a former Orlando police chief, is the prohibitive favorite in the Democratic primary and has been a strong fundraiser.\n\nThe outcome of these two races could dictate heading into 2024 how much attention and resources Democrats will deploy to Florida, which has been one of the premier battleground states in presidential races for many cycles.\n\nSeptember 6: Massachusetts primaries\n\nFormer state Rep. Geoff Diehl Matt Stone/MediaNews Group/Boston Herald/Getty Images\n\nThe decision by Republican Gov. Charlie Baker to not seek a third term in deep-blue Massachusetts sets up another test of Trump’s power inside the GOP. Former state Rep. Geoff Diehl originally launched his campaign as a challenge to Baker and picked up Trump’s endorsement. But while Diehl won’t have the popular incumbent as an opponent, he also doesn’t have a clear lane to November. Chris Doughty, a businessman and self-described moderate, joined the race in late January. While he doesn’t have electoral experience like Diehl, Doughty was able to open his campaign with half a million dollars of his own money.\n\nOn the Democratic side, state Attorney General Maura Healey, who entered the race after Baker declined to run again, leads the entire field in fundraising. State Sen. Sonia Chang-Díaz is also running. Despite favoring Democrats at the federal level, Massachusetts has a habit of electing moderate Republican governors. Without Baker on the ballot, Democrats are hopeful they’ll avoid such a fate this November.\n\nSeptember 13: Delaware, New Hampshire and Rhode Island primaries\n\nNew Hampshire Sen. Maggie Hassan Erin Scott/Getty Images\n\nDemocratic Sen. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire is one of the GOP’s top targets in 2022, but the party’s hopes of flipping the seat took a hit last November when popular Granite State Gov. Chris Sununu passed on a Senate bid. Sununu’s decision sets up what could be a long and crowded GOP primary, given New Hampshire’s late primary date. Candidates include former Londonderry Town Manager Kevin Smith, retired Army Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc and state Senate President Chuck Morse, who’s received praise from McConnell.\n\nRedistricting is poised to make New Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District, currently held by Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas, more favorable for Republicans. That shift has attracted a wide field of GOP challengers, including Matt Mowers, who lost to Pappas in 2020, former Trump aide Karoline Leavitt and Gail Huff Brown, a former TV anchor and the wife of former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown.\n\nThere will likely be another crowded primary on this day on the Democratic side in the Rhode Island governor’s race. Then-Lt. Gov. Dan McKee was elevated to the top job when Gina Raimondo was appointed as Biden’s commerce secretary last year, and he’s now seeking a full term. But Rhode Island Democrats aren’t just letting McKee have it. The packed field currently includes Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea, former Secretary of State Matt Brown and Helena Foulkes, a former executive at Rhode Island-based CVS.\n\nNovember 8: Election Day; Open primaries in Louisiana", "authors": ["Terence Burlij Melissa Holzberg Depalo Ethan Cohen", "Terence Burlij", "Melissa Holzberg Depalo", "Ethan Cohen"], "publish_date": "2022/02/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/17/politics/governor-races-democrats-republicans-midterm-elections/index.html", "title": "Democrats are facing stiff battles for governor in these key states ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nDemocratic nominees for governor are facing the stiffest competition this year as the party tries to hold on to its gains from the “blue wave” of 2018, even though Republicans are defending more governorships in November.\n\nDemocrats hold 16 of the 36 gubernatorial seats on the ballot, including in key states like Arizona, Pennsylvania and Michigan. Events of the past two years have brought to the fore the power of governors, who have played decisive roles in dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic, the aftermath of former President Donald Trump’s defeat in 2020 and new clashes over the future of abortion rights following the US Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\nGubernatorial races are on the ballot in the five states that flipped from Trump in 2016 to now-President Joe Biden four years later. Those contests, all but one of which feature Trump-backed GOP nominees will test of the strength of the former President’s movement and his ability to boost his picks in a general election.\n\nMeanwhile, Republican incumbents in states such as Florida and Texas could be using their reelection campaigns as possible jumping-off points for future presidential bids.\n\nThe 2022 races are also expected to mark the end of an era in states such as Maryland and Massachusetts, where two-term moderate Republican governors are on their way out – one via term limits, the other facing dissent within his own party – with Democrats poised to replace them.\n\nAs the campaign hits the home stretch, these are the 10 states – eight where Democrats currently hold the governorship – with the most consequential contests on the ballot.\n\nArizona\n\nKatie Hobbs, left, and Kari Lake Getty Images\n\nThe Grand Canyon State became ground zero for Trump’s 2020 election conspiracy theories after voters there narrowly backed Biden and Trump-aligned state lawmakers later forced a deeply flawed partisan ballot review in Maricopa County that ultimately did not alter the outcome.\n\nBut that controversy has lingered, with Republican gubernatorial nominee Kari Lake echoing Trump’s falsehoods that the 2020 election was “corrupt” and “stolen.” She has also stated that she would not have certified the 2020 election results in Arizona. Lake’s Democratic opponent, Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, who defended the state’s election systems against the baseless fraud accusations, has cast the former news anchor as a dangerous threat to democracy.\n\nLake is focusing on her economic agenda in the campaign’s final weeks and on her plans to address increased migration across the border – including a promise to declare an “invasion” at the border to give the state greater power to address the issue. She also has accused Hobbs of cowardice for refusing to debate her. Hobbs has centered her campaign on abortion, arguing that her GOP opponent’s extreme positions would endanger Arizona women.\n\nThe Hobbs-Lake race is one of five gubernatorial contests this cycle in which both major-party nominees are women. Up until this year, there had only been four such matchups in US history.\n\nKansas\n\nLaura Kelly and Derek Schmidt Mark Reinstein/MediaPunch/IPX/AP\n\nDemocrat Laura Kelly seized on voter antipathy for state and national Republicans in 2018 to become governor of reliably red Kansas. Four years later, it may be anger aimed at her own party that dooms her reelection bid.\n\nKelly faces Republican state Attorney General Derek Schmidt in a state Trump won by 15 points in 2020. Schmidt has not impressed party officials with his campaign or his fundraising – Kelly raised over $1.5 million from January to July, while her GOP opponent only brought in around $700,000 in that time frame. But Republicans are hopeful that Schmidt will benefit from the state’s natural political tilt, which they’re seizing on by tying Kelly to Biden at every turn.\n\nDemocrats got a boost this summer when a turnout surge helped defeat a ballot measure that would have allowed lawmakers to ban abortion in the state. The victory – with the “no” vote carrying nearly 60% of the vote – invigorated Kansas Democrats and seemingly Kelly’s reelection chances.\n\nBut Kelly has not exactly seized on abortion as an issue in her bid for a second term. On the campaign trail, she has largely focused on speaking about the economy, education and tax cuts, three more palatable issues for the independent and Republican-leaning voters she will need to defeat Schmidt.\n\nNevada\n\nSteve Sisolak, left, and Joe Lombardo Getty Images\n\nDemocratic Gov. Steve Sisolak faces fierce headwinds in a state that has seen some of the nation’s highest inflation rates as well as frustration among blue-collar workers about the pace of the post-pandemic recovery. Many Nevadans in the tourism-reliant state were hit hard by pandemic-era closures and are now grappling with the high cost of gas and groceries.\n\nSisolak’s opponent, Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo, has the backing of both the GOP establishment and Trump, though the Republican nominee has said he does not agree with the former President’s false claim that the 2020 election was rigged. Lombardo has focused on kitchen table issues, including education and the expansion of school choice. He has blamed Biden and the Democrats for inflation – and accused the governor of hampering the economic recovery by being overly restrictive with school and business closures during the pandemic.\n\nSisolak has defended his actions as necessary to save lives, but he has also attempted to distance himself from the unpopular President. The Democrat has also pounded Lombardo for a series of inconsistent statements on abortion, which is protected up to 24 weeks under Nevada law.\n\nSisolak has faulted his opponent for an uptick in crime in Clark County, home to Las Vegas. At a recent debate, Lombardo said that crime went down for six years of his tenure as sheriff but acknowledged it has increased in the past two years – which he blamed on “soft on crime” policies advanced by the governor and Democratic lawmakers.\n\nOregon\n\nFrom left, Tina Kotek, Betsy Johnson and Christine Drazan From Facebook, AP\n\nAn unpredictably close race between three well-funded women could culminate in Oregon electing its first Republican governor in 40 years.\n\nDemocrat Tina Kotek, the longest-serving state House Speaker in Oregon history, started out as the favorite to replace term-limited Gov. Kate Brown in the blue-leaning state. But independent candidate Betsy Johnson has proved to be a formidable contender who Democrats fear could act as a spoiler in the race. A former Democratic state senator with two decades of legislative experience, Johnson has powerful allies in the business community who have made it possible for her to outraise her opponents. Johnson – a gun rights advocate who relishes the fact that she is being attacked by the “woke left” and the “radical right” – has blamed liberal Democratic policies for trash-lined streets and tent cities, as the state struggles with homelessness.\n\nJohnson’s candidacy has created a path for Republican Christine Drazan, the former state House minority leader, who is promising to bring “balance” back to Oregon while charging that all-Democratic control over the past decade has failed to hold the governor and the Legislature “to account.”\n\nBiden made a recent foray to the state to offer Kotek a fundraising assist.\n\nWisconsin\n\nTony Evers, left, and Tim Michels Getty Images\n\nGov. Tony Evers’ bid for reelection in one of the nation’s most competitive states could hinge on what’s most important to voters: abortion rights, which the Democrat has made his top focus in recent weeks, or the economy, which could benefit his Republican challenger, businessman Tim Michels.\n\nEvers recently called the state’s GOP-led legislature into a special session, urging lawmakers to allow a Michigan-style referendum to undo the state’s 1849 law that bans abortion in all cases except to save the life of the mother. But Republicans gaveled in and out of session within 30 seconds, ignoring Evers’ calls.\n\nMichels, who won the GOP nomination in August buoyed by a Trump endorsement, has focused his campaign on crime and inflation. Republicans are blaming Evers for a 70% increase in homicides in Wisconsin from 2019 to 2021, and Michels has also criticized the governor’s push to cut the state’s prison population.\n\nWisconsin’s elections have long been hard-fought: Biden defeated Trump there by about 20,000 votes out of more than 3.2 million cast in 2020, four years after Trump carried the state by a similar margin. Evers narrowly unseated GOP Gov. Scott Walker in 2018 but he faces a decidedly different political climate this year. As does his No. 2, Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, who is challenging Republican Sen. Ron Johnson in one of the nation’s most competitive and expensive contests.\n\nMichigan\n\nGretchen Whitmer, left, and Tudor Dixon Getty Images\n\nDemocratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has made her support for abortion rights the centerpiece of her bid for a second term against Republican Tudor Dixon, a conservative commentator.\n\nWhitmer has positioned herself as the last line of defense for abortion rights in the state. She sued to block Michigan’s 1931 ban from taking effect after the Supreme Court eliminated federal abortion rights protections in June. She is also backing a Michigan ballot measure that would enshrine abortion rights in the state’s constitution.\n\nDixon won a wide-open GOP primary in August, benefiting from the financial backing of the family of former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and a late endorsement from Trump. She has embraced Trump’s lies about fraud in the 2020 election.\n\nIn recent weeks, Dixon has sought to shift the focus of the race from abortion to other cultural issues. She has proposed a measure that would ban transgender girls from competing in sports with the gender they identify with, as well as one modeled after a Florida law, which critics have dubbed “Don’t Say Gay,” that bans discussion of gender and sexuality issues with younger students in classrooms.\n\nDixon has also made implicit acknowledgements that the electorate is more closely aligned with Whitmer’s position on abortion.\n\n“You can vote for Gretchen Whitmer’s position without having to vote for Gretchen Whitmer again,” she told reporters recently, citing the abortion ballot measure.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nMichelle Lujan Grisham and Mark Ronchetti Pool/AP, From Facebook/Mark Ronchetti\n\nOn paper, the New Mexico governor’s race should not be competitive: Biden carried the state by double digits in 2020.\n\nBut if there is a red wave, Republicans hope former television meteorologist Mark Ronchetti may be able to unseat incumbent Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a former congresswoman seeking her second term in office.\n\nRonchetti has beaten expectations before. In 2020, as the GOP nominee for Senate, he outran Trump at the top of the ticket, losing by a closer-than-expected 6 points to Democrat Ben Ray Lujan (a distant relative of the governor).\n\nIn his bid for governor, Ronchetti has attempted to distance himself from the former President – including by acknowledging that Biden won the 2020 election. He won a five-way GOP primary in June, finishing comfortably ahead of an opponent who had questioned his Republican credentials.\n\nRonchetti’s campaign has focused on crime – including one ad that a CNN fact check determined was deceptive – and the decision to stop in-person schooling during the coronavirus pandemic. Lujan Grisham has cast herself as someone who has had to make tough decisions while panning her opponent’s lack of political experience. These contours of the race were clear in their first debate last month.\n\n“There has to be a change here — she hasn’t taken crime seriously,” Ronchetti said during the debate.\n\n“Bold words from someone who’s never even been to a legislative session,” Lujan Grisham responded.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nJosh Shapiro, left, and Doug Mastriano Getty Images\n\nLess than a month before the election, Democratic state Attorney General Josh Shapiro is enjoying a big lead in the polls – and in fundraising – over Republican state Sen. Doug Mastriano, a hard-line conservative who led GOP efforts to overturn Biden’s 2020 victory in the commonwealth.\n\nShapiro is a popular figure who, should he win as expected in November, will be on the radar of national Democrats thinking ahead to the party’s next open presidential primary. Until then, though, his focus will be on defeating Mastriano, who is supported by Trump and chartered buses to Washington ahead of the former President’s “Stop the Steal” rally on January 6, 2021. (Mastriano says he never entered the US Capitol and has not been charged with any crimes.)\n\nLike a handful of other contests on this list, Pennsylvania is particularly important to Democrats because the state legislature is controlled by Republicans. And with abortion rights now resting with the states, a GOP governing trifecta could move forward with a ban or severe restrictions on the procedure. Mastriano has said he favors a total ban, with no exceptions.\n\nAbortion is currently legal in Pennsylvania, up to 24 weeks into a pregnancy, a standard Shapiro has vowed to support and uphold.\n\nGeorgia\n\nStacey Abrams and Brian Kemp Getty Images/AP\n\nRepublican Gov. Brian Kemp faces Democrat Stacey Abrams in a rematch of their showdown four years ago. While the race remains competitive, Kemp finds himself in a better position than 2018, when Abrams lost by about 54,000 votes out of nearly 4 million cast.\n\nComing after nearly two decades of GOP dominance in Georgia, Kemp’s slim victory was a sign that the state was up for grabs. Two years later, Georgia narrowly voted blue in the presidential election for the first time since 1992 while Democrats flipped both US Senate seats in runoffs, in no small part due to Abrams’s efforts to organize and mobilize minority and progressive voters in the Peach State.\n\nKemp drew Trump’s ire in 2020 when he rebuffed his efforts to overturn Biden’s victory in Georgia. But that stance earned Kemp an independent reputation, aided by a Trump-backed primary challenge that failed to take him down. Kemp remains a reliable conservative and has not shied away from helping enact Republican agenda items, including a far-reaching new elections overhaul and a six-week abortion ban that went into effect with the overturning of Roe v. Wade.\n\nAbrams, meanwhile, is attempting to use her organizational and financial advantages – she has outraised Kemp, thanks to a national donor network – to draw attention to the governor’s most conservative positions, from restricting abortion to opposing Medicaid expansion. But she has struggled to recapture the magic from four years earlier and has consistently run behind Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, who is seeking a full six-year term against embattled Republican challenger Herschel Walker.\n\nFlorida\n\nCharlie Crist, left, and Ron DeSantis Getty Images\n\nBefore he can decide whether to run for president, Gov. Ron DeSantis first faces a reelection test back home.\n\nThose close to the Republican governor say he is looking to better Trump’s 3.5-point victory two years ago in Florida – a symbolic result that would signal DeSantis’ readiness to potentially compete with the former President for the party’s 2024 nomination.\n\nStanding in the way is Charlie Crist, the former Republican governor and Democratic congressman whom Democrats have turned to once again try to take down a GOP incumbent. Democrats are not only hoping to slow DeSantis’ rise; they’re desperate to prove that Florida remains a swing state. Crist, though, has been hampered by sluggish fundraising and overall Democratic malaise in the Sunshine State, while DeSantis has broken campaign financing records as he taps into Republican excitement around his political stardom.\n\nCrist’s uphill climb was made that much harder by Hurricane Ian, a colossal and deadly storm that forced politics to the back burner as Floridians and their elected leaders – including DeSantis – dealt with the aftermath. Both candidates are reemerging on the campaign trail, but Crist lost several weeks when he could ill afford to.\n\nOther states\n\nIt could be back to the future in Maine and Alaska, with two former governors, Republican Paul LePage and independent Bill Walker, respectively looking to unseat incumbents Janet Mills, a Democrat, and Mike Dunleavy, a Republican. The Alaska race will, for the first time, be decided by a ranked-choice vote. Maine, one of the pioneers of that voting system, does not use it in general elections for governor, so the winner only needs a plurality for victory.\n\nThere isn’t much drama around the electoral outcomes in the blue states of Massachusetts, Maryland and New York. The GOP nominees are all closely aligned with Trump – a good formula for winning a primary, but likely a losing proposition in a general election.\n\nIn New York, Republicans’ two-decade-long statewide losing streak – the longest in the country – appears poised to continue, with Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul, who ascended to the top job following Andrew Cuomo’s resignation last year, favored over US Rep. Lee Zeldin.\n\nIn Maryland, state Del. Dan Cox won the GOP nomination over a candidate endorsed by term-limited Republican Gov. Larry Hogan. He’s floundered since, with Democrat Wes Moore poised to make history as the state’s first Black governor. It’s a similar story in Massachusetts, where popular GOP Gov. Charlie Baker decided against a run for a third term amid backlash from conservative Republicans, who ended up nominating former state Rep. Geoff Diehl. State Attorney General Maura Healey, who would make history as the commonwealth’s first elected female governor and the first out lesbian governor in the US, is the overwhelming favorite to reclaim the corner office for Democrats.\n\nAnother woman with a chance to make history in November is Arkansas Republican Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a former press secretary in the Trump White House and daughter of former Gov. Mike Huckabee. Sanders is heavily favored to become the first female governor of the deep-red state.\n\nThere are also a handful of states that, while their results might not be in much doubt, incumbent governors, like DeSantis in Florida, will be keeping a close eye on their margins of victory as they look ahead to potential presidential bids, in 2024 or beyond.\n\nIn Texas, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott is in a contentious race with Democrat Beto O’Rourke. The former El Paso congressman hasn’t caught fire like he did in his near-miss 2018 Senate run but remains an estimable opponent. A big win for Abbott could stoke his ambitions. The same could go for GOP Govs. Chris Sununu of New Hampshire and Kristi Noem of South Dakota, who may be facing a closer-than-expected reelection race but remains favored in a state that last elected a Democratic governor in 1974.\n\nAmong Democrats, Govs. Gavin Newsom of California, Jared Polis of Colorado and J.B. Pritzker of Illinois could all seek to use successful reelection bids next month as a springboard to higher office.", "authors": ["Gregory Krieg Maeve Reston Eric Bradner Dan Merica Michael Warren Steve Contorno", "Gregory Krieg", "Maeve Reston", "Eric Bradner", "Dan Merica", "Michael Warren", "Steve Contorno"], "publish_date": "2022/10/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/28/economy/saudi-arabia-biden-opec-oil/index.html", "title": "America and Saudi Arabia are locked in a bitter battle over oil. The ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nThe relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia is one of the most important on the planet. And lately, it’s also been one of the most awkward.\n\nAngry officials in Washington vowed “consequences” after Saudi-led OPEC sharply cut oil production earlier this month, driving up pump prices just weeks before the midterm elections.\n\nUS lawmakers are threatening steps that were unthinkable not long ago, including banning weapons sales to Saudi Arabia and unleashing the Justice Department to file a lawsuit against the country and other OPEC members for collusion.\n\nRiyadh has been caught off guard by the thirst for revenge from US politicians. And Saudi officials are hinting at payback – including dumping US debt – that could have huge ripple effects in financial markets and the real economy.\n\nNeither side is even trying to hide the tension. After a top Saudi official suggested the kingdom has decided to be the more mature party, a top White House official responded by saying, “It’s not like some high school romance here.”\n\nWhat happens next is critical.\n\nIf this decades-old relationship devolves into a full-blown break-up, there could be enormous consequences for the world economy, not to mention international security.\n\n“This is a new low. We have seen a degradation in the US-Saudi relationship for years but this is the worst it’s been,” said Clayton Allen, director at the Eurasia Group.\n\nSo much for that secret deal\n\nThe spat is linked to one of the biggest sore spots among voters during the Biden era: Inflation and high gas prices.\n\nAfter trying and failing to persuade OPEC to ramp up oil production, President Joe Biden reversed his 2020 campaign promise to make Saudi Arabia a “pariah” over its human rights record. Biden visited Saudi Arabia over the summer and even fist-bumped Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nUS officials thought they reached a secret deal with Saudi Arabia to finally boost supply of oil through the end of the year, The New York Times reported this week.\n\nThey were wrong.\n\nOPEC and its allies, known as OPEC+, responded by increasing oil production by a measly 100,000 barrels per day – the smallest increase in its history. The move was widely viewed as a “slap in the face” of the Biden administration.\n\nWhat came next was worse.\n\nIn early October, OPEC+ announced plans to slash oil production by 2 million barrels per day – a move that briefly drove up oil and gasoline prices at a time of high inflation and infuriated US politicians.\n\n“Neither side seems to understand each other,” Allen said. “Riyadh underestimated the severity of the US backlash. And the US assumed we had an unspoken agreement.”\n\nFatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, described the move as “unprecedented” and “unfortunate” in an interview with CNN International on Thursday.\n\n“When the global economy was on the brink of a global recession, they decided to push the prices up,” Birol said.\n\nSaudi official accuses US of manipulating markets\n\nThe tensions haven’t eased, and officials from both sides have sharpened their criticism of each other in recent days. In one telling episode, a top Saudi minister went from defending Biden’s energy strategy to slamming it.\n\nDuring the OPEC+ press conference in early October, Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman seemed to praise Biden’s decision to release unprecedented amount of emergency oil reserves from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n\n“I wouldn’t call it a distortion. Actually, it was done in the right time,” Prince Abdulaziz told reporters. “If it didn’t happen, I’m sure that things might be different than what it is today.”\n\nFlash forward three weeks, and that same Saudi minister sang a very different tune.\n\n“People are depleting their emergency stocks, had depleted it, used it as a mechanism to manipulate markets while its profound purpose was to mitigate a shortage of supply,” Prince Abdulaziz said during a conference in Saudi Arabia this week. “However, it is my profound duty to make it clear to the world that losing emergency stock may become painful in the months to come.”\n\nThe criticism is noteworthy, especially given that OPEC openly manipulates markets in many ways by withholding supply to support prices.\n\nOPEC is unpopular\n\nThe risk is that the tension devolves into a tit-for-tat cycle of retaliation that undermines global economic stability, or whatever economic stability there is at the moment.\n\nLawmakers from both sides of the aisle have stepped up their calls to enact NOPEC (No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels) legislation that would empower the Justice Department to go after OPEC nations on antitrust grounds. Although NOPEC isn’t new, it seems more possible now than at any point in recent memory. Eurasia Group pegs a 30% chance of NOPEC enactment and a 45% chance of a watered-down version of the bill.\n\n“You can’t overstate how upset a huge number of lawmakers are,” said Allen.\n\nLawmakers aren’t only upset, they realize OPEC is not exactly endearing itself to voters.\n\n“This is popular. American sentiment is anti-Saudi. This now has domestic political utility for American politicians. That’s where we are now,” said Karen Young, senior research scholar at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. “NOPEC would be harder to veto than in the past.”\n\nCould Saudi Arabia dump US debt?\n\nSaudi Arabia could respond to penalties from Washington with drastic steps of their own, ratcheting up the conflict further.\n\nSaudi officials have privately warned that the kingdom could sell US Treasury bonds if Congress passes NOPEC, The Wall Street Journal reported this week, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nAt a minimum, dumping US debt would create uncertainty in markets at an already-perilous moment. A fire sale would drive up Treasury rates, destabilizing markets and raising borrowing costs for families and businesses.\n\nAnd of course, Saudi Arabia’s own holdings would be damaged in such a fire sale.\n\nSaudi Arabia is sitting on roughly $119 billion of US debt, according to Treasury Department data, making it the world’s 16th largest holder of Treasuries.\n\nAnother risk is that Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of OPEC+, could remove further supply from world oil markets – or at least refuse to respond to future price spikes as the West continues to crack down on Russia.\n\nFurther curbs on OPEC supply would lift gasoline prices and worsen inflation, raising already-high recession risks.\n\nAll of this explains why a full-blown breakdown in relations between the United States and Saudi Arabia may be the last thing the fragile economy needs right now.", "authors": ["Matt Egan"], "publish_date": "2022/10/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/26/europe/ukraine-russia-invasion-sunday-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Putin orders Russian deterrence forces onto high alert as troops ...", "text": "Kyiv, Ukraine CNN —\n\nA Ukrainian delegation will meet with a Russian delegation on Monday for talks on the Ukraine-Belarus border following assurances from Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko.\n\nThe announcement came Sunday as Ukrainian forces engaged in fierce fighting with Russian troops in multiple cities across Ukraine.\n\nRussia is facing universal condemnation and increased sanctions from Western powers over Moscow’s unprovoked assault on Ukraine, now in its fourth day.\n\nUkraine’s Deputy Interior Minister Evgeny Yenin said the talks would take place Monday morning local time.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had earlier said he would be willing to hold talks with Russia but not in Belarus, pointing out that Russian military actions are being launched from that country.\n\nOn Sunday, Zelensky said in a brief televised statement that he doesn’t expect much from the meeting.\n\n“I will say frankly, as always: I do not really believe in the result of this meeting, but let them try. So that no citizen of Ukraine would have any doubt that I, as president, did not try to stop the war when there was even a small chance,” Zelensky said.\n\nUkraine has said its air force shot down a cruise missile launched at Kyiv on Sunday from Belarus. Belarus is an ally of Russia and has played an important role in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nZelensky’s office said Lukashenko had called his Ukrainian counterpart on Sunday. “The politicians have agreed that the Ukrainian delegation will meet with the Russian delegation without preconditions on the Ukrainian-Belarusian border, near the Pripyat River,” Zelensky’s office said.\n\n“Aleksander Lukashenko has taken responsibility for ensuring that all planes, helicopters and missiles stationed on the Belarusian territory will remain on the ground during the Ukrainian delegation’s travel, meeting and return.”\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin ordered his country’s deterrence forces – which include nuclear arms – onto their highest state of alert on Sunday.\n\n“Top officials in leading NATO countries have allowed themselves to make aggressive comments about our country, therefore I hereby order the Minister of Defense and the chief of the General Staff to place the Russian Army Deterrence Force on combat alert,” Putin said in a televised meeting with top Russian defense officials.\n\nPutin also said the Western sanctions placed on Russia were unlawful.\n\nA senior US official told CNN that the new development is Putin’s latest attempt to manufacture threats to justify aggression.\n\n“The only reason his forces face a threat today is because they invaded a sovereign country, and one without nuclear weapons,” said the official. “This is yet another escalatory and totally unnecessary step.”\n\nAs the fighting continues, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians have fled their homes and dozens of civilians have been killed, according to UN figures.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told a briefing that Putin’s order to put Russian deterrent forces on alert was a “direct threat to us” and an effort to raise pressure on the Ukrainian delegation at Monday’s scheduled talks.\n\nKuleba indicated that Ukrainian officials are willing to “listen to what Russia has to say” but will not give in to pressure. “We will tell them what we think of this,” he said. “And what we are ready to discuss is how to stop the war and the occupation of our territories. Full stop.”\n\nKuleba said that, according to Ukrainian intelligence, even people within Putin’s inner circle do not agree with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, “because they understand the detrimental, the damaging, the devastating consequences this conflict will have for Russia itself.”\n\nFighting in Kharkiv, missiles in Kyiv\n\nEarlier Sunday, residents of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, awoke to find the city still firmly under Ukrainian control, despite two massive explosions some 30 kilometers, or about 18 miles, south of the city lighting up the sky overnight.\n\nAnd fighting broke out on the streets of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second largest city, after Russian forces entered the city, Oleh Synehubov, the head of the Kharkiv Regional State Administration, said Sunday. “Do not leave your shelters!” he posted on Facebook, warning civilians not to go out on the streets.\n\n“Intensive exchanges of rocket artillery overnight have been followed by heavy fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces in Kharkiv,” an assessment by the UK’s Ministry of Defence said.\n\nUkrainian forces had managed to deter the Russians from entering the northeastern city – home to about 1.4 million people – for the past three days. The city, which sits less than 20 miles south of the Russian border, was approached by Russian forces shortly after the invasion began.\n\nBut despite being far better equipped, Russia has failed to take control of key cities, as ordinary Ukrainians and reservists join efforts to defend their homes and families.\n\nOthers are fleeing the conflict. The United Nations estimates as many as 368,000 Ukrainians are now refugees.\n\nThe UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said late Saturday that the United Nations “reports at least 240 civilian casualties, including at least 64 people killed” in the fighting in Ukraine. Damage to civilian infrastructure has deprived hundreds of thousands of people of access to electricity or water, the statement added.\n\nIn a video message Sunday, Zelensky accused Russian troops of targeting civilians, including children, and called for an international investigation into the conflict.\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense has previously said it is targeting only military infrastructure, saying in a statement: “The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation do not strike cities and towns, they take all measures to save the lives of civilians.”\n\nBut Zelensky rejected this, saying: “They lied when they said they would not target civilian population. Since the first hours of the invasion, Russian troops have been hitting civilian infrastructure.”\n\nUkraine is “documenting their crimes,” he said, adding: “This is terror.”\n\nRussian offensive failing, Ukrainian PM says\n\nUkrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Saturday that Russia’s offensive was failing and it was now deliberately attacking civilian infrastructure, including kindergartens, residential blocks and “buses with children” – actions he labeled as “war crimes.”\n\n“The Russian government doesn’t understand they are not fighting only with the government, in fact they are fighting against the entire Ukrainian people,” he added.\n\nRussian troops are facing a determined and highly-motivated Ukrainian resistance, resulting in significantly slower progress than Kremlin military planners had first anticipated, according to an assessment issued by Britain’s Ministry of Defence late Saturday. After encountering strong resistance in Chernihiv, Russian forces were now bypassing the area to prioritize “the encirclement and isolation of Kyiv,” another British assessment said Sunday.\n\nRussia is facing unexpected difficulties supplying its forces, and is experiencing heavier losses in personnel, armor and aircraft than expected, two senior United States officials with direct knowledge told CNN.\n\nThe US continues to see Russian forces facing “stiff resistance” and their momentum has slowed in the northern part of Ukraine, a senior US defense official told reporters Sunday, citing fuel shortages and logistical issues.\n\nThe official noted that the Russians are having a “little bit more success” in the south, and would learn from their logistical issues and find ways to overcome them.\n\nUkrainian Maj. Gen. Borys Kremenetsky told reporters Saturday that Ukraine had captured around 200 Russian soldiers, some of whom were just 19 years old. They were not trained at all and were badly equipped, he said. CNN has not been able to independently verify this.\n\nOn Sunday, Russian authorities acknowledged a number of deaths and injuries in Ukraine for the first time since the beginning of the invasion.\n\n“Russian servicemen are displaying courage and heroism in fulfilling combat tasks in the special military operation,” Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said. “Unfortunately, there have been deaths and injuries among our comrades.”\n\nWithout providing precise numbers, Konashenkov also noted that the losses suffered by Russian troops were “considerably lower” than those by Ukrainian forces.\n\nRussia has yet to establish air supremacy over Ukraine, one US official said, as the Ukrainian Air Force and air defense systems fight for control of the airspace. Without uncontested control of the skies, it becomes more difficult for an army on the move to see and strike targets from the air.\n\nSo far these challenges have prevented the quick overthrow of major Ukrainian cities, including the capital, which US officials were concerned could play out in a matter of days. The city of Kharkiv near Ukraine’s border with Russia also has not fallen to invading forces – despite officials worrying that could happen on the first night of an invasion.\n\nA NATO official agreed that Russian forces were having problems.\n\n“They lack diesel, they are proceeding way too slow and morale is obviously an issue,” said the official.\n\nAsked whether Russians are likely to intensify their efforts, the official said they have no choice. “They are way behind schedule,” the official said. “This is getting out of hand for them, every additional day is very painful.”\n\nBut the Russians on Sunday countered reports of its military stalling, claiming the cities of Kherson and Berdyansk “were completely blocked” by Russian forces, and the city of Henichesk and the Chornobayivka airfield near Kherson, also known as Chernobayevka, had both been brought under control.\n\nMaj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, the Russian Ministry of Defense spokesperson, said a Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile regiment surrendered in the Kharkiv region and 471 Ukrainian servicemen were captured.\n\nCNN could not immediately verify those claims.\n\nUkrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov said on Sunday that checkpoints would be set up across the country to detect Russian troops and make their movements more difficult.\n\nAccusations of war crimes\n\nConcerns are now growing that Russia may look to deploy indiscriminate battlefield weaponry in civilian areas in an attempt to decisively crush Ukrainian forces.\n\nA CNN team spotted a Russian thermobaric multiple rockets launcher south of Belgorod, Russia, near the Ukrainian border early Saturday afternoon.\n\nThermobaric weapons have been used in Chechnya, with horrifying consequences, according to Human Rights Watch, and their use has been condemned by number of non-governmental organizations.\n\nThere is no evidence that thermobaric weapons have been used in the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Russia moves in heavy flamethrower weapon 01:02 - Source: CNN\n\nAlthough Russia has claimed it is not targeting civilian infrastructure, an increasing body of evidence on the ground suggests otherwise.\n\nKyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko said Sunday that nine civilians, including one child, had been killed in Kyiv since the invasion began, as well as 18 military and territorial defense personnel. There are currently no Russian troops in the capital, he added. The mayor extended a strict curfew across the city until Monday morning.\n\nAccording to a local hospital, a six-year-old boy died in heavy gunfire in a western district of Kyiv on Saturday evening.\n\nA woman was killed after a nine-story residential building in the eastern city of Kharkiv was hit by “enemy artillery” on Saturday night, according to Ukraine’s State Emergency Service.\n\nPolish officials said Sunday that 187,000 people had entered Poland from Ukraine since the invasion began on Thursday.\n\nA defiant Ukraine\n\nAs the battle continues, a defiant Zelensky has released a series of videos from the streets of Kyiv urging citizens to defend their country.\n\nOfficials armed reservists with 18,000 guns and ammunition in Kyiv alone, and Ukrainian TV has broadcast instructions for making Molotov cocktails.

This is the beginning of a war against Europe, against European structures, against democracy, against basic human rights, against a global order of law, rules and peaceful coexistence,” he said.\n\nThe Ukrainian military on Sunday claimed successful attacks by its Turkish-made force of drones against Russian forces. The Armed Forces of Ukraine released footage showing the destruction of armor by a drone and said that it was carried out against a Russian Buk surface-to-air missile system.\n\nValerii Zaluzhnyi, the Armed Forces commander-in-chief, said the drone attack took place near the town of Malyn, about 100 kilometers (or 62 miles) northwest of Kyiv.\n\nThe Ukrainian government began receiving the Bayraktar TB2 drones from Turkey last year.\n\nWestern powers have imposed several rounds of sanctions against Russia since Thursday, with more under consideration. On Saturday, the United States, European Union, United Kingdom and Canada said they would expel some Russian banks from SWIFT, a global financial messaging service, and “paralyze” the assets of Russia’s central bank.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Russian state TV is covering the war very differently 02:24 - Source: CNN\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz vowed Sunday that “very soon the Russian leadership will feel what a high price they will have to pay” for the invasion of Ukraine, as he announced he would raise German military funding during a special session with lawmakers.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen confirmed Sunday that the European Union is shutting down its airspace to Russia.\n\n“We are proposing a prohibition on all Russian-owned, Russian-registered and Russian-controlled aircraft. These aircraft will no more be able to land in, take off or overfly the territory of the European Union. This will apply to any plane,” von der Leyen said.\n\n“Our airspace will be closed to every Russian plane. And that includes the private jets of oligarchs too,” she added.\n\nOn Sunday, the EU also announced a ban on Russian news outlets Russia Today and Sputnik, according to the EU’s top diplomat Josep Borrell.\n\n“Today we are taking a crucial step to turn off the tap for the Russian’s information manipulation in Europe by banning Russia Today and Sputnik from broadcasting in the European Union,” Borrell said at a joint press conference in Brussels.\n\nAt home, the Kremlin appears to be in damage control, attempting to limit information about the difficulties its forces are facing in Ukraine.\n\nSocial media platform Twitter said Saturday it is being restricted inside Russia and is working to address the issue.\n\nRussia’s media regulator told 10 news outlets that it would restrict access to their publications unless they stopped spreading “false information” – including the shelling of Ukrainian cities and the death of civilians caused by the Russian armed forces.\n\nNonetheless, Russians continued to turn out for anti-war protests over the weekend.

For the next 21 minutes, he listened as a fellow osteopath he had known for 25 years strongly denied the allegations of two former patients.\n\nNassar asked whether Karageanes would speak to Michigan State University Police and explain pelvic medical procedures, Nassar’s chosen specialty. Nassar also asked his friend to write a letter of support and help gather other doctors, trainers and therapists to fend off the women, who said he molested them during treatments when they were teenagers.\n\nKarageanes said he would help. And it was only after additional evidence piled up that he and others realized how fully Nassar had used them.\n\n\"He groomed me for 28 years to help him commit sexual assault,\" Karageanes said in a statement read by a prosecutor during Nassar’s January sentencing on seven counts of criminal sexual conduct.

The connections Nassar nurtured in sports, medicine and academia helped mask his abuses. And the institutions that gave rise to his fame failed to put sufficient checks in place to protect the children in their care.\n\nUSA Gymnastics and MSU declined to comment for this story, citing pending litigation.\n\nWhen Nassar agreed last year to skip a trial and plead guilty to sexually abusing the young girls any lingering doubt about him was removed.\n\n\"That's when it just like punched me in the head, you know,\" Karageanes said recently. \"It means everything the last few months, oh my God, the last few years, oh my God, all these years — I mean, it's all suspect. Everything.\"\n\n'One lonely tear running down my cheek'\n\nA woman identified only as Victim 125 confronted Nassar with a question that had haunted her for years.\n\n\"Who was that first girl?\" she asked Nassar in Ingham County Circuit Court. \"Am I her? Do you even remember? Do you even remember what we will never forget? Can you even remember, Larry, when it all began?\"\n\nShe was 8 years old in 1988 when Nassar arrived at the Great Lakes Gymnastics Club in Lansing, Michigan. It was there that Nassar, then in his mid-20s, teamed up with two young upstart coaches who would rise in the sport together: John Geddert, who would go on to coach an Olympic champion, and Kathie Klages, who would eventually become MSU’s gymnastics coach.\n\nNassar started medical school at MSU that year, and had already accumulated years of sports training experience. As a student at North Farmington High School, he was the trainer for the girls’ gymnastics team. Trainers treated minor injuries, and one former classmate recalled Nassar proudly carrying a black medical bag around school.\n\nNassar continued athletic training throughout college and, by 1986, the energetic and friendly young man started a decades-long relationship with Indianapolis-based USA Gymnastics, the sport’s national governing body.\n\nIn a court statement directed at Nassar, Victim 125 recalled the young medical student being at the Great Lakes gym \"almost every single day for hours with your big black medical bag full of supplies over your shoulder.\"\n\nMore:Larry Nassar was sometimes arrogant, sometimes nervous, during only interview on sex abuse\n\nVictim 125 said she was 12 in 1992 when Nassar invited her to help with a flexibility study he said he was conducting on behalf of the MSU medical school. The USA TODAY Network typically doesn't identify victims of sexual abuse without their consent.\n\n\"My mother was out of town, but granted permission for me to go to your house because not only did she love and trust you, but because I was supposed to be one of several subjects participating in your Michigan State study,\" Victim 125 recalled in court.\n\nA neighbor drove her to Nassar’s apartment. When she got there, it was just her and Nassar. There were no other subjects for his alleged study. Trusting Nassar, the pre-teen girl followed his direction.\n\nHe told her to take a bath in his tub, which would help relax her muscles, she said in court. Then he laid her, naked, on a treatment table in his living room.\n\nShe reminded Nassar in court \"... you massaged the entirety of my 12-year-old body, suggesting that I relax as you slipped your adult fingers in and out and in and out of my body. That was one of the many, many times that your hands were in me, on me, over the next many years.\"\n\nVictim 125 said in an interview last month that Nassar’s alleged study left her confused.\n\n\"I knew when I left there that something had happened,\" Victim 125 said. \"I didn't know I was sexually abused. I just knew that I felt really uncomfortable and that something had gone on, but I didn’t know what.\"\n\nFormer Great Lakes gymnasts Christina Barba and Trinea Gonczar said that Nassar used a similar ploy on them around that time. They may have been among Nassar’s original victims.\n\nBarba, in a recent interview, said Nassar invited her to his apartment so he could practice new techniques.\n\nShe said he showed her a picture in a textbook. It depicted the pelvic floor, a group of muscles, tendons and nerves that come together in the pelvis near the genitals. He was not yet a doctor, and he was already beginning to focus on that part of the anatomy. And he was already using it to justify child abuse.\n\nBarba said Nassar had her sit in a bathtub. He stretched her legs and then performed an invasive procedure with his hand.\n\nBarba said she trusted Nassar, who had always been nice to her, but the situation made her uncomfortable.\n\n\"I remember having, like, one lonely tear running down my cheek,\" she said.\n\nA self-made expert on the pelvic floor\n\nNassar received his medical degree in 1993, and later positioned himself as an expert on pelvic floor treatments.\n\nHe became adept at relieving pain caused by the rigors of gymnastics, but he also took liberties with the girls that went far beyond their medical needs, according to statements from numerous survivors. He sometimes groped their breasts. And, no matter what their ailment, whether a sore neck or ankle, some said, Nassar's treatment often involved penetration of their vaginas.\n\nThere is an accepted osteopathic intravaginal procedure for adult women with specific problems, but it is considered a last resort to be used only in the most severe situations. Karageanes said it should not be used on prepubescent girls. Some victims said Nassar assaulted them this way every time they visited him.\n\nNassar’s career shifted into high gear after he went to his first Olympic Games in 1996, where the Magnificent Seven won the first-ever team gold medal for the U.S. He also was appointed USA Gymnastics' national medical coordinator. The following year he was hired as an assistant professor at the MSU College of Osteopathic Medicine.\n\nNassar burnished his image by volunteering at schools, speaking at gymnastics workshops and sports medicine conferences. He secured a U.S. patent for his prototype of an ankle support device. He wrote a textbook chapter establishing guidelines for performing medical techniques near genitalia. He filmed more than 1,000 videos about osteopathic techniques, some of which were done close to genitalia, but did not involve penetration.\n\nThe United States Olympic Committee awarded Nassar a grant in 1990, while he was still in medical school, to study changes in the wrists of female gymnasts.\n\nProminent coaches and doctors referred athletes to Nassar for treatment. He collected state, regional and national honors that bolstered his credibility in gymnastics and sports medicine, and brought prestige to both MSU and USA Gymnastics.\n\nThe United States Elite Coaches Association named him National Contributor of the Year six times from 1993 to 2002. \"The highly respected, visible, eager osteopathic physician will be an excellent addition to the faculty,\" the MSU search committee said.\n\n\"He essentially did a lot of humble bragging,\" Karageanes said. \"He always had a USA Gymnastics or Michigan State shirt on, always.\"\n\nNassar eventually became known as The Gymnastics Doctor, one of the only physicians specializing in the sport, as well as a self-made expert in pelvic floor treatments. \"So when I say 'self-made,' I mean he literally put himself out there as this guy who knows how to treat this,\" Karageanes said.\n\nKarageanes heard Nassar speak about medical techniques Nassar used that involved placing his hands near young gymnasts’ genitalia after bunching up their shorts. He also saw photos of Nassar demonstrating those techniques.\n\nThe procedures were invasive enough that Karageanes once asked Nassar, \"aren't you worried about being sued ever by touching girls like this on their bottoms?\"\n\nNassar laughed.\n\nThen he rattled off a long list of resources supporting pelvic floor treatment, citing specific websites and articles. He never seemed defensive about it. And he was always prepared to talk about how important it was.\n\nLater, Karageanes said he realized all of those efforts were Nassar trying to normalize his predatory behavior.\n\n\"He worked very hard at that,\" Karageanes said.\n\nTo disguise what he was doing, Nassar would describe his treatment in different ways to different people, presenting it as noninvasive to the medical world, while penetrating the vaginas and rectums of gymnasts under the guise of healing them. Many of his victims were so young, naïve and trusting that they didn’t realize they were being abused.\n\nFor decades, the difference between what Nassar said and did — and the deference of patients, parents and other doctors — would create confusion that allowed him to continue molesting girls.\n\nAn environment ripe for abuse\n\nInstead of providing strong defenses against such a predator, the gymnastics culture placed few boundaries between Nassar and the girls he would groom and abuse.\n\nUSA Gymnastics was so confident in its doctor back in 2000 that it sent out the following message to gymnasts attending its National Talent Opportunity Program Training Camp: \"If you or anyone in your room has a problem at night (or any time), please call Dr. Larry Nassar, Debbie Van Horn or a USA Gymnastics staff person. Please do not call your personal coach.\"\n\nThe Olympic organization failed to prevent Nassar from treating girls alone in hotel rooms and in dorm rooms at its national training center in Texas, known as the Karolyi Ranch. Many of the women who spoke in court during Nassar’s sentencing described this as an environment ripe for abuse.\n\nThe girls in Nassar’s orbit were taught from a young age what it takes to be an elite gymnast: discipline, obedience and a high tolerance for pain. Withstanding the pain meant keeping quiet, which cultivated a mindset among the young athletes that their voices didn’t matter.\n\n\"From the beginning we are taught to soldier on through intense training sessions, through the emotional roller coaster of competition, through injury and fatigue, through pain,\" former gymnast Chelsea Williams said.\n\nWhen gymnasts were injured, they were sometimes required to see Nassar.\n\nThe number of victims rose.\n\nWarning signs:How to protect your child from sexual predators\n\nRelated:8 ways to talk to your child about sexual abuse\n\nIn 2013, USA Gymnastics made Nassar a \"core member\" of a Medical Task Force established to review the organization's \"practices, procedures and protocols regarding athlete care.\" Among its responsibilities: develop best practices for medical team members, including \"ethical obligations for addressing or reporting significant issues.\"\n\nA year later, former USA Gymnastics President Steve Penny praised Nassar as being \"instrumental to the success of USA Gymnastics at many levels, both on and off the field of play.\"\n\nIn the process, many gymnasts were led to believe that Nassar using his fingers to penetrate their vaginas and rectums was a necessary, and routine, part of their osteopathic care.\n\n\"Who was I to question his treatments or, even more, risk my chance at making the Olympic team or being chosen to compete nationally, and, after all, he was recommended by the national team staff and he treated us monthly at all of our national team camps,\" 2012 Olympic gold medalist Jordyn Wieber said during the Ingham County court hearing. Wieber, a Lansing area native, trained with Geddert at Twistars.\n\n'All the girls loved Larry'\n\nUSA Gymnastics and others missed several warning signs of pedophilia.\n\nChild safety advocates recommend that organizations that deal with children prohibit adults from being alone with children, from giving them gifts and from emailing and texting children directly. But Nassar did all of that.\n\nAnd he took advantage of the harsh gymnastics culture. Several survivors said in court that verbal abuse was common from coaches, including Nassar’s longtime friend, Geddert, who owned Twistars in Dimondale, a suburb near Lansing. Nassar volunteered there as a trainer. Neither Geddert, whose USA Gymnastics membership was suspended in January, nor his attorney responded to requests for comment.\n\nLike many sexual predators, Nassar positioned himself as a helpful \"nice guy.\"\n\nIn a culture where overeating was discouraged, food and water intake was closely monitored and body shaming was common, Nassar slipped the girls unsanctioned Skittles and Starburst. He commiserated with them about the pressures of the sport. He gave them what they perceived as a safe space, away from stern coaches they feared.\n\n\"Every Monday he would come to the gym and everyone was always so happy to see him,\" said Brooke Hylek, giving a statement at Nassar’s sentencing. \"All the girls loved Larry and trusted him.\"\n\nNassar sought deeper connections, too, as the girls’ close friend and confidant. He texted them, sent them messages on Facebook, gave them nicknames and shared adult details about himself, such as his preferred beer.\n\nHe played on their desire for Olympic greatness, hanging pictures of top athletes in his office. Some women remembered looking up at the images as he assaulted them.\n\nGift-giving is considered a possible warning sign of pedophilia, especially when only certain children receive them, and is banned from some gyms, but no one appears to have stopped Nassar.\n\nHe gifted Kassie Powell, a track athlete, an Olympic sweatshirt she wore around the house for weeks. Emily Morales, a gymnast, got an autographed towel from the London Olympics. Alexis Alvarado was given autographed photos of famous gymnasts. Others received Olympic pins and one girl was given a practice leotard.\n\nFor Isabell Hutchins the gifts were even more personal — 1996 Olympics swag featuring the event’s mascot, Izzy.\n\nIsabell was gifted figurines and playing cards.\n\n\"And there were Izzy Band-Aids for Izzy boo-boos because of all the injuries I had had,\" Hutchins said during Nassar’s sentencing. \"He even wrote me a letter and he said, 'Dear Izzy, I am so proud of you having such an awesome season this year. Did you know that the 1996 Olympic mascot was Izzy? Well, enjoy. And, of course, I have a pair of Izzy socks from the 2000 Aussie Olympics.\n\n\"Love you, girl. Larry.'\"\n\nBut the trust Hutchins, Hylek, Powell, Morales, Alvarado and hundreds of other girls put in Nassar was betrayed. They were all assaulted.\n\nHutchins brought the Izzy figurines into the courtroom during Nassar’s sentencing. After her statement, she dropped them in the trash.\n\n'Instead of being protected, I was humiliated'\n\nSome girls did complain. But Nassar’s connections, reputation and careful attention to victim grooming repeatedly worked in his favor, as did the ambiguities he created about the procedures he performed.\n\nFormer gymnast Larissa Boyce told the court she raised concerns to MSU coach Kathie Klages about Nassar’s treatments as early as 1997. According to a lawsuit, Klages, who started working with Nassar at Great Lakes, asked other gymnasts in the Spartan Youth program if Nassar had done anything to them.\n\nA second gymnast spoke up.\n\nBut rather than calling police or MSU officials, Boyce said Klages went to Nassar. \"Instead of being protected,\" Boyce said in court, \"I was humiliated. I was in trouble, and brainwashed into believing that I was the problem. This MSU employee then fed me back to you, the wolf, to continue to be devoured.\"\n\nKlages' attorney declined comment, citing a pending lawsuit. In 2017, Klages told police she did not remember Boyce coming to her.\n\nOne of the women who met Nassar at Great Lakes in the 1980s said a very close friend came to her in 1997. \"I think Larry did something bad to me,\" the friend told Gonczar.\n\n\"I asked her what he had done,\" Gonczar said in court. \"She explained he vaginally manipulated her. I calmed her down and explained to her what happened to her was completely OK as it happened to me all the time.\"\n\nThat conversation upset Gonczar when she eventually realized the treatment she and her friend had received was actually sexual abuse. Gonczar said she recently sought counseling.\n\nMichigan police departments twice investigated Nassar prior to his arrest in 2016, once in 2004 and again in 2014. The first investigation was never sent to prosecutors. The second one was, but no charges were filed.\n\nIn early 2014, MSU graduate Amanda Thomashow reported that Nassar massaged her breast and vagina after sending out the only other person present during an exam at MSU. She told him to stop, but he did not until she physically removed his hand from her. The university started a Title IX investigation and its police department started a separate criminal investigation.\n\nNassar went to William Strampel, one of his bosses at the time, for support. Strampel received updates on the status of the Title IX investigation throughout, according to emails obtained through a public records request.\n\nThe investigation relied on the medical opinions of four MSU employees who had close ties to Nassar. They determined that Thomashow received an appropriate medical procedure and likely misinterpreted it as sexual assault because she wasn't familiar with osteopathic medicine and wouldn’t know the \"nuanced difference.\"\n\n\"As I see it, Amanda was abused twice,\" Suzanne Thomashow said of the Title IX process, specifically pointing to the \"nuanced difference\" line that said her daughter didn’t understand what happened.\n\nSuzanne Thomashow, a doctor, said she was furious when Amanda told her what Nassar did. Suzanne Thomashow knew it was a sexual assault, but she thought it was an isolated incident. She stopped referring patients to Nassar after that and didn’t send any of her daughters back to see him.\n\nSuzanne Thomashow would later learn that one of her other daughters, Jessica, had been sexually assaulted by Nassar years before.\n\nAs a result of the 2014 investigation, Nassar agreed to have another person in the room during procedures of \"anything close to a sensitive area\" and would modify procedures to have \"little to no\" skin-to-skin contact. But police say Strampel later told them that he didn’t see a need to ensure Nassar followed those protocols, because Nassar had been “cleared of all charges” and “exonerated,” according to a police report.\n\nStrampel told Nassar in an email that he was happy the complaint had been resolved and that Nassar was back to full clinical duties.\n\nIn 2015 yet another complaint was received, this time by USA Gymnastics. It prompted USA Gymnastics to quietly release Nassar. The organization notified the FBI, but no one else. Nassar continued working with girls for another year at MSU and Twistars, while the FBI investigation languished.\n\nMore time allotted:USA Gymnastics delayed reporting Larry Nassar to FBI for 5 weeks\n\nUSA Gymnastics previously said it was told not to interfere with the FBI's investigation and interpreted that to mean it could not speak about the allegations.\n\nAt least 20 women and girls have said Nassar abused them after MSU and USA Gymnastics had been made aware of allegations against the doctor, records show.\n\nOn. Dec. 14, Strampel stepped down from his post as dean of the College of Osteopathic Medicine, citing medical reasons. On Feb. 9, MSU interim President John Engler moved to fire Strampel for his failure to enforce the protocols imposed on Nassar. Strampel is also a focus of the Michigan Attorney General’s Office’s investigation of MSU. His attorneys declined comment.\n\nRespect for Nassar was ‘through the roof’\n\nNassar’s reputation among coaches also helped him evade detection.\n\nOver 15 years, longtime gymnastics coach Patrick Hulliung relied on Nassar’s recommendations for training methods that prevent injury. Hulliung attended the doctor’s seminars, read his books, consulted with him about injuries and sent athletes to him for treatment.\n\nHulliung even invited Nassar to his gym, the World Class Gymnastics Center in Belleville, Illinois, to screen athletes.\n\n\"Respect level for him was through the roof,\" Hulliung said. \"He was the best.\"\n\nNever, in all those years, did Hulliung hear a whisper of allegations against the famed doctor. There were rumors about coaches in the sport, sure. But not Nassar.\n\nSo Hulliung said he was horrified in January 2016 when Samantha Ursch, a former gymnast whom he regarded as family, described in detail how Nassar had inserted his fingers into the most private areas of her body.\n\nThe medical appointment had happened five years earlier, when Ursch was suffering back pain as a senior at Central Michigan University. The 22-year-old tried to justify Nassar’s actions. Teammates told her they had experienced something similar. She called her mom, who argued something didn’t sound right. Ursch defended Nassar, but she said \"the feeling of wrongdoing haunted my mom.\"\n\nIt was Ursch's mother who prompted her to tell Hulliung and another coach while they were visiting each other in Florida.\n\nHulliung said he couldn’t sleep that night. He felt guilty for being one of the people who recommended Nassar to Ursch.\n\n\"I knew it was wrong from the moment she said it to me,\" he said.\n\nBut he hesitated. He wanted to give Nassar the benefit of the doubt. So, when he returned to Illinois days later, he met with his friend Dr. Richard Lehman, medical director for the U.S. Center for Sports Medicine in St. Louis.\n\nLehman said in a recent interview that the coach looked terrible. Hulliung relayed Ursch's story and asked Lehman what he thought about Nassar’s techniques.\n\n\"In 33 years of this,\" Lehman said, \"and, you know, going to a million meetings and hearing a million talks and reading the literature and kind of knowing everybody in sports medicine, I’ve really never heard of anything like this.\"\n\nLehman said he had never heard of a technique like that to treat back pain.\n\n\"That's just full-on sexual assault,\" Lehman told Hulliung. \"I just can't put it any other way.\"\n\nThe coach hung his head.\n\n\"That's kind of my take on it as well,\" Hulliung replied.\n\n\"It was a grim discussion,\" Lehman said in an interview, \"and it was grim for both of us.\"\n\nHulliung said he left Lehman’s office and talked over the situation with the other coach who had heard Ursch's story.\n\nThe two coaches wondered what would happen if they made the report. They weren’t worried about Ursch’s safety. She was an adult. She lived in another state and hadn’t seen Nassar in years. Hulliung said they were concerned that Nassar was working with other gymnasts. But they also feared backlash from USA Gymnastics if they reported what happened. Scoring is subjective. Would their athletes face repercussions? The coaches didn’t want their gymnasts to suffer for something they had done.\n\n\"My delay and discussion was: 'What’s going to happen to us when we start throwing accusations around about somebody as high-profile as this person?'\" Hulliung said.\n\nThey decided to stay quiet.\n\n‘An amazing media storm’\n\nThe beginning of the end for Nassar came when IndyStar published a story Aug. 4, 2016, about sexual abuse in gymnastics. Within weeks, former gymnasts contacted the newspaper to share stories about their abuse by Nassar. One of them contacted MSU police.\n\nNassar called on friends before the story came out, asking for help. That's when he dialed Karageanes.\n\nKarageanes, the fellow doctor who knew Nassar, believed at the time that Nassar’s treatments might have been misunderstood. He agreed to help.\n\nRachael Denhollander's brave journey: Lone voice transforms into 'army' at Larry Nassar's sentencing\n\nIt bothered Karageanes that two women from different walks of life and different paths had made identical claims. \"But the overwhelming part of my brain was saying, 'I’m going to protect Larry. This isn’t Larry.' And he told me that he didn’t do anything intravaginal, so I believed that, too.\"\n\nWhen IndyStar published a story about Nassar, it was the first time any of the accusations against him had been made public. And for scores of women, it was the first time they heard Nassar deny doing intravaginal procedures.\n\nThat claim inflamed women who instantly knew it was a lie. More accusers came forward.\n\nUrsch was among them. When Hulliung, her former coach, learned of allegations against Nassar, he said he was irritated and upset with himself for not having immediately reported what happened to Ursch.\n\n\"To hell with it,\" he told a fellow coach. \"I’m calling right now.\"\n\nHulliung said he called USA Gymnastics first. An official there told him the organization couldn't talk about it. He said he asked for guidance, but they didn't offer any.\n\nHe called MSU police to make a report. Then Hulliung asked Ursch if he could pass her number to police. Ursch, who believes Hulliung hadn’t reported earlier because he was trying to protect her, joined those who were telling their stories.\n\nOn the morning of Sept. 16, 2016, Nassar’s former MSU medical school boss, Strampel, told Nassar in an email that more people appeared to be coming forward.\n\nNassar responded: \"The media has killed me.\"\n\nA 20-year toll: 368 gymnasts allege sexual exploitation\n\nThe victims: Gymnasts who have accused Larry Nassar of sexual assault\n\n\"Things are moving outside of my control,\" Strampel wrote back. That day MSU took the first formal step to fire Nassar.\n\nEven with the new allegations looming, though, Nassar continued to rally supporters. One of his protégées sent a text: \"Larry, praying for you and your family. You’ve been a great mentor for me.\"\n\nNassar invoked his old defense.\n\n\"Working in the pelvic floor area on over 1000 patients has turned into some sort of life of crime now as the media has created such an amazing media storm,\" he replied to the text.\n\nNassar also turned to members of the board of the American Osteopathic Academy of Sports Medicine. In a Nov. 17, 2016, email to Karageanes and another academy official, Nassar detailed his struggles in the face of a growing number of accusers.\n\n\"I am trying my best to stay positive and keep a good attitude to keep my family's daily activities as normal as possible,\" Nassar wrote. He added later, \"I also gain strength from the continued support I receive from the community. I have 27 physicians, 21 physical therapist and 122 patients/parents/coaches all willing to testify to support me and the list continues to grow each week.\"\n\nNassar concluded with a plea for help. He even suggested language the academy could use in a statement of support, including the phrase: \"He has conducted himself at our events with the highest morals and ethics.\"\n\nIn retrospect, Karageanes said he realizes that Nassar still believed he would be able to bury the accusations in a hail of medical arguments, and with a little help from his friends. But because the case was now public, it was quickly spinning out of Nassar's control.\n\nEmpowering: Some of the most powerful Larry Nassar victim testimony\n\nWhat happened: Victims share what Larry Nassar did to them under the guise of medical treatment\n\nOne of the people who stepped forward to report abuse was neither a gymnast, nor a patient of Nassar’s. Kyle Stephens, a neighbor of the doctor, said Nassar had repeatedly abused her during visits to his home starting when she was 6 years old. That removed the medical arguments from the case.\n\nWhen that news broke, Karageanes contacted the academy. \"I said, 'Hold everything on this. Something's wrong here.'\" The letter of support was never sent.\n\nA month later, in federal court, authorities revealed shocking new evidence that they had found during the search in September: 37,000 images of child pornography on computer drives Nassar had set out for trash pickup.\n\nSome still refused to believe. When asked about the child pornography, Klages, the MSU gymnastics coach who had known Nassar for decades, floated the possibility that police had planted the evidence, according to a lawsuit.\n\nLindsey Lemke, who spoke at Nassar’s sentencing, said in court that Klages held a team meeting in September 2016 at which she defended Nassar and asked athletes to sign a sympathy card for him.\n\nKlages, whose attorney declined comment, was suspended by MSU in February 2017 for the way she handled that meeting. She resigned a day later.\n\nThe child pornography was the final straw for Karageanes and many of Nassar’s other supporters.\n\n37,000 incriminating images:Larry Nassar pleads guilty to federal child porn charges\n\nChristy Lemke-Akeo, whose daughter Lindsey Lemke had been a gymnast at Twistars and MSU, had initially considered helping Nassar.\n\nWhen the accusations against Nassar first became public, Lemke-Akeo said she asked her daughter if she had been abused and her daughter said, no. So they initially decided to stand by the man they thought was their friend.\n\nNassar had played several different roles to gain their trust: friend, neighbor, doctor and even a babysitter of sorts, encouraging them to run errands while he treated Lemke after hours. He would do anything to be helpful, said Lemke-Akeo.\n\nSome of Nassar’s seemingly kind acts should have been red flags. When Lemke-Akeo injured her shoulder, Nassar examined it. If Lemke-Akeo was ill, he would write her a prescription. He didn't bill their insurance. Nassar once gave her daughter a muscle relaxer at his house for her back pain, which Lemke-Akeo questioned but dismissed as Nassar being nice.\n\nLemke-Akeo said she “flipped out” when she heard about the child pornography. She confronted her daughter again.\n\n\"I said, 'how many times did he do it to you?' She said, 'Every time.’ So she had been seeing him since she was 10 years old up until she was 20 and every time he saw her he was doing that to her,\" Lemke-Akeo said.\n\n‘Nobody gets the benefit of the doubt’\n\nLooking back, Hulliung, the coach who reported Nassar’s assault on Ursch, said he’s embarrassed that he didn’t report it months earlier. If he could go back, he said he would make a different choice.\n\nThe sentence and an apology: Larry Nassar gets up to 175 years in sexual abuse scandal\n\n\"As a parent or a coach in a position to safeguard children, I think you cannot give people the benefit of the doubt,\" he said. \"I think maybe we learned that, or I learned that, the hard way. When you’re that safeguard of children, nobody gets the benefit of the doubt, no matter their reputation or credentials.\"\n\nHulliung sees Nassar’s abuses as a \"great motivator to get things right\" — to create a gymnastics culture in which people don’t fear repercussions for expressing concern or asking questions when something doesn’t seem normal.\n\n\"The most egregious thing that happened wasn’t what Larry did,\" Hulliung said. \"The most egregious thing that happened was that it was allowed to go on for so long.\"\n\nWhat the prosecutor said: 7 lessons we learned from Larry Nassar sentencing\n\n'I'm proud of these brave gymnasts': IndyStar investigation leads to U.S. House passing sexual abuse legislation\n\nAbout this story\n\nThis article is based on 1,583 pages of victim impact statements presented in Ingham County Circuit Court in Michigan in January. More than 150 women said Larry Nassar abused them over three decades, many when they were children. USA TODAY Network reporters at the Indianapolis Star, Lansing State Journal and Detroit Free Press conducted interviews with victims, doctors and coaches in multiple states.\n\nTo contact the reporters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/03/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/02/14/winter-weather-new-england-boston-huricane-winds/23406815/", "title": "New England braces for fourth round of heavy snow", "text": "G. Jeffrey MacDonald and Doug Stanglin\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nMARBLEHEAD, Mass. — As light snow began to fall here Saturday afternoon, residents braced for a fourth round of heavy snow in less than a month across New England, as the latest storm threatened to deliver life-threatening blizzards, hurricane-force winds, whiteouts and widespread power outages.\n\nDuring a late-afternoon briefing, Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker called it \"a Cinderella evening\" and urged residents going out for Valentine's Day to be off the roads by midnight so that crews can plow and remove snow on Sunday. He said forecasts call for a foot of snow in parts of eastern Massachusetts.\n\nSnow blown about by strong winds \"will make driving virtually impossible. Unless you have a really good reason to be out tomorrow, we would urge you all to stay off the roads,\" he said.\n\nIn this North Shore town about 16 miles northeast of Boston, Fred Brink raced before the storm to dig out his office entrance, which had been buried for two weeks. \"At least if I clear this now, then I'll only be dealing with fresh snow after this storm,\" he said.\n\nA few blocks away, Miles Keroack bought a gas can to fill his new snowblower. He hadn't needed one during his 20 years living in town, but he finally made the purchase after the most recent storm, the third major one in two weeks.\n\n\"My wife said, 'That's enough. Time to get one,' \" he said, adding that he has never seen so much snow in such a short time. \"It took me going to 10 places to find a snowblower, but we finally got one.\"\n\nThe forecast for another round of heavy snow is disheartening enough for winter-weary Boston and coastal New England, but the storm will also usher in another Arctic air mass that will dip southward Sunday, bringing some of the coldest temperatures of year as far south as Florida.\n\nBoston, which has already endured 42 inches of snow this month and three major winter storms, plans to simply hunker down, with the area transit lines shutting down completely Sunday. The city has issued a parking ban starting 10 p.m. Saturday.\n\nIn Swampscott, Joe Caponigro called a friend at Ciciotti Construction and asked him to swing by Saturday night, preferably with his backhoe loader. His driveway had become so squeezed by plowed snow from past storms that he was having trouble getting cars in and out.\n\n\"I had to open it up,\" Capinigro explained as his friend, Marco Ciciotti, scooped up snowbanks and dumped them on taller ones nearby.\n\nFor Ginna Ospina of East Boston, another storm meant it was time again to avoid grocery stores, which she expected to be mobbed and picked over as residents stocked up for potential power outages.\n\nSince the first one hit nearly three weeks ago, Ospina, 37, has tried to avoid driving because she would likely lose her on-street parking spot and have to shovel out a frozen snowbank to create a new space.\n\nInstead of a five-minute drive to work, she now walks an hour, because she has to walk in the street, weaving around giant mounds of snow and dodging vehicles.\n\n\"Before it was like, 'Oh, snow is good! We get a little break',\" Ospina said. \"No. This is just too much. I miss the pavement.\"\n\n\"It's pretty depressing,\" she said. \"Another storm just prolongs this agony.\"\n\nAt Green's Ace Hardware in Marblehead, store manager Justin Turbie said he's been selling out of about 100 shovels every two to three days, and shipments of 50 to 75 roof rakes are usually gone within an hour. \"Our customers are saying it's probably the worst it's ever been\" in terms of winter weather, he said.\n\nThe heavy snow has led to an increase in roof collapses, Gov. Baker said in his briefing.\n\nThe prospect of cancelling school meant she'd be hearing more frustration from her 15-year-old son, who's had so many days off that he's missing his friends. When school resumes, she'll worry about him walking in busy streets near school because sidewalks are inaccessible.\n\nFor Romeo Merino of East Boston, Sunday's blizzard extends an erratic work season in construction. He'll likely miss work again Monday because it takes him five hours after big storms to dig out his landlord's property and get vehicles freed up. He could make $100 or $200 shoveling on a day off, he said, but then it's back to outdoor construction, which isn't steady work for him in the wake of huge snowfalls.\n\n\"I've been missing two days of work per week,\" Merino said. \"I'm shoveling at my house. Then you got to go to work, too. It makes life harder.\"\n\nOthers are taking the next storm in relative stride. Steve Burri, an inspector for the MBTA and a landlord of a triple-decker home in East Boston, was relaxed as he ran his snowblower to the make his driveway wider before the next deluge.\n\n\"We're professionals,\" he said with a smile. \"We've got this down to a science. We can handle this.\"\n\nNo one would blame him if he did worry, at least a little. He owns a flat-roofed property that's getting a blizzard on top of more snow in a two-week period than any time in Boston history. But he's not worried, he said, because from his window he can see the tops of similar buildings in the neighborhood. Much of the snow seems to have blown off them, which means his might be fairly clear as well. So he hopes, at least.\n\nAfter snowblowing Saturday, Burri planned to relax with a glass of wine. Sunday is his day off before another 15-hour shift that begins midnight Sunday night. He's been working 70-hour weeks at the MBTA since the storms began because the T has struggled to keep equipment working in all the snow and cold.\n\nHe is concerned, though, to have his son waste no time after the blizzard and shovel off the garage roof. It had four or five feet of snow on it Saturday even before the snow began to fall.\n\n\"I'm a little worried about that roof,\" he said, pointing to the garage. \"We already cleaned that off once.\"\n\nHaving faced an especially tough winter, even by Boston standards, Burri is thinking about retiring in a couple of years and moving south.\n\n\"Somewhere warm,\" he said. \"Maybe North Carolina.\"\n\nBy late afternoon, 81 Saturday flights destined for Boston Logan airport had been canceled, according to FlightAware.com. For Sunday, 211 departing and 145 arriving flights already have been canceled at Logan and the airport may have to shut down entirely, at least for a period of time.\n\nThroughout the Northeast, hundreds of Saturday flights have been canceled, with nearly 1,000 Sunday flights, including more than 500 inbound and outbound flights at the three major New York metropolitan airports, already canceled in anticipation of the storm, according to FlightAware.com.\n\n\"Travel will become nearly impossible and potentially life-threatening due to whiteout conditions and bitterly cold wind chills,\" the National Weather Service warns. \"Conditions will remain dangerous for travel well into Sunday due to blowing and drifting snow.\"\n\nThat is grim news indeed for a region that, in some areas, has staggered under 6 feet or more in recent weeks. The hardest-hit area this weekend will likely stretch along the coast from Cape Cod to Maine, which could get as much as 15 inches of snow. The Boston area could see 8 to 10 inches or more.\n\nThe storm arrived peacefully enough Saturday afternoon with light snow, but it will build in intensity into Sunday morning as the arctic air triggers winds of up to 75 miles just off the coast.\n\nThe storm is part of a ferocious winter system stretching from the Midwest across the northern tier that has already brought up to 8 inches of snow in parts of Michigan.\n\n\"The Arctic front will behave like a squall line, but instead of bringing heavy rain, it could bring a brief period of heavy snow with perhaps thunder and lightning,\" says AccuWeather.com Senior Meteorologist Henry Margusity.\n\nHe warned the rolling band of snow could quickly create dangerous driving conditions.\n\n\"The squall line of snow and the sudden drop of temperature with strong wind gusts can make wet roads slippery in a matter of a couple of minutes and catch motorists off guard,\" Margusity said.\n\nThe Mid-Atlantic states should miss the brunt of the snow but will likely face strong winds Sunday, particularly in coastal areas. The National Weather Service says the Arctic air mass is expected to send temperatures in the single digits, teens and 20s well into Virginia and North Carolina.\n\n\"The strong winds will combine with these frigid temperatures to produce brutal subzero wind chills,\" the weather service said.\n\nDespite bright sunshine, portions of northern Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia will have high temperatures only in the 30s during the second half of the weekend and into early next week.\n\n\"The air will get cold enough in northern Florida to bring the risk of damage to unprotected sensitive fruits and vegetables,\" said AccuWeather.com senior meteorologist Alex Sosnowski.\n\n.\n\nAs snow accumulated on Valentine's Day, Gov. Baker had decided to extend the lovers' holiday to provide an economic boost for the region. He declared the week of Feb. 15 \"Valentine's Week,\" encouraging couples and others to support hard-hit local businesses after the blizzard cleanup is done.\n\nStanglin reported from McLean, Va.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/02/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/30/health/suicide-deaths-2021/index.html", "title": "US suicide rates rose in 2021, reversing two years of decline | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: If you or someone you know is struggling with suicidal thoughts or mental health matters, please call the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988 or 800-273-8255 to connect with a trained counselor, or visit 988lifeline.org.\n\nCNN —\n\nLast year, a landlord stopped by Patrick John’s home in the Salt Lake City area to replace a broken dishwasher. John was always a little shy with people he didn’t know well, but he welcomed his guest with the warmth that he was known and loved for.\n\nIn the process of replacing the dishwasher, they discovered that mice had found their way inside the house, likely because of nearby construction. But for John – a husband and father of four – the mess became a physical representation of his sense that he was failing his family.\n\nA few years earlier, physical health challenges had made John unable to work. The change took a toll on him in many ways. That day, his worries spiraled into fears of eviction or homelessness, and he called his wife, Sabina, in a panic.\n\nJohn had also struggled with depression and anxiety for years and was working hard to overcome his mental health challenges with regular therapy and medication. But his access to therapy was cut off in 2020 as the office closed to in-person visits amid the Covid-19 pandemic, and in early February 2021 – within hours of the landlord leaving – he died by suicide at age 32.\n\n“It was everything leading up to that point that made such a small thing so big to him,” Sabina John said. “The day was just hard, in general, and I think that may have just tipped him over the edge to say ‘I can’t do this anymore.’ “\n\nPatrick John was one of 47,646 people in the US who died of suicide last year, according to a new report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention – one death every 11 minutes.\n\nSuicide has long been a growing concern – rates have increased 31% over the past 20 years, CDC data shows – but experts were divided in their expectations of what the pandemic would bring. Isolation and other new stressors could take a heavy toll, for example, but the forced changes could also help people remove themselves from previous stressors and find solace in a shared crisis.\n\nPatrick John, a husband and father of four, died by suicide in February 2021. Courtesy Stephanie Howell Photography\n\nA dip in suicide rates in 2019 continued into 2020, but the CDC report, released Friday, shows that 2021 reversed most of that improvement and brought rates back to near-record levels – about 14 suicide deaths for every 100,000 people.\n\nThe pandemic may have introduced new difficulties into our lives, but experts say the many reasons a person may attempt suicide have a common core.\n\n“There is individual difference that exists with what might make me lose hope versus you,” said Sarah Brummett, director of the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention’s executive committee. “But taking a step back, when we’re talking about the drivers for suicidal despair, we’re talking about pain and the loss of hope that things can get better.”\n\nFor some, like John, the path is long and winding before it reaches a breaking point. For others, it’s more direct.\n\n“Traditionally, we thought of suicide as linear. First, you start having thoughts, and you maybe practice with attempts, and then you actually attempt. But people can jump these phases,” said Justin Baker, a psychologist and assistant professor at the Ohio State University College of Medicine. “This may be someone that has previously never struggled with suicide. So universal screening measures would have missed that kind of individual.”\n\nIn either case, it is often just a matter of minutes between the time a person decides to take their life and when a suicide attempt is made, experts say. But there’s usually a trigger – like a breakup, a financial crisis, violence or other trauma.\n\n“That individual can’t think their way through that situation or find an alternative strategy to get out. They’re just flooded and overwhelmed, and so they see suicide as the solution to that immense distress or pain,” Baker said.\n\nBut, he said, most people who survive suicide attempts say they didn’t really want to die – they just want help getting through that immediate pain.\n\nBetter lifelines\n\nAlthough CDC data shows that suicides increased from 2020 to 2021, experts say it’s challenging to draw conclusions from one year of change. And rates are relatively stable compared with three years earlier.\n\nIn recent years, progress has been made on both critical fronts: better options for addressing the immediate crisis and building up support for broader mental health resources.\n\n“Suicides did not skyrocket the way a lot of people thought they would” during the pandemic, partly because there were efforts by so many who were “trying to head off what we were afraid would happen,” said Doreen Marshall, a psychologist and vice president of mission engagement with the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention.\n\nThere was also a “growing awareness and learning on the part of the public about what mental health is and how to help someone who’s struggling,” she said.\n\nAlthough John would often isolate himself during tough times, he did recognize the positive effects of talking things through with his therapist and family – and he was generous in offering that support to others.\n\nHe was an avid gamer and found respite in the online gaming community. After his death, one fellow gamer reached out to his wife to share the story of how talking with John – and the compassion and empathy he gave him in times of pain – helped save his own life.\n\nThe National Suicide Prevention Lifeline also recently transitioned to a three-digit hotline, the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, to make it easier for people to get help.\n\n“The impulse to act is a very short, intense one. And so the goal is really to get people through those difficult moments,” Marshall said. “The shorter number is more accessible for people to remember in that time of crisis.”\n\nAnd calls into the hotline jumped 45% after its launch over the summer, compared to the same time a year earlier, according to data from the US Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nBut critical challenges remain.\n\nManaging risk factors\n\nIn 2021, the CDC report shows, the suicide rate among men in the US was four times higher than it was for women – a disparity that continues to grow. There were about 23 suicide deaths for every 100,000 men in 2021, compared with about 6 for every 100,000 women.\n\nSome point to guns as the driving risk factor.\n\nThe new CDC report does not include data on suicide methods or attempts for 2021. But data from 2020 shows that for every person who died of suicide, there were eight suicide-related hospital visits and 27 suicide attempts. And firearms were used in more than half of suicide deaths.\n\nYoung women are most likely to present at an emergency room after a suicide attempt, but older men are most likely to die as a result of a suicide attempt – and that’s directly correlated to gun ownership, said Ari Freilich, state policy director for Giffords Law Center, a gun-control advocacy group.\n\n“The population most at risk and most likely to attempt suicide in the United States is not the population most likely to die by suicide,” he said. “Firearms explain so much of that difference.”\n\nOwning a gun does not make a person more likely to feel suicidal, but having access to one during a crisis can be a “really bad combination,” Brummett said. “We’re really talking about collaborative approaches that create time and distance between me, in the presence of a suicidal crisis, and my firearm.”\n\nAnd with a record year of gun sales in 2020, the risk increases with more guns in more homes.\n\n“Guns are so uniquely lethal compared to the most common other methods in the United States,” Freilich said. The vast majority – 9 out of 10 people – who attempt suicide using a gun die as a result, but about the exact opposite is true for those who attempt with other methods.\n\n“Even if you were 0% effective at preventing people from attempting suicide, replacing the means – the access to firearms – would save the majority of people.”\n\nBut mental health struggles, including suicidal ideation, can affect anyone, experts say.\n\nSuicide is a major contributor to premature death in the US overall, and it’s the second leading cause of death among people ages 10 to 34, according to the CDC.\n\nBetween 2020 and 2021, suicide deaths among girls ages 10 to 14 increased more than any other group, followed by teenage boys and young men ages 15 to 24, according to the new CDC report. And in 2021, the American Academy of Pediatrics declared a state of emergency concerning children’s and adolescents’ mental health.\n\n“Now that we’ve made it easy to talk about mental health, we have to ensure that our infrastructure is able to withstand the additional referrals,” Baker said. “We need to now adjust to being able to absorb all the people who are wanting to actually address their mental health.\n\n“In some ways, we’ve created a new problem,” he said.\n\nNot a burden but a gift\n\nOnce John stopped therapy, Sabina said, it was tough for him to get back into it once services were available again and he often lamented the burden he felt that he put on his family.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nBut for Sabina, he was anything but.\n\n“He really thought I would be better off without him, but that’s just not the case,” she said.\n\n“Whatever struggles we would have gone through, I would have rather gone through those together than have to struggle without him.”\n\nShe is proud of the qualities he instilled in their kids: curiosity, ambition, humor and compassion. Their oldest daughter talks with her hands like he did and has a laugh that sounds just like his, and it makes her smile.\n\nAnd when his memory or the topic of suicide comes up, Sabina is sure to never shy away from it.\n\n“It was really important for me that [the kids] knew the circumstances and the why,” she said. “I didn’t want to hide the fact that he committed suicide. I just explained that Daddy had been sick for a very long time, and his mind had also been sick for a very long time.”\n\nThat way, she said, they can remember him together with a focus on all of the good times, without letting him be defined by his death.", "authors": ["Deidre Mcphillips"], "publish_date": "2022/09/30"}]}

She then guided Democrats as they rode the waves of popular opinion, seeing their power swell to a 257-seat majority after the 2008 elections, ultimately crash to a 188-seat minority, and then rise once again.\n\nHer political career was marked by an extraordinary ability to understand and overcome those political shifts, keeping conflicting factions of her party united in passing major legislation. She earned the Speaker’s gavel twice – after the 2006 and 2018 elections – and lost it after the 2010 elections.\n\nOf late, she has conducted a string of accomplishments with one of the slimmest party splits in history, passing a $1.9 trillion pandemic aid package last year and a $750 billion health care, energy and climate bill in August.\n\nHer legislative victories in the Biden era cemented her reputation as one of the most successful party leaders in Congress. During the Obama administration, Pelosi was instrumental to the passage of the massive economic stimulus bill and the 2010 Affordable Care Act, which provides over 35 million Americans health care coverage.\n\nOver the past 20 years, the California liberal has been relentlessly attacked by Republicans, who portray her as the personification of a party for the coastal elite. “We have fired Nancy Pelosi,” said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy on Fox News on Wednesday, after Republicans won back the chamber.\n\nIn recent years, the anger directed toward her has turned menacing. During the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, pro-Trump rioters searched for her — and last month, a male assailant attacked Paul Pelosi, the speaker’s husband, with a hammer at the couple’s home in San Francisco, while she was in Washington.\n\nPelosi told CNN’s Anderson Cooper this month that her decision to retire would be influenced by the politically motivated attack. Paul Pelosi was released from the hospital two weeks ago after surgery to repair a skull fracture and injuries to his arm and hands.\n\nAfter thanking her colleagues for their well-wishes for Paul, the House chamber broke out into a standing ovation.\n\nDemocrats now look to finally choose Pelosi’s successor\n\nPelosi’s long reign became a source of tension within her own party. She won the gavel after the 2018 elections by promising her own party that she would leave her leadership post by 2022.\n\nMassachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton, who previously tried to oust Pelosi, told CNN it’s time for a new chapter.\n\n“She’s a historic speaker who’s accomplished an incredible amount, but I also think there are a lot of Democrats ready for a new chapter,” said Moulton.\n\nBut some Democrats praised Pelosi and said they wished she would remain leader. Asked about her decision, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer clutched his chest and said he had pleaded with her to stay.\n\n“I told her when she called me and told me this and all that, I said ‘please change your mind. We need you here,’” Schumer said.\n\nHouse Democrats appear likely to choose New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, 52, to succeed Pelosi as leader, though Democrats won’t vote until November 30.\n\nAfter her speech, Pelosi wouldn’t tell reporters who’d she support. But House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn announced they would also step down from their leadership posts, and endorsed Jeffries to succeed Pelosi. Hoyer said Jeffries “will make history for the institution of the House and for our country.” Clyburn added that he hoped Massachusetts Rep. Katherine Clark and California Rep. Pete Aguilar would join Jeffries in House Democratic leadership.\n\nBefore Pelosi’s announcement, Ohio Rep. Joyce Beatty, chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, told CNN that she expects her caucus to throw their support behind Jeffries, and help him become the first Black House Democratic leader.\n\n“If she steps aside, I’m very clear that Hakeem Jeffries is the person that I will be voting for and leading the Congressional Black Caucus to vote for,” said Beatty.”I don’t always speak for everybody, but I’m very comfortable saying I believe that every member of the Congressional Black Caucus would vote for Hakeem Jeffries.”\n\nRetiring North Carolina Rep. G.K. Butterfield, a former CBC chairman, told CNN that Jeffries “is prepared for the moment” if Pelosi steps aside. Butterfield said he thought Jeffries would run.\n\nThe longtime Democratic leader told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” on Sunday that members of her caucus had asked her to “consider” running in the party’s leadership elections at the end of the month, adding: “But, again, let’s just get through the election.”\n\nAny decision to run again, Pelosi said, “is about family, and also my colleagues and what we want to do is go forward in a very unified way, as we go forward to prepare for the Congress at hand.”\n\n“Nonetheless, a great deal is at stake because we’ll be in a presidential election. So my decision will again be rooted in the wishes of my family and the wishes of my caucus,” she continued. “But none of it will be very much considered until we see what the outcome of all of this is. And there are all kinds of ways to exert influence.”\n\nPelosi is a towering figure in American politics with a history-making legacy of shattering glass ceilings as the first and so far only woman to be speaker of the US House of Representatives.\n\nPelosi was first elected to the House in 1987, when she won a special election to fill a seat representing California’s 5th Congressional District.\n\nWhen she was first elected speaker, Pelosi reflected on the significance of the event and what it meant for women in the United States.\n\n“This is an historic moment,” she said in a speech after accepting the speaker’s gavel. “It’s an historic moment for the Congress.

Although titles change depending which party is in power, the hierarchy of House Democratic leadership has been the same for nearly two decades. Pelosi, 82, has been backed up by Reps. Steny Hoyer, 83, of Maryland, and James Clyburn, 82, of South Carolina.\n\nBesides those two, one potential successor includes Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, 52, of New York, who ranks fifth in leadership as chairman of the Democratic Caucus. Rep. Adam Schiff, 62, of California, who led the first impeachment of former President Donald Trump as head of the Intelligence Committee, is another possibility, though Politico reported Wednesday that he would not seek the post.\n\nPelosi spent decades as a Republican target, blasted as a “San Francisco liberal.” When rioters supporting Trump rampaged through the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, they called out \"Where's Nancy?\"\n\nThe man charged with attacking her husband Oct. 28 asked the same question.\n\n- Associated Press\n\nPelosi broke ground for women\n\nPelosi was a trailblazer for women in politics. She became first woman to ascend to House leadership as Democratic whip in 2001, the first to lead a party in Congress two years later and the first to become speaker four years later. While Pelosi was in the House, recruiting and fundraising for candidates, the number of women serving in the chamber grew from 23 in 1987 to 127 this year, including non-voting delegates.\n\nHillary Clinton told USA TODAY Washington Bureau Chief Susan Page, who wrote the book \"Madam Speaker,\" that Pelosi was “one of the very best inside political players that I’ve ever seen.\"\n\nPelosi is stepping down weeks after her husband’s skull was fractured by a hammer-wielding assailant in their home last month. Paul Pelosi left the hospital after a week, but she said \"a long recovery process and convalescence\" is expected.\n\nPelosi, a prolific fundraiser, rose through the ranks\n\nPelosi learned politics from her father, Thomas D’Alesandro Jr., a former House member and three-term mayor of Baltimore. She won her House seat in a special election in June 1987.\n\nPelosi rose through the leadership ranks with prolific fundraising. She raised $1.25 billion for Democrats during the last 20 years, according to a party tally reported by the New York Times.\n\nShe became minority whip in 2001, beating Hoyer in a caucus election, and became the minority leader two years later.\n\nPelosi became the first woman speaker in 2007, when Democrats won control of the chamber for four years.

And if they decide to attempt to succeed her in the top spot, or try to keep a position in leadership, it could lead to a messy internal battle in the aftermath of surprising Democratic wins in Tuesday’s midterms. One member told CNN that Hoyer is exploring a range of options.\n\nLike Pelosi, Hoyer and Clyburn are in their 80s, and are facing calls for generational change even as they command loyalty and respect from various wings of their caucus. If Pelosi were to step aside, the widespread belief internally is that Hakeem Jeffries, the 52-year-old Brooklyn Democrat and current caucus chairman, would be the front-runner. And he and two other Democrats from his generation and who have been at the leadership table – 59-year-old Katherine Clark of Massachusetts and 43-year-old Pete Aguilar of California – are seen as a team that would round out the top three leadership positions.\n\nBut those plans could be upset rather quickly since others have signaled interest in leadership spots. Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, has been quietly meeting with members for months as he sounds out a possible run for Democratic leader, while the head of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, Pramila Jayapal, is also seen as a potential candidate for a spot within the leadership team.\n\nAll of this rests, though, on what Pelosi decides to do. The expectation, sources say, is for Pelosi to announce her future once the House is called, and until then even her closest allies and aides do not know what she is going to do, even though she committed to Democrats years ago to step aside after 2022.\n\n“Everyone I think is frozen by the situation,” a senior Democratic aide said.\n\nOne member said that the speaker is being so careful not to tip her hand that even Hoyer and Clyburn do not know what her plans are.\n\nWith tight margins, possibly a razor-thin GOP majority, sources say, it creates a dynamic that calls for a different set of leadership skills.\n\nWith Pelosi comes unparalleled institutional knowledge of operating under narrow margins and a staff that has years of experience leading the caucus – something the younger generation lacks. Pelosi has been hearing from some members who are asking her to stay on in the new Congress, even if Democrats are in the minority, two sources tell CNN, citing her ability to maintain discipline, something critical in a narrowly divided chamber.\n\n“The speaker will make an announcement when she makes an announcement,” Drew Hammil, Pelosi’s spokesperson, told CNN in a statement. “Until then, let’s all enjoy watching Kevin McCarthy lose a speakership his party hasn’t even won in the first place.”\n\nPelosi told CNN’s Anderson Cooper this week that the violent attack on her husband, Paul Pelosi, has impacted her decision about her future – but she did not tip her hand about what direction she will go and even members closest to her do not know.\n\nThe decision, she said, “will be affected about what happened the last week or two.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Pelosi describes her experience following husband's attack that was intended for her 02:42 - Source: CNN\n\nPelosi’s deputies mum about their plans\n\nHoyer and Clyburn have privately and publicly signaled they wouldn’t necessarily step aside if Pelosi announces her move.\n\n“They’ve made very clear that they are not going to abide by her timeline,” one member told CNN.\n\nHoyer told reporters earlier this week that he is waiting to make his decision until it is determined which party will remain in the majority.\n\n“The impact of what ultimately happens will impact my decision,” Hoyer said.\n\nClyburn, according to two sources, would step down with an emeritus position should Jeffries become the leader. Clyburn’s office did not respond to CNN’s request for comment for the story.\n\nBut Clyburn told Politico that he would not stand in the way of Jeffries ascension.\n\n“There’s nothing I would ever do to impede the progress of our up-and-coming young Democrats and I see him as an up-and-coming young Democrat,” Clyburn said. “He knows that, I didn’t have to tell him that — but I did.”\n\nWhether the South Carolina Democrat would seek to stay in the leadership, though, is uncertain.\n\n“It’s hard to fill in below the top spot until you know who the top spot is,” a senior aide said. “But that doesn’t mean conversations aren’t happening.”\n\nAs candidates for the top three are waiting to see what Pelosi does before publicly making moves, Democrats running to round out the bottom half of their party’s leadership have publicly announced and have begun full throttle campaigns.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Joe Neguse of Colorado, who currently serves as the co-chair of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, announced his run for Caucus Chair to replace Jeffries who is term limited.\n\nThe race to lead the party’s campaign arm, DCCC chair, is already heating up after the current chair Rep.

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nCNN —\n\nHaving lost control of the House for the second time under her leadership, Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced in a moving speech in the House chamber that she would retreat to the back benches of Congress.\n\nHer decision not to seek a Democratic leadership position next term sets off a wholesale changing of the guard – Democrats’ first in decades.\n\nOut with the octogenarians born before the baby boom. Pelosi, 82, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, 83, and House Majority Whip James Clyburn, 82, the top three congressional Democrats through four presidents, will all remain in Congress, but not seek those leadership spots.\n\nPelosi’s departure certainly marks the end of an era when she made history as the first and only woman to serve as speaker. She shattered that glass ceiling.\n\n“When I came to the Congress in 1987, there were 12 Democratic women. Now there are over 90. And we want more,” she said in the speech, which was laced with a reverence for the institution she leads, and where her father first brought her when he was a congressman and she was a small child.\n\n“When I first came to the floor at 6 years old, never would I have thought that someday I would go from homemaker to House speaker,” she said.\n\nIn with the Gen Xers born in the ’60s and ‘70s. Pelosi’s likely successor is Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the 52-year-old Brooklyn and Queens congressman known to quote rap lyrics in floor speeches, such as when he invoked Notorious B.I.G. during then-President Donald Trump’s first impeachment trial.\n\nIf he obtains the position of Democratic leader, Jeffries would be the first Black man to lead a party on Capitol Hill. Democrats won’t vote until November 30.\n\nJeffries is, for now, running unopposed for the leadership position. Rep. Pete Aguilar, the 43-year-old who represents the Inland Empire of California, and Rep. Katherine Clark, the 59-year-old who represents a district outside Boston in eastern Massachusetts, were name-checked by Clyburn as possibilities for joining Jeffries in House Democratic leadership.\n\nPelosi, a dominant force among Democrats for two decades as their congressional leader, could probably have held on after a better-than-expected performance in the midterm election, with the GOP only clinching a slim majority in the House.\n\nBut she stayed true to a promise she made to quiet a brewing rebellion among House Democrats four years ago that she would step down as their leader after 2022.\n\nBack then, Democrats had just reclaimed the majority from Republicans. Now they’re handing it back.\n\nHer speech Thursday announcing she would not stand for election to the Democratic leadership served as a valedictory to her leadership career. She pointed to her work pushing clean energy with Republican President George W. Bush, the Affordable Care Act with Democratic President Barack Obama and infrastructure spending and health care and climate change legislation with Democratic President Joe Biden.\n\nAlthough she has been parodied by Republicans as a San Francisco liberal, Pelosi fended off frustration from liberals and moderates in her party to stay on top and in charge for 20 years – an incredible run.\n\nA bogeywoman for the right. She did not mention it in what amounted to a farewell address, but Pelosi has also been a motivating character in Republican attack ads for decades. She will stay in Congress, for now, but is unlikely to be the political villain for Republicans.\n\nThe attack ad that sticks with me from this most recent campaign cycle featured an image of the moderate Democrat, Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, made to look like Pelosi’s twin. Spanberger won the race, but Democrats will lose control of the House.\n\nPhysical attacks. The verbal attacks on Pelosi took an even more serious turn just before the election, when her husband Paul was attacked by a man with a hammer in their San Francisco home. She said her husband’s recovery is continuing. The alleged attacker pleaded not guilty to federal charges earlier this week.\n\nPleas to remain. Biden reportedly wanted Pelosi to stay on as leader, and so did Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. CNN’s Manu Raju reported Thursday that Pelosi went home Wednesday night with two versions of the speech, one in which she remained in leadership, and the one she delivered.\n\nLooking forward. “Now we must move boldly into the future,” Pelosi told colleagues, adding that Democrats should be “grounded by the principles that have propelled us this far and open to fresh possibilities.”\n\nThat’s a solid message for a party that looks to appeal to young and diverse voters. It’s something Biden, who comes from the same era as Pelosi and is already the oldest president, will have to grapple with as he decides whether to seek reelection in 2024.\n\nHe has said it is his intention to run, and Democrats’ strong showing on Election Day should invigorate him, especially since he defeated a diverse field of younger Democrats to win his party’s nomination in 2020.\n\nIt’s something Republicans will also consider as Trump begins his third campaign for the White House. Trump is nearly as old as Biden, and many Republicans want their party to move forward too.\n\nThings are about to change. The next two years will be tougher for Biden. Republicans are set to use their House majority to turn a microscope on his family and his administration.\n\nA team of CNN reporters on Thursday published a fascinating look at how the White House has spent months preparing for the onslaught.\n\nA team of lawyers has been holed up in an office building near the White House, and they plan to expand their defensive efforts now that Republicans have clinched a majority.\n\nFrom the report: “You’re gonna have a bunch of chairmen who are totally on their own, doing whatever the hell they want without regard for what the national political implications are,” said Brendan Buck, a former top adviser to House Speaker Paul Ryan, who said he believes GOP leader Kevin McCarthy will have “very little leash” to rein in those investigative pursuits.

Hakeem Jeffries to succeed Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a potentially historic move to elect the first Black person to lead a party in Congress.\n\nJeffries launched his bid for House Democratic leader on Friday, promising his colleagues in a letter that he would empower and protect them — and expand their ranks.\n\n“Our top non-governmental priority, for the sake of the American people, must be retaking the majority in November 2024,” Jeffries wrote.\n\nIn a sign of Jeffries’ emerging power, Pelosi, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn quickly backed him after announcing they would step down from their leadership posts.\n\nPelosi blessed the new trio of leaders expected to succeed them — Jeffries, Massachusetts Rep. Katherine Clark and California Rep. Peter Aguilar — in a statement on Friday. The House Democrats’ leadership election is on November 30.\n\n“A new day is dawning — and I am confident that these new leaders will capably lead our Caucus and the Congress,” Pelosi said.\n\n“Speaker Pelosi has left an indelible mark on Congress and the country, and I look forward to her continued service and doing whatever I can to assist our new generation of Democratic leaders,” said Clyburn in a statement. And Hoyer said Jeffries “will make history for the institution of the House and for our country.”\n\nAt 52, Jeffries would represent a generational change from the current triumvirate of House Democratic leaders, who are three decades older than him. He became the chairman of the Democratic caucus in 2019, making him the youngest member serving in leadership.\n\nIn his letter Friday, Jeffries praised the past leadership but said “more must be done to combat inflation, defend our democracy, secure reproductive freedom, welcome new Americans, promote equal protection under the law and improve public safety throughout this country.”\n\nHe promised his rank-and-file colleagues that he would give them more power in the legislative process, writing “we must chart a return to regular order.” He also said that in “dangerous times,” Congress must focus on passing bills to “combat crime” for Americans and “significantly enhance the security of all Members and their families.”\n\nJeffries seems to enjoy widespread support among the House Democratic caucus.\n\nBefore Pelosi’s announcement, Ohio Rep. Joyce Beatty, the Congressional Black Caucus chairwoman, told CNN that she expected the caucus to throw their support behind Jeffries.\n\n“If she steps aside, I’m very clear that Hakeem Jeffries is the person that I will be voting for and leading the Congressional Black Caucus to vote for,” Beatty said. “I don’t always speak for everybody, but I’m very comfortable saying I believe that every member of the Congressional Black Caucus would vote for Hakeem Jeffries.”\n\nAnd Wisconsin Rep. Mark Pocan, a former Congressional Progressive Caucus chair, also threw his weight behind Jeffries. “Hakeem Jeffries came in my class and I’m a huge fan of Hakeem,” Pocan told CNN. “I think he’s extremely intelligent, he’s a good person to bring consensus among the caucus. I think he’ll be an outstanding Leader.”\n\nFor months, Democratic lawmakers have whispered that Pelosi’s potential exit from Congress could pave the way for Jeffries. The Brooklyn-bred attorney graduated from State University of New York at Binghamton, Georgetown and New York University Law School, before his election to the New York State Assembly in 2006. He has since served New York’s 8th District since winning his first election to Congress a decade ago. In the Trump era, Jeffries played a crucial role passing the bipartisan criminal justice overhaul bill known as the First Step Act and in arguing for the former president’s impeachment as a House manager in the first trial. He has continued to shape the party’s messaging during the Biden administration.\n\nSome House Democrats have waited a long time to turn the page on the Pelosi era. She earned the speaker’s gavel after the 2006 elections, lost it after the 2010 elections, and won it again after the 2018 elections.\n\n“She’s a historic speaker who’s accomplished an incredible amount, but I also think there are a lot of Democrats ready for a new chapter,” Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton, who previously tried to oust Pelosi, told CNN.\n\nBut whoever follows Pelosi will serve in the shadow of her legacy as one of the most powerful and polarizing figures in American politics. The Speaker was instrumental in passing the Affordable Care Act, the 2008 economic stimulus bill, a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill, $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package and, most recently, a sweeping $750 billion health care and tax bill that included the largest investment in American history to address climate change.\n\nPelosi, who will continue to serve in Congress representing San Francisco, will leave her successor with a greater than expected House minority following the 2022 midterm elections. Some Democrats said they wished she would remain leader.\n\nAsked about Pelosi’s decision, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer clutched his chest and said he had pleaded with her to stay.\n\n“I told her when she called me and told me this and all that, I said, ‘Please change your mind. We need you here,’” Schumer said.\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Alex Rogers Daniella Diaz Manu Raju", "Alex Rogers", "Daniella Diaz", "Manu Raju"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/14/politics/house-leadership-elections/index.html", "title": "What to know about upcoming House leadership elections | CNN ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA new Congress won’t be sworn in until January and control of the House has not yet been determined, but Republicans appear on track to recapture the chamber and the race to determine who will serve as the next speaker is underway.\n\nHouse GOP leader Kevin McCarthy has officially declared his bid for the speakership, but is already facing headwinds from members of the hardline, pro-Trump House Freedom Caucus who are threatening to withhold their support as they hope to extract concessions.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Nancy Pelosi, the current House speaker, has not yet made clear what her next move will be. Speculation has intensified in Washington over her political future and whether she will run again for the top leadership spot for House Democrats or if she will instead decide to step aside as a new generation of potential leaders waits in the wings.\n\nTiming for internal GOP leadership elections – and the speaker vote\n\nThe vote to elect the next speaker will take place in January at the start of the new Congress, but House Republicans will hold their internal leadership elections to pick a Speaker nominee this week.\n\nRepublicans are scheduled to hold a candidate forum on Monday evening, followed by leadership elections on Tuesday, November 15, according to a copy of the schedule shared with CNN.\n\nThe elections are conducted behind closed doors and are done via secret ballot. In the GOP’s internal leadership elections, McCarthy only needs a simple majority to win his party’s nomination for speaker. That is expected to happen, but McCarthy could still fall short of 218 votes – the magic number needed to win the speaker’s gavel in January.\n\nDuring that speaker vote, McCarthy will have a higher hurdle to clear. The full House holds a vote on the floor for Speaker and to win, a candidate needs to win a majority of all members, which amounts to 218 votes if no member skips the vote or votes “present.”\n\nWhen will Democrats hold their election?\n\nHouse Democrats will hold their internal leadership elections later – the week after Thanksgiving.\n\nHouse Democratic leadership elections have been announced for Wednesday, November 30. Voting will take place behind closed doors via secret ballot using an app.\n\nTo be elected to any position in Democratic leadership, a candidate needs to win a majority among those present and voting. If more than two candidates run and no one wins a majority, the candidate with the fewest votes after the first round of voting will be eliminated and voting will proceed to a second round. That process continues until one candidate wins a majority.\n\nWhoever is elected for the top leadership spot in the House Democratic caucus would serve as their party’s Speaker nominee. But if Republicans have a majority, that nominee would be expected to fall short in the vote by the full House in the Speaker’s election in January and would be poised to become House Minority Leader instead.\n\nThe first election on November 30 will be for the next House Democratic Caucus Chair and whoever is elected to that role will administer the rest of the leadership elections.\n\nWho to watch in GOP leadership elections\n\nMcCarthy has been working the phones locking down support from across the conference and has received former President Donald Trump’s endorsement. But even if he becomes his party’s speaker nominee, as is expected, he could still face a rocky road to securing the gavel.\n\nMembers of the pro-Trump House Freedom Caucus are threatening to withhold support for McCarthy’s speakership bid and have begun to lay out their list of demands, putting the California Republican’s path to securing 218 votes in peril if the party ultimately takes the House with a slim majority. Members of the caucus are emboldened by the likelihood of a narrow House GOP majority – which would make the margins for McCarthy’s vote math tight.\n\nMcCarthy and his team are confident he will ultimately get the votes to be speaker. And two would-be challengers, Reps. Jim Jordan and Steve Scalise, the current House GOP whip, have lined up behind his speakership bid.\n\nBut if enough members of the Freedom Caucus withhold their support, it could imperil his speaker bid or force him to make deals to weaken the speakership, something he has long resisted.\n\nCNN reported Sunday that Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona, a former chairman of the pro-Trump House Freedom Caucus, is considering mounting a long-shot challenge to McCarthy, according to GOP sources familiar with the matter. McCarthy’s team has been prepared for this possibility.\n\nIf a challenger does emerge, it would be more of a protest candidate than a serious one. But the House Freedom Caucus is hoping to show McCarthy during the internal GOP leadership elections that he doesn’t have the floor votes for speaker, in hopes of forcing him to the negotiating table.\n\nRepublican races besides leader of the party\n\nAside from the speaker’s race, Republicans’ underwhelming performance in the midterms has scrambled other leadership races.\n\nThe race for House GOP whip – a position that will only open up if Republicans win the majority – was already competitive, though Rep. Tom Emmer, who chairs the House GOP’s campaign arm, was seen as having the edge since he was likely to be rewarded if they had a strong night.\n\nNow, Republicans say it could be tougher for Emmer to pull out a win.\n\nEmmer told reporters Tuesday he still plans to run and that he doesn’t know if a smaller majority impacts his bid. But his pitch to members is similar to McCarthy’s, saying: “we delivered.”\n\nMeanwhile, Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana, a Trump ally and the head of the conservative Republican Study Committee, also officially declared his candidacy for the whip’s position. And Rep. Drew Ferguson of Georgia, the current deputy whip, is also vying for the post, arguing that his experience on the whip’s team will be even more valuable in a slimmer majority, where the chief vote counting job will be crucial for governing.\n\nWho to watch: Nancy Pelosi\n\nWhat happens in Democratic leadership elections revolves around the key question of what Pelosi decides to do.\n\nPelosi was asked by CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” on Sunday whether she would make a decision on running for leadership before the party’s leadership elections.\n\n“Of course. Well, you know that I’m not asking anybody – people are campaigning, and that’s a beautiful thing,” the California Democrat told Bash. “And I’m not asking anyone for anything. My members are asking me to consider doing that. But, again, let’s just get through the election.”\n\nIf Pelosi decides to run again for the top leadership spot for House Democrats, it will make clear that she is not yet ready to relinquish her role atop the House Democratic caucus. Pelosi, a towering figure in Democratic politics, commands widespread support among her members and is viewed as an effective leader within her party.\n\nBut if she runs again for leadership, such a move would also likely surprise, and even frustrate, many in Washington, including members of her own party, who have been anticipating that she might step aside for a new generation of leadership to take the reins.\n\nIf Pelosi does not run for the top leadership post, it would set the stage for a major shakeup in House Democratic leadership and mark the end of an era for Washington. The move would kick off a fight for her successor that could expose divisions within the party as other prominent members of the party look to move up the leadership ladder.\n\nPelosi’s future freezes much of the Democratic races\n\nUntil Pelosi makes her announcement, much of the rest of the field is expected to remain essentially frozen in place.\n\nCurrently, Maryland Rep. Steny Hoyer serves as the No. 2 House Democrat, in the role of House majority leader, and South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn serves in the role of House majority whip. Massachusetts Rep. Katherine Clark serves in the role of assistant Speaker and New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries serves as House Democratic caucus chair.\n\nAs potential candidates for the higher rungs of House Democratic leadership wait to see what Pelosi does before publicly making moves, some Democrats vying for other positions in their party’s leadership have already announced their candidacy.\n\nDemocratic Rep.

She will continue to serve as a member of the House.\n\n“For me, the hour has come for a new generation to lead the Democratic caucus that I so deeply respect,” she said in a speech from the House floor. “And I am grateful that so many are ready and willing to shoulder this awesome responsibility.”\n\nHomemaker-turned-powerhouse politician\n\nRepublicans claimed majority control of the U.S. House of Representatives this week, setting the stage for Pelosi to unveil her plans for a new term. It was becoming increasing clear that Pelosi was considering a supporting role among Democrats. The recent attack on her husband may have sealed the deal.\n\nWhile this homemaker-turned-powerhouse politician is passing the torch, I have little doubt she will continue to use her old-school, strategic approach to legislating and leadership.\n\nHer gavel may become smaller, but it will bang just as loud.\n\nPelosi, 82, became the first woman to ascend to House leadership as Democratic whip in 2001 and the first to steer a party in Congress in 2003, when she became minority leader.

I felt her quiet strength emanate with every word. I know she has her fair share of detractors – as most politicians do – but there is no denying her rightful place as a giant and consummate public servant in America's political system.\n\nShe drove a people-first legislative agenda while masterfully corralling a caucus that found itself sometimes in dissent.

You don’t become the first female speaker of the House – and then become speaker again – all while leading your party in the chamber for two decades without hugely formidable skills.\n\nBut there’s one trait at which – even among the best of politicians – Pelosi is absolutely elite: Counting votes.\n\nPelosi announced Thursday that she will not run for a leadership post, but will continue to serve in the House, where Republicans captured the majority in the midterm elections. During her run atop of the House Democratic caucus, no one – and I mean no one – knew not just how to measure support (and opposition), but how to convince and cajole members to support her priorities like she did.\n\nThat skill dates all the way back to Pelosi’s first major victory in her climb up the Democratic leadership ladder.\n\nIn the early 2000s, it was clear that Rep. Dick Gephardt, who was the House Democratic leader, was eying the exits, preparing for an ultimately unsuccessful presidential bid in 2004. The race to be minority whip then was regarded as a proxy for who would lead the caucus when Gephardt moved on.\n\nThe race was fought behind the scenes for years, literally. But, when it came time to vote, Pelosi won 118-95 in 2001 – a victory that made her the highest-ranking woman ever in congressional leadership at the time. She was then on course to become House minority leader in 2003 and speaker in 2007 (and again in 2019).\n\nTime and again – over both her time as House minority leader and as speaker – Pelosi demonstrated an uncanny knack for knowing what her members needed and when they needed it in order to get them to vote the way she wanted.\n\nTwo examples stand out.\n\nThe first came in November 2009, when Pelosi was tasked with passing then-President Barack Obama’s signature health care overhaul. The bill was massive and, like all massive bills, required an incredibly delicate coalition that could fall apart at any point. And she believed that Republicans would not offer any support, meaning that Pelosi had to get 218 votes within her own caucus or tell Obama that his legislation just wouldn’t make it.\n\nAs Time’s Molly Ball, who has written a book on Pelosi, wrote in 2020:\n\n“Pelosi thought wooing Republicans was a fool’s errand. From the beginning, she predicted the legislation would get zero GOP votes. ‘Does the president not understand the way this game works? she asked Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff. ‘He wants to get it done and be beloved, and you can’t have both—which does he want?’”\n\nPelosi knew how the game worked better than anyone else in the House. The Affordable Care Act passed the House in March 2010 by a 219-212 vote, with zero Republicans voting for it and 34 Democrats voting against it on final passage.\n\nThe second example of Pelosi’s vote-counting wizardry came in November 2021, when she shepherded President Joe Biden’s infrastructure bill to passage.\n\nAs I wrote at the time:\n\n“Consider the challenge Pelosi faced with this infrastructure bill – starting with the fact that she had only a three-seat majority, meaning that even a handful of renegade Democrats could scuttle the entire thing. Then add in the total lack of trust not only between House liberals and Senate moderates but also the decided lack of trust between House liberals and House moderates. And sprinkle it the fact that the entire bill had been at an impasse for months as both sides of the party wrangled for leverage on the broader $1.75 trillion social safety net legislation.”\n\nThe bill, which allocated $1.2 trillion for infrastructure spending around the country, passed by a 228-206 margin. Thirteen Republicans voted for it while six Democrats voted against it.\n\n“Is Nancy Pelosi the most effective Speaker of all-time? (whether you like her agenda or not),” asked Bruce Mehlman, a Republican lobbyist, in a tweet with a screengrab of the final 228-206 winning vote for Pelosi.\n\nIn both instances, Pelosi took on what looked like an impossible task: Find a way to pass the sort of legislation that had failed, time and again, in years past. And yet, both times – and on plenty of other occasions too – Pelosi managed to get the job done.\n\nHer record as a legislator is titanic – no matter where you stand on the legislation she championed. And at the foundation of her success is an innate understanding of human nature – a deep knowledge of what drives people to vote and how they can be influenced.\n\nThat ability runs higher in Pelosi than in any other modern member of Congress.", "authors": ["Chris Cillizza"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/26/politics/joe-biden-nancy-pelosi-taiwan-china/index.html", "title": "Biden administration working behind the scenes to convince Pelosi ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nNational security officials are quietly working to convince House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of the risks her potential trip to Taiwan could pose during a highly sensitive moment between the self-governing island and China.\n\nSources familiar with the speaker’s plans say she is planning to visit in the coming weeks as part of a broader trip to Asia and has invited both Democrats and Republicans to accompany her. If she goes, she would be the first House speaker to visit in a quarter century.\n\nThe possible trip is highlighting the concerns within President Joe Biden’s administration over China’s designs on Taiwan as Beijing has stepped up its rhetoric and aggressive actions toward the island in recent months, including sending warplanes into Taiwan’s self-declared air defense identification zone several times. US officials have expressed concern that those moves could be precursors to even more aggressive steps by China in the coming months meant to assert its authority over the island.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has only intensified those worries, as Biden and other top officials nervously watch to see what lessons China may be taking from the Western response to Russia’s aggression.\n\nMeanwhile, China’s President Xi Jinping – with whom Biden expects to speak this week – is believed to be laying the groundwork for an unprecedented third term as president in the fall, contributing to the tense geopolitics in the region. Biden’s call with Xi was in the works before Pelosi’s potential visit to Taiwan became public, officials noted.\n\nAdministration officials have shared their concerns not only about Pelosi’s security during the trip, but also worries about how China may respond to such a high-profile visit. With China recently reporting its worst economic performance in two years, Xi finds himself in a politically sensitive place ahead of an important meeting regarding extending his reign and could use a political win, multiple officials told CNN.\n\nWhile Biden’s aides have ideas about how he could potentially respond, they aren’t sure which direction the Chinese leader will choose.\n\nIt is against that highly charged backdrop that Pelosi has proposed visiting Taiwan with a congressional delegation, a trip that she has so far declined to confirm publicly. But that has not stopped China from lashing out, saying a visit would violate US policy toward the island.\n\nChina’s Ministry of National Defense on Tuesday said Pelosi’s trip should be canceled, warning that China’s military would “resolutely defend national sovereignty” if faced with “external forces” encouraging Taiwanese independence.\n\n“China demands the US take concrete actions to fulfill its commitment not to support ‘Taiwan independence’ and not to arrange for Pelosi to visit Taiwan,” Ministry of Defense Spokesperson Tan Kefei said Tuesday in response to questions over Pelosi’s reported trip to Taipei.\n\n“If the US insists on taking its own course, the Chinese military will never sit idly by, and it will definitely take strong actions to thwart any external force’s interference and separatist’s schemes for ‘Taiwan independence,’ and resolutely defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Tan added.\n\nBecause Pelosi is in the presidential line of succession, the administration takes extra care for her security when she travels overseas, the White House said Tuesday.\n\nThat includes establishing a footprint on the ground based on the location and environment, sometimes using military resources, according to John Kirby, the communications coordinator at the National Security Council.\n\n“We take those obligations seriously,” Kirby said, even as he reiterated Pelosi has not announced any travel plans to visit Taiwan.\n\nAdministration lays out the risks for Pelosi\n\nBehind the scenes, Biden administration officials have been working to spell out the potential risks of a visit in meetings with Pelosi and her team.\n\nPentagon officials briefed the speaker last week about Taiwan and the heightened tensions in the region, according to people familiar with the matter. White House officials were also present for the briefing.\n\nThe President let slip last week that the US military was opposed to Pelosi visiting Taiwan now, but the White House has refused to expand on his comments. Even Pelosi said during a news conference last week that she wasn’t sure precisely what Biden meant.\n\n“I think what the President was saying is that maybe the military was afraid of my plane of getting shot down or something like that. I don’t know exactly,” she said.\n\nThe White House said Tuesday it was providing Pelosi information about her potential travel.\n\n“I’ll let the speaker talk about her travel plans. Our job is, of course, to make sure she has all the context and information before she travels anywhere. But that kind of rhetoric coming out of the Chinese side is clearly unhelpful and not necessary,” Kirby said on CNN’s “New Day.”\n\n“There’s no call for that kind of escalatory rhetoric,” Kirby added. “Again, none of this has to devolve into conflict. Nothing’s changed about our policies with respect to One China or supporting Taiwan’s ability to defend itself. So, there’s no reason for this to be escalated, even just in rhetoric.”\n\nPotential trip comes at tense moment in China\n\nAdministration officials are concerned Pelosi’s trip comes at a particularly tense moment, as Xi is expected to seek an unprecedented third term at the upcoming Chinese Communist Party congress. Chinese party officials are expected to begin laying the groundwork for that conference in the coming weeks, putting pressure on the leadership in Beijing to show strength.\n\nOfficials also believe the Chinese leadership don’t completely grasp the political dynamics in the United States, leading to a misunderstanding over the significance of Pelosi’s potential visit. The officials say China may be confusing Pelosi’s visit with an official administration visit, since she and Biden are both Democrats. Administration officials are concerned that China doesn’t separate Pelosi from Biden much, if at all.\n\nInstead, the politics surrounding the potential trip have become somewhat reversed. A number of Republicans have encouraged Pelosi to go ahead with her plans, arguing it would be a strong stand against China, including former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\n“Nancy, I’ll go with you. I’m banned in China, but not freedom-loving Taiwan. See you there!” Pompeo tweeted this week.\n\nPelosi has long cultivated a tough-on-China stance. She issued a strong statement in June on the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre reminding everyone she helped unfurl a banner there two years after the massacre reading, “To those who died for democracy in China.”\n\nBiden looks for stability\n\nBiden, who has sought to stabilize ties with China through regular conversations with his counterpart, is planning a phone conversation with Xi this week in which the issue of Taiwan could likely arise.\n\nHe last spoke to Xi in March, when he worked to convince the Chinese leader not to support Russia amid its invasion of Ukraine. Officials have been watching closely how Beijing responds to the invasion, hoping the mostly united Western response — including a withering set of economic sanctions and billions of dollars in arms shipments — proves illuminating as China considers its actions toward Taiwan.\n\nKirby indicated Tuesday that China is observing the global response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as it plots next steps in Taiwan, saying, “I’m sure they’re watching this in real time” but that there was “no reason for this to devolve into any kind of conflict.”\n\nUS officials believe there’s a small risk China would miscalculate in responding to a Pelosi visit. Biden administration officials are concerned that China could seek to declare a no-fly zone over Taiwan ahead of a possible visit as an effort to upend the trip, potentially raising tensions even further in the region, a US official told CNN.\n\nThat remains a remote possibility, officials said. More likely, they say, is the possibility China steps up flights further into Taiwan’s self-declared air defense zone, which could trigger renewed discussions about possible responses from Taiwan and the US, the US official added. They did not detail what those possible responses would entail.\n\nWhile the administration has not, and does not, plan to officially tell the speaker not to travel to Taiwan, officials have been frank in the briefings about the risks associated with a trip. People familiar with the matter say their hope is to quietly convince Pelosi of the trip’s risks without explicitly telling her not to go.\n\nIn the end, the speaker will make her own decision, Biden officials noted.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak Kaitlan Collins", "Kevin Liptak", "Kaitlan Collins"], "publish_date": "2022/07/26"}]}

Those contests will tee up Election Day on November 8, when control of the House and Senate will be up for grabs as well as several high-profile gubernatorial races in key battleground states.\n\nThe outcome of November’s elections will serve as a referendum on President Joe Biden’s first two years in office and set the table for the 2024 presidential campaign. Biden and congressional Democrats have scored some legislative victories and are poised to confirm a history-making pick to the Supreme Court in Ketanji Brown Jackson. Yet economic anxiety punctuated by inflation concerns combined with exhaustion over the coronavirus pandemic has tilted the political environment in favor of Republicans, who also have electoral history on their side. There is also a unique dynamic to these midterms, with former President Donald Trump eyeing a potential return to the White House and looking to lay the groundwork by endorsing candidates in GOP primaries who have embraced his lies about the 2020 election results.\n\nThe majority in the Senate, currently split 50-50 with Vice President Kamala Harris serving as a tiebreaker, is expected to come down to a handful of competitive races. There are four Democratic incumbents running in battleground states Biden won in 2020: Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and New Hampshire. Republicans have incumbents seeking reelection in Wisconsin and Florida, and they’re defending three open seats in Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Ohio. In total, 34 Senate seats will be decided in November.\n\nIn the House, Republicans need a net gain of five seats to win control of the chamber. More than 40 members, mostly Democrats, have announced they are leaving Congress. Some of those decisions were driven by redistricting, the once-a-decade process of redrawing congressional and state legislative boundaries. In states with partisan control of the process, both parties have tried to draw new maps to their advantage: to pick up more seats, shore up incumbents or reduce the number of competitive districts.\n\nThere are currently 27 Republican governors and 23 Democratic governors – with 36 seats up for grabs this November – including several in battleground states that could play a significant role in deciding the outcome of the 2024 election. Beyond elections for governor, state races for secretary of state and attorney general will receive unprecedented attention, as the battle over how elections are handled intensifies in the aftermath of the 2020 campaign.\n\nHere are the key dates and contests to watch as the 2022 primary process plays out:\n\nMarch 1: Texas primaries\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott Lynda M. Gonzalez/Pool//Getty Images\n\nThe Lone Star State is home to a few intriguing GOP statewide primaries and a House Democratic primary that highlights the ideological divide within the party.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott is seeking reelection to a third term, which could set the stage for a potential 2024 bid. First, he must get through a GOP primary that includes challenges from former (Florida) Rep. Allen West and businessman and ex-state Sen. Don Huffines.\n\nThere is also a contested Republican primary in the race for state attorney general, with incumbent Ken Paxton being challenged by state Land Commissioner George P. Bush, US Rep. Louie Gohmert and former state Supreme Court Justice Eva Guzman. Paxton’s rivals have taken aim at his legal problems, but Trump has thrown his support behind the incumbent, who led a failed effort to challenge the 2020 election results in four battleground states at the US Supreme Court.\n\nIn south Texas, there is a rematch of a 2020 Democratic primary in the 28th Congressional District between centrist Rep. Henry Cuellar and immigration attorney Jessica Cisneros, who has received the endorsement of progressive leaders, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The FBI searched Cuellar’s home and campaign office in January, but the nine-term congressman released a video a week later vowing to seek reelection despite the “ongoing investigation.”\n\nThe Dallas-area 3rd Congressional District is the site of a battle over how the GOP should handle the 2020 election and the events of January 6, 2021. Rep. Van Taylor is a conservative Republican, but he voted to accept the 2020 presidential election results and supported an independent commission to investigate the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. (He opposed the select committee that was eventually created.) He’s now facing several primary challengers who question the results of the election, criticize Taylor’s vote on the commission and downplay the Capitol insurrection. The district also became much more Republican in redistricting, so while the seat shouldn’t be competitive in November, it could be easier for a more right-wing candidate to defeat Taylor in the primary.\n\nApril 5: Special election primary in California’s 22nd Congressional District\n\nFormer GOP Rep. Devin Nunes JIm Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFormer GOP Rep. Devin Nunes set off this special primary contest with his resignation from Congress in January to join Trump’s new social media venture. Assuming no candidate gets a majority of the vote in the all-party primary, the top two finishers will face off in June, when California holds its general election primaries, giving the eventual winner about six months to represent this Central Valley seat in Congress. The district will have new boundaries for the election held in November.\n\nMay 3: Indiana and Ohio primaries\n\nOhio Gov. Mike DeWine Paul Vernon/AP\n\nThe Buckeye State has a pair of Republican primary battles that could offer early clues about the GOP electorate heading into the heart of the nominating calendar.\n\nRepublican Gov. Mike DeWine is seeking a second term. His management of the coronavirus pandemic has become the target of fierce criticism from opponent Jim Renacci, a former GOP congressman who has accused DeWine of governing Ohio “like a blue-state liberal.” On the Democratic side, it’s a battle between two former mayors, with Dayton’s Nan Whaley and Cincinnati’s John Cranley squaring off for the nomination.\n\nIn the GOP Senate primary, the crowded contest has at times veered toward political theater as several top contenders – most notably former state Treasurer Josh Mandel and “Hillbilly Elegy” author J.D. Vance – have sought to burnish their conservative pro-Trump credentials with incendiary rhetoric and inflammatory displays of opposition to public health precautions. Former state GOP chair Jane Timken and businessman Mike Gibbons are also making plays for the Trump base, while state Sen. Matt Dolan is testing the theory that there is still room in the party for a candidate who doesn’t fully embrace the former President.\n\nAfter a history of teasing potential statewide bids only to pass, Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan decided to take the plunge (with a helpful shove from redistricting) and launched a bid for US Senate. He faces a primary challenge from consumer protection attorney Morgan Harper. While Ohio has been trending red in recent years, Ryan is hoping to follow a similar blue-collar blueprint that has helped Sen. Sherrod Brown win statewide three times, most recently against Renacci in 2018.\n\nMay 10: Nebraska and West Virginia primaries\n\nWest Virginia Rep. David McKinley Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc./Getty Images\n\nWest Virginia is poised to hold the country’s first incumbent vs. incumbent primary of the 2022 cycle, featuring GOP Reps. David McKinley and Alex Mooney. The Republicans were drawn into the new 2nd Congressional District after the state lost a House seat following the 2020 census. The matchup will be an early test of Trump’s sway in GOP primaries, with the former President backing Mooney over McKinley, who did not object to counting the Electoral College vote and supported the bipartisan infrastructure bill. Mooney objected to the Pennsylvania electoral count, but not Arizona, and voted against the infrastructure package.\n\nIn Nebraska, outgoing Gov. Pete Ricketts urged Trump to stay out of the GOP primary to replace him, but the former President spurned the request and threw his support behind businessman Charles Herbster last October. Ricketts later endorsed Nebraska University Regent Jim Pillen, setting up a proxy battle between the two GOP leaders who both carried the Cornhusker State by wide margins.\n\nMeanwhile, in Nebraska’s 1st Congressional District, embattled GOP Rep. Jeff Fortenberry is facing a primary challenge from state Sen. Mike Flood, who has been endorsed by Ricketts and former Gov. Dave Heineman. Fortenberry was indicted last fall for allegedly concealing information and lying to federal authorities investigating illegal campaign contributions. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\nMay 17: Idaho, Kentucky, North Carolina, Oregon and Pennsylvania primaries\n\nCelebrity doctor Mehmet Oz Brad Barket/Getty Images\n\nThe fight for the GOP Senate nomination in Pennsylvania could be one of the nastiest and most expensive primary contests of the entire 2022 cycle, with hedge fund executive David McCormick and celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz trading pointed attacks over their personal ties to foreign countries. Both contenders are pumping massive amounts of their personal wealth into TV ads. The crowded field also includes former US ambassador to Denmark Carla Sands, who, like the top contenders, is relying on her personal wealth, and Jeff Bartos, the party’s 2018 nominee for lieutenant governor. The race to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Pat Toomey was upended last November when Trump-backed candidate Sean Parnell ended his campaign amid scrutiny of his turbulent personal life. So far, the former President has held off on throwing his support behind another candidate, a move that could shake up the trajectory of the primary.\n\nDemocrats see the Keystone State as perhaps the party’s best opportunity to flip a Republican-held Senate seat. The competition on the Democratic side features candidates with distinct backgrounds who represent divergent ideological factions within the party. Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, an outspoken progressive and strong fundraiser, and Rep. Conor Lamb, a Marine Corps veteran and former federal prosecutor, are seen as the top contenders. Rounding out the field is state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta, who has won the backing of some progressive groups.\n\nThere is also a wide-open race for governor in Pennsylvania, with Democrat Tom Wolf term-limited. The lone Democratic candidate is state Attorney General Josh Shapiro, who was one of the leading officials rebutting false claims about the commonwealth’s 2020 election results. The GOP field includes state Senate President Pro Tempore Jake Corman, former US Rep. Lou Barletta, former US Attorney Bill McSwain, state Sen. Doug Mastriano and businessman Dave White. Trump, and his lies about the election, are expected to be a driving factor in the primary.\n\nIn North Carolina, Trump’s early surprise endorsement of US Rep. Ted Budd failed to clear the GOP Senate primary field, with former Gov. Pat McCrory, former US Rep. Mark Walker and Army veteran Marjorie K. Eastman also in the running to succeed retiring Republican Sen. Richard Burr. Walker announced in January he would stay in the Senate race, defying Trump’s effort to get the former congressman to drop his bid and run for a House seat. On the Democratic side, the party has largely cleared the field for former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Cheri Beasley.\n\nIdaho is another state home to a GOP civil war, with Gov. Brad Little getting a primary challenge from Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin. The two have engaged in a political tug-of-war, with McGeachin on multiple occasions using her powers as acting governor to issue executive orders while Little was out of state, only to have the governor rescind them upon his return. Trump endorsed McGeachin last November, calling her a “a true supporter of MAGA from the very beginning.”\n\nMay 24: Alabama, Arkansas and Georgia primaries; Texas runoffs (if necessary)\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp Megan Varner/Getty Images\n\nThere is perhaps no state on the 2022 map where Trump is seeking to exert his influence on the Republican Party more than Georgia, where he rolled out a “Trump ticket” of candidates, including two who are challenging GOP incumbents the former President attacked after they rejected his efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nThe top target for Trump is Gov. Brian Kemp, whose decision to certify Biden’s narrow win in Georgia unleashed fierce and frequent attacks by the former President. The attacks culminated with Trump’s endorsement of former US Sen. David Perdue after he launched a primary challenge against Kemp. Perdue lost his Senate runoff to Democrat Jon Ossoff in January 2021, which some Republicans blamed, in part, on Trump’s efforts to undermine the state’s election results. Now Perdue is making Trump’s lies about the 2020 election a cornerstone of his bid to defeat Kemp. The winner of the GOP primary will likely face Democrat Stacey Abrams, who lost the 2018 gubernatorial race to Kemp by less than 2 percentage points.\n\nWhile the GOP primary for governor is unsettled, Republican Herschel Walker has plenty of running room in the Senate race. The former football star has Trump’s support as he seeks to defeat Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, who scored a 2-point victory in a Senate special election runoff against Republican Kelly Loeffler last year. Warnock has been a prolific fundraiser, beginning 2022 with nearly $23 million in the bank.\n\nGeorgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger stood up to Trump’s demands that he “find” the votes to overturn the 2020 election results in the state. Now the question is whether the state’s top election official can withstand a primary challenge from Trump-backed US Rep. Jody Hice, who embraced the former President’s false claims about the election. Among the Democratic contenders are state Rep. Bee Nguyen, who succeeded Abrams in the state legislature, and former Fulton County Commission chair John Eaves.\n\nThe Atlanta area will host the year’s first Democratic member vs. member primary, with Reps. Lucy McBath and Carolyn Bourdeaux running in the newly redrawn 7th Congressional District after the GOP-controlled state legislature turned McBath’s current seat safely red. Both Democrats flipped suburban districts previously held by Republicans – McBath in 2018 and Bourdeaux in 2020.\n\nGeorgia won’t be the only state testing the power of Trump’s endorsement on this primary day. In Alabama, US Rep. Mo Brooks is hoping the former President’s support will help deliver him the GOP Senate nomination. But the conservative firebrand is running against two well-funded opponents: Katie Britt, a former top aide to retiring Republican Sen. Richard Shelby, and Mike Durant, an aerospace executive and former Blackhawk helicopter pilot. Brooks has struggled to take command of the field, prompting frustration from the former President.\n\nAlabama Gov. Kay Ivey is running for a second full term but is being challenged by several candidates in the GOP primary, including Lindy Blanchard, who served as ambassador to Slovenia in the Trump administration. Blanchard initially launched a bid for the open Senate seat but switched gears to run for governor last December.\n\nIn Arkansas, Sarah Huckabee Sanders – a former White House press secretary under Trump and daughter of former Gov. Mike Huckabee – has a clear path to the Republican nomination as she seeks to succeed GOP Gov. Asa Hutchinson. With Trump having carried the Natural State by more than 20 points in 2020, Sanders is poised to follow in her father’s footsteps and become Arkansas’ first female governor.\n\nJune 7: California, Iowa, Mississippi, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico and South Dakota primaries; special election in California’s 22nd Congressional District (if necessary)\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nLast September, California Gov. Gavin Newsom became the second governor in US history to defeat a recall. Now the Democrat appears to be coasting toward a second term in office – which could serve as a platform for a national run down the road. There are already signs of a brewing feud between Newsom and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a top GOP 2024 prospect.\n\nSen. Alex Padilla, appointed by Newsom to the seat vacated by Harris ahead of her becoming vice president, is running for a full six-year term. At the same time, Padilla must run in a special election for the remaining weeks of the original Harris term.\n\nCalifornia is losing a US House seat for the first time in the state’s history because of slower population growth. The new congressional maps, drawn by an independent commission, have scrambled the Golden State’s political landscape. With the potential for as many as 10 competitive House races this fall, the state’s top-two primary system could be a major factor in shaping the battleground map.\n\nGOP Rep. David Valadao is running in the newly drawn 22nd District in the Central Valley, which became more favorable to Democrats under redistricting. Valadao is the only House Republican running for reelection who voted for to impeach Trump in 2021 for inciting the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol and doesn’t have a challenger endorsed by the former President (yet). Among his Democratic challengers is Rudy Salas, a California assemblyman and former member of the Bakersfield City Council.\n\nAnother race to keep an eye on is the new 27th District around Los Angeles, where GOP Rep. Mike Garcia is a top target of Democrats. His challengers include former state assemblywoman Christy Smith, who is running for a third time against Garcia. She lost a special election and general election to him in 2020, with the latter race decided by a margin of just 333 votes. Democrat Quaye Quartey, a retired Navy intelligence officer, is also running.\n\nPrior to serving as Trump’s interior secretary, Ryan Zinke spent about two years representing Montana in the US House. Zinke is now eyeing a return to Capitol Hill after Montana gained a House seat following the 2020 census, though he’s facing scrutiny about his current ties to the state.\n\nJune 14: Maine, Nevada, North Dakota and South Carolina primaries\n\nNevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc./Getty Images\n\nNevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto is one of the most endangered Senate Democrats running this year, looking to carry a state Biden won by less than 3 points in 2020. The top contender in the GOP field is former state Attorney General Adam Laxalt, the party’s 2018 nominee for governor, who has managed to unite the Trump and Mitch McConnell wings. Still, he is facing a primary challenge from Army veteran Sam Brown, who has demonstrated some fundraising strength.\n\nIn the Silver State’s race for governor, incumbent Democrat Steve Sisolak is seeking a second term, with several Republicans lining up to run against him, including former US Sen. Dean Heller and Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo.\n\nThe fate of two Trump targets could be decided this day in South Carolina, where the former President has endorsed primary challengers to GOP Reps. Tom Rice and Nancy Mace. In the 7th Congressional District, Trump has backed state Rep. Russell Fry against Rice, who was one of the 10 House Republicans to vote in favor of Trump’s impeachment last January. Mace, who represents the 1st District, voted to certify the election results (but not for impeachment) and has tried to walk the Trump tightrope, criticizing his actions at times and embracing the former President at others. Trump has thrown his support behind former state Rep. Katie Arrington, who defeated former Rep. Mark Sanford in the 2018 GOP primary for the 1st District, only to lose to Democrat Joe Cunningham in the general election.\n\nIn Maine, a pair of Republicans are attempting political comebacks – with former Gov. Paul LePage and former US Rep. Bruce Poliquin both running for their old jobs. LePage is looking to challenge Democrat Janet Mills, who won the 2018 race to succeed him. Poliquin is eyeing a rematch in the 2nd Congressional District with Jared Golden, the Democrat who defeated him four years ago.\n\nJune 21: DC and Virginia primaries; runoffs in Alabama, Arkansas and Georgia (if necessary)\n\nVirginia Rep. Abigail Spanberger Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nLast November’s victory by Republican Glenn Youngkin in the race for Virginia governor boosted the GOP’s hopes that 2022 would be a strong year for the party in the commonwealth and beyond. This year, the battleground in the Old Dominion will center on two competitive House races featuring a pair of Democrats first elected in the 2018 blue wave – Reps. Abigail Spanberger and Elaine Luria. A handful Republicans have lined up to challenge Spanberger in the new 7th Congressional District, which was redrawn to include more of the Democratic-leaning exurbs in Northern Virginia but no longer includes the congresswoman’s home near Richmond. Luria’s 2nd District, meanwhile, became more favorable to Republicans under redistricting, with state Sen. Jen Kiggans seen as a top contender in the GOP primary.\n\nJune 28: Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, New York, Oklahoma and Utah primaries; runoffs in Mississippi and South Carolina (if necessary)\n\nIllinois Rep. Mary Miller Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc./Getty Images\n\nThe Land of Lincoln is the scene of not one but two dual incumbent House primaries after Illinois lost a seat based on the 2020 census.\n\nThe GOP contest in the 15th District will provide another test of Trump’s endorsement strength, with Reps. Mary Miller and Rodney Davis facing off. The former President rebuffed the advice of GOP leaders to remain neutral and threw his support behind Miller, a freshman member who has stirred controversy since arriving in Congress. Davis, now in his fifth term, is an ally of House Republican leadership and poised to become a committee chairman if the GOP wins control of the chamber.\n\nDemocrats have their own incumbent vs. incumbent primary in the 6th District, where Reps. Sean Casten and Marie Newman will compete for the party’s nomination. Casten flipped a GOP-held seat in 2018 while Newman narrowly defeated conservative Democratic Rep. Dan Lipinski in a 2020 primary before winning her general election race by double digits.\n\nOn the same day, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul will face off against US Rep. Tom Suozzi and New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams in the Democratic primary as Hochul seeks a full term in office. Hochul became the first female governor of the Empire State last August after Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo resigned amid allegations of sexual harassment. Among the candidates on the Republican side are Rep. Lee Zeldin, 2014 GOP gubernatorial nominee Rob Astorino, businessman Harry Wilson and Andrew Giuliani, the son of former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani.\n\nWith popular Republican Gov. Larry Hogan unable to run for a third term in Maryland, Democrats are hopeful about their prospects of retaking the governor’s mansion after eight years of Republican rule. That optimism has produced a crowded Democratic field, which includes former US Labor Secretary Tom Perez, state Comptroller Peter Franchot, author and former nonprofit chief Wes Moore and former US Education Secretary John King. Trump has endorsed state Del. Daniel Cox, who is running in the GOP primary against Hogan’s preferred candidate, state Commerce Secretary Kelly Schulz.\n\nJuly 26: North Carolina runoffs (if necessary)\n\nThe calendar in July is rather bare, unless any of the North Carolina primary contests in May require a runoff to decide the winner. Candidates only need to top 30% of the vote to avoid that scenario.\n\nAugust 2: Arizona, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri and Washington primaries\n\nArizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs Ross D. Franklin/AP\n\nTwo states at the center of Trump’s lies about the 2020 election will vote on this day – Arizona and Michigan.\n\nSparked by the former President’s falsehoods, GOP lawmakers in Arizona launched a months-long partisan review of the results in Maricopa County, home to Phoenix, which ultimately confirmed Biden’s victory there. That fact has failed to dissuade Republican candidates from embracing Trump’s baseless claims. The former President has endorsed former TV anchor Kari Lake, who is running for governor, and state Rep. Mark Finchem, a candidate for secretary of state, both of whom have cast doubts about the 2020 election results.\n\nCurrent Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, is running for governor, putting her defense of the state’s elections at the center of her candidacy. In addition to Lake, the other Republican contenders include former US Rep. Matt Salmon, developer and former Arizona Board of Regents member Karrin Taylor Robson and businessman Steve Gaynor.\n\nFinchem is joined in the GOP secretary of state primary by state Sen. Michelle Ugenti-Rita, who has advocated for so-called election integrity legislation. The Democratic candidates hoping to succeed Hobbs include Adrian Fontes, the former Maricopa County recorder, and Arizona House Minority Leader Reginald Bolding.\n\nTrump has yet to endorse in the Arizona GOP Senate primary, but his impact on the field has been felt in how the leading candidates are positioning themselves to align with the former President’s policies and politics. That list of hopefuls includes state Attorney General Mark Brnovich, businessman Jim Lamon and venture capitalist Blake Masters, who has the backing of tech billionaire Peter Thiel and the anti-tax Club for Growth.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Mark Kelly and his massive campaign war chest await whichever candidate emerges victorious on the Republican side. The former astronaut is running for a full six-year term after defeating appointed Republican Sen. Martha McSally in a 2020 special election.\n\nIn Michigan, Trump has endorsed two statewide candidates who’ve spread election falsehoods – Kristina Karamo for secretary of state and Matthew DePerno for state attorney general. They are seeking to challenge incumbent Democrats Jocelyn Benson and Dana Nessel, who have pushed back on Trump’s efforts to undermine the state’s 2020 election results.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer Bill Pugliano/Getty Images\n\nDemocratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who was on Biden’s short list for vice president, is also seeking a second term. Businessman Kevin Rinke and former Detroit police chief James Craig are among a packed field of GOP candidates looking to challenge Whitmer.\n\nThe new congressional map in Michigan has set up an all-incumbent primary battle in the 11th district featuring Democratic Reps. Haley Stevens and Andy Levin. The district’s new lines make it a safer seat for Democrats than the one Stevens flipped in 2018. Levin has deep political roots in the state, with his father, Sander, serving in the US House for more than 30 years and his uncle Carl Levin serving six terms as a US senator.\n\nGOP Rep. Peter Meijer is running for reelection in Michigan’s 3rd Congressional District after voting for impeachment and faces a primary challenge in John Gibbs, a former Trump administration official who has the backing of the former President.\n\nTrump has also endorsed state Rep. Steve Carra, who had launched a bid against Rep. Fred Upton, another GOP member who voted to impeach. But Upton has not yet officially announced if he’s running for another term, which would mean having to face off against fellow GOP Rep. Bill Huizenga in the newly drawn 4th District.\n\nTwo House Republicans from Washington who voted for Trump’s impeachment – Jaime Herrera Beutler and Dan Newhouse – will also face GOP primary voters on this day. Both have Trump-backed opponents in their all-party primaries. Retired Army Special Forces officer Joe Kent is challenging Beutler, while failed 2020 gubernatorial candidate Loren Culp is seeking to oust Newhouse. Like in California, the top two finishers in the primary advance to the general election, regardless of party affiliation.\n\nIn Missouri, there is a crowded GOP primary to succeed retiring Republican Sen. Roy Blunt in a state that should favor the party. Some Republicans are concerned that if former Gov. Eric Greitens emerges as the nominee, it could put the seat in play for Democrats, given his scandal-plagued past. GOP Sen. Josh Hawley has endorsed US Rep. Vicky Hartzler in the primary, with state Attorney General Eric Schmitt, US Rep. Billy Long, state Senate President Pro Tempore Dave Schatz and St. Louis attorney Mark McCloskey also in the mix. On the Democratic side, Marine veteran Lucas Kunce appears to be the leading contender.\n\nAugust 4: Tennessee primaries\n\nFormer State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus Gabriel Aponte/Getty Images South America/Getty Images for Concordia Ameri\n\nTennessee Republicans cracked Democratic Rep. Jim Cooper’s Nashville-based seat in redistricting, diluting the power of the vote in Davidson County, spreading it across three GOP-leaning districts. The move prompted Cooper to announce his retirement. It has also sparked a GOP showdown for the new 5th Congressional District. Trump is backing Morgan Ortagus, a former State Department spokesperson, while two top allies of the former President – US Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Madison Cawthorn – are supporting social media influencer Robby Starbuck. Former state House Speaker Beth Harwell is running for the redrawn seat as well.\n\nAugust 9: Connecticut, Minnesota, Vermont and Wisconsin primaries\n\nWisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson is the only Republican senator seeking reelection in a state Biden carried in 2020. A dozen Democrats have lined up to take on the two-term incumbent, who has evolved from a tea party insurgent during his first run in 2010 to a promoter of Covid-19 and January 6 conspiracies. The leading Democratic challengers appear to be Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, Milwaukee Bucks executive Alex Lasry and state Treasurer Sarah Godlewski.\n\nThe GOP field to take on Democratic Gov. Tony Evers is less crowded, with former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch, state Rep. Timothy Ramthun and Kevin Nicholson, who lost in the 2018 Senate Republican primary, among the contenders.\n\nThe last time a Republican candidate won a statewide office in Minnesota was 2006, when former Gov. Tim Pawlenty was narrowly reelected. Several Republicans are running to prevent Democratic Gov. Tim Walz from winning a second term. Misinformation about Covid-19 and the 2020 election have been key issues in the GOP primary. One leading candidate is Scott Jensen, a former state senator and family doctor, who has voiced vaccine skepticism and opposition to mandates. Another physician, Neil Shah, has suggested he took an unproven drug to treat coronavirus. At a forum last December, none of the five candidates who participated were willing to answer a plain “yes” when asked whether they thought Biden won a “constitutional majority in the Electoral College.”\n\nUltimately, whether Republicans lean toward a candidate like Jensen or Shah or a more mainstream pick like state Sens. Paul Gazelka or Michelle Benson, the primary may well be decided long before August. The state GOP will endorse a candidate at its convention in May and most, if not all, of the other candidates could drop their bids if they don’t earn that nod.\n\nVermont is the only state in the union that’s never sent a woman to Congress. But Democratic Sen. Pat Leahy’s decision to call it quits after almost 50 years in the Senate started a domino effect that could change that. Democratic Rep. Peter Welch, the state’s lone House member, is trying to move across the Capitol to succeed Leahy. That’s set up a Democratic primary in which two of the leading candidates are women. Lt. Gov. Molly Gray and state Sen. Becca Balint both declared for the seat shortly after Welch made his announcement.\n\nVermont Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican who leads one of the most Democratic states in the nation, will also be up for reelection (Vermont governors serve two-year terms) but he’s yet to announce his plans.\n\nConnecticut Gov. Ned Lamont and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, both Democrats, also face voters this year.\n\nAugust 13: Hawaii primaries\n\nHawaii Lt. Gov. Josh Green State of Hawaii\n\nTerm limits prevent Hawaii Gov. David Ige from seeking a third term, and several Democrats have lined up to succeed him. The primary field includes Lt. Gov. Josh Green, a doctor who has been one of the main faces of the state’s pandemic response, former Hawaii first lady Vicky Cayetano and former Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell. US Rep. Kai Kahele has also been mentioned as a potential candidate.\n\nHawaii is one of the most Democratic states in the country, so the winner of the Democratic primary will be heavily favored in November.\n\nAugust 16: Alaska and Wyoming primaries; South Dakota runoffs (if necessary)\n\nWyoming Rep. Liz Cheney Oliver Contreras/Pool/Getty Images\n\nTwo of Trump’s top GOP targets in 2022 are Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski. The coincidence of both states holding primaries on the same day sets up an epic test of the former President’s sway in the GOP.\n\nThere is arguably no Republican who has drawn Trump’s ire more than Cheney, who voted in favor of impeachment last year and is the vice chair on the House select committee investigating the events surrounding the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. Trump has endorsed Harriet Hageman, a onetime critic, as the candidate to fulfill his goal of ousting Cheney. So has House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. And the Republican National Committee took the unprecedented step of censuring the congreswoman. Working in Cheney’s favor are her family’s deep roots in the state and her massive campaign war chest. She also might benefit from the fact that she could win the primary without receiving a majority of the vote, as Hageman has not cleared the field of Cheney challengers despite Trump’s support.\n\nMurkowski is the lone Republican running for reelection this year who voted to convict Trump at his impeachment trial in the Senate. The former President has backed Kelly Tshibaka, who formerly led Alaska’s Department of Administration. But the race in Alaska will be complicated by the state’s new election system, with all the Senate candidates running on a single ballot and the top four finishers, regardless of party, advancing to the general election, which will be decided by ranked-choice voting. Given that, Murkowski is almost certain to advance to the November vote, where she could benefit from the reallocation process. The senator has faced tough reelection campaigns before – winning as a write-in candidate in 2010 after losing the GOP primary to a tea party challenger. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and his allies are firmly behind Murkowski’s bid.\n\nAugust 23: Florida primaries; Oklahoma runoffs (if necessary)\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, who has made himself a national figure with a laissez-faire approach to the Covid-19 pandemic and willingness to embrace hot-button conservative causes, might be eyeing another office in a few years. But first, he needs to win a second term, with the possibility of a decisive victory likely to only spark further speculation about his ambitions beyond the Sunshine State.\n\nThree Democrats are hoping to derail DeSantis’ rise, with US Rep. Charlie Crist, a former Republican governor, trying to reclaim his seat as Florida’s chief executive. Crist leads the Democratic field in fundraising. The other contenders to take on DeSantis are state Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried and state Sen. Annette Taddeo.\n\nBefore DeSantis, Sen. Marco Rubio was seen as the GOP’s rising star in Florida. His failed 2016 presidential bid upended that trajectory and led Rubio to reverse course and seek reelection to the Senate. Now he’s seeking a third term, with the onetime tea party darling turned Trump critic having fully embraced the former President amid Florida’s shift to the right. US Rep. Val Demings, a former Orlando police chief, is the prohibitive favorite in the Democratic primary and has been a strong fundraiser.\n\nThe outcome of these two races could dictate heading into 2024 how much attention and resources Democrats will deploy to Florida, which has been one of the premier battleground states in presidential races for many cycles.\n\nSeptember 6: Massachusetts primaries\n\nFormer state Rep. Geoff Diehl Matt Stone/MediaNews Group/Boston Herald/Getty Images\n\nThe decision by Republican Gov. Charlie Baker to not seek a third term in deep-blue Massachusetts sets up another test of Trump’s power inside the GOP. Former state Rep. Geoff Diehl originally launched his campaign as a challenge to Baker and picked up Trump’s endorsement. But while Diehl won’t have the popular incumbent as an opponent, he also doesn’t have a clear lane to November. Chris Doughty, a businessman and self-described moderate, joined the race in late January. While he doesn’t have electoral experience like Diehl, Doughty was able to open his campaign with half a million dollars of his own money.\n\nOn the Democratic side, state Attorney General Maura Healey, who entered the race after Baker declined to run again, leads the entire field in fundraising. State Sen. Sonia Chang-Díaz is also running. Despite favoring Democrats at the federal level, Massachusetts has a habit of electing moderate Republican governors. Without Baker on the ballot, Democrats are hopeful they’ll avoid such a fate this November.\n\nSeptember 13: Delaware, New Hampshire and Rhode Island primaries\n\nNew Hampshire Sen. Maggie Hassan Erin Scott/Getty Images\n\nDemocratic Sen. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire is one of the GOP’s top targets in 2022, but the party’s hopes of flipping the seat took a hit last November when popular Granite State Gov. Chris Sununu passed on a Senate bid. Sununu’s decision sets up what could be a long and crowded GOP primary, given New Hampshire’s late primary date. Candidates include former Londonderry Town Manager Kevin Smith, retired Army Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc and state Senate President Chuck Morse, who’s received praise from McConnell.\n\nRedistricting is poised to make New Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District, currently held by Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas, more favorable for Republicans. That shift has attracted a wide field of GOP challengers, including Matt Mowers, who lost to Pappas in 2020, former Trump aide Karoline Leavitt and Gail Huff Brown, a former TV anchor and the wife of former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown.\n\nThere will likely be another crowded primary on this day on the Democratic side in the Rhode Island governor’s race. Then-Lt. Gov. Dan McKee was elevated to the top job when Gina Raimondo was appointed as Biden’s commerce secretary last year, and he’s now seeking a full term. But Rhode Island Democrats aren’t just letting McKee have it. The packed field currently includes Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea, former Secretary of State Matt Brown and Helena Foulkes, a former executive at Rhode Island-based CVS.\n\nNovember 8: Election Day; Open primaries in Louisiana", "authors": ["Terence Burlij Melissa Holzberg Depalo Ethan Cohen", "Terence Burlij", "Melissa Holzberg Depalo", "Ethan Cohen"], "publish_date": "2022/02/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/11/10/what-we-know-outstanding-midterm-election-races/8316881001/", "title": "Election 2022 races remain undecided: live updates", "text": "WASHINGTON - Two days after polls closed in the 2022 midterm elections, some of the nation's most consequential races have not yet been decided.

Nevada officials say their count is slow because every voter received a mall ballot, and those are still being delivered to counting centers as long as they were postmarked by Nov. 8.\n\nHanging in the balance are the governorship of the state and the reelection race of incumbent Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democrat, who is neck-and-neck with Republican challenger and Trump ally Adam Laxalt.\n\n– Trevor Hughes\n\nDonald Trump again attacks Florida governor DeSantis\n\nRepeated talk in Republican channels of Ron DeSantis running for president is apparently getting to Donald Trump.\n\nTrump issued a lengthy written statement attacking \"Ron DeSanctimonious\" as \"an average REPUBLICAN Governor with great Public Relations.\"\n\nThe ex-president also attacked once-favored news outlets – Fox News, The Wall Street Journal, and The New York Post – for editorials touting a DeSantis candidacy, and criticizing Trump over the midterm election results.\n\nThere's a reason for Trump's defensiveness: While some of his candidates lost high-profile races this week, DeSantis racked up more than 59% of the vote in winning re-election as governor of Florida.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nGeorgia runoff election: Will President Joe Biden campaign for Sen. Raphael Warnock?\n\nPresident Joe Biden stayed clear of Georgia leading up to Tuesday’s midterm elections, sending in former President Barack Obama to rally supporters for Sen. Raphael Warnock.\n\nNow that the Georgia Senate race will be decided in a December runoff election, will Biden campaign for Warnock?\n\n\"The president will do whatever Sen. Warnock needs him to do to help him win,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Thursday.\n\nBiden had an unexpectedly good night Tuesday, when Republicans failed to deliver a knock-out blow. Control of Congress is still up in the air.\n\nBut Biden’s approval rating, including in Georgia, is low. And Warnock has declined to say whether Biden should run for a second term.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nDan Newhouse, Republican who voted to impeach Trump, reelected\n\nWashington Republican Rep. Dan Newhouse won reelection, the Associated Press reported early this morning, but he remains something of an endangered species on Capitol Hill.\n\nNewhouse was one of only two Republicans who voted to impeach former President Donald Trump for inciting the Capitol riot and made it to Election Day. (The other, Rep. David Valadao, was still awaiting results Thursday)\n\nThe other eight retired or lost primary elections, including Rep. Liz Cheney, perhaps the most visible Republican on the House committee investigating the riot.\n\nNewhouse emerged from the primary with only 25% of the votes, while 50% of voters supported Trump-aligned candidates.\n\n“My strategy and my message has been to appeal to those people that have supported me in the past,” Newhouse told the Spokane Spokesman-Review, “and to remind them that I'm still the same conservative Republican that I've always been.\"\n\nStill, it was unlikely Trump-favoring voters would go so far as to vote for his Democratic opponent in the general election, Yakima businessman Doug White.\n\n– Donovan Slack\n\nBoebert now ahead in Colorado with 98% of votes counted\n\nRepublican Lauren Boebert has pulled ahead of her opponent, Democrat Adam Frisch, by over 400 votes, according to the latest from the Associated Press with 98% of votes reported.\n\nBoebert has trailed Frisch by a slim margin since Tuesday, in what became a surprisingly tight race between the incumbent and her Democratic challenger.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nMeanwhile, in Reno… ‘We are working on it. Please be patient.’\n\nIn Nevada’s Washoe County, Nevada’s second-most populous, the vast majority of uncounted ballots won’t be tallied until Friday and maybe later than that. Mail-in ballots are still arriving. About 4,000 came Wednesday. Some 18,000 showed up on Election Day, none of which have been tallied yet.\n\n“We are working on it. Please be patient,” interim registrar of voters Jaime Rodriguez urged. “It does take time. We don’t want to do it fast – we want to do it right.”\n\nAbout 25,000 votes separated incumbent Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto from Trump-backed Republican challenger Adam Laxalt with 83% of the vote counted statewide as of midday Thursday on the East Coast.\n\nBallots that arrive through Saturday and are postmarked by Nov. 8, the day of the midterm election, will be counted.\n\nWashoe and Clark account for about 90% of the state’s 1.8 million active registered voters. On Wednesday evening, Clark County released additional results that placed Cortez Masto ahead of Laxalt by 33,179 votes, or 51.3% to 45.8%.\n\nIn Washoe County, the margin was 0.2 percentage points - 356 votes.

He had set up a secure location, and plans were laid to select four races to audit -- though he didn’t say when exactly workers would begin counting.

Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democrat – remained undecided.\n\nPolls going into Election Day showed Cortez Masto and Republican challenger Adam Laxalt essentially tied, and both sides say the outstanding votes favor them. Partial results reported by the Nevada Secretary of State show Laxalt leading by about 21,000 votes, but most of the ballots remaining to be counted are from more urban areas that have been trending in Cortez Masto’s favor.\n\n“We expect the remaining mail universe to fall well below the percentage she needs to catch us,” Laxalt said in a statement posted to Twitter.\n\nBut a spokesman for Cortez Masto, who is known colloquially in Nevada as CCM, said he’s confident things are breaking their way from the Democratic-leaning Washoe and Clark counties, which are home respectively to Reno and Las Vegas.\n\n“CCM just took the lead in Washoe and more Dem-heavy mail is pouring in from Clark. As we said, we’re on track to win this,” Josh Marcus-Blank tweeted late Wednesday.\n\n– Trevor Hughes\n\nMore than 600,000 ballots to be counted as the day begins in Arizona\n\nArizona election workers on Thursday were still digging into a mountain of ballots — more than 600,000 statewide – in the crucial battleground state. The results will decide two of the most closely watched races in the country:\n\nDemocratic incumbent Sen. Mark Kelly has a comfortable lead over Trump-backed Republican challenger Blake Masters, but only 70% of the votes are counted.\n\nDemocrat and current Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs is leading Republican Kari Lake, a former TV anchor, by a razor-thin margin – 13,000 votes – at 50.3% to 49.7%.\n\nUSA TODAY Network reporters at the Arizona Republic are on the ground following all the developments this morning.

I think he's a drag on our offices, on our races.\"\n\nLooking to 2024, Ryan said in a Fox News interview last month, that \"anybody not named Trump\" should be the presidential nominee in two years.\n\nWhat some were predicting to be a \"red wave\" this November turned into a tighter contest for control of Congress. Republicans lead by 23 seats in the House, according to the Associated Press. The majority in the Senate may once again come down to a runoff election in Georgia, this time between Republican Herschel Walker and Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, after neither received at least 50% of the vote.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nTexas results confirm Abbott's 'resounding victory'\n\nAUSTIN, Texas - For Gov. Greg Abbott, his decisive victory Tuesday night over Democratic challenger Beto O'Rourke was at once a tribute to his fundraising prowess, his unwavering adherence to the issues that played to his strength and his enduring lock on a state electorate that has grown and evolved over the Republican's first two terms.\n\n\"It isn’t luck,\" University of Houston political science professor Brandon Rottinghaus said. \"Abbott has seen a politically competitive Texas coming for a long time and planned well ahead for it, raising a record-setting amount of money and developing the most impressive ground game Texas has seen in history.\"\n\nWith all voting places reporting unofficial results by Wednesday afternoon, Abbott had won 54.8% of the vote, to O'Rourke's 43.8%, validating the governor's claim the night before of a \"resounding victory\" to cheering supporters during an ebullient celebration in South Texas.\n\n– John C. Moritz, Austin American-Statesman\n\nLauren Boebert's race remains too close to call\n\nThe unexpectedly tight race for the Colorado House seat between incumbent Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert and Democratic challenger Adam Frisch remains too close to call. As of Thursday morning, Frisch led by 64 votes—putting the candidates neck-and-neck with 99 percent of votes reported, according to the Associated Press.\n\nBoebert had a 97% chance of winning reelection against Frisch, analysts at FiveThirtyEight predicted before polls opened Tuesday.\n\nColorado law states a recount is held when the difference between the number of votes cast for the two candidates is less than one-half of one percent of the number of votes the leading candidate received. The current tally puts the Colorado House candidates at a virtual tie. The Associated Press is reporting each candidate has received 50% of the votes, with Frisch at 156,746 votes and Boebert at 156,682.\n\n– Rachel Looker\n\nWhat's happening in Arizona?\n\nThe results of Arizona’s 2022 election were by no means finalized on Wednesday, but voters’ choices became somewhat clearer. The marquee races – for a U.S. Senate seat and the governor’s chair – remained too close to call.\n\nThere were still more than 600,000 ballots left to process and count statewide at the end of the day Wednesday, according to a tracker by the Arizona Secretary of State's Office. An estimated 340,000 of those were in Maricopa County, which encompasses the Phoenix metro area.\n\nAmong those that officials started processing early Wednesday were some 275,000 early ballots that voters dropped off at polling places on Election Day in Maricopa. Those ballots have to undergo signature verification before they are counted. That process should be almost complete by the end of Friday, officials said.\n\n– Arizona Republic\n\nUncalled Senate races\n\nFour Senate races remain uncalled, three of which have the potential to reshape the upper chamber of Congress.\n\nIn Arizona, incumbent Sen. Mark Kelly, a Democrat, holds a 5-point lead over Republican challenger Blake Masters with 69% of ballots counted.\n\nNevada Republican Adam Laxalt is leading incumbent Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto by just over 2 percentage points, 49.6% to 47.4%, with 78% of ballots counted.\n\nAnd in Georgia, perhaps the most consequential of them all, incumbent Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock is headed into a runoff election against Republican challenger Herschel Walker. With more than 98% of ballots counted, neither Warnock nor Walker earned more than 50% of the vote, which is needed to name a winner.\n\nSenate races recap:John Fetterman defeats Oz in Pennsylvania; Maggie Hassan wins New Hampshire\n\nAlaska's Senate race is yet to be called, but its ideological outcome is already decided. With the state's ranked-choice voting system, Republicans Kelly Tshibaka and Lisa Murkowski are neck-and-neck for the seat, meaning that Alaska's next senator will be a Republican; it's just a matter of who. That state's results could take up to two more weeks to finalize.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans have so far won 48 seats each. A party needs 51 seats to have the majority, but with Vice President Kamala Harris' tie-breaking vote, Democrats only need 50 seats.\n\nUncalled House races\n\nThere are dozens of seats still at stake, including several key races that could determine what party controls the House.\n\nAmong the races called as of Wednesday evening, Republicans look better slated to reach the 218 seat threshold to control the House compared to Democrats.\n\nIn one notable outstanding race, Republican freshman Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado trailed her Democratic challenger Adam Frisch by just 64 votes, with 98% of votes counted, according to the Associated Press.\n\nHouse election recap:Democrats run stronger than expected but may yet lose majority\n\n4 gubernatorial races have no winner yet\n\nFour of the 36 gubernatorial races up for reelection have yet to be called, including the highly anticipated Arizona governor's race between Democratic incumbent Katie Hobbs and Republican candidate Kari Lake.\n\nHobbs' previously lofty lead over Lake has slimmed down to a razor-thin margin as the state continues to count votes. With 69% of the votes counted, Hobbs holds 50.3% of the vote compared to Lake's 49.7%.\n\nGovernor races recap:Arizona, Oregon too close to call; Whitmer, Kemp win reelection\n\nNevada's Republican gubernatorial candidate Joe Lombardo leads incumbent Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak by nearly 5 percentage points, 50.3% to 46%, with 78% of votes counted.\n\nDemocrat Tina Kotek leads Republican Christine Drazan by nearly 3 percentage points, 46.7 to 43.9%, in her run for Oregon's gubernatorial race, where she seeks to maintain the Democrats' 36-year hold on the state's governorship.\n\nRepublican Gov. Mike Dunleavy is likely to maintain his position as Alaska's governor with 52% of the votes, beating Democrat Les Gara and independent Bill Walker. However, if Dunleavy's lead falls below 50% the state will turn to ranked choice vote tabulations.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/06/politics/senate-race-rankings-september-elections/index.html", "title": "The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2022 | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nA lot can change in a couple of months. Democrats now face a midterm environment that looks decidedly brighter than it was in the middle of the summer.\n\nThere were glimmers of optimism back in July for the party trying to hold on to its narrow Senate majority, in the immediate aftermath of the US Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. The ruling appeared to energize the Democratic base – something the party had been struggling with given President Joe Biden’s low approval ratings.\n\nStrong performances by Democrats in special House elections and a defeated anti-abortion ballot initiative in deep-red Kansas have given them more confidence that running on abortion, especially when framed in terms of rights and liberties, can be effective.\n\nOn top of that, Democrats have enacted a sweeping health care, tax and climate law, gas prices have come down and former President Donald Trump has thrust himself back in the headlines by revealing the FBI’s search of his Mar-a-Lago home, offering a foil for Biden and the party in power.\n\nAt the individual Senate race level, Republican candidates are struggling – both with fundraising, which is nothing new, and with how to adapt to a general electorate after months of trying to appeal to Trump and his base during the primaries. There have been frequent stories, for example, about GOP nominees scrubbing their websites of Trump-centric rhetoric and hard-line anti-abortion stances.\n\nIt hasn’t helped that the two men who are ostensibly in charge of winning Republicans the Senate – Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Florida Sen. Rick Scott, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee – have sparred publicly about midterm strategy. “Candidate quality has a lot to do with the outcome,” McConnell said last month, before later describing the GOP’s chances of flipping the Senate as a “50/50 proposition.” Scott responded in an op-ed without mentioning the Kentucky Republican by name, writing, “If you want to trash-talk our candidates to help Democrats, pipe down.”\n\nThe shifting winds, both nationally and in specific races, have resulted in several changes to this month’s ranking of the top 10 Senate seats most likely to flip since CNN’s last list in July. The ranking is based on CNN’s reporting, fundraising and advertising data, and polling, as well as historical data about how states and candidates have performed. Wisconsin, where Sen. Ron Johnson is the only Republican running for reelection in a state Biden carried, moves up the list as several public polls show him in a vulnerable position. And Arizona, where Republican Blake Masters has struggled to fundraise, moves down the list as allies have either not yet come to his defense or have actively moved money away from his race to shore up seats such as Ohio, which bumps up one spot in the rankings – at least for now.\n\nDespite the recent good news for Democrats and the structural fact that this year’s battleground states were largely won by Biden two years ago, Republicans still have a good shot of winning the Senate, especially with the economy in flux. All they need is a net gain of one seat. Biden’s approval numbers may have improved slightly in certain polls, but that’s not saying much considering most Americans still disapprove of his performance. And the historical trend of first-term presidents seeing their party lose congressional majorities in the midterms looms large.\n\n1. Pennsylvania\n\nIncumbent: Republican Pat Toomey (retiring)\n\nSarah Silbiger/Pool/Getty Images\n\nAmid all the viral jeering in Pennsylvania – whether over crudités or Snooki – the real question heading into the post-Labor Day sprint is whether Republican voters will “come home” for Senate nominee Mehmet Oz. That is: Will they show up and cast their ballots for the celebrity doctor, who doesn’t seem to have used the summer to try to repair his image after an ugly May primary? That’s one reason why Pennsylvania, which Biden narrowly won in 2020, remains the seat most likely to flip this fall, as Oz and Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman vie to replace retiring GOP Sen. Pat Toomey.\n\nBut in this critical battleground, which saw visits from both Biden and Trump over the holiday weekend, the race is expected to tighten – the question is by how much. As it tries to make up lost ground, Oz’s campaign has been mocking Fetterman’s health in the wake of his May stroke – an unusual and arguably risky strategy coming from a cardiothoracic surgeon. (Fetterman, newly back on the trail, struggles with “auditory processing,” his campaign has acknowledged.) Outside Republicans are sticking to a more predictable script, trying to paint Fetterman, who backed Sen. Bernie Sanders’ 2016 campaign for president, as weak on crime.\n\nThe Democrat has responded in ads of his own by mocking Oz’s “Gucci loafers” and arguing that he couldn’t hack it in Braddock, the western Pennsylvania borough where Fetterman served as mayor. “We did whatever it took to fund our police,” Fetterman says in one spot – an example of how Democratic candidates this cycle are trying to get ahead of GOP efforts to tie them to “defund the police” rhetoric.\n\n2. Nevada\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto\n\nCNN\n\nNevada, a state that Biden won by about 2 points in 2020, remains the seat second most likely to flip. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto didn’t start off the cycle as well defined as other swing-state Democratic incumbents facing reelection for the first time, and she’s running in a state with a transient population where economic concerns remain pressing. Her challenger, former state Attorney General Adam Laxalt – the grandson of a former governor and senator with the same last name – secured support early on from both McConnell and Trump and comfortably won his primary in June.\n\nBut if there’s one issue that could work in Democrats’ favor come November, regardless of economic conditions, it may be abortion. A recent ad from Cortez Masto uses audio of Laxalt calling Roe v. Wade a “joke.” The Republican has attempted to defuse such efforts to paint him as a threat to abortion rights, arguing in an August op-ed that he does not support a national abortion ban and that voters already settled Nevada’s “pro-choice” policy. However, both Democrats and Republicans acknowledge that the issue of abortion has some power here to make a difference. Whether it’ll be salient enough for voters when they enter the voting booth, however, remains to be seen.\n\n3. Wisconsin\n\nIncumbent: Republican Ron Johnson\n\nLeigh VogelPool/Getty Images\n\nThe Badger State moves up two spots on this list, with the seat now looking more likely to flip than it did in the middle of the summer.\n\nAt least two public polls have suggested GOP incumbent Ron Johnson is in trouble against Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, who easily won last month’s Democratic primary after his closest challengers dropped out and endorsed him. Barnes was at 50% to Johnson’s 46% among registered voters in Fox’s mid-August survey, which was within the poll’s margin of error. In a Marquette Law School poll taken around the same time, Barnes led Johnson 51% to 44%. In both surveys, inflation was the most important issue to voters, which should benefit Republicans. (Voters who said inflation was the most important issue for their Senate vote overwhelmingly broke for Johnson in the Fox poll.) As it has in other states, the GOP-aligned nonprofit group One Nation has tried in ads to tie “Washington spending” to rising consumer prices. But the Marquette survey found that voters were less concerned about inflation than they had been in June, thanks to falling gas prices and costs – a positive trajectory for Democrats.\n\nNow that they have an opponent, however, Republicans are going hard after Barnes, arguing that his numbers will look different once they’re done with their attacks. The GOP playbook so far has been to try to tie Barnes to the “squad” of House progressives, with the NRSC saying he’s “not just a Democrat, but a dangerous Democrat” in an ad about ending cash bail. Wisconsin Truth PAC, a pro-Johnson super PAC, ran an ad saying Barnes “supports defunding the police” – which the Democrat calls a “lie” in his own spot that features him unpacking groceries.\n\n4. Georgia\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Raphael Warnock\n\nMegan Varner/Getty Images\n\nGeorgia lands at No. 4 this month, with Wisconsin moving up. While the Peach State went blue in 2020 and elected two Democratic senators in runoffs last year, voters here have otherwise been accustomed to voting for Republicans statewide. That means Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, who’s seeking a full six-year term in November, is in for a tough reelection regardless of the tailwinds his party may be picking up elsewhere.\n\nBut the wild card here is his GOP opponent, Herschel Walker, a Trump recruit whom many Republicans had tried to keep out of this race. A new ad from a Democratic outside group uses footage of the candidate and his ex-wife describing how he once put a gun to her head. (Walker has said he has dissociative identity disorder, which was previously known as multiple personality disorder, and has sought to advise people with mental health problems.) Walker has raised decent money – although his haul still pales in comparison with Warnock’s – and observers credit a staff shakeup for helping the Republican get his campaign on track.\n\nStill, Democrats think they have plenty to attack him on, including his habit of saying controversial or illogical things when he goes off script. While Warnock has worked to build an identity that’s his own and to explain the health care, tax and climate law in his ads, Republicans have been trying to tie him to Biden and to blame the President’s agenda – and Warnock’s votes for it – for the pain Georgia voters are feeling in the grocery checkout line.\n\n5. Arizona\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Mark Kelly\n\nCourtney Pedroza/Getty Images\n\nDemocratic Sen. Mark Kelly, who’s running for a full six-year term in November, faces a tough reelection because of the ancestrally red state he’s running in. But Arizona drops a spot on this list in light of his challenger’s struggles. Republican Blake Masters won the early August primary with backing from Trump and financial support from billionaire tech mogul Peter Thiel. But as CNN has reported, Thiel isn’t committing to getting him over the finish line – and Masters himself has struggled to raise money to compete with Kelly. And if he was counting on outside funding propping him up, that’s mostly gone for now – the GOP super PAC Senate Leadership Fund cut its September ad reservations for Masters while it moved money around to Ohio. (It still has airtime reserved in October.)\n\nMasters has earned media attention for scrubbing his website of language that included the false claim that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump, along with a section arguing that the country would be better off if Trump were still president, and some strict anti-abortion positions – a sign of how Republicans are trying to distance themselves from previously held abortion stances heading into the general election. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is attacking Masters on abortion, with one ad featuring a testimonial from a female voter: “Blake Masters has no idea what I went through, and he has no business making that decision for me.”\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, are still hoping the conservative DNA of Arizona, which backed Biden narrowly in 2020, will help their candidate, with the NRSC blasting what it calls Kelly’s “radical, extreme America.”\n\n6. New Hampshire\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Maggie Hassan\n\nErin Scott/Getty Images\n\nNew Hampshire is the only competitive state with an outstanding primary. The September 13 Republican contest will decide who’s taking on first-term Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan – and potentially how competitive that November election will be.\n\nRetired Army Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc, who unsuccessfully sought the state’s other Senate seat in 2020, led the GOP field with 43% among likely primary voters, well ahead of state Senate President Chuck Morse’s 22%, according to an August Granite State Poll conducted by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center. That could be a concern for Republicans looking to flip this seat. Gov. Chris Sununu, whose late decision not to challenge Hassan left the GOP without a field-clearing candidate, recently called Bolduc “kind of a conspiracy theorist-type candidate.” Besides going hard right, Bolduc lacks resources. He’d raised just $579,000 by the end of the pre-primary reporting period on August 24, compared with Hassan’s $31.4 million.\n\nThe fear that Bolduc could jeopardize their chances of flipping the seat has prompted outside Republicans to boost Morse on the airwaves, which in turn has Democrats’ Senate Majority PAC attacking him. And in a sign of Republican optimism about this race, the Senate Leadership Fund has said it’s planning to spend $23 million for fall TV reservations here.\n\n7. North Carolina\n\nIncumbent: Republican Richard Burr (retiring)\n\nDemetrius Freeman/Pool/Getty Images\n\nAs Republicans look to hold the seat of retiring Sen. Richard Burr, they have yet another nominee who has been outraised. GOP Rep. Ted Budd had brought in more than $6 million by the end of June, while Democratic nominee Cheri Beasley had raised $16 million.\n\nBudd won the GOP nomination with early backing from Trump, but Democrats argue he’s too conservative for a purple state – which Biden lost by a point – and is further to the right than its current GOP senators. (Sen. Thom Tillis, for example, has said he’d vote for legislation codifying same-sex and interracial marriage, a bill that Budd opposed in the House.) Democrats are hitting Budd on the airwaves over abortion, which comes amid the recent reinstatement of North Carolina’s 20-week abortion ban. Beasley, a former state Supreme Court chief justice, is trying to run as an outsider. “I like that Cheri Beasley hasn’t worked in Washington,” one woman says in an ad for the Democrat.\n\nBudd has run hybrid ads with the NRSC that attack Biden over inflation, with montages of a little girl’s disappointed face when her mother signals they cannot afford to buy cupcakes. Another features Budd standing on an empty stage in front of a fake banner that reads “Cheri Beasley Welcomes Joe Biden” as the Republican says Biden won’t show up in North Carolina because “he’s too busy making life harder for you.” Beasley still faces an uphill battle in a state Trump carried twice, but Democrats hope that the first Black woman to serve as chief justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court may be able to juice turnout among communities that don’t always vote, especially in midterms.\n\n8. Ohio\n\nIncumbent: Republican Rob Portman (retiring)\n\nTING SHEN/AFP/POOL/Getty Images\n\nOhio switches places with Florida this month, although that could change again before Election Day. At this moment, however, retiring GOP Sen. Rob Portman’s seat appears more likely to flip because Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan is running a better campaign than Republican J.D. Vance, who, as CNN reported, hasn’t been very active on the trail.\n\nPerhaps even more concerning to Washington Republicans is Vance’s fundraising – Ryan had raised six times more by the end of June. All of that prompted the Senate Leadership Fund to pull ad reservations in Arizona, a state Biden narrowly won, and invest $28 million in Ohio, a state Trump twice won by 8 points. One Nation, the GOP-affiliated nonprofit group, has already been hitting Ryan for supporting legislation in Congress it asserts has worsened inflation.\n\nRyan has been working hard to distance himself from the national party – most recently, for example, he came out strongly against Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan. He’s running on an economic populist message, declaring in an ad that he “voted with Trump on trade,” but he’s also talking about abortion. He called the decision to overturn Roe v. Wade “the largest governmental overreach into the private lives of American citizens in the history of our lifetime” on CNN’s “State of the Union” last month – one example of how Democrats have been adopting GOP rhetoric about freedom and liberty in their messaging on abortion.\n\nStill, Ryan may soon hit a ceiling of support in this red state, and with more resources coming in from Republicans, Vance may again have the advantage. If that doesn’t start to make a difference for him soon, though, this race will deserve another closer look.\n\n9. Florida\n\nIncumbent: Republican Marco Rubio\n\nDREW ANGERER/AFP/POOL/Getty Images\n\nFlorida drops one spot this month on account of Ohio moving up, but the fundamentals of the two states suggest that the Sunshine State may eventually revert to being the more competitive race for Democrats. (Trump carried it by just 3 points in 2020, less than half his margin in Ohio.) Unlike the Republican nominee in the Buckeye State, GOP Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida isn’t having the same struggles with fundraising, even though he has been outraised by his Democratic challenger, US Rep. Val Demings, who easily won her primary last month. (She had raised nearly $48 million by the beginning of August compared with Rubio’s nearly $37 million.)\n\nLaw enforcement and policing remain a big focus of the attacks between them, and Demings’ background as a former Orlando police chief provides an interesting dynamic. “I’ll protect Florida from bad ideas like defunding the police,” she says in a spot that touts her experience fighting crime. “That’s just crazy.” Rubio and the NRSC argue, however, that her voting record compares with that of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and undermines her law enforcement background. “Maybe she used to be a cop, but in Washington, Val Demings is just another radical, rubber stamp,” one of their hybrid ads says.\n\n10. Colorado\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Michael Bennet\n\nDEMETRIUS FREEMAN/AFP/POOL/Getty Images\n\nIt’s hardly surprising that one of Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet’s first negative ads in his bid for a third full term is about abortion. In a state that Biden won by nearly 14 points in 2020, Democrats are making the elimination of federal abortion rights a central part of their midterm message.\n\nRepublican nominee Joe O’Dea is responding in ads narrated by his daughter and his wife. “When Joe O’Dea says he’s American before he’s a Republican, he means it,” his wife says. O’Dea, who told CNN he disagreed with the Supreme Court’s abortion decision, is trying to cast himself as a moderate. But Democrats are quick to point out that he voted for a failed 2020 state ballot measure to ban abortion after 22 weeks of pregnancy. And O’Dea acknowledges he would’ve voted to confirm the conservative justices who backed overturning Roe v. Wade. (He also said he would have supported Obama-nominated Justice Elena Kagan, who dissented in the high court’s abortion ruling.)\n\nDemocrats still remember when overplaying the abortion issue cost them a Senate race here in 2014. And Bennet, who won reelection in 2016 by less than 6 points against a challenger without national GOP backing, knows he’ll need support beyond the Democratic base to win in light-blue Colorado. He recently criticized the Biden administration’s student loan forgiveness announcement, for example, saying it should have been further targeted. And he’s tried to convey an across-the-aisle appeal in advertising, with a fly fishing instructor in a recent ad stating, “I’m not a Democrat, but I know Michael doesn’t take the bait from Washington.”", "authors": ["Simone Pathe"], "publish_date": "2022/09/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/11/health/us-coronavirus-tuesday/index.html", "title": "Omicron variant will 'find just about everybody,' Fauci says, but ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAs the Omicron variant spreads like wildfire across the United States, it’s likely just about everybody will be exposed to the strain, but vaccinated people will still fare better, the nation’s leading infectious disease expert said Tuesday.\n\n“Omicron, with its extraordinary, unprecedented degree of efficiency of transmissibility, will ultimately find just about everybody,” Dr. Anthony Fauci told J. Stephen Morrison, senior vice president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “Those who have been vaccinated … and boosted would get exposed. Some, maybe a lot of them, will get infected but will very likely, with some exceptions, do reasonably well in the sense of not having hospitalization and death.”\n\nIn contrast, those who are not vaccinated are “going to get the brunt of the severe aspect of this,” he added.\n\nAcross the United States, at least one in five eligible Americans – roughly 65 million people– are not vaccinated against Covid-19. More than 62% of the country has been fully vaccinated, but only 23% are fully vaccinated and boosted, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nFauci’s comments came in response to a question about whether the pandemic has entered a new phase. That will come when there’s enough protection in the community and drugs to easily treat severe Covid-19, he said, adding, “We may be on the threshold of that right now.”\n\nAlso Tuesday, US Food and Drug Administration acting commissioner Dr. Janet Woodcock said that while most people could catch the virus, the focus now should be on making sure hospitals and essential services function.\n\nWoodcock was responding to a question from Sen. Mike Braun about whether it’s time for the United States to change its Covid-19 strategy. Her statement was not a new assessment of Covid-19, but rather an attempt to make clear the need to prioritize essential services as the Omicron variant surges.\n\n“I think it’s hard to process what’s actually happening right now, which is: Most people are going to get Covid,” Woodcock said Tuesday at a Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee hearing. “And what we need to do is make sure the hospitals can still function, transportation, you know, other essential services are not disrupted while this happens.”\n\nOn Tuesday, the number of US patients hospitalized with Covid-19 hit a record high, adding strain to health care networks and pushing states toward emergency staffing and other measures as they struggle to cope.\n\nMore than 145,900 people were in US hospitals with Covid-19 as of Tuesday – a number that surpasses the previous peak from mid-January 2021 (142,246), and is almost twice what it was two weeks ago, according to data from the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe hospitalization record comes amid a surge in cases fueled by the highly transmissible Omicron variant.\n\nThe United States averaged more than 754,200 new Covid-19 cases daily over the past week, according to Johns Hopkins University data. That’s about three times last winter’s peak average (251,987 on January 11, 2021), and 4.5 times the peak from the Delta-driven surge (166,347 on September 1), according to JHU.\n\nThe country has averaged 1,646 Covid-19 deaths a day over the past week – 33% higher than a week ago, according to JHU. The peak average was 3,402 daily on January 13, 2021, JHU data shows.\n\nThe Omicron variant caused 98.3% of new coronavirus cases in the United States last week, according to estimates posted Tuesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nA technician administers a Covid-19 test Monday at a drive-thru location at Churchill Downs, Kentucky. Jon Cherry/Getty Images\n\nLeaders activate new measures to combat surging numbers\n\nHospitals are increasingly juggling staffing issues – not just because of the increased demand, but also because their employees, who are at a high risk of infection, have to isolate and recover after testing positive.\n\nIn Virginia, Gov. Ralph Northam declared a limited state of emergency Monday after the number of intensive care unit hospitalizations more than doubled since December 1. The order allows hospitals to expand bed capacity and gives more flexibility in staffing, he said, adding that it also expands the use of telehealth as well as expanding which medical professionals can give vaccines.\n\nIn Texas, at least 2,700 medical staffers are being hired, trained and deployed to assist with the surge, joining more than 1,300 personnel already sent across the state, the Texas Department of State Health Services said in a statement to CNN.\n\nKentucky has mobilized the National Guard to provide support, with 445 members sent to 30 health care facilities, the state announced.\n\n“Omicron continues to burn through the commonwealth, growing at levels we have never seen before. Omicron is significantly more contagious than even the Delta variant,” said Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, noting the earlier variant that spurred a surge of cases in the summer and fall.\n\n“If it spreads at the rate we are seeing, it is certainly going to fill up our hospitals,” he said, and Kentucky is “down to 134 adult ICU beds available.”\n\nAnd New Jersey reinstated a public health emergency, Gov. Phil Murphy announced, saying the state needed to “commit every resource available to beating back the wave” caused by Omicron. In the past two weeks alone, the state saw more than 10,000 people requiring hospitalization due to Covid-19, the governor said in a video announcement.\n\nMitigation measures such as mandatory masking are also being revived in some areas.\n\nDelaware Gov. John Carney signed a universal indoor mask mandate Monday because of hospitalization increases, with some hospitals “over 100% inpatient bed capacity amid crippling staffing shortages,” he said. Churches and places of worship are exempt, while businesses should provide masks to customers and have signage about indoor mask requirements.\n\n“It’s time for everyone to pitch in and do what works. Wear your mask indoors. Avoid gatherings or expect to get and spread Covid. Get your vaccine and, if eligible, get boosted. That’s how we’ll get through this surge without endangering more lives,” Carney said.\n\nShare of hospitalizations from breakthrough infections is growing, but risks for unvaccinated are higher\n\nThe HHS data on Covid-19 hospitalizations includes both those patients who are hospitalized because of Covid-19 complications and those who may have been admitted for something else but test positive for Covid-19. This has been true throughout the pandemic, though the share of patients who fall into each category may have changed over time.\n\nFully vaccinated people are accounting for a growing share of people hospitalized with Covid-19 – but hospitalizations among people who received a booster shot are still rare, and the gap in risk by vaccination status has been wide.\n\nBetween April and July 2021, before the emergence of the Omicron variant, more than 90% of Covid-19 hospitalizations were among people who were either unvaccinated or partially vaccinated, according to a study published by the CDC.\n\nBut a sampling of data collected by CNN suggests that figure has dropped to somewhere between 60% and 75% in recent days and months:\n\n• In Pennsylvania, about 75% of Covid-19 hospitalizations between September and early December 2021 were among people who were not fully vaccinated, according to data from the state health department.\n\n• In New York, about 61% of Covid-19 hospitalizations during the week ending January 2, 2022 were among people who were not fully vaccinated, according to data from the state health department.\n\n• Beaumont Health, the largest health care system in Michigan, reported on Thursday that 62% of Covid-19 patients in its eight hospitals were unvaccinated.\n\nIn some hospitals, up to 40% of patients with Covid-19 “are coming in not because they’re sick with Covid, but because they’re coming in with something else and have had Covid or the Omicron variant detected,” CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told Fox News on Sunday.\n\nBut Covid-19 cases in hospitals strain resources, regardless of whether a patient was hospitalized because of Covid-19, CNN chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said.\n\n“If they get (incidentally) diagnosed with Covid in the hospital, they still need to go into infection protocol – personal protective equipment, all of that still needs to be utilized. So it’s a huge drain on the system overall,” Gupta said Tuesday.\n\nWhile fully vaccinated people are accounting for a larger share of Covid-19 hospitalizations, multiple accounts suggest that those who are fully vaccinated and boosted account for a small share.\n\nIn the University of Maryland Medical System, less than 5% of hospitalized patients were fully vaccinated and boosted, President and CEO Dr. Mohan Suntha said Thursday. Beaumont Health reported Thursday that only 8% of Covid-19 patients were fully vaccinated and boosted.\n\nThe CDC did not respond to CNN’s multiple requests for data on the share of Covid-19 hospitalizations by vaccination status.\n\nThe agency publishes data on its website regarding the relative risk by vaccination status. Cumulatively, the risk of hospitalization has been eight times higher for unvaccinated people than for fully vaccinated people. But in the last week of November, CDC data showed that hospitalization rates were about 17 times higher for unvaccinated people than for fully vaccinated people.\n\nSchools and industries face Omicron issues\n\nThe debate over safety in schools from Covid-19 continues to play out as only about one in six children ages 5 to 11 is fully vaccinated, according to data from the CDC.\n\nAs Los Angeles prepared to return to school on Tuesday, approximately 62,000 students and staff had tested positive for Covid-19 and will have to stay home, data from the Los Angeles Unified School District showed Monday, equating to a 14.99% positivity rate. The positivity rate of Los Angeles County at large, by comparison, has spiked to 22%.\n\nIn Chicago, educators returned to school Tuesday and students are expected to resume in-person learning Wednesday following a nearly weeklong dispute. The Chicago Teachers Union had voted to teach remotely last week, and the school district responded by canceling classes for four days.\n\nThe agreement, announced late Monday, included metrics for when a classroom would need to go remote due to Covid-19 levels.\n\nIn areas where schools have returned to in-person learning after the holiday break, the time needed for those with Covid-19 to recover has impacted some essential services.\n\nOther sectors also are struggling due to high infection rates.\n\nSome municipalities have seen nearly a quarter of their trash collection workforce call in sick in recent weeks due to Covid-19, leading to delays, according to the Solid Waste Association of North America.\n\n“This coincided, unfortunately, with increased trash and recycling volumes associated with the holidays. However, we hope that as volumes decline and sanitation workers return to work, these delays will prove temporary,” executive director and CEO David Biderman said in a statement Monday.\n\nIn travel, US airlines canceled thousands of additional flights over the weekend due to Covid-19 callouts and winter storms, and cruise line Royal Caribbean International announced it has canceled voyages on four ships because of “ongoing Covid-related circumstances around the world.” Last week, Norwegian Cruise Line canceled the voyages of eight ships.\n\nPublic transit systems in major metropolitan areas such as New York City and Washington, DC, have had to scale back service with employees ill from Covid-19. In Detroit, 20-25% of SMART bus service is canceled or delayed, the agency said in a statement Saturday.", "authors": ["Travis Caldwell Jason Hanna Deidre Mcphillips Christina Maxouris", "Travis Caldwell", "Jason Hanna", "Deidre Mcphillips", "Christina Maxouris"], "publish_date": "2022/01/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/11/10/election-2022-arizona-live-updates-across-state/8267106001/", "title": "Arizona election Thursday recap: Updates across the state", "text": "Arizona Republic\n\nElection workers were still digging into a mountain of ballots on Thursday — more than 600,000 statewide, according to a tracker posted by the Arizona secretary of state.\n\nThe highest-profile offices on the ballot, from U.S. senator to governor to other key statewide positions, remained too close to call. Results from around the state will continue to be posted throughout the day on Friday.\n\nMaricopa County, the most populous county in the state, released a major update of results on Thursday evening.\n\nLooking for the latest updates? Follow Friday's coverage of Arizona's midterm election by Republic reporters.\n\nHere's a recap of Wednesday's election events.\n\nHobbs keeps lead over Lake\n\nDemocratic nominee for governor Katie Hobbs held her lead over GOP nominee Kari Lake as the neck-and-neck contest remained too close to call on Thursday evening.\n\nKelly stays ahead in U.S. Senate race\n\nU.S. Sen. Mark Kelly, a Democrat, maintained a lead Thursday evening over Republican Blake Masters.\n\n10 p.m.: Yee on course to win treasurer’s race\n\nKimberly Yee, the incumbent treasurer and a former state lawmaker, maintained a strong lead over Democrat Martín Quezada, a state senator, after Thursday’s ballot tallies.\n\nYee is seeking another four years in office. She was the first Asian American candidate to win statewide office in Arizona when she was elected in 2018. Quezada has said he ran to improve a statewide office that is too often used as a steppingstone for politicians.\n\n9:40 p.m.: Jenn Duff gains in lead for Mesa City Council; voters favor public safety bond\n\nMesa’s $157 million public safety bond and three other local measures continue to be favored by voters after updated ballot tallies Thursday evening.\n\nIncumbent Jenn Duff gained in her lead for a second term on City Council to represent District 4, which covers central and downtown Mesa.\n\nThe multimillion-dollar bond request will pay for fire stations, a renovated police headquarters and an expanded fire and police training facility.\n\nVoters considered two city charter changes. One relates to how the city negotiates with public safety employee associations. The other updates which purchases must be approved by the City Council. Currently, the council must approve any purchase of materials over $25,000. The measure will allow the council to change the spending limit via city ordinance rather than sending it to the voters each time a change is sought.\n\nThe question of home rule — used in more than half of Arizona cities — lets the council, rather than a 42-year-old state spending formula, decide what services the community needs. The city must secure voter approval every four years to continue the practice. Mesa voters have consistently approved home rule requests.\n\n— Maritza Dominguez\n\n9:25 p.m.: Three Maricopa County judges at risk of losing their posts\n\nThe judicial retention results as of Thursday evening continued to show that most judges across the ballot would keep their posts, except for three Maricopa County Superior Court judges.\n\nWhile still holding enough votes to remain a justice, William Montgomery had the lowest number of approval votes Thursday when compared with his Arizona Supreme Court justice colleagues James Beene and Ann Timmer.\n\nAll five Arizona Court of Appeals judges — Kent Cattani, Cynthia Bailey, David Gass, Michael Brown and Steven Williams — seemed poised for retention.\n\nRusty Crandell, Stephen Hopkins and Howard Sukenic were the three judges, out of 47 Maricopa County Superior Court judges on the ballot, whose vote majorities were against retention.\n\n— Miguel Torres\n\n9:20 p.m.: Jason Beck leading in Peoria mayoral race\n\nJason Beck maintained his lead over Bridget Binsbacher, a longtime council member, in the race for Peoria mayor following Maricopa County's Thursday evening ballot drop.\n\nIncumbent Brad Shafer led challenger Diane Douglas, the former Arizona schools chief, for the council seat representing north Peoria's Mesquite District.\n\nNewcomer Jennifer Crawford held a narrow lead over incumbent Vicki Hunt in the race for the council seat representing the Acacia District in south Peoria.\n\n— Corina Vanek\n\n9:15 p.m.: Phoenix City Council races still too close to call\n\nPhoenix's two competitive City Council contests were too close to call after more votes were counted Thursday, but the unofficial tallies showed both races were tight enough to likely lead to runoff contests in March.\n\nHalf of the city's eight council seats are on the ballot, but the race to represent District 8 in south Phoenix and District 6 in Arcadia, the Biltmore area and parts of north central Phoenix are the most competitive.\n\nDistrict 8 incumbent Carlos Garcia was in a dead heat with challenger Kesha Hodge Washington.\n\nKevin Robinson narrowly pulled ahead in the open field of eight candidates vying to replace term-limited Sal DiCiccio in District 6. Trailing Robinson by a small margin were Sam Stone and Joane Greene. Stone eked out a slim advantage over Greene Thursday, though the two were nearly tied.\n\nIt's likely that the two top candidates in each race will head to March runoffs. Runoffs occur when no single candidate gets more than 50% of the vote.\n\n— Taylor Seely\n\n9:05 p.m.: Crane beats O'Halleran; three Arizona congressional races still undecided\n\nRepublican Eli Crane defeated incumbent Democrat Tom O'Halleran in the race for Arizona's 2nd Congressional District, the Associated Press determined Thursday evening.\n\nThree U.S. House races remain undecided:\n\n1st Congressional District: Democrat Jevin Hodge led incumbent Republican David Schweikert.\n\n4th Congressional District: Incumbent Democrat Greg Stanton was well ahead of Republican Kelly Cooper.\n\n6th Congressional District: Republican Juan Ciscomani led Democrat Kirsten Engel.\n\nEarlier in the week, the Associated Press called the following U.S. House races: Incumbent Democrat Ruben Gallego beat Republican Jeff Zink in the 3rd Congressional District; incumbent Republican Andy Biggs won the 5th Congressional District contest, where he faced Democrat Javier Ramos and independent Clint Smith; and incumbent Democrat Raul Grijalva beat Republican Luis Pozzolo in the 7th Congressional District race.\n\nRepublicans Debbie Lesko and Paul Gosar ran unopposed in Congressional Districts 8 and 9, respectively.\n\n8:55 p.m.: Buchli has a slim lead over Spence in Gilbert race\n\nBobbi Buchli maintains a slim lead over opponent Bill Spence in a runoff for the sole open seat on Gilbert’s Town Council as of Thursday evening as ballot counting continued.\n\nSpence is a retired Navy lieutenant commander and nuclear engineering officer who served as an appointed Town Council member in 2020. Buchli is a real estate broker.\n\nGilbert voters settled most of the council races in August's primary election, giving outright wins to incumbent Yung Koprowski and newcomers Chuck Bongiovanni and Jim Torgeson.\n\nThree new Town Council members will be seated in January as incumbents Lauren Hendrix and Aimee Yentes did not seek reelection and appointed Councilmember Scott September lost in August.\n\n— Maritza Dominguez\n\n8:50 p.m.: Graham leading Carter in Scottsdale City Council race\n\nBarry Graham maintained a sizable lead over Pamela Carter in the race for Scottsdale’s open City Council seat after Thursday's ballot update.\n\n— Sam Kmack\n\n8:40 p.m.: Updated results on the 10 statewide ballot measures\n\nPass and fail calls on the propositions were made by the Associated Press.\n\n8:25 p.m.: Mitchell still leads Maricopa County attorney's race\n\nFollowing Thursday evening's ballot updates, Republican Rachel Mitchell maintained a lead over Democrat Julie Gunnigle in the race for Maricopa County attorney.\n\nVoters faced a choice between two divergent approaches to criminal justice in the Maricopa County attorney's race.\n\nIt pitted Mitchell, the current county attorney who was appointed after the resignation of Allister Adel, against Gunnigle, an outsider and critic of the agency.\n\n8:15 p.m.: Hoffman moves ahead of Horne in superintendent race\n\nIncumbent Democrat Kathy Hoffman moved into the lead in the race for superintendent of public instruction following ballot tallies released Thursday night by Maricopa County.\n\nHoffman is now leading former superintendent and anti-bilingual education crusader Tom Horne.\n\nThe role of superintendent is largely an administrative job, not a policy-creation one.\n\nArizona’s superintendent can shake up educational priorities through public comment, but the role’s sphere of influence centers on pursuits like overseeing teacher certification, doling out funds, lobbying the Legislature and executing state and federal education laws.\n\n8:15 p.m.: Mayes holds lead in attorney general race\n\nDemocrat Kris Mayes held her lead over Republican Abe Hamadeh in the race to become Arizona's next attorney general following ballot tallies released Thursday night by Maricopa County. On Wednesday, Hamadeh had briefly taken the lead.\n\n8:10 p.m.: Fontes keeps lead for Arizona secretary of state\n\nDemocrat Adrian Fontes maintained his lead in the race for Arizona secretary of state. Tallies released Thursday evening showed Fontes still ahead of Republican rival Mark Finchem.\n\n7:30 p.m.: While ballots are still being counted, legislators elect leaders\n\nRepublican lawmakers on Thursday elected Warren Petersen, one of the most strident 2020 election deniers in the Legislature, as next year’s Senate president.\n\nA group of 19 current senators and Senate candidates, meeting at the Irish Cultural Center in downtown Phoenix, also elected Sen. Sonny Borrelli, R-Lake Havasu City, as the new majority leader and Sen. Sine Kerr, R-Buckeye, as whip.\n\nEarlier in the day, Democratic lawmakers elected new leaders in the House and Senate.\n\nIt’s still not clear if Republicans or Democrats will have the majority once all the votes are counted. How the election results shake out could change minds on who is best for the leadership jobs, but only House Republicans decided to wait until more election results come in before voting on a speaker of the House and other leaders.\n\nThe Senate president and House speaker assign lawmakers to committees that hear bills and have the power to kill bills outright or prevent lawmakers from voting on them.\n\nPetersen, R-Gilbert, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, helped lead the partisan 2020 election audit ordered by the current Senate president, Karen Fann, R-Prescott. He also was one of 30 GOP lawmakers who sent a letter to then-Vice President Mike Pence in December 2020 asking him to turn Arizona’s electoral votes over to Trump or delay the election’s certification.\n\nDemocrats, meeting at the state Capitol, elected Rep. Andrés Cano, D-Tucson as House minority leader and Sen. Lupe Contreras, D-Avondale, who's returning to the House next year, as assistant minority leader. Co-whips will be Reps. Melody Hernandez, D-Tempe, who starts her second term next year, and Rep. Marcelino Quiñonez, D-Phoenix, who was appointed to the Legislature last year and likely just won election to a two-year term.\n\nOn the Senate side, Democrats elected Sen. Raquel Terán, D-Phoenix, who's also the chair of the Arizona Democratic Party, for Senate minority leader and Sen. Mitzi Epstein, D-Tempe for assistant minority leader. Sen. Rosana Gabaldón, D-Green Valley will be the minority whip. A new position was created for Sen. Lela Alston, D-Phoenix, called Caucus chair. Alston has served in the Legislature off and on since the 1970s.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers who had won their election or who currently had more votes than their Republican opponents were allowed to vote for leaders.\n\nWith a few hundred thousand votes still uncounted, it's unclear if Republicans or Democrats will have majorities or if the House and Senate will be evenly split.\n\nFor an even split, the leaders of each caucus will negotiate a power-sharing agreement. This last happened in 2000 with a tie in the Senate.\n\n— Ray Stern\n\n7 p.m.: Pima County pushes Kelly further ahead\n\nVotes counted in Democratic-leaning Pima County on Thursday helped Sen. Mark Kelly widen his lead over Republican challenger Blake Masters.\n\nKelly, D-Ariz., now leads Masters by just under 100,000 votes or 5.2 percentage points.\n\nMaricopa County is expected to announce updated results Thursday evening based on the day's counting.\n\nThere were an estimated 600,000 ballots to be counted statewide entering Thursday.\n\nOf the ballots counted so far Thursday, Kelly has won 68%, and Masters received 30%.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n6:30 p.m.: Unprecedented number of Maricopa County ballots dropped off on Election Day\n\nOne key reason for prolonged election results this week is the number of people in Maricopa County who decided to drop off their ballots on Election Day.\n\nAbout 290,000 ballots were dropped off at polling locations on Tuesday and haven't been counted yet, Maricopa County Board of Supervisors chairman Bill Gates said Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe number of ballots dropped off on Election Day was unprecedented in Arizona's most populous county, and changes the county's original goal of having 95% to 99% of all ballots counted by Friday, Gates said.\n\nIn 2020, the ballots dropped off on Election Day tilted heavily Republican. But in 2018, that batch of ballots tilted Democratic, lifting Kyrsten Sinema to the U.S. Senate and three Democrats to statewide offices. Among those was Katie Hobbs, who was elected secretary of state that year.\n\nWhile it is legal for voters to drop off their early ballots on Election Day, doing so delays finalizing the results.\n\n— Richard Ruelas and Stephanie Innes\n\n4:30 p.m.: Maricopa County ballot count will take longer\n\nAt a Thursday afternoon news conference, Board of Supervisors Chairman Bill Gates said the ballot count likely won't be done by Friday.\n\nHe said Maricopa County staff will work on Veterans Day and over the weekend to count ballots.\n\nMaricopa County has counted 1.1 million votes and has another 400,000 to 410,000 to count.\n\nGates said the next ballot drop will be in “the 8 o’clock hour\" Thursday night. Thursday’s report will cover early ballots received Saturday, Sunday and Monday. He estimated it would be slightly more than the 62,000 ballot results released Wednesday evening.\n\nGates said he expects results to continue being released in evening batches of about 62,000 or slightly more in the coming days. Early ballots that were dropped at the polls on Election Day will likely be counted starting Friday, he said.\n\nGates also said “it’s offensive” for Kari Lake, the Republican candidate for governor, to charge that Maricopa County officials are slow-rolling election results. County staffers are working 14 to 18 hours a day, he said.\n\n— Mary Jo Pitzl and Catherine Reagor\n\n3:45 p.m.: Proposition to create lieutenant governor passing\n\nBallot measure, Proposition 131, to create the position of lieutenant governor in Arizona was passing as of Wednesday.\n\nFull results may not be available for several days. Early results can flip as later votes are counted.\n\nVoters are deciding for a third time if they want to replace Arizona's century-old procedure for what to do if the governor unexpectedly leaves office.\n\nThey rejected two other ballot measures intended to change the line of succession, in 1994 and 2010.\n\nOne of eight measures placed on the ballot by the Legislature, it would change the Arizona Constitution to create the position of lieutenant governor.\n\n— Ray Stern\n\n3 p.m.: Republicans lead in AZ Corporation Commission races\n\nRepublicans in the race for two seats on the Arizona Corporation Commission are maintaining their leads, according to results released Wednesday evening.\n\nDemocrat Sandra Kennedy is the only incumbent on the ballot for the commission. She and fellow Democrat Lauren Kuby are in the race against Republicans Kevin Thompson and Nick Myers.\n\nThompson and Myers took the lead in the race early Wednesday and have maintained it with subsequent releases of results. If the lead for both holds, it will give Republicans an additional seat on the commission and a 4-1 majority over a lone Democrat.\n\n— Ryan Randazzo\n\n2 p.m.: Why are AZ ballots printed on Election Day?\n\nMaricopa County uses several different machines at its vote centers: electronic check-in stations, ballot-on-demand printers and tabulators, where paper ballots are fed after people vote.\n\nBallots are printed on-site to give voters the option to vote at any voting location in the county, instead of going to an assigned location.\n\nA ballot printed on-site ensures the voter gets the right ballot that includes their school district, City Council and other local races.\n\n— Corina Vanek\n\nQ&A:What happened at Maricopa County's vote centers on Tuesday\n\n1:10 p.m.: Possible runoff elections for Phoenix City Council seats\n\nCompetitive contests for two Phoenix City Council seats were too close to call and could lead to runoff elections.\n\nHalf of the city's eight council seats were on the ballot, but the race to represent District 8 in south Phoenix and District 6 in Arcadia, the Biltmore area and parts of north-central Phoenix are the most competitive.\n\nDistrict 8 incumbent Carlos Garcia was in a dead heat with challenger Kesha Hodge Washington.\n\nKevin Robinson narrowly pulled ahead in the open field of eight candidates vying to replace termed-out Sal DiCiccio in District 6. Trailing by a small margin behind Robinson were Joan Greene and Sam Stone.\n\nIf the returns hold, the two top candidates in both races will head to a runoff in March. Runoffs occur when no single candidate gets more than 50% of the vote.\n\n— Taylor Seely\n\n12:15 p.m.: Kari Lake slams election on Charlie Kirk podcast\n\nWith hundreds of thousands of votes left to be counted and her Democratic opponent Katie Hobbs with a slight lead, GOP nominee for governor Kari Lake shared a confident message with her supporters on Thursday.\n\nWhat she is not confident in, however, is Arizona’s election system.\n\n“Listen, I'm a fighter, I think everyone knows that,\" she told conservative influencer Charlie Kirk on his podcast. “I'm not going to let these guys with their incompetency slow me down. We are moving forward.

Vote counting can take also several days in Arizona as election officials verify signatures on and process ballots received by mail.\n\n“I'm already heading toward getting ready to govern this state, and we're keeping our eyes on this election,\" Lake said. “We've got attorneys, we've got eyeballs everywhere, the votes will eventually be counted. And we will change the way the system works.”\n\nKirk is notable for launching Turning Point USA, a conservative youth movement that has grown in prominence and shifted Arizona Republican politics to the right.\n\nBoth Lake and Kirk have repeatedly pointed to widespread problems with ballot tabulators in Maricopa County this year as they raise concerns about election security.\n\n— Stacey Barchenger\n\n11:30 a.m.: New leader in Peoria mayor race\n\nBusinessman Jason Beck took a slim lead in the race for Peoria mayor Wednesday after all mail-in and same-day ballots were counted.\n\nHe is running against longtime Peoria Councilmember Bridget Binsbacher.\n\nBeck trailed Binsbacher in the first rounds of results but pulled ahead at about 1:30 a.m. when a flood of same-day votes were released by Maricopa County elections officials.\n\nAt his campaign's election night party, Beck said he was confident that later results would push him ahead.\n\n\"There is not a single thing left on the table for us to do, we worked as hard as we could,\" Beck said, joking that he had worn through three pairs of shoes knocking on doors to gather support.\n\nFor the council races, challenger Jennifer Crawford narrowly pulled ahead of incumbent Vicki Hunt in the race for the council seat for the Acacia District in south Peoria.

The text is among records obtained by the House select committee investigating January 6, 2021.\n\n\"It's very simple,\" Trump Jr. texted to Meadows on November 5, adding later in the same missive: \"We have multiple paths We control them all.\"\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Trump Jr.'s lawyer Alan S. Futerfas said, \"After the election, Don received numerous messages from supporters and others. Given the date, this message likely originated from someone else and was forwarded.\"\n\nImmediately before his text to Meadows describing multiple paths for challenging the election, Trump Jr. texted Meadows the following: \"This is what we need to do please read it and please get it to everyone that needs to see it because I'm not sure we're doing it.\"\n\nThe November 5 text message outlines a strategy that is nearly identical to what allies of the former President attempted to carry out in the months that followed. Trump Jr. makes specific reference to filing lawsuits and advocating recounts to prevent certain swing states from certifying their results, as well as having a handful of Republican state houses put forward slates of fake \"Trump electors.\"\n\nIf all that failed, according to the Trump Jr. text, GOP lawmakers in Congress could simply vote to reinstall Trump as President on January 6.\n\n\"We have operational control Total leverage,\" the message reads. \"Moral High Ground POTUS must start 2nd term now.\"\n\nThe text from Trump Jr. is revealing on a number of levels. It shows how those closest to the former President were already exchanging ideas for how to overturn the election months before the January 6 insurrection -- and before all the votes were even counted. It would be another two days before major news outlets declared Joe Biden the winner on November 7.\n\nThe text also adds to a growing body of evidence of how Trump's inner circle was actively engaged in discussing how to challenge the election results.\n\nOn March 28, Judge David Carter, a federal judge in California, said that Trump, along with conservative lawyer John Eastman, launched an \"unprecedented\" campaign to overturn a democratic election, calling it \"a coup in search of a legal theory.\"\n\nGeorge Terwilliger, an attorney for Meadows, declined to comment for this story. A spokesperson for the House select committee declined to comment.\n\nForeshadowing the Trump campaign strategy\n\nIn the weeks following the 2020 election, Trump and his allies eventually filed more than 60 unsuccessful lawsuits in key states, failing to convince the courts that his claims about a stolen election were justified, or uncover any evidence of widespread voter fraud.\n\nThey also called for various recounts based on those same unfounded voter fraud claims. A number of states conducted recounts in the months after the election, though none of them revealed any fraud substantial enough to have changed the outcome of the vote in any state.\n\nWhile Trump Jr. was publicly pushing various voter fraud conspiracy theories and generally casting doubt about the results in states like Pennsylvania and Georgia, his text to Meadows reveals there were other ideas being discussed privately.\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump-endorsed candidate asked about January 6. Watch what happened next Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump-endorsed candidate asked about January 6. Watch what happened next 01:48\n\nIn his text to Meadows, Trump Jr. identifies two key dates in December that serve as deadlines for states to certify their electoral results and compel Congress to accept them. Though the dates are largely ceremonial, in his text Trump Jr. appears to point to them as potential weaknesses to be exploited by casting doubt on the legitimacy of the election results.\n\nSeeking Trump electors\n\nTrump Jr.'s November 5 text to Meadows came as similar notions of faithless electors were starting to percolate publicly on conservative social media. Trump Jr. sent the text to Meadows at 12:51 p.m., just minutes after conservative radio host Mark Levin had tweeted a similar idea and suggested state legislatures have final say on electors.\n\nIf secretaries of state were unable to certify the results, Trump Jr. argues in his text to Meadows that they should press their advantage by having Republican-controlled state assemblies \"step in\" and put forward separate slates of \"Trump electors,\" he writes.\n\n\"Republicans control Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina etc we get Trump electors,\" Trump Jr. adds.\n\nTrump Jr.'s text, however, refers to an untested legal theory that state houses are the ultimate authority in elections and can intervene to put forward a different slate of electors than those chosen by the voters, when in reality this is a ceremonial process and the outcome is essentially a foregone conclusion.\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump dangles pardons for Jan. 6 rioters while teasing 2024 run Replay More Videos ...

However, multiple people who know Rick Perry previously confirmed to CNN that the phone number the committee has associated with that text message is Perry's number.\n\n'We control them all'\n\nTrump Jr. also texts Meadows that Congress could intervene on January 6 and overturn the will of voters if, for some reason, they were unable to secure enough electoral votes to tip the outcome in Trump's favor using the state-based strategy.\n\nThat option, according to Trump Jr.'s text, involves a scenario where neither Biden nor Trump have enough electoral votes to be declared a winner, prompting the House of Representatives to vote by state party delegation, with each state getting one vote.\n\n\"Republicans control 28 states Democrats 22 states,\" Trump Jr. texts. \"Once again Trump wins.\"\n\n\"We either have a vote WE control and WE win OR it gets kicked to Congress 6 January 2021,\" he texts Meadows.\n\nIn a series of memos in early January, conservative lawyer John Eastman proposed a variation of that idea\n\nEastman's memo laid out a six-step plan for Vice President Mike Pence to overturn the election for Trump, which included throwing out the results in seven states because they allegedly had competing electors. In fact, no state had actually put forward an alternate slate of electors -- there were merely Trump allies claiming without any authority to be electors.\n\nEastman, who has been subpoenaed by the House select committee and is fighting to keep some of his records secret from investigators, was accused by Carter of likely engaging in a criminal conspiracy with Trump to overturn the election.\n\n\"Dr. Eastman has an unblemished record as an attorney and respectfully disagrees with the judge's findings,\" his attorney Charles Burnham said in response to the judge's ruling.\n\nTrump Jr. pushes Meadows to fire Wray and install loyalist at FBI\n\nTrump Jr. ends his November 5 text by calling for a litany of personnel moves to solidify his father's control over the government by putting loyalists in key jobs and initiate investigations into the Biden family.\n\n\"Fire Wray; Fire Fauci,\" he texts, referring to FBI Director Christopher Wray and White House coronavirus adviser Anthony Fauci. Trump Jr. then proposes making former acting Director of National Intelligence Ric Grenell interim head of the FBI and having then-Attorney General Bill Barr \"select Special prosecutor on HardDrivefromHell Biden crime family.\"\n\nAs Trump refused to concede in the days and weeks after the 2020 election, rumors swirled that he was still considering firing Wray, along with several other top officials with whom he had grown frustrated.\n\nTrump and his allies sharply criticized Wray for failing to produce information that they claimed would be harmful to the President's political enemies, including Biden. CNN previously reported that the prospect of Trump firing Wray hung over the FBI for weeks, dating to before Election Day.\n\nWhile Wray remains in his post and Barr resigned in mid-December 2020 without naming a special prosecutor to investigate the Bidens, Trump Jr.'s text underscores just how precarious the situation at DOJ was in the immediate aftermath of the election.\n\nThe same is true for Trump Jr.'s recommendation that Meadows replace Wray with Grenell, someone who not only lacked the usual qualifications to lead the FBI but also had a proven track record of doing the former President's bidding.\n\nAfter serving a controversial three-month stint as Trump's acting intel chief, Grenell hit the campaign trail in late 2020 to help promote Trump's unfounded claims of widespread voter fraud and support his legal challenges in a key swing state: Nevada.\n\nOn November 5, Biden held a slim lead over Trump in Nevada but appeared poised to win the state's six electoral votes. That same day, Grenell and Trump campaign officials announced they were filing a new lawsuit to \"stop the counting of illegal votes\" but provided no evidence to support their claims of rampant fraud.\n\nThis story has been updated with new details of a text message Trump Jr. sent to Meadows.", "authors": ["Ryan Nobles", "Zachary Cohen", "Annie Grayer"], "publish_date": "2022/04/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/11/08/election-day-2022-arizona-live-voting-updates-across-state/8267101001/", "title": "Arizona Election Day recap: Voting updates across the state", "text": "Arizona Republic\n\nLeer en español\n\nPolls opened for in-person voting from 6 a.m. until 7 p.m. Tuesday as Arizona and the nation wrap up a contentious midterm election.\n\nRepublican Kari Lake, the Trump-backed former TV news anchor, is squaring off against Democrat Katie Hobbs, Arizona's secretary of state, in a high-profile race for who will become governor.

Some race outlooks tightened or changed with the new additions.\n\nGubernatorial hopeful Republican Kari Lake gained ground on Democrat Katie Hobbs, who still led following the latest returns.\n\nSen.

The celebration outside the church featured a free taco truck and horses moving to music played by La Banda Xplosiva.\n\nThe event was part of Poder Latinx’s efforts to build political power among the Latino community in Arizona by reaching residents in a cultural manner, said Executive Director Yadira Sanchez. The group also organizes in Florida, Georgia and Washington — places where Latino political representation is not where it could be, she said.\n\n“We chose activities that our community is familiar with,” Sanchez said. “La Cabalgata is a very popular activity that resonates not only in Mexican culture but other cultures in Latin America.”\n\nThe event was intended to be a celebration of democracy as well. “In Latin America, you go sometimes on a weekend, not Tuesday, and it’s a big party, a big fiesta,” Sanchez said. “So we’re trying to replicate that on a Tuesday evening.”\n\nSanchez said they planned to knock on doors around the Fowler Elementary polling site to let people know they still had time before the polls closed and that the group would \"be there waiting for them with tacos and music after they vote.\"\n\nElsewhere in south Phoenix, Benjamin Tarango and Rosa Sanchez Tarango cast their ballots at Moose Lodge near the foot of South Mountain.\n\nBoth Democrats, they said the most important issue to them this election was the improvement of south Phoenix, where they have lived for almost 40 years.\n\nBenjamin Tarango said he wanted to see improved streets, infrastructure, houses and local education.\n\n“It’s important that we make ourselves counted because we’re in this country,” Rosa Sanchez Tarango said in Spanish.\n\nBenjamin Tarango hoped “que no los abandonan a los Hispanos,” he said. “That they do not abandon the Hispanics.”\n\n— Madeleine Parrish\n\n12:50 a.m.: Arizonans vote against Prop. 128; Legislature can't change ballot measures\n\nArizonans voted against Proposition 128, which would have allowed the Legislature to change ballot measures that voters approved or divert funds from them if either the Arizona Supreme Court or U.S. Supreme Court deemed a measure unconstitutional.\n\n12:40 a.m.: Phoenix sees close City Council races\n\nPhoenix's two competitive City Council contests were too close to call based on early ballot counts Tuesday, but the unofficial tallies showed tight races that could lead to runoff contests.\n\nDistrict 8 incumbent Carlos Garcia was in a dead heat with challenger Kesha Hodge Washington to represent part of south Phoenix.\n\nKevin Robinson narrowly pulled ahead in the open field of eight candidates vying to replace term-limited Sal DiCiccio in District 6. Trailing by a small margin behind Robinson in early results was Joan Greene and Sam Stone.\n\nIf early return trends hold, the two top candidates in both races will head to a runoff in March. Runoffs occur when no single candidate gets more than 50% of the vote.\n\n— Taylor Seely\n\n12:30 a.m.: Republican confident in comeback for Corporation Commission\n\nCrowds were thinning at the Scottsdale Resort at McCormick Ranch as midnight approached, but candidates at the GOP Election Day celebration remained upbeat.\n\nKevin Thompson, a Mesa councilman running for one of two seats on the Arizona Corporation Commission, which regulates utilities, was trailing two Democrats in his race by a few percentage points.\n\nBut like other GOP candidates, he said he expects things to change as more rural county votes are reported, as well as votes cast on Tuesday, which are expected to favor Republicans.\n\n“We did really well in the rural counties,” he said of his campaign. For the race, he teamed up with Nick Myers, a Republican policy adviser at the commission, traveling the state together to reach voters. Myers is also behind the Democrats in early returns.\n\nShould he win, Thompson said his first order of business at the commission would be to improve the regulatory environment for utilities, which he said face higher borrowing costs because of the unpredictable decisions that Arizona regulators have made for utilities. When utilities face higher borrowing costs, they pass it on to customers.\n\n“It is costing us money as consumers,” Thompson said.\n\n— Ryan Randazzo\n\n12:20 a.m.: Attorney general candidates talk election outlook\n\nDemocrat Kris Mayes is leading Republican Abe Hamadeh for Arizona attorney general in early returns.\n\nMayes expressed optimism in a phone interview with The Republic about 11:40 p.m. on election night.\n\n“It’s going to take a few days to get the final results, but I’m cautiously optimistic. Arizona showed tonight that it does not want election deniers in office. Arizona wants an attorney general that is concerned about abortion rights, democracy and water conservation,” Mayes said.\n\nAt the Republican election night party in Scottsdale, Hamadeh addressed the crowd shortly before midnight.\n\n“The biggest threat to democracy is incompetent election officials. All we are asking for are free, fair, and transparent, competent elections. But Arizona, once every vote is counted … I assure you, we will be victorious,” Hamadeh said.\n\n— Tara Kavaler\n\n12:10 a.m.: Navajo Nation president loses reelection\n\nBuu Nygren has been elected as Navajo Nation president and Richelle Montoya will serve as vice president, the first woman to serve in that office. The unofficial results were released Tuesday from the Navajo Nation Election Administration.\n\nNygren defeated incumbent President Jonathan Nez, who was seeking a second term in office. He had started the evening with the lead, but Nygren soon took over and finally won enough votes to secure the victory.\n\n— Arlyssa D. Becenti\n\n12 a.m.: Prescott's LGBTQ community concerned about election results\n\nAmong some of the voters who have expressed concern about the pending results of Tuesday's election: Prescott’s queer community.\n\nThough a conservative city, Prescott has a hefty LGBTQ community. But many would never know it because politics has forced people back into the closet, LGBTQ leaders said.\n\nJohn Duncan, who helps run the Prism Network that connects gay communities among northern Arizona cities and towns, has lived in Prescott his entire life. He said the political tenor has made the area unsafe for queer people, especially transgender people.\n\n“We have a pride event, but we don’t call it a pride event because we’re worried about what will happen to people if we do,” said Teresa Landreth, an organizer for transgender communities in the region. “We have a lot of people who are trans here, and they just want to live their lives. They don’t want to fight battles. They’ve gone through it.”\n\nMolly Frieburg, executive director of Prism Network, said the politics is oppressive for LGBTQ people.\n\n“The politics has amped up around here to the point where even among our community organizations we’ve worked with in the past, I’m having people feel comfortable saying, ‘We don’t want you,’” Frieburg said.\n\n“We want people to know that this discrimination is happening,” she said. “But we also have to protect our community.”\n\n— Joseph Darius Jaafari\n\n11:45 p.m.: Voters pass Prop. 211, choosing more transparency in political spending\n\nVoters pulled back the curtain on anonymous campaign spending Tuesday, passing a law that requires public disclosure of big-dollar donors to political committees.\n\nProposition 211 jumped to an early and big lead and never let up, winning in all 15 counties.\n\nThe measure will require so-called dark money groups to name the donors who contribute at least $5,000 to a political committee, in a move that will provide more transparency in political spending.\n\n— Mary Jo Pitzl\n\n11:35 p.m.: Arizona voters opt to lower maximum medical debt interest rates\n\nArizonans voted to lower maximum interest rates on medical debt and change rules on general debt collection after passing Proposition 209.\n\n11:30 p.m.: Few gather outside Maricopa County tabulation center\n\nAt least 30 journalists from across the country and around the world waited for hours outside the Maricopa County Tabulation and Election Center in Phoenix on a gradually cooling Tuesday night to see if crowds gathered. They didn't.\n\nAt first, there were only two self-described patriots camped outside.\n\nAbout an hour later, they were joined by two women who danced as they called on Jesus to help with ballot counting inside.\n\n\"I'm pleading the blood of Jesus over our nation,\" said Leslie Taylor, with tears in her eyes. \"We already won. The election is ours. There is no one who can take it back to the evil side.\"\n\nHer friend, Michele Gordon, lamented the 2020 election and said that her vote wasn't counted. Times have gotten tumultuous, she said.\n\n\"We want fair elections,\" she said. \"What is going on right now is wrong and corrupt.”\n\n— Jose Gonzalez\n\n11:20 p.m.: Maricopa County provides more details on ballot counting plan\n\nBallots dropped by voters into “door 3” blue tubs at polling places will be tabulated Wednesday, according to Rey Valenzuela, co-elections director for Maricopa County.\n\nThe counting process for these ballots will be similar to the early ballots dropped off on Election Day, though early ballots go through signature verification.\n\nAll ballots successfully processed by polling place tabulator machines will be included in Tuesday evening results, Valenzuela said. Other ballots will be counted later in the week alongside the early ballots dropped off Tuesday.\n\n“Door 3” refers to a secure ballot box at polling places. Voters whose ballots weren’t accepted by malfunctioning machines were told to place their ballots in the “door 3” box to be counted later or else vote at a different location.\n\n— Sasha Hupka\n\n10:50 p.m. Hobbs, Lake address supporters as vote counting continues\n\nGubernatorial candidates Katie Hobbs and Kari Lake addressed their supporters after early results showed Hobbs ahead of Lake.\n\nLake, the Republican and former Fox 10 news anchor, struck an optimistic tone and criticized the election process in a speech at a watch party shortly after 10 p.m.\n\nHobbs, the Democrat and outgoing secretary of state, spoke to supporters earlier in the evening and said she’s “feeling good” about the early results.\n\nShe said county election officials are hard at work tallying votes and will be tabulating for the next few days.\n\n“We need to be patient and wait for every vote to be counted because every single vote matters and every single vote counts equally,” Hobbs said.\n\nLake took a critical tone toward the vote-counting process, saying “when we win,” the first course of action will be to “restore honesty to Arizona elections.”\n\nShe said she expects to declare victory and then will get to work to root out “incompetency” and “corruption” in Arizona elections. Lake said the current election system does not work and that people should know the winner and loser on election night.\n\n“We will take the victory when it comes, and we will turn this around,” Lake told a cheering crowd of GOP supporters.\n\n— Alison Steinbach\n\n10:10 p.m.: Gallego, Grijalva win reelection\n\nIncumbent Democratic Reps.

Roberts is leading in the race for justice of the peace in Page, according to preliminary election results.\n\nRoberts was first elected to the role in 1987 and served through 1994. Almost a decade later, in 2003, Roberts was again elected to serve as the justice of the peace for the Page Precinct, a role he held until his death.\n\nAfter his passing, the Coconino County Elections Department began accepting nominations for write-in candidates for the position. Ultimately five candidates entered the race, but preliminary results show that Roberts still earned more votes than the rest of the candidates combined.\n\n— Lacey Latch\n\n9:30 p.m.: Supporters of in-state tuition for Dreamers optimistic\n\nSupporters of Proposition 308 expressed optimism that their lead in the first batch of voting results would hold as more votes are counted.\n\nThe ballot measure would grant in-state tuition to undocumented students.\n\nCarlos Alfaro, campaign manager for Yes on 308, said the early results showed the influence of a bipartisan coalition of community and elected leaders to promote the initiative.\n\n“I’m confident because not only is it a big margin that we started out with, but as we went around to the different polling locations that our volunteers were at, we saw Republican, Democrat and Independent voters and heard back from them that they were voting yes,” Alfaro said.\n\nProgressive groups, including the organizations supporting Proposition 308, gathered at Xico Inc. in downtown Phoenix to watch the news as results are tabulated.\n\nAlfaro credited the work of undocumented students, also known as Dreamers, in helping get the word out, especially given the ballot's len\n\n“Our campaign tried to take every single opportunity to tell Arizona voters that this was on the ballot,” he said. “Because it was such a busy ballot with 10 ballot initiatives on there, even though most Arizonans agree, it was hard to get awareness out.”\n\n— Rafael Carranza\n\n9:20 p.m.: Early results on the 10 ballot measures\n\n8:30 p.m.: Congressional District 1: Hodge leading Schweikert in early results\n\nDemocrat Jevin Hodge led incumbent Republican David Schweikert in early ballot results released at 8 p.m. Tuesday.\n\n8:30 p.m.: Congressional District 2: O’Halleran and Crane nearly even in early results\n\nIncumbent Democrat Tom O’Halleran and Republican Eli Crane were neck and neck in early results posted Tuesday evening, with Crane just slightly ahead.\n\n8:30 p.m.: Congressional District 3: Gallego leading over Zink\n\nIncumbent Democrat Ruben Gallego had a sizable lead over Republican challenger Jeff Zink, per early ballot results posted Tuesday at 8 p.m.\n\n8:30 p.m.: Congressional District 4: Stanton leading Cooper\n\nIncumbent Democrat Greg Stanton was well ahead of Republican Kelly Cooper in early ballot results released Tuesday evening.\n\n8:30 p.m.: Congressional District 5: Biggs and Ramos in close race\n\nIncumbent Republican Andy Biggs had a slight lead on Democrat Javier Ramos in the first batch of results released Tuesday evening. Independent Clint Smith trailed.\n\n8:30 p.m.: Congressional District 6: Close race between Ciscomani and Engel\n\nRepublican Juan Ciscomani and Democrat Kirsten Engel were in a tight race, though few ballots were released in the first drop of results at 8 p.m.\n\n8:30 p.m.: Congressional District 7: Grijalva ahead over Pozzolo\n\nIncumbent Democrat Raul Grijalva had a sizable lead over Republican Luis Pozzolo in early results released by the state at 8 p.m.\n\n8:30 p.m.: Lesko wins reelection in 8th Congressional District\n\nIncumbent Rep. Debbie Lesko won reelection in Arizona’s 8th Congressional District. Lesko, R-Ariz., ran unopposed in the general election.\n\n8:30 p.m.: Gosar wins reelection in 9th Congressional District\n\nIncumbent Rep. Paul Gosar won reelection in Arizona’s 9th Congressional District. Gosar, R-Ariz., ran unopposed in the general election.\n\n8 p.m.: Kelly leading Masters for U.S. Senate seat in early results\n\nSen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., was ahead over Republican challenger for U.S. Senate Blake Masters in the first drop of results released by the state shortly after 8 p.m. Tuesday.\n\nThe race had tightened in recent weeks and was expected to be very close.\n\n8 p.m.: Adrian Fontes ahead early over Mark Finchem for secretary of state\n\nDemocrat Adrian Fontes led Republican Mark Finchem in their contest for secretary of state, per first results.\n\nThe race has pitted Fontes, who oversaw the 2020 presidential election as Maricopa County recorder, against Finchem, a four-term state lawmaker and arguably the loudest election denier in the state.\n\nThe winner would also be next in line to succeed the governor if that office is vacated for any reason.\n\n8 p.m.: Democrat Kris Mayes leading in early results over Abe Hamadeh for attorney general\n\nFirst ballots showed Democrat Kris Mayes led Republican Abe Hamadeh in their contest to become Arizona's next attorney general.\n\nMayes, a former member of the Arizona Corporation Commission, and Hamadeh, a former prosecutor at the Maricopa County Attorney's Office, have hit each other with tough rhetoric on social media and at campaign events in a heated race where abortion and election integrity were top issues.\n\n8 p.m.: Julie Gunnigle leading Rachel Mitchell for Maricopa County attorney in early results\n\nDemocrat Julie Gunnigle led Maricopa County Attorney Rachel Mitchell in their race to lead the prosecutorial agency, according to first ballots.\n\nMitchell, a Republican and longtime agency employee, was appointed to fill the position in April. Gunnigle, a reform-minded Democrat, ran as an outsider and critic of the agency.\n\n8 p.m.: Yee ahead over Quezada in treasurer’s race early results\n\nKimberly Yee, the incumbent treasurer and a former state lawmaker, was ahead in early results over Democrat Martín Quezada, a state senator.\n\nYee was seeking another four years in office. She was the first Asian American candidate to win statewide office in Arizona when she was elected in 2018. Quezada has said he ran to improve a statewide office that is too often used as a stepping stone for politicians.\n\n8 p.m.: Kathy Hoffman leading in bid for reelection as schools superintendent per initial results\n\nIncumbent Democrat Kathy Hoffman was leading in early results over Republican challenger Tom Horne for superintendent of public instruction.\n\nHoffman was running for a second term and Horne was seeking what would be his third term as state superintendent.\n\n8 p.m.: Kennedy and Kuby leading in early results for Arizona Corporation Commission\n\nDemocrats Sandra Kennedy and Lauren Kuby held narrow leads over Republicans Kevin Thompson and Nick Myers in the race to fill two seats on the Arizona Corporation Commission, the body that decides things like rate hikes for electric, water and gas utilities.\n\nKennedy was the only incumbent on the ballot for the commission.\n\n7:50 p.m.: GOP strategy to vote more on Election Day stressed system\n\nRepublican suspicions about mail-in ballots meant many GOP voters waited for Election Day to vote. It was a strategy pushed by party leaders and one that always carries some risk.\n\nOn Tuesday, that risk materialized with glitches and long lines.\n\nBadly printed ballots affected about 60 voting centers in Maricopa County, roughly 30% of the total. Voters whose ballots weren’t accepted by machines were told to place their ballots in a secure ballot box labeled “door 3” to be counted later or go to a different voting location.\n\nSome people in metro Phoenix waited in line for a half-hour or more, too.\n\nNo one’s vote was disenfranchised because of the issues, county officials said. But hiccups at the polls were just another example of why voting by mail is better, said Chuck Coughlin, a Republican political consultant.\n\n“That is the problem, you tell people to wait for Election Day, you put a lot of stress on mechanical machines — and machines break,” Coughlin said. “Maybe people will vote by mail next time.”\n\nMost people already do, even Republicans. But this election cycle, far more Democrats voted early than Republicans. Democratic strategist Sam Almy noted on Twitter after 5 p.m. that of ballots returned on Tuesday, Republicans outnumbered Democrats 3.5 to 1.\n\nRepublican political consultant Constantin Querard said that because his job is to make sure his candidates win, “I like knowing my votes are already nice and warm, all safe in the ballot box — hopefully, days ahead of the election.”\n\nSnow or rain can also be a problem for someone who waited until Election Day to vote, though not so much in Arizona, Querard said.\n\n— Ray Stern\n\n7:35 p.m.: New translation options for Hopi speakers on reservation\n\nHopi-speaking voters casting ballots on the Hopi reservation had several options for voting in their tribal language on Tuesday.\n\nThey could use earphones to hear voting instructions and choices in Hopi or use a touchscreen to read the same information in Hopi.\n\n“I am going to vote in person just so I can hear it,” Hopi Elections Registrar Karen Shupla said. “It’s exciting that we’re up to time on the machines.”\n\nIn addition, this is the first year that Hopi translators were hired to work the polls on the Hopi reservation, Shupla said.\n\nMaxine Wadsworth was hired by Navajo County to ensure that all Hopi language speakers were accommodated at the polls. She said that a Hopi language speaker was available at each polling site on Hopi land to accommodate Hopi language speakers.\n\n“The voters are amazed, and now they can vote on the propositions that they had trouble understanding,” she said. “For so long, the Hopi voters felt left out of the loop on language issues. It’s exciting that they can vote in a way that any Hopi voter can understand.”\n\n— Stan Bindell, reporting supported by the Pulitzer Center\n\n7:20 p.m.: Polls close across Arizona\n\nPolls closed at 7 p.m. for the Arizona general election.\n\nA last-minute hearing wrapped up just before 7 p.m. with a Maricopa County judge denying a Republican request to extend voting hours in the county by three hours because of issues at some polling places.\n\nMaricopa County Superior Court Judge Tim Ryan rejected arguments that voters were denied the right to cast ballots due to glitches with equipment at 30% of voting centers.\n\n\"The court doesn't have any evidence that any voter was precluded from their right to vote,\" Ryan said during a hearing.\n\nVoters who were in line by 7 p.m. can still cast their ballots.\n\nThe first results were expected to be available just after 8 p.m., with updates throughout the evening and into the coming days. Full election results may not be available for several days. Early results can flip as later votes are counted. The preferences of early voters, in-person Election Day voters and those who drop off their ballots at the polls all could differ.\n\nFollow along on this page for live updates on key races, and see all results at this link.\n\n— Alison Steinbach and Robert Anglen\n\n6:55 p.m.: Hearing underway for GOP request to extend voting hours\n\nA hearing is underway in Maricopa County Superior Court for the Republican committee and candidates seeking to extend polling hours to 10 p.m. Without legal action, the polls are scheduled to close at 7 p.m.\n\nThe Republican National Committee and others filed a lawsuit shortly after 5 p.m. Tuesday calling for polls to stay open for three extra hours in Maricopa County, alleging that problems at polling stations across the county prevented some voters from casting their ballots.\n\nIn addition to the RNC, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, U.S. Senate candidate Blake Masters and gubernatorial hopeful Kari Lake were listed as plaintiffs.\n\n— Alison Steinbach\n\n6:45 p.m.: Steady flow of voters at Brophy Prep\n\nThe flow of voters trickled slowly in and out of the polling site at Brophy Prep in Phoenix on Tuesday evening.\n\nA volunteer at the polling site said they had not had any issues so far, and staff was expecting more voters as the workday ended.\n\nThe volunteer said the votes cast at Brophy seemed closely split between those filling their ballots out in person at the site and those dropping off their early ballots.\n\nRafael Lores Cabrera from Phoenix said he voted for Republican candidates because he’s unhappy with the state of the economy.\n\n“The high prices, insecurity, the border is in chaos. The high prices with inflation, gas, food, there had to be a change,” he said.\n\nStaci Ryder, an independent voter from Phoenix, said her top issue was abortion rights and said she cast her ballot for Democratic candidates.\n\n“A couple years ago, we kind of flipped our state a little bit. We became a purple state, and I am hopeful that we can keep that progression going,” she said.\n\n— Rafael Carranza\n\n6:25 p.m.: Tucson voter says No. 1 issue is faith in election process\n\nTucson voters cast their ballots as part of a constant flow of people at Donna R. Liggins Recreation Center.\n\nPoll inspector Carolyn Eisner said Pima County voting was running smoothly. She has been working at the polls for 20 years and said preparation among her team for this election was not different than previous elections. She said she and her team felt safe going into this election.\n\nEisner said voting is easier since the county switched to a central voting station model during the last election. In this model, anyone can vote anywhere. Voters have their IDs scanned, then poll workers verify their information and give them their ballots.\n\nMolly Armstrong, a University of Arizona student, said she was a first-time voter and thought the process went smoothly, with no wait in line. Armstrong said she came out to vote “to have my voice heard.”\n\nAsha Grey Eyes, an intern at the State Historic Preservation Office, said she felt the voting process was secure. She said she was concerned that so many people who don’t trust the election process got on the ballot.\n\n“The number one issue is making sure people who don’t take our election process seriously, specifically anyone affiliated with Trump,” are not elected, she said.\n\nIt’s “not cool to fearmonger in hopes that will get them in seats of power,” she said.\n\n— Sarah Lapidus\n\n6 p.m.: Views diverge among Mesa, Glendale voters\n\nSome voters on Tuesday said they weren’t particularly passionate about any candidates, but were just happy to exercise their right to vote.\n\n“Regardless of how it comes out, we’re glad to see the line and the turnout,” said 57-year-old Shellie Snow of Queen Creek, who voted with her husband at the ASU Polytechnic Campus in Mesa.\n\nThe polling place had moderate wait times but no other issues.\n\nMichelle Francis, a 44-year-old Gilbert resident, said she voted for Democrats Katie Hobbs for governor and Mark Kelly for U.S. Senate.\n\n“I just think they’re more sensible,” she said.\n\nMesa resident Rob Rucker disagreed. He said he has faith in Republicans Kari Lake and Blake Masters.\n\n“They have key information needed to focus on the state of Arizona,” the 54-year-old said.\n\nDavid Schrimpf, a 38-year-old customer service manager, said he used to vote Republican but was voting “100%” for Democrats today. He was most focused on abortion rights, inflation, climate change and election deniers, he said.\n\n“I’m fearing that Lake is going to win, but I’m keeping my fingers crossed,” he said.\n\nIn Glendale, voters at the Mission and Ministry Center saw mild wait times Tuesday afternoon.\n\nJon Landavaso, a health care worker from Glendale, said he is most concerned with high inflation and taxes. He said he hopes his vote matters and he “prays to God that we can have someone that will actually make a difference.”\n\nLandavaso, who cast his vote after about 30 minutes in line, said the machine “jammed up” when he submitted his ballot and needed a worker to intercede. “That was pretty sketchy to me,” he said.\n\nAndrew Ruelas, also of Glendale, brought his wife to the polling station so she could vote for the first time. Ruelas, who waited in the parking lot, said the past few years showed him that “state government is more important than we thought it was.”\n\nRuelas said many people lost their jobs during COVID-19 and that “unprecedented mistakes” were made.\n\n— Juliette Rihl and Eryka Forquer\n\n5:45 p.m.: Native voters cast ballots at Salt River\n\nA steady stream of voters came to Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community's polling place at the tribe's recreation center to vote, drop off early ballots or just visit and pick up swag like T-shirts and mugs.\n\nBut not everything was happy inside. At least one tabulation machine had problems, with at least one voter having to submit their ballot three times before it was accepted.\n\nSalt River Councilwoman Diane Enos, an attorney who volunteers frequently with Arizona Native Vote Election Protection Project, said the group had received calls about problems with the tabulation from across the Phoenix metro area. In some cases, she said, voters' ballots were \"spoiled,\" a process where poll workers place a special mark on a ballot as invalid if it is damaged or otherwise unusable. The voter is given another fresh ballot to mark again.\n\n\"I saw one person vote but who couldn't get it into the machine,\" she said.\n\nEnos also advised voters dropping off early ballots to sign and date the envelope so poll workers would know the ballot was received on Election Day.\n\nDie’dre Goodluck, a Navajo who lives nearby, said she always votes.\n\n“It’s important for us to do our civic duty because our grandparents weren’t able to,” she said.\n\nGoodluck said she voted a straight Democratic ticket. \"It's important to make sure we have judicial and representatives who have the best interests of tribes in mind,\" she said.\n\nSalt River Vice President Ricardo Leonard dropped off his early ballot along with Dustin Burke, a tribal member.\n\nLeonard said the current political climate could be attributed to giving extremist groups, like white supremacists, a break.\n\n\"When you have politicians who support these groups, you're opening the door,\" he said. The current Republican Party isn't the same as when it concentrated on fiscal responsibility and other such issues, he said.\n\n\"But when you have a great number of people who say the election was rigged, it's hard to get past that,\" Leonard said. \"It's a scary thing, especially for Natives.\"\n\n— Debra Krol\n\n5:25 p.m.: Republicans want to extend voting hours in Maricopa County\n\nThe Republican National Committee and others filed a lawsuit Tuesday evening calling for polls to stay open for three extra hours in Maricopa County.\n\nThe suit, filed just after 5 p.m., seeks an emergency ruling from a judge and alleges that problems at polling stations across the county prevented some voters from casting their ballots.\n\n“At least 36% of all voting centers across Maricopa County have been afflicted with pervasive and systemic malfunctions of ballot tabulation devices and printers, which has burdened voters with excessive delays and long lines,” according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe suit was filed against the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors and the county recorder.\n\nBoard of Supervisors Chair Bill Gates said Monday it would take a court order to extend hours.\n\n\"The only way that this county would extend the voting hours beyond those who arrive at 7 p.m. is from a court order. Period,” he said.\n\nRNC lawyer Kory Langhofer said Tuesday the party wants to ensure voters have a chance to vote.\n\n“We want to make sure our voters’ rights are protected,” he said.\n\nIn addition to the RNC, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, U.S. Senate candidate Blake Masters and gubernatorial hopeful Kari Lake were listed as plaintiffs.\n\n— Robert Anglen and Alison Steinbach\n\n5 p.m.: One voter wants to ‘take us back’; another motivated by TikTok\n\nClara Tedrick voted in person early Tuesday morning at the Surprise Senior Center.\n\n\"Voting is extremely important to help make any changes and to speak our voice and exercise our right,\" she said, adding that changes must start from the bottom.\n\n\"I'm a firm believer that you can't sit here and complain about problems if you don't do your due diligence to try to help make changes,\" she said.\n\nTedrick, who said she’s a “self-declared lesbian,” is particularly concerned about issues that affect women's rights.\n\nAt Worship & Word in Peoria, some voters said morning voting was delayed by faulty tabulators, which a poll worker said had been working intermittently.\n\nKathleen Hebert, a Sun City resident who is a realtor and investor, said she did extremely thorough research before dropping off her ballot, taking more time to vote than she had in the past.\n\n\"There's just too many radical people trying to change our children's minds, and Kari Lake's going to take us there — take us back to where we were,\" Hebert said.\n\nRon LaPlante, a 55-year-old construction worker, said content on TikTok motivated him to vote in person on Tuesday.\n\nHe said he’s been voting by mail his whole life, but decided to vote in person for the first time after watching a TikTok video. He said the video showed a person who went to vote, only to discover that someone else had cast their ballot.\n\n\"It could have been a little smoother,\" said LaPlante. He said the process took about 30 minutes. LaPlante said he’s curious why Powerball results are available within a few hours, yet there were issues with voting tabulators.\n\nLaPlante said he put his ballot in several different machines before it registered.\n\nLaPlante said he's most interested in following the governor's race. He voted for Kari Lake.\n\n\"She seems to want to bring the truth,\" said LaPlante.\n\n— Alexandra Hardle\n\n4:30 p.m.: Phoenix, Scottsdale voters explain their choices\n\nLisa Sandoval and Rosita Salway cast their ballots at Academies at South Mountain in south Phoenix early Tuesday.\n\n“The most important vote we cast today was just to maintain our democracy,” said Sandoval, who works in medical administration.\n\n“I do have concerns regarding Kari Lake,” Sandoval said. “I don’t have a problem with a candidate being conservative or liberal. To me, it’s never about whether they’re a Republican or Democrat.” It's about their “core values,\" she said.\n\nSalway and Sandoval said they showed up for propositions on the ballot as well, especially to vote against the propositions that aim to change ballot initiative rules. Sandoval said that Proposition 129 specifically was \"a bit concerning if it passes.\"\n\nSandoval has seen firsthand the problems with the rising cost of health care, she said. She said she voted yes for Proposition 209, which would limit interest rates on medical debt and increase property protections for debt collection.\n\nSandoval was both surprised and happy that medical debt was on the ballot, she said.\n\n“Medical debt is so massive for people, especially when you’re dealing with long-term care or chronic illness or terminal illness,” she said. “Not only are you fighting for your life, but you end up fighting for your home or your stability because it can be absolutely crippling.”\n\nLarry Dillie, 76, voted in person at the Islamic Center in Scottsdale on Tuesday. He said his top issues were inflation, crime and the border.\n\nDillie said he felt the election was very secure, but only because he waited to fill out his ballot in person. He said he doesn’t like voting by mail.\n\nHeather Pratt also voted at the Islamic Center polling place and said it was “just very stressful,” as machines were acting up.\n\n“And they pulled apart the machines in front of me and made it sound like everybody's ballot wasn't being taken,” Pratt said.\n\n— Madeleine Parrish and Emily Sacia\n\n4:10 p.m.: Trump urges Arizonans to stay in line\n\nFormer President Donald Trump posted a video message to Truth Social at 3 p.m. on Tuesday urging Arizona voters to stay in line at the polls, despite any issues with tabulators or long wait times.\n\nTruth Social is a social media platform created by Trump Media & Technology Group.\n\n“To the great people of Arizona — Maricopa County, in particular — don’t leave your line. Stay where you are,” Trump said.\n\nThe sentiments echo what GOP candidates in Arizona told their supporters: vote in person and don’t leave long lines.\n\n“They say that the machines aren’t working, they say that they’re running out of paper in different locations throughout different states,” Trump said. “There’s a lot of bad things going on. Stay on line, do not leave.”\n\n“Already, a lot of people have left and it’s very, very unfair what’s going on. Maricopa County, don’t leave. Stay there.”\n\n— Lillian Boyd\n\n3:50 p.m.: Passing out pizza to student voters in Tempe\n\nAt Escalante Community Center in Tempe, voters were split on both the candidates and the priority issues. Several voters said abortion rights, the economy and water conservation were top of mind as they cast their ballots.\n\nBrothers Thomas and Steven Womack said inflation and border security were the most important issues to them. They both voted for Kari Lake for governor.\n\n“I think she focuses on issues really well,” said Steven Womack, 60.\n\nSoftware engineer Saif Azharuddin said he was motivated to vote because not enough young people do.\n\n“I feel like most younger people are too online, and I don’t want to be part of the problem,” the 25-year-old said. He’s passionate about school funding, water conservation and lowering medical debt, and said he mostly voted for Democrats.\n\nElsewhere in Tempe, students at Arizona State University waited around 40 minutes to cast their vote on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe line at the polling site, located in a gymnasium at the fitness center, moved slowly as it stretched around the building.\n\nJacob Eslick, a 22-year-old senior at ASU, said he did not encounter any issues in the voting process. He said he was motivated to vote by abortion rights, casting ballots for pro-choice candidates.\n\n“When it comes to actual rights to people, I think that everyone should have a right to choose. I feel abortion was like the main issue, so just wanted to make sure women have that right,” he said.\n\nDozens of volunteers canvassing for candidates and propositions walked up and down the line to talk to voters, some even handing out pizza to people waiting in line.\n\n— Juliette Rihl and Rafael Carranza\n\n3:40 p.m.: Election denial group calls for protests\n\nAn election denial group is calling for dual rallies on Tuesday in Maricopa and Pima counties to protest voting machines.\n\nThe group, 2020 Is Nullified, issued a call on social media for supporters to gather at 8 p.m. outside the Maricopa County Tabulation and Election Center in Phoenix and at the Pima County Recorder’s Office in Tucson.\n\n“Stand in solidarity with fellow Americans to demand a hand count” of ballots, the group said.\n\nThe group maintains voting machines are not legal and have not been certified.\n\nElection officials say the tabulation machines are certified by state and federal inspectors, which is required under the law.\n\n— Robert Anglen\n\n3:30 p.m.: Flagstaff voters say ballots have impact in battleground Arizona\n\nVoting across Flagstaff was proceeding smoothly on Tuesday.\n\nBrad Dorman, 44, turned out to cast a ballot because, in competitive battleground states like Arizona, voters have an opportunity to make a clear difference, he said.\n\n“States tend to have gone in one direction or stayed in one direction to where you may feel like, ‘Does it really count if I go in and vote?’” Dorman said. “In a battleground state, that’s where really the majority of the money is being poured.”\n\nWhile the midterms historically have a lower voter turnout than presidential election years, Damon pointed out that many of the issues represented on the 2022 ballot will have local effects.\n\n“I feel like it’s the local stuff and even state that has a more direct impact” on voters’ lives, he said.\n\nJim Ellis has lived in Flagstaff for 56 years and cast his ballot at Flagstaff High School on Tuesday afternoon, just down the street from his home.\n\n“So many things are at stake, primarily our democracy,” he said.\n\n“When you got people that are well-educated, and they’re denying that Biden is the president, you know something’s wrong,” Ellis said.\n\n— Lacey Latch\n\n3:15 p.m.: Maricopa County identifies tabulator issue\n\nMaricopa County has identified a solution to solve ongoing problems with tabulators at voting locations across the county, officials said.\n\nThe issues, which impacted about 60 polling places — 30% of sites — were related to timing marks on ballots.\n\nIn Maricopa County, printers at polling sites produce ballots on demand so that voters can vote at any location in the county, rather than being assigned a polling place. The formatting marks on the ballots produced by some printers weren’t printing dark enough for the tabulators to read, officials said.\n\nTechnological support staff have already resolved the issue at 17 locations, according to county officials.\n\n\"I am very sorry for any voter who has been frustrated or inconvenienced today in Maricopa County,\" Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer said in a statement. “Every legal vote will be tabulated. I promise.”\n\nRicher said per state statute, the county recorder is generally responsible for voter registration and early voting, and the county board of supervisors for emergency voting, Election Day and tabulation.\n\nVoters who are running into issues with tabulators can place their ballots in a secure ballot box labeled “drawer 3” to be counted or can go to a different voting location. Most locations are unaffected by tabulator issues, according to the county. Locations are listed at locations.maricopa.vote.\n\n— Sasha Hupka and Alison Steinbach\n\n3 p.m.: Voters report smooth process in Tucson\n\nJessie Jensen and Eric Rahn stopped to vote at the Sam Lena Public Library polling center in south Tucson because it was on their way home.\n\nVoting was “really easy,” Jensen said, adding that it was just nice to be able to vote anywhere.\n\n“Every vote is important. The world has gone crazy lately,” Jensen said. Jensen usually votes with a mail-in ballot, but she didn’t receive one this election, she said.\n\nRahn said women’s rights were an important issue for him during this election.\n\nA poll inspector at the site said other than printer jam issues, which are typical, things have been running smoothly.\n\nLuz Acosta said the voting process was quick, with no lines or issues. She said she felt the process was secure and was turning out because of many issues.\n\n“I’m a single mom,” she said. “It’s all important.”\n\n— Sarah Lapidus\n\n2:45 p.m.: Cybersecurity officials say still no threat to disrupt elections\n\nTwo senior U.S. cybersecurity officials said Tuesday afternoon that the Department of Homeland Security continues to see no specific or credible threat to disrupt election infrastructure or Election Day operations and that it remains vigilant to protect against foreign nation disinformation and malign influence operations.\n\nThe officials, both with DHS’ Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency or CISA, noted that there have been a few isolated issues arising from within the 8,800 or so individual election jurisdictions in the U.S., including Maricopa County. But they described them as nothing out of the ordinary and said CISA was in close touch with elected officials in Maricopa County and elsewhere across the country in order to understand and respond to any Election Day problems if needed.\n\nThe officials, both speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing cybersecurity operations, referred questions about Maricopa County to local officials there, who have released statements and a video explaining how the voting machinery works.\n\nOne of the CISA officials specifically cautioned against some efforts to politicize what appears to be a fairly routine technical glitch, saying Maricopa County voters should have confidence in their systems because they are fully transparent and open to bipartisan observers. Also, one of the officials said, Arizona has a process that uses paper ballots for all votes, so there will be opportunities to verify — and audit — them if necessary.\n\n— Josh Meyer, USA TODAY\n\n2:30 p.m.: Kari Lake casts vote in person\n\nRepublican candidate for governor Kari Lake went to vote at Phoenix’s downtown post office at noon on Tuesday with her husband, son and daughter.\n\nAfterward, she spoke to a throng of local, national and international press, alleging problems with ballot tabulators in conservative areas, prompting her to vote in “the heart of liberal Phoenix” instead of in Paradise Valley as she had planned.\n\nMaricopa County has not released a list of locations with issues, saying that about 20% of over 220 voting locations were impacted.\n\n“We have had problems after problems,” Lake told reporters. “And there's a reason we decided to change locations.\"\n\nLake has made election reforms a key part of her campaign platform, including false claims that Donald Trump won the state in 2020. She has refused to say if she’d accept a loss, telling ABC News in October she would do so if the election was “fair, honest and transparent.”\n\n“This is incompetency,\" Lake said Tuesday standing next to GOP lawyer Harmeet Dhillon, a Republican National Committee member from California who has represented Trump. Lake’s campaign brought on Dhillon last month.\n\n\"I hope it's not malice, but we're going to fix it,” Lake said. “We're going to win. And when we win there is going to be a come to Jesus for elections in Arizona.”\n\nAs Lake cast her vote, Democratic nominee for governor Katie Hobbs wrapped up visits to several polling locations in Tempe and Phoenix.

Rest assured: paper ballots are safe and secure, and your vote will be counted.\"\n\nThe issues were likely to delay vote counts in the 3rd and 12th Congressional District races, as well as local races.\n\n— Liam Quinn\n\n1:55 p.m.: Some Maricopa County polling locations reporting long lines\n\nSome Maricopa County polling locations were reporting wait times of more than 30 minutes as of early afternoon on Tuesday. Keep in mind that wait times are fluid and can change frequently throughout the day.\n\nAs of 1:45 p.m., the Outlets at Anthem had the longest wait time among county polling locations at 64 minutes followed by Mesa Community College at Red Mountain at 56 minutes. Asante Library in Surprise reported a 56-minute wait time.\n\nEarlier this week, Maricopa County officials said the busiest time at the polls is generally from 5 to 7 p.m.\n\nYou can check wait times on the county's website: https://elections.maricopa.gov/voting/where-to-vote.html.\n\n— Anne Ryman\n\n1:40 p.m. Political activist criticizes Maricopa County over machine glitches\n\nCharlie Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA, the influential Phoenix-based nonprofit aimed at engaging young conservatives, sent a Tweet to his 1.8 million followers calling for arrests related to election issues in Arizona’s most populous county.\n\n“People need to be arrested for what is happening in Maricopa County,” Kirk wrote at about 12:15 p.m. on Election Day. “It’s criminal.”\n\nAlthough the Tweet wasn’t specific about why Kirk thought arrests were warranted, it came amid a stream of Tweets about lines and machine glitches throughout metro Phoenix.\n\nKirk urged Republicans to vote in person, saying he did not trust the early voting mechanisms. He said that he expected the number of in-person voters to be “so immense they will not be able to do what they normally do, the kind of nonsense shenanigans.”\n\n— Richard Ruelas\n\n1:30 p.m.: Cochise County may appeal ruling on hand count\n\nA day after a judge shot down an attempt to hand count every Cochise County ballot in Tuesday's election, officials signaled they want to appeal.\n\nThe board of supervisors called an emergency meeting for Wednesday to consider hiring outside counsel Bryan Blehm to represent not only the three-person board, but also the county recorder and the elections director.\n\nSupervisor Peggy Judd said she was hoping to get support for an appeal, arguing, along with supervisor Tom Crosby, that their hand count plan was legal. A Pima County judge late Monday ruled it was not.\n\nJudd, a Republican, blamed the ruling on political bias.\n\n“Pima County is our most liberal county in Arizona,” she said in an email to The Arizona Republic. ”It was in our judge’s DNA to side with the plaintiff.”\n\n— Mary Jo Pitzl\n\n1:15 p.m.: On Tohono O’odham Nation, employees distribute shirts, more\n\nIn Sells, employees of the Tohono O’odham Nation’s Sells District Administration Office distributed T-shirts, water bottles, clip boards, storage containers and first aid kits to tribal members who voted Tuesday.\n\nThe employees set up a large white tent in the office parking lot.\n\nSells District Chairman Juan Buendia, 36, said the giveaways are a way to encourage voter participation among tribal members. Voter turnout was steady.\n\nThe text on the gray T-shirts said, “Our Voice — Our Vote, Since 1948.”\n\nSells is the Tohono O’odham nation’s capital.

Burchill responded to what she said was a rapid spread of misinformation online.\n\nShe said Tuesday afternoon that there were no issues with printers or voting machines. On Tuesday morning, she said a printer at a Chino Valley polling location was not working correctly, but the issue was solved in 30 minutes.\n\nThat didn’t stop social media messages saying that there were broken machines, bad printers, and people waiting “hours” with lines of over 200 people.\n\n“That wasn’t the case,” Burchill said, explaining that lines have been running smoothly — albeit slowly — all morning.\n\nShe asked that people remain calm and stay in line, and not get heated over waiting times: “They wanted to come out and vote in person today rather than take advantage of other opportunities. Just — please cut us a little slack.”\n\nDeputy County Recorder Karen McCracken said earlier Tuesday that ballots will be dropped off at the recorder's office by 8 p.m., but not to expect any initial results until late in the evening, likely after midnight.\n\n— Joseph Darius Jaafari\n\n12:45 p.m.: Voter reports being juggled between sites to cast ballot\n\nAt Madison Baptist Church in central Phoenix, Carol Harder said a tabulator wouldn’t count her ballot. They tried some 20 times before issuing her another ballot, which also couldn’t be counted, she said.\n\nShe was told to go to another location since this site couldn’t issue her a third ballot. At the next polling location, she was told the system showed she had counted. She returned to Madison Baptist Church where her only option was to file a provisional ballot.\n\n“Now I have to trust that part of the system. … I totally have no faith in this,” she said walking away.\n\nMaricopa County has reported technical issues with ballot tabulators at some 40 voting locations. Under typical circumstances, county voters fill out paper ballots and then insert their ballots into on-site tabulators.

But some have had issues with the spoil process as well.\n\nVoters who experienced issues with the tabulators at the Desert Christian Fellowship Church location decided to try again at the Beatitudes Campus, a retirement community.\n\n\"We have two ballots floating,\" Bill Mason said. \"We went over the Beatitudes — they're still showing we voted over here.

We’re doing what we can to get them back online,\" said Maricopa County Board of Supervisors Chairman Bill Gates during an impromptu news conference Tuesday morning.\n\nGates said the issues were not centered in one particular geographical area but were \"dispersed\" throughout the state's most populous county.\n\nMaricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer said the county has not experienced this particular issue with tabulators in previous elections.\n\nCounty officials are advising voters to place their ballots in a secure drop box called \"Door No. 3\" at the polling site if the tabulator is not working. Those ballots will remain secure and will be taken when voting ends after 7 p.m. and delivered by a bipartisan team to the county's election tabulation center.\n\nRicher said this is similar to the process used by other Arizona counties.\n\n\"Everyone is still getting to vote,\" Gates said. \"Nobody is being disenfranchised, and we’ve got redundancies in place.\"\n\nAt polling sites, Maricopa County voters fill out paper ballots and then insert their ballots into on-site tabulators.

That's what Jimmy R. Smith did when his ballot didn't scan.\n\n“I was informed that some of the votes aren’t being taken, and that you can go ahead and vote, and if it doesn’t, you can put it in a box and they’re going to come back and tabulate it later,” he said. “But you also have people sitting around, waiting, because they want to make sure that their vote is tabulated.”\n\nOthers chose not to leave their ballot in the ballot box.\n\nJosh Erb said he plans to come back to the same site later this afternoon once he gets off work.\n\nHe also chose not to attempt to use the tabulators once he heard they were having problems. “They said that we can slide it in the machine, but I don’t want to risk it. If it’s not working, I’m not going to place my vote,” Erb said.\n\n— Madeleine Parrish\n\n9 a.m.: Maricopa County now says 20% voting locations having issues\n\nMaricopa County Elections officials say 20% of the county's voting locations are experiencing issues as of Tuesday morning.

Elections Department spokesperson Megan Gilbertson said poll workers are best equipped to help voters ensure their ballot is successfully cast.\n\n“It’s important for voters to talk to the poll workers on site,” Gilbertson said.\n\nOfficials confirmed the issues were with the on-site tabulators.\n\nAs of 8 a.m. Tuesday, nearly 30,000 Maricopa County voters had cast a ballot, Gilbertson said.\n\n— Sasha Hupka\n\n8 a.m.: Pinal County reports no problems at polling sites\n\nMonths after a disastrous primary election, Pinal County polling sites opened without a hitch on Election Day.\n\nCounty spokesperson James Daniels said officials received just nine calls within the first few hours of voting, compared with hundreds each hour in August, when the county ran out of ballots at one-quarter of its voting locations.\n\nAll of Tuesday’s calls were related to general requests for voter information, such as polling locations, Daniels said.\n\n“They are just voter-type questions, which is what the contact center should be for,” he said.\n\n— Sasha Hupka\n\n7:20 a.m.: Rural voting site reports steady stream of voters\n\nAt the voting site north of Prescott in Williamson Valley, a fire and medical building was already bustling by 6 a.m. as a line formed outside.\n\nOutside the 75-foot perimeter, where campaigners and activists can stand, a large red tent was propped up with signs supporting Senate candidate Blake Masters, while others stood outside holding signs to raise money for a proposition to raise firemen’s budgets.\n\nBy 6:30, poll workers were tending to about 20 people — which, for this area, is a lot, said Dawn Casey, the inspector at the poll site. “I’ve been here when 10 people show up,” adding that this year’s election feels different.\n\n“This is a very rural area, lots of cowboys and farmers,” she said. “But we’re seeing a good turnout so far.”\n\n— Joseph Darius Jaafari\n\n7 a.m.: Burton Barr Library tabulator machine back online\n\nMaricopa County officials said Burton Barr Library is only doing drop-off ballots as of 6 a.m. after there were issues with a ballot tabulator machine.

Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nIn a phone interview with CNN, Fitton would neither confirm nor deny conversations he’s had with Trump, but noted that he has been vocal on social media and television that Trump had the right to keep the documents he took with him at the end of his presidency because they inherently were personal.\n\nTrump’s interactions with Fitton shed new light on his evolving— and often conflicting— posture toward the Archives dating back to before he even left office and his recent reluctance to hand over more documents after initially giving up the 15 boxes in January. While he was in contact with Fitton behind the scenes, Trump continued to claim publicly that he was cooperating with government officials.\n\nTrump didn’t completely stonewall the government as Fitton had advised, turning over some material in June following a meeting between his lawyers and federal investigators at Mar-a-Lago. But after a Trump lawyer claimed all classified material had been provided, investigators developed evidence suggesting that was not the case, leading to the August 8 search.\n\nA similar dissonance has emerged between Trump’s private and public response to the FBI’s search of his Mar-a-Lago resort.\n\nPublicly, Trump and his allies have celebrated the surge in enthusiasm and fundraising among Republicans — with the former President painting himself as a victim of the “deep state.” Some in Trump’s orbit have even gone so far as to indicate that a potential indictment would give Trump a political boost as he mulls another presidential run.\n\nBut privately, the former President and his allies have become increasingly concerned. One source close to the former President told CNN that Trump has posed questions about a potential indictment to members of his inner circle. Another adviser acknowledged that while Trump has certainly been in legal peril before, including while he was president, this seems different and potentially more dangerous, particularly because the former President no longer has the legal protections afforded to the executive office.\n\nA spokesperson for Trump did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nThe actions of Trump’s legal team since the FBI’s search – including a legal filing seeking a “special master” that a judge found problematic and told the team to clarify by Friday – have only fueled questions about Trump’s strategy as his legal woes have multiplied.\n\nTrump’s team seems to be primarily concerned with the public relations fight – and Trump’s political prospects. While Trump has publicly called for the release of the affidavit justifying the search of his residence, his lawyers have yet to take any legal action to seek its disclosure.\n\nMeanwhile, Fitton’s conservative Judicial Watch, which frequently uses litigation to try to pry loose government activity and records, has filed to unseal the affidavit. So has CNN, along with other news outlets, including The Washington Post, NBC News, and Scripps.\n\nFedExing Kim Jong Un’s letters\n\nWhen federal agents arrived at Trump’s oceanfront estate on August 8, more than a year had passed since Archives officials first began asking representatives of the former President to return various materials that were removed from the White House and taken to Mar-a-Lago.\n\nAmong them had been Trump’s correspondence with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un in June 2019, in Panmunjom, Korea. BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAt one point during the protracted negotiations, a senior Archives official instructed Scott Gast, a former lawyer in Trump’s White House counsel’s office who had been appointed to coordinate with the National Archives, to send the letters using FedEx’s overnight service.\n\n“Please let me know before you mail it and then pass along the tracking code once it has been sent. I need to make sure I have staff on this end to receive the package,” the official wrote to Gast and others in a June 2021 email obtained by CNN.\n\nIn the end, it took seven months for the Archives to finally receive the Kim letters. They were contained in the 15 boxes that Trump aides allowed Archives officials to arrange for pick up from Mar-a-Lago earlier this year, which contained 700 pages of classified documents, according to the Archives.\n\nSources close to the former President said his willingness to cooperate with Archives and, eventually, federal investigators broke down further once Fitton became a familiar voice inside his orbit.\n\nFitton told Trump that he had case law on his side due to Fitton’s own failed effort a decade ago to gain access to certain records from former President Bill Clinton’s time in office. In 2012, Judicial Watch sued to require the Archives to designate as presidential records audio recordings then-President Clinton made with a historian named Taylor Branch. Doing so would make them subject to Freedom of Information Act requests.\n\nThe suit was eventually dismissed by a judge, who wrote that NARA “does not have the authority to designate materials as ‘presidential records’” and “lacks any right, duty or means to seize control of them.”\n\nEven though the Clinton case did not involve classified records, Fitton, nevertheless, believes his case proves Trump has the right to keep his records.\n\n“I have been quite clear that President Trump is being abused here and the Justice Department has changed its position that they had in the Clinton case,” Fitton told CNN. After the 15 boxes were returned, “I noted at the time that it was at odds with the position of the Justice Department in the Clinton-Taylor Branch case.”\n\nLegal concerns\n\nEven people close to the former President have begun to privately question the competence of the legal team around him, particularly Christina Bobb, the former One America News Network TV host who has become one of the faces of Trump’s legal team in the aftermath of the Mar-a-Lago search.\n\nIn her recent appearances across conservative media, Bobb has propagated a litany of conspiracy theories about the Mar-a-Lago search, including the baseless allegation that the FBI planted evidence while on Trump’s property.\n\nThe One America News Network Weekly Briefing with Christina Bobb Gabby Jones/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nBobb previously assisted Rudy Giuliani’s behind-the-scenes efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. She signed the warrant receipts after the FBI searched Mar-a-Lago.\n\nBobb did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nLast week, Fox News host Laura Ingraham, who has been a vocal supporter of Trump on her program, pushed back on Bobb over the decision by Trump’s legal team not to file or join any motions related to the release of the federal affidavit filed to justify the search warrant.\n\n“Are you not concerned that because you didn’t join any of these motions for the full release of this affidavit that you are then waiving possible objections to the way redactions are being done by the Justice Department later on?” Ingraham asked Bobb.\n\nBobb replied that the team was going to wait and see what happened with the unsealing of the affidavit.\n\nIt took two weeks before Trump’s lawyers formally waded into the legal fight over the search warrant. And when they finally did on Monday, their motion had numerous legal flaws and drew criticism from legal experts on both sides of the aisle. The motion was filed in a separate case, putting it before a different judge than Florida Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart, who approved the search warrant. That judge, District Court Judge Aileen Cannon, gave Trump’s legal team until Friday to refine its legal arguments as part of its request for a “special master” — a third party attorney — to oversee the review of evidence obtained during the search.\n\nWhile Trump’s legal team has not filed any motions to unseal the affidavit, Trump and his legal team have argued publicly that it should be released.\n\nOn Thursday, Reinhart ruled that the Justice Department must release a redacted version of the affidavit by noon on Friday.\n\nAnother lawyer representing Trump, Alina Habba, suggested in a TV appearance Tuesday that the former President wants the DOJ to release the names of the witnesses who helped secure the search warrant for Mar-a-Lago, which would be contained in the affidavit and which government attorneys have argued could chill future witness cooperation.\n\n“The president’s position is the same as what I would advise him, which is to ask (the DOJ) to uncover everything so we can see what’s going on. I understand the witness protection issue, but at the same time, these witnesses are truly not going to be concealed for very long,” Habba said on conservative network Newsmax. “That’s just not the nature of the DOJ and the FBI, and unfortunately in our country there’s always leaks.”\n\nIn addition to Bobb and Habba, Trump is being represented by Evan Corcoran, an attorney who has also represented former Trump aide Steven Bannon, and Florida-based attorney Lindsey Halligan, whose background is in insurance litigation. Trump has also retained Jim Trusty, a former assistant US attorney and Justice Department prosecutor, who is widely seen in his orbit as the most capable among his team.\n\nAs they’ve sought to undercut the federal probe, Trump’s team and his allies have put forward additional theories that quickly wilted under scrutiny.\n\nJohn Solomon, a conservative writer and one of Trump’s designees to the Archives, read a statement from Trump’s team claiming Trump had a “standing order” to declassify documents he took from the Oval Office to the White House residence – something 18 former administration officials told CNN was patently untrue. Others have suggested the General Services Administration, a small government agency that helps with the presidential transition, was responsible for the documents that were sent to Mar-a-Lago.\n\nThe GSA said the responsibility for what is moved when a president leaves office rests entirely with the outgoing president and staff.\n\nTrump wants political fight not a legal one\n\nTrump’s advisers have made it clear they want this fight to be a political not legal battle.\n\nOn Monday night, Solomon published a letter sent by the National Archives to Trump’s legal team in May.\n\nThe letter stated clearly that the Archives had retrieved more than 100 classified documents totaling more than 700 pages, including some with the highest levels of classification.\n\n“It shows that Donald Trump and his team knew…they were in possession of large amounts of highly classified information,” said Elie Honig, a former Assistant US Attorney for the Southern District of New York and a CNN legal analyst. “This letter makes clear [Trump’s team] was delaying.”\n\nWhile many legal experts shared this sentiment and said the letter was damning to Trump, the former President seemed to believe the letter showcased a political win — claiming it proved that he was the victim of a “witch hunt.” Trump has pointed to the letter’s mention of the communications the Archives had with the Biden White House over privilege issues, after the White House counsel’s office was consulted over granting the FBI access to the boxes the Archives took from Mar-a-Lago. That was unrelated to the search warrant, however.\n\nTrump’s allies in conservative media have picked up on the narrative and amplified it. “The letter revealed that Joe Biden empowered the National Archives to waive any claims to executive privilege Trump might assert to block the DOJ from gaining access to the documents,” conservative personality Dan Bongino said on his program.\n\nTrump and his allies, however, have conflated the executive privilege questions over the documents Trump had handed over to the Archives with the FBI’s search warrant, which the Biden White House says it had no knowledge of.\n\nThe White House’s counsel’s office deferred the decision to the archivist, declining to weigh-in on whether the FBI should have been allowed to access the documents the Archives retrieved from Mar-a-Lago “given the political implications and optics,” said Bradley Moss, a Washington-based national security lawyer.\n\n“If anything, the Biden White House went out of its way to not get involved in whether or not this became a truly criminal matter,” Moss said.\n\nSome of Trump’s allies believe the former President is more secure than ever, at least politically speaking. In the days following the FBI search, Trump raised millions of dollars and saw an outpouring of support – including from his potential GOP rivals in a 2024 presidential primary.\n\n“Republican voters are looking at this [search] and saying if they can do this to him, they can do this to anyone,” one source close to Trump said. “It’s exactly where we want them to be.”", "authors": ["Gaborr Kristen Holmes Evan Perez Jeremy Herb", "Kristen Holmes", "Evan Perez", "Jeremy Herb"], "publish_date": "2022/08/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/columnists/mike-kelly/2022/03/03/state-of-the-union-2022-joe-biden-moderate/9349862002/", "title": "Joe Biden State of the Union: Will his tack to the center work?", "text": "Joe Biden downshifted the other night.

Maybe Biden has even started to listen to New Jersey Democrats like Rep. Josh Gottheimer and Rep. Mikie Sherrill, moderates who have tried to carve out places for themselves in former Republican bastions.\n\nBiden seems to want to be Biden again — the centrist who thinks of himself as the lynchpin to forging some measure of political cooperation from a federal system that seems drunk on the poison of tit-for-tat partisanship.\n\nOh beautiful, for spacious skies, can we all stop fighting?

He urged Congress to:\n\nimprove safety at nursing homes\n\ninvest in colleges\n\nraise the hourly minimum wage to $15\n\nextend the child tax credit program and\n\npass a law allowing workers to more easily unionize.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nNo surprises there.\n\nIt was also no surprise that Biden devoted a significant portion of his speech to tightening up the federal response to the COVID-19 pandemic. He called for more medicine, more tests and an end to “the shutdown of schools and businesses.”\n\n“It is time for America to get back to work and fill our great downtowns again with people,” Biden said. “People working from home can feel safe again and begin to return to our offices.”\n\nAgain, no surprise.\n\nThen came the shift.\n\n'Fund the police'\n\n“We cannot change how divided we have been,” Biden said. “It was a long time coming. We can change how to move forward on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together.”\n\nWith that, Biden launched into a segment in which he talked about crime. He began by describing his visit to New York City only days after the funerals of two police officers, Wilbert Mora and Jason Rivera, who had been gunned down while responding to a call at a home.\n\n“Like some of you, who have been around for a while, I have worked with you on these issues for a long time. I know what works,” Biden said, adding his workable formula: “Investing in crime prevention and community policing, cops who walk the beat, who know the neighborhood and who can restore trust and safety.”\n\nSo far, this seemed like just boilerplate rhetoric.\n\nBiden then turned up the pressure.\n\n“Let’s not abandon our streets or choose between safety and equal justice,” he said, noting that communities need to be protected and police need to be held accountable, especially in their dealings with Black Americans.\n\nBiden then drew the line — a clear rebuff to the progressive corner of the Democratic Party, which managed to turn the outrage over the murder of George Floyd in May 2020 into a national call to reconfigure police departments from top to bottom, cutting their budgets with calls to “defund the police” and replacing beat cops in some cases with social workers.\n\n“We should all agree the answer is not to defund the police. It is to fund the police. To fund them,” Biden declared. “Fund them with resources and training. Resources and training they need for — they need to protect our communities.”\n\nIn that brief moment, Biden shifted gears.\n\nHis message was clear: The Democratic Party should not be labeled as just another bunch of egghead progressives who think that social workers can stop gang warfare by “engaging” in “dialogue” with hustlers on the tough streets of Paterson and Newark.\n\nThe aftermath of Floyd’s death presented the party with a set of difficult choices. Across America — even in wealthy suburbs like Ridgewood, New Jersey — residents of all colors took to the streets to demand an end the wrongful killing of non-white suspects arrested by police. Even cops and other members of law enforcement marched.\n\nBut Democrats allowed the progressive wing of the party to seize the rhetorical edge with a call to “defund the police” — a throw-the-baby-out-with-the-bathwater approach that was impractical and insulting to anyone who has ever been the target of a crime.\n\nColumn continues below the gallery\n\nSmart Democrats knew such a proposal was ridiculous. But far too many smart Democrats went silent, fearing they would be targeted by progressives for not being \"woke\" enough.\n\nSuch silence and such demands nearly cost the Democrats control of the House of Representatives in 2020. Afterward, moderate Democrats, including Virginia’s Abigail Spanberger, made no secret of their criticism of progressives’ demands to “defund the police.” Like Gottheimer, Spanberger is a key figure in the House Problem Solvers Caucus, a coalition of Democrats and Republicans who aim to work together on practical legislation.\n\nIn a caucus meeting, Spanberger was especially angry, warning Democrats that the party would get “torn apart” in the 2022 elections if it did not renounce some of its progressive positions.\n\nBiden apparently heard this warning loud and clear — finally.\n\nAppeal to Republicans\n\nBiden went on to call for more cooperation with Republicans.\n\n“It is important for us to show the nation that we can come together and do big things,” he said, then “offering a unity agenda for the nation,” which he defined as “four big things we can do together, in my view.”\n\nThe president outlined four priorities:\n\nOpioids: First, Biden proposed that America should beat the opioid epidemic.\n\nFirst, Biden proposed that America should beat the opioid epidemic. Mental wellness: Then, the president proposed tackling mental health “especially among our children, whose lives and education have been turned upside down” by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThen, the president proposed tackling mental health “especially among our children, whose lives and education have been turned upside down” by the coronavirus pandemic. Veterans: Biden’s third “big thing” was a call to improve care for veterans. This was hardly a surprise. Biden believes the brain cancer that took the life of his son, Beau, can be traced to Beau’s deployment in Iraq near pits used to burn garbage and toxic materials. Sadly, this prompted Rep. Lauren Boebert, the outspoken Colorado Republican, to heckle Biden. But most Republicans and Democrats cheered the proposal to help veterans.\n\nBiden’s third “big thing” was a call to improve care for veterans. This was hardly a surprise.

Cancer: The same was true of Biden’s fourth proposal for bipartisan cooperation — to “end cancer as we know it.”\n\nAs with Biden’s call to fund police and not defund them, his four “big ideas” seemed thoughtful — another example of the rational, pragmatic Biden at work. But they also seemed like the political equivalent of a last-second shot in a March Madness college basketball game.\n\nYes, Joe Biden found his old moderate self.\n\nBut he seemed desperate.\n\nDemocrats, you should still prepare to get skunked in this November congressional elections.\n\nRemember to blame yourselves.\n\nMike Kelly is an award-winning columnist for NorthJersey.com.

The Animal Liberation Front, an animal rights group, has claimed that on Nov. 8 a member released 1,000 mink from a fur facility in Massillon, Ohio, about three hours east of Lion Farms, The Cincinnati Enquirer, part of the USA TODAY Network, reported.\n\nAuthorities told the Enquirer they have been checking in with nearby fur facilities since that claim was posted, but no farms in the area have reported missing mink.\n\nThe Animal Liberation Front did claim to have freed 150 to 200 of the animals in a September 2013 raid at a mink farm in Van Wert County, the Van Wert (Ohio) Times Bulletin reported Tuesday.\n\nCOVID and mink\n\nDuring the height of the coronavirus pandemic, there were concerns of coronavirus infections on mink farms in the U.S. Denmark killed all the millions of mink in the country's mink industry – they are raised for fur – after the virus spread from workers to mink and back to humans. (The Danish government had planned to end the industry in 2024 but accelerated the plan because of the pandemic.)\n\nAt the time, the Ohio Department of Agriculture said there had been no virus outbreaks in mink in the state, reported The Columbus Dispatch, part of the USA TODAY Network. It was unclear at the time how many mink farms existed in Ohio because the state agency does not regulate or track the farms.\n\nIn Michigan, two mink farm employees, along with a taxidermist and his wife, who contracted COVID-19 in 2021 probably were the first U.S. cases of animal-to-human COVID “spillover,” The Detroit Free Press, also part of the USA TODAY Network, reported this year.\n\nContributing: Victoria Moorwood, The Cincinnati Enquirer; Associated Press\n\nFollow Mike Snider on Twitter: @mikesnider.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/17/us/ohio-mink-released/index.html", "title": "Thousands of mink fled their cages when vandals broke into an Ohio ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThousands of mink were released from their cages at a northwestern Ohio farm in an overnight breaking and entering episode, authorities said Tuesday.\n\nBetween 25,000 and 40,000 mink were let loose after a suspect or suspects broke into the Lion Farms USA Mink Farm in Hoaglin Township, Ohio, and destroyed fencing, sending the animals out of their cages sometime overnight Monday into Tuesday, the Van Wert County Sheriff’s Office said in a news release.\n\nIn an update Tuesday afternoon, the sheriff’s office said many of the mink stayed on the farm and some were “corralled by employees,” so only an estimated 10,000 remained on the loose.\n\nMink are carnivorous mammals that primarily eat fresh kills, the sheriff’s office warned.\n\n“As a result, they can be a bothersome pest for homeowners, livestock owners, and property managers,” the sheriff’s office said. “(Mink) have proven to be especially costly and problematic for poultry ranchers as well as homeowners with ornamental ponds filled with koi and other fish.”\n\nThe sheriff’s office urged people not to approach the loose mink because they may bite.\n\n“These (mink) are considered domesticated animals/livestock.

Mickey Paulk posted the video on his Facebook page Tuesday night as authorities continued searching for him. It shows him stroking a rodent that he indicates was the same one seized during a search and then released by authorities. “You can’t give squirrels meth; it would kill ’em. I’m pretty sure, (but) I’ve never tried it,” he said. Paulk said the squirrel was safe and not a threat to anyone. “The public isn’t in danger in any kind of way from the methed-out squirrel in the neighborhood,” he said with a laugh. He also said Wednesday that he was working with an attorney and relatives on a plan for turning himself in to authorities. Paulk said he had “a few loose ends to tie up,” including getting the squirrel to a temporary home in Tennessee.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Federal marine biologists for the first time have recorded singing by one of the rarest whales on the planet, the North Pacific right whale. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration researchers used moored acoustic recorders to capture repeated patterns of calls made by male North Pacific right whales. It’s the first time right whale songs in any population have been documented, NOAA Fisheries marine biologist Jessica Crance says. She spoke to southern right whale and North Atlantic right whale experts to confirm that singing had not previously been documented. Researchers detected four distinct songs over eight years at five locations in the Bering Sea off Alaska’s southwest coast, Crance says. Only about 30 of the animals remain. Whalers nearly wiped out the slow-moving whales, which remain buoyant after they are killed.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: State test scores are improving, but only by a few percentage points. Early AzMERIT standardized test results show small increases in the percentage of students passing the test in most grade levels in reading and math. But the scores still show more than half the students in most categories, including in third-grade reading, aren’t passing the test. Arizona’s education leaders introduced AzMERIT, an attempt at a reinvigorated state standardized test, in 2015. Schools have a lot riding on test scores. School letter grades are largely decided by test scores, and high-achieving schools get extra funding under the results-based funding program. This is also the first year high schools were able to opt out of the AzMERIT test and choose a different assessment over AzMERIT, such as the ACT and SAT exams.\n\nArkansas\n\nMountain Home: Hickory Park will get a splash of color this weekend thanks to Care Center Ministries of Mountain Home. Volunteers with the ministry will meet at 9:30 a.m. Saturday at the downtown park to paint the pavilion, park benches, some of the playground equipment and sidewalks. Anyone is welcome to come lend a hand Saturday morning, pastor Ty Cotter said. “We’ll have extra gloves, glasses and paint. They just need to show up,” he said. On June 1, Care Center Ministries representatives and civic leaders gathered at Hickory Park for a ceremony where the nonprofit “adopted” the care and upkeep of the facility. Saturday’s event will be the official kickoff of Care Center Ministry’s park stewardship, but volunteers have already been inside the park performing some landscaping work.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Officials say someone climbed a more than two-story-tall Hollywood public art piece and stole a statue of Marilyn Monroe. The statue depicting Monroe in her iconic pose from the 1955 film “The Seven Year Itch” went missing early Monday from the “Four Ladies of Hollywood” gazebo. Los Angeles Councilman Mitch O’Farrell says a witness saw someone climb the gazebo on the Hollywood Walk Fame and saw off the statue. Los Angeles police say investigators have recovered fingerprints from the gazebo. The gazebo, erected in 1994, pays tribute to women in film, with depictions of Dolores Del Rio, Dorothy Dandridge, Mae West and Anna May Wong making up the structure’s pillars. Monroe, whose real name was Norma Jeane Mortenson, died in 1962.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A report indicates the Mile High City had the highest increase in the nation in its violent crime rate last year, but crime remains low compared with the most violent large U.S. cities. The Denver Post reports the city recorded 629 violent crimes per 100,000 residents, resulting in a 9% increase between 2017 and 2018. The report by the Brennan Center for Justice shows the rates of homicides, rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults in the 25 most populous U.S. cities dropped 4% on average last year. Denver Police Deputy Chief Barb Archer says the department didn’t find a specific cause driving the violence. The department says all categories of crime have declined or stayed level for first five months of 2019.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont has signed legislation that increases the minimum age to purchase cigarettes and other tobacco products to 21. The bill signed into law Tuesday by the Democrat also prohibits the sale of electronic cigarettes and vaping products to anyone under 21. The new law takes effect Oct. 1. Harold Wimmer, president and CEO of the American Lung Association, says such “Tobacco 21” laws are “more important than ever” given the increase in youth e-cigarette use. He says adolescents and young adults are uniquely vulnerable to the effects of nicotine and nicotine addiction, making Connecticut’s legislation “an important, life-saving measure.” The law also bans smoking on the grounds of child care centers and schools. Critics say it violates the rights of adults ages 18 to 21.\n\nDelaware\n\nBethany Beach: As thousands of people flock to Dover for Firefly Music Festival, one of the world’s rarest fireflies is battling for survival at beaches in the state. The Bethany Beach firefly, a rare species found in only seven unique habitats along Delaware’s southern coast, lost one this year to new residential construction, according to a local scientist who has studied the species. At that new development, beach houses are being built on million-dollar lots in a wetland that had been identified as home to the state’s most dense population of the fireflies. “Imagine if you start losing the species, but you still have a Firefly Festival. That connection is lost,” said Tara Cornelisse, a senior scientist at the Center for Biological Diversity. “I look to it as a beacon of hope, if we can protect it.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: District of Columbia lawmakers voted to add $47 million in excess reserves from the Washington Convention and Sports Authority to the city’s fiscal 2020 budget. The Washington Post reports $24 million will go toward fixing the city’s dilapidated public housing complexes. The rest will upgrade 911 dispatch centers. Tuesday’s approval came after a weeks­long dispute over whether the funds could be redirected from the reserve. The District’s chief financial officer, Jeffrey S. DeWitt, argued that using the funds would violate obligations to bondholders who invested in the convention center. He threatened not to certify the budget if the council redirected the money. However, a spokesman for DeWitt said the issue had been resolved Monday evening. Advocates said the money would cover renovating at least 400 units.\n\nFlorida\n\nHolmes Beach: Police trying to find the rightful owner of a prosthetic ear that washed up on their beach got a happy phone call from South Carolina on Thursday. Holmes Beach Police Sgt. Brian Hall said a woman called saying the rubber ear that police posted on Facebook belongs to her husband. Hall said the Beaufort couple was vacationing in the Tampa Bay area when the man went swimming. She said he was trying to put the ear in his pocket for safekeeping when “a wave knocked it off his hand.” The police department posted a photo of the left ear, saying a local resident found it in the sand Saturday after the “World’s Strongest Man” contest on Anna Maria Island. Prosthetic ears can cost thousands of dollars. Hall said the department will mail it to South Carolina. “We will put it in box. I hope nobody sees it and freaks out,” he said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state is shifting its presidential primary to late March, leaving the group of states that vote on Super Tuesday. The primary has been set for March 24, three weeks after Super Tuesday is held March 3, which Georgia has joined in past election cycles. The date announced Wednesday by Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger could relegate the state’s voters to a less influential position in deciding each party’s nominee. But it will also give state and county election officials a bit of breathing room in a tight timeline to replace the state’s outdated touchscreen voting machines. New touchscreen machines are in the process of being acquired, and a vendor has yet to be selected.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The U.S. Navy will christen a new guided missile destroyer, the USS Daniel Inouye, during a ceremony this weekend. U.S. Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii will speak at Saturday’s ceremony in Bath, Maine. Inouye’s widow, Irene Hirano Inouye, will be the ship’s sponsor. The Arleigh Burke-class ship is being named after the war hero and politician who broke racial barriers in Congress. Inouye represented Hawaii in the U.S. Senate for a half-century until his death in 2012. He played key roles in congressional investigations of the Watergate and Iran-Contra scandals and served as chairman of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee. He received the Medal of Honor for bravery in World War II with the mostly Japanese-American 442nd Regimental Combat Team. He lost his right arm.\n\nIdaho\n\nMoscow: The University of Idaho has ordered a student who owns a beverage company to stop using the name “Vandal Beer.” The Moscow-Pullman Daily News reports university officials sent the letter, citing trademark infringement, to Vandal Beer owner R. Austin Nielsen earlier this week. The school’s mascot is the Vandals. Nielsen announced plans last week for his company to start producing the gold pale ale in Coeur d’Alene next month, with plans to release it in north-central Idaho retail stores in August. Nielsen said he pitched the Vandal Beer idea to the University of Idaho a while ago, but school officials told him he wasn’t allowed to use the Vandal name. He said he came up with the idea while he was a student in the university’s Idaho Entrepreneurs program. Nielsen has said he will donate a portion of all Vandal Beer sales to University of Idaho scholarships.\n\nIllinois\n\nWauconda: A Civil War reenactment at a northeastern Illinois forest preserve is back on after the event was temporarily canceled by a county official over questions of its value, as well as the use of the Confederate flag. The (Waukegan) News-Sun reports Lake County Forest Preserves District President Angelo Kyle announced Wednesday that Civil War Days will still be held July 13-14 at Lakewood Forest Preserve in Wauconda. Kyle noted contractual obligations for the event that’s been held for 27 years and can draw up to 3,000 people. The announcement comes two days after Kyle canceled the event over concerns about the reenactment not telling the victims’ perspective and featuring many Confederate flags. Wayne Carle, who helps plan the event, says the reenactors put on the show to keep history alive.\n\nIndiana\n\nWest Lafayette: Purdue University is planning several events commemorating the upcoming 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing commanded by school alumnus Neil Armstrong. The university says events begin July 18 with a presentation on the landing by Apollo 11 flight director Gene Kranz, followed by a July 20 screening of “Armstrong,” a new documentary film featuring home videos shot by Armstrong and unseen footage from NASA. Purdue will host a special exhibition of items from its Armstrong archives July 19-20. Other July 20 events include children’s activities on the Purdue Mall and a lunar module landing celebration timed around the 4:17 p.m. touchdown ahead of Armstrong becoming the first person to walk on the moon. Armstrong, a 1955 Purdue graduate, died in 2012 at age 82.\n\nIowa\n\nSioux City: A company that’s been fined thousands of dollars for the stink coming from its plant has lost its lawsuit targeting the city’s odor ordinance. The Sioux City Journal reports Judge Leonard Strand of the U.S. District Court in Sioux City granted the city of Sibley’s motion for a summary judgment. Strand disagreed with Iowa Drying & Processing’s contention that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague. Iowa Drying & Processing had said the city’s enforcement unfairly targeted the company and interfered with its efforts to sell the plant, which had drawn residents’ complaints for years. One resident, Josh Harms, sued Sibley after city officials threatened legal action against him for saying on a website that Sibley smelled like “rancid dog food.” Strand ruled against the city in Harms’ case.\n\nKansas\n\nHutchinson: Hutchinson Zoo director Ryan VanZant says last month’s flooding covered more than one-third of the zoo. The Hutchinson News reports the zoo – except for the gift shop and train – has been closed since May 21 after consecutive storms caused water to rise at the zoo. VanZant said in a Facebook post Wednesday that five buildings and two playgrounds were affected by flood waters. He said staff moved animals to safety ahead of the rising water and built temporary housing where the animals are being kept while waiting for the water to recede and the cleanup to begin. A Facebook fundraiser has been started to help cleanup costs. The Hutchinson Friends of the Zoo says the goal is to raise $10,000 before Family Fun Day on Aug. 17.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A state agency says it has secured another $5 million federal grant to continue a program providing youth-support services. Kentucky’s Department for Behavioral Health, Developmental and Intellectual Disabilities says the latest grant will continue the program through March 2024. The Transition Age Youth Launching Realized Dreams program allows youth ages 16 to 25 to easily access quality, developmentally appropriate, youth-driven support services. Officials say the goal is to help participants achieve their goals and transition into adulthood successfully. Officials say available services include expedited assistance in locating housing, mental health services and substance-abuse treatment. Since 2014, the program has helped more than 1,900 youth. Officials say youth and young adults can visit one of Kentucky’s 20 drop-in sites to access behavioral health services.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Billions of mosquito lookalikes are showing up in the area, blanketing car windshields, littering the ground with little bodies and even scaring some folks. They’re aquatic midges, often called “blind mosquitoes.” They don’t bite, and they’re good for the environment, but they’re a nuisance. Entomologist Nick Delisi of the St. Tammany Mosquito Abatement District says that “they tend to emerge in the billions.” Sloshing down bug-spattered windshields has become such a chore that the manager of the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway says Motorist Assistance Patrol trucks on the 24-mile-long bridge have had to replenish their water almost daily. Mosquito control officials say they don’t plan to do anything to control the swarms because they die in less than a week and their larvae clean up waterways.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The Legislature sent a proposal to the governor Wednesday to ditch the state’s presidential caucuses for a primary system that would be the nation’s first to allow voters to rank candidates. The Democratic-led Senate approved funding the bill, which had already passed the House. It now heads to Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, who hasn’t taken a position. As the 2020 presidential primary season nears, Maine is among an increasingly small handful of states that still have caucuses, including Iowa, Nevada and Wyoming. If primaries are approved, Maine voters will use ranked-choice voting to indicate which candidates they want delegates to support. That could get hairy in the Democratic primary, where more than 20 people are running.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A memorial dedication, gun violence forum and moment of silence are among the events scheduled for the one-year anniversary of the attack on The Capital Gazette newspaper that killed five employees. Police say a man with a history of harassing people at the paper shot and killed the journalists June 28, 2018, in its Annapolis newsroom. The Capital Gazette reports the attack will be formally remembered next week with a concert, the unveiling of a memorial garden, a forum on gun violence and a moment of silence. The events also coincide with Maryland’s first statewide observance of Freedom of the Press Day. At 2:33 p.m. June 28 – the time the gunman entered the newsroom – Tribune properties across the country will take a moment of silence for the victims.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A veterinary hospital got quite a surprise recently when a family brought in their bulldog after he stopped eating. The Angell Animal Medical Center found 19 baby pacifiers in the dog’s stomach. It started in April when the Wellesley family noticed that their 3-year-old dog, Mortimer, started getting nauseated before meals. His owner, Emily Shanahan, brought Mortimer to the vet, who prescribed medicine to take care of the issue. But it didn’t help, and Mortimer eventually stopped eating entirely. Shanahan went to Angell, where they took an X-ray and discovered the pacifiers. Vets think Mortimer had been taking the pacifiers from Shanahan’s two children over the course of months. The pacifiers were removed without surgery, and Mortimer has fully recovered and is back at home.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has ordered state agencies to step up efforts to reduce phosphorus pollution and otherwise improve water quality in Lake Erie. Whitmer signed an executive directive Thursday instructing three state departments to support the initiative. The departments of Agriculture and Rural Development; Environment, Great Lakes and Energy; and Natural Resources will submit annual progress reports. Michigan adopted guidelines last year for making Lake Erie healthier, including cutting phosphorus loading into its western basin 40% by 2025. Whitmer’s directive puts a focus on lessening nutrient inflows from the Detroit River, the River Raisin and the Maumee River.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Peter: An invasion of gnats is presenting a risk to the health and lives of livestock in this southern Minnesota town. The Mankato Free Press reports that gnats cause weight loss and stress for any animal with their bites and by gathering around eyes and in airways. Brooke Knisley, who runs an organic produce farm with her husband in St. Peter, says one of her friends has lost 16 chickens to the gnats this year. Knisley says she’s trying to reduce the risk for her own flock by running fans in the chicken coop, hanging fly strips and placing vanilla-soaked rags near where the gnats congregate. Gnats are also an irritant for cattle and horses, and many owners are keeping their animals inside until the invasion passes.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Persistent flooding across wildlife management areas has decimated some wildlife habitats and food supplies, leading the state to allow supplemental deer feeding in Issaquena and Warren counties. The executive director of the state Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks says the deer stuck on a flooded levee have depleted their resources. Russ Walsh says the stressed deer are in bad shape. Resident Melissa Lyons raises two cattle on the levee and says that “the only things thriving are the buzzards.” She says the deer are starved and weak, and her husband recently removed 20 dead deer from their hay field. Supplemental feeding requires a wildlife agency permit that expires this fall.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: McDonald’s has started a trans-Atlantic barbecue feud with the introduction of a Kansas City-themed hamburger in the U.K. Outgoing Mayor Sly James said Tuesday that the fast-food chain should “stay in your lane” in a tweet that included a picture of what he says a “real” burger looks like. Kansas City is known for its style of dry-rubbed, slow-cooked meats drizzled in tomato-molasses sauce. Other Twitter users rushed to join the mocking after McDonald’s proclaimed “Yeehaw” as it promoted its “Kansas City Stack” on social media. Barbecue powerhouse Q39 kidded “Yeehaw, mate!” while Joe’s Kansas City Bar-B-Que retweeted a scathing critique of the burger along with a slew of various laughing emojis. McDonald’s says the bacon-topped burger is available until June 25, but not in America.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: AT&T has started dropping cellphone customers in the state’s northeast, citing customers’ regular data use outside its service area. The Billings Gazette reports the company began notifying customers earlier this year that they would lose their mobile coverage. AT&T spokeswoman Suzanne Trantow says the company can no longer be the primary provider for a “small number of customers who live or have a billing address outside our owned network coverage area.” She declined to give the specific area or the number of customers dropped. Verizon dropped the rural Montana customers in 2017, citing the costs of customers using data while roaming off its network. Scobey-based Nemont Telephone Cooperative has become the only provider for some parts of the region, but T-Mobile has been expanding operations.\n\nNebraska\n\nMcCook: Family Fun Nights have been scheduled for the summer at Red Willow State Recreation Area. The state Game and Parks Commission says a typical Family Fun Night begins at 6 p.m. with a meal provided by the park. Events start at 7 p.m. and include kayaking, fishing and archery. All equipment is provided. Just before dark, everyone heads back to the campfire to finish off the evening with s’mores. Family Fun Nights are scheduled for June 26, July 5 and 19, and Aug. 2. The park sits about 11 miles north of McCook, just west of U.S. Highway 83. A park entry permit is required.

The Las Vegas City Council approved the program in 2016 and voted Wednesday to activate it for a month. Anyone who is issued a fine between June 19 and July 19 can clear it by taking new, unwrapped school supplies to the city’s parking services offices on Main Street. The donation has to be made within 30 days of receiving a parking ticket. The supplies must be of value equal to or greater than the fine. A receipt also is required. The supplies will be given to the Teacher Exchange, which serves about 390 schools in southern Nevada. It’s part of the Public Education Foundation.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A committee of lawmakers has reached a compromise on changes to the state’s new work requirements for Medicaid recipients. The rules, which are just starting to take effect, require most recipients to spend at least 100 hours a month working, going to school or participating in community service. The House and Senate passed different versions of a bill to broaden the allowed exemptions and end the work requirements entirely if 500 people lost coverage. A committee reached a compromise Thursday to suspend, but not eliminate, coverage for noncompliance. The state would have until July 2021 to waive the requirements in several scenarios, including if the state is unable to contact all participants to explain the rules. The full Legislature will vote on the amended bill next week.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Gov. Phil Murphy has signed legislation requiring ride-hailing services to show additional identification after the March death of a University of South Carolina student who police say got into the car of an Uber impersonator. Among the new requirements is that ride-hailing services must issue two identifying markers to each driver. They must be displayed on the front windshield and rear window. Murphy, a Democrat, signed the legislation Thursday in Robbinsville, the hometown of Samantha “Sami” Josephson. The act is known as Sami’s Law. Police say Josephson got into the car of an Uber driver impersonator in Columbia, South Carolina. She was killed and her body dumped in the woods 65 miles away. A man has been charged with kidnapping and murder in the case.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLovington: Lea County has approved more than $5 million in upgrades to an airport in the heart of the state’s booming oil region. The Hobbs News-Sun reports the county commission gave the green light last week to improvements to the Lea County Regional Airport – most funded by federal and state grants. The improvements call for doubling the expansion of the holding area for flight patrons and renovating the apron area on the airside of the terminal. They also including upgrading a runway safety area and extending the primary runway. Officials say increased ridership is spurring the recommended improvements. The Lea County Regional Airport is located in Hobbs – a key city in the booming Permian Basin.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Artist Kehinde Wiley will unveil his first monumental public sculpture in Times Square this fall in response to Confederate statues nationwide. Times Square Arts, the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts and gallery owner Sean Kelly announced Thursday that the bronze “Rumors of War” sculpture features a young black man dressed in urban streetwear mounted atop a horse. The project originated when Wiley saw Confederate Gen. J.E.B. Stuart’s monument in Richmond, Virginia. Wiley is known for his paintings of black Americans and his commissioned portrait of President Barack Obama, displayed at the National Portrait Gallery. He says the new statue’s inspiration is war and “an engagement with violence.” “Rumors of War” will display in Times Square from Sept. 27 to December before finding a permanent home at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nOak Island: Advocates for sea turtles say a hefty fine is in store for whoever dug into a nest of loggerhead sea turtle eggs. The Oak Island Sea Turtle Protection Program says the nest was tampered with Monday. Sand was displaced from the covered hole, and it was burrowed into. The News & Observer reports none of the eggs were broken or harmed. But the group wants beachgoers to know that disturbing sea turtle nests carries a federal fine up to $50,000 and possible prison time. Last week, a woman was arrested in Miami after police said she stomped on sea turtle nests and poked them with a stake. Loggerhead turtles are protected under the Endangered Species Act.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state’s female prison population has reached capacity, leaving some inmates in the custody of counties. The Bismarck Tribune reports that the state’s female prison population reached capacity for the first time in May. Under 2017 legislation, county inmates are transferred to state prisons based on the severity of crimes, medical needs and other factors. Last week, only six of 12 inmates intended for movement from county to state were admitted. The statewide system for women has a daily average capacity of 224 inmates. Donnell Preskey, who represents the North Dakota Association of Counties, says a mechanism must be established to reimburse counties for the cost of holding inmates who should be in state facilities.\n\nOhio\n\nBrecksville: A national park that protects about a quarter of the Cuyahoga River is preparing to celebrate the river’s health 50 years after it infamously caught fire. A ceremonial torch traveling the length of the 85-mile-long river will make a stop in Cuyahoga Valley National Park on Friday afternoon on its way to Cleveland. The public event comes one day before the 50th anniversary of the June 22, 1969, fire. It will feature the passing of the Xtinguish Torch Fest torch along with music, poetry and the unveiling of a new sculpture. Speakers, including a regional director of the National Park Service, will outline efforts to restore the river from its abysmal earlier condition to a vibrant place for wildlife and outdoor recreation.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Jet engine maker Pratt & Whitney has announced plans to expand its operations at Tinker Air Force Base. Pratt & Whitney Vice President Kevin Kirkpatrick, Gov. Kevin Stitt and Mayor David Holt announced what is called a “multimillion-dollar investment” to expand its military aftermarket services at the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Complex based at Tinker. The project is also expected to add more than 100 jobs. Pratt & Whitney is a division of Farmington, Connecticut-based United Technologies Corp. and performs engine services and maintenance for the Air Force at Tinker.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Gov. Kate Brown deployed the state police Thursday to try to round up Republican lawmakers who fled the Capitol in an attempt to block a vote on a landmark climate plan that would be the second of its kind in the nation. Minority Republicans want the cap-and-trade proposal aimed at dramatically lowering the state’s greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 to be sent to the voters for approval instead of instituted by lawmakers. Negotiations with Democrats fell apart late Wednesday, prompting conservatives to pursue a walkout, said Kate Gillem, a spokeswoman for Senate Republicans. Some members have even left the state to avoid a vote, Gillem said. State police don’t have jurisdiction beyond state lines. Democrats have an 18-to-12 majority in the chamber but need 20 members present for a quorum.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: A mural by the artist who painted the official portrait of Michelle Obama is being dedicated in the city. Amy Sherald’s overall body of work represents everyday lives of black Americans. So it’s fitting that the 6-story-tall mural dedicated Thursday portrays Najee Spencer-Young, a 19-year-old participant in Philadelphia’s Mural Arts education program. Sherald tells the Philadelphia Inquirer she chose Spencer-Young during a class trip to her studio. The artist saw it as an opportunity to boost the self-esteem of the teenager and those who look like her. The mural depicts Spencer-Young in a black-and-white flower print trench coach and mustard yellow hat, looking confident and composed – and very imposing – against a bright blue background.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo signed a bill Wednesday to preserve federal abortion protections in state law. The Senate passed the bill and immediately transmitted it to the House, which resumed its session to pass it. Raimondo signed it in her office, calling it an “important, consequential bill.” “Fundamentally this bill is about health care,” she said. Rhode Island is one of the Democratic-led states taking steps to enshrine the right to an abortion should the U.S. Supreme Court ever overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. Raimondo said she wanted to sign quickly, in light of the uncertainty across the nation. The new law says the state will not restrict the right to an abortion prior to fetal viability or afterward if an abortion is necessary for the health or life of the mother.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A zoo plans to send off two African elephants in order to bring in Southern white rhinos. Riverbanks Zoo and Garden of Columbia announced Wednesday that 48-year-old Robin and 37-year-old Belle will soon join a larger herd. The zoo says the public can attend special activities before the elephants leave. The destination for the elephants hasn’t been determined. Zoo officials say 13 elephants have lived at Riverbanks since 1973. The zoo says there is a chance elephants will return in the future. Director of Animal Care and Welfare John Davis says the zoo hopes to add more space and manage a breeding group one day. Southern white rhinos haven’t lived at the zoo since 1989. The new exhibit is scheduled to open next year.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The Sioux Falls Freemasons and Architecture Inc. opened a time capsule Wednesday afternoon, revealing multiple artifacts the Masons had placed downtown nearly a hundred years ago. Lisa VandeVoort, business manager at Architecture Inc., said the time capsule – placed on June 6, 1924 – was opened as renovations were being done to the building. The Masons never specified a date to open the capsule, VandeVoort said, “so doing it during renovations made sense.” Dozens of items were removed from a box set in the building’s cornerstone, including a Masonic Bible, several editions of the Argus Leader and a typewritten copy of the address read during the time capsule ceremony 95 years ago. The capsule also included a sealed envelope with stamps from the time, as well as a handbook for new owners of telephones.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The three new eagles at Radnor Lake State Park’s Barbara J. Mapp Aviary Education Center are finally ready to meet the public. After months of park staff working to acclimate the eagles to their new environment, Radnor hosted a free open house Thursday, for American Eagle Day, for bird lovers to get at least a glimpse of the majestic creatures. “One of the long-term goals has been to have captive bald eagles (that could not be released back into the wild due to their injuries) in the aviary where visitors could interact with them,” Radnor Park manager Steve Ward said. The two bald eagles are housed in the park’s new $110,000 flighted aviary, a 38-foot-tall netted enclosure that gives the birds freedom of movement and protects them from other predatory wildlife within the natural area. The golden eagle has its own enclosure.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: A federal law enforcement official says the FBI received a call three years ago about the 22-year-old man who opened fire on a courthouse downtown. Brian Isaack Clyde was shot and killed Monday by security officers at the Earle Cabell Federal Building. There were no other serious injuries or deaths in the attack. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, says a member of Clyde’s family called a national tip line to say he was suicidal and had a fascination with guns. The official said the July 1, 2016, call expressed concern for Clyde but did not contain a specific threat and was therefore not investigated. It came while Clyde was enlisted in the U.S. Army. Clyde’s mother, Nubia Brede Solis, told The Dallas Morning News that his half-brother had called the FBI with concerns.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A state commission has agreed to provide a $21.4 million grant to a multicounty coalition for a proposed new 80-mile rail route to haul crude oil from eastern Utah to existing Union Pacific tracks northwest of Price in Carbon County. The Salt Lake Tribune reports that the Community Impact Board last week approved the funding for the Seven County Infrastructure Coalition for planning and environmental reviews. Supports say the planned Uinta Basin Railway would help Uintah and Duchesne counties develop their energy-dependent economies and reduce tanker traffic on highways. The coalition has contracted with the investment bank Drexel Hamilton, which will commit between $5 million and $15 million of its own funds, to raise private capital, commercialize the project and secure a partner to operate the rail line.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state Department of Fish and Wildlife is reminding people not to release aquarium fish into the wild. It is illegal to release the fish into Vermont waters. While most tropical fish are unlikely to become established in Vermont waters due to the cold weather, biologists say that if the aquarium fish survive and reproduce in the wild, they can be difficult – if not impossible – to control or eradicate. They can also cause changes in the native aquatic environment by competing with native species and introducing exotic parasites and diseases. Vermont biologists recently discovered goldfish, which are native to China, living in the sewer drains of Williston, which connect to public waters. Aquarium plants can also pose a threat if they are released into the wild.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The state plans to mark four centuries of black history with a new exhibit and a tribute to tennis star Arthur Ashe Jr. The exhibit begins with the 1619 arrival in Virginia of the first enslaved Africans in English North America and continues all the way to the present day. “Determined: The 400-Year Struggle for Black Equality” will open Saturday at the Virginia Museum of History & Culture in Richmond as the city officially dedicates Arthur Ashe Boulevard. Renowned civil rights activist Rep. John Lewis of Georgia will be the keynote speaker. The exhibit features dozens of artifacts to tell the story of black Virginians, including slavery-era restraints, an African-inspired banjo and a stool from a Richmond lunch counter where students held a sit-in to protest segregation.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The proof is in the pee. A new federally funded study has confirmed, not surprisingly, that marijuana use went up in the state after its first legal pot stores opened in 2014. In fact, consumption doubled over three years – a conclusion scientists reached after performing the decidedly unglamorous work of analyzing raw sewage. The researchers tested wastewater from Tacoma, a city whose drug-use trends tend to mirror those of Seattle, for a substance that is produced when people metabolize the active ingredient in pot. It is excreted in urine. The researchers said they can’t tell whether the increase in metabolites means more people are using weed or the same old users are consuming more of it. Another possible explanation is that the THC products sold legally in stores are more potent than what was commonly available on the black market.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: State agricultural officials are warning about a fungal disease that attacks boxwood shrubs. The Department of Agriculture says in a news release that boxwood blight has been detected on residential and commercial landscapes throughout the state. Boxwood blight produces dark brown leaf spots and causes rapid defoliation that sometimes kills young boxwoods. It’s found in more than two dozen states and was first detected in West Virginia on plants shipped from out-of-state nurseries in 2015. The statement says residents should buy shrubs from reputable nurseries and only buy plants that appear healthy. Gardeners and landscapers should sanitize gardening tools between different plantings of boxwoods.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state Assembly has approved a bill that would require online vendors like Amazon to collect and remit sales taxes from third-party sellers in perpetuity, a move that would trigger income tax cuts. Under the bill, revenue from the tax collections would be used to cover reductions in the lowest- and second-lowest income tax brackets. According to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, taxpayers could expect an average reduction of $27 for tax year 2019 and an average reduction of $59 in tax year 2020 under the new rates. The Assembly passed the bill Thursday afternoon on a voice vote. The measure goes next to the state Senate. Coupled with an income tax cut plan Republicans inserted in the state budget, taxpayers could expect a total annual reduction of $91 in 2019 and $124 in 2020.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Some rodeo circuit cowboys say they will boycott this year’s Cheyenne Frontier Days rodeo because of the new, tournament-style format the “Daddy of ’em All” adopted in roping and steer wrestling events. Under the new format, slack will now become a qualifying round to make it into the rodeo performances in steer roping, tie-down roping, team roping and steer wrestling. Each performance will see event winners and money paid out, and the contestants will start with a clean slate in the finals. Tie-down roper Hunter Herrin tells KGAB-AM the change means cowboys will compete more for less money. Cheyenne Frontier Days Rodeo Chairman Chad Mathews tells the Wyoming Tribune Eagle the new format means a better spectator experience and payouts to more contestants.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/06/21"}]}

Does that get him off the legal ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe never-ending legal problems swirling around former President Donald Trump are already taking center stage in his freshly announced 2024 presidential campaign.\n\nTrump himself, in his speech declaring his candidacy on Tuesday, ranted about how he was a “victim” of the “weaponization of the justice system,” as he railed against the search the FBI executed of his Florida home as part of a criminal investigation into the mishandling of documents from his White House.\n\nRegardless of whether Trump’s criminal exposure politically undermines his campaign or rallies his supporters, the investigations that could implicate him – which also include federal and state-level probes into 2020 election subversion gambits – won’t likely pose any legal barrier to his candidacy.\n\nIt is unlikely that even a conviction would disqualify him from the ballot, according to legal experts.\n\n“It might be a practical barrier, it might be a fundraising barrier, but those are political questions, not legal ones,” said Derek Muller, an election law professor at University of Iowa College of Law.\n\nOn the flip side, Trump’s candidacy for president doesn’t, by itself, give him any additional legal protections in the probes. But it does create a more complicated political and practical environment for investigators to navigate.\n\nCan Trump stay on the ballot if he is convicted of a crime?\n\nThis question has not been fully settled by the courts, but the general consensus is that neither an indictment nor a conviction would legally prevent Trump from being elected.\n\nNot only have convicted felons run for federal office in the past, but at least one ran for president successfully from prison: Eugene Debs, a perennial socialist candidate for the White House in the early 20th century, won more than 900,000 votes in a 1920 presidential campaign he ran while incarcerated on an espionage conviction.\n\nThe reason why it is widely believed a conviction wouldn’t preclude Trump’s return to the White House is because of a mainstream legal argument that only the Constitution sets the standards candidates must meet to be president.\n\nEugene Debs addresses a crowd of people, circa 1910. (Photo by Fotosearch/Getty Images). Getty Images\n\n“It’s pretty widely accepted that the qualifications to serve as president are enumerated in the Constitution,” Muller said. “And just being convicted of a felony is not one of them, and states and Congress cannot add to those qualifications.”\n\nThat is why many legal experts believe that courts would not uphold proposals by states to bar from their ballots presidential candidates who refuse to release their tax returns, as Trump has refused to do.\n\nYet if Trump is charged with one of the statutes federal investigators are examining in the Mar-a-Lago documents probe, it might pose the most serious test yet to the constitutional question.\n\nOne of the laws implicated in that Justice Department’s Mar-a-Lago investigation, a federal statute that criminalizes the concealment or removal of government records, said that those found guilty “shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.”\n\n“It would present the strongest case for the lawfulness of statutory disqualification that one could make, because of, both, its subject matter – national security – and because Congress spoke so explicitly and expressly,” said Paul Rosenzweig, a former official at the US Department of Homeland Security who also worked on the Whitewater investigation into President Bill Clinton. “My guess is that it would still not stand.”\n\nDo the legal protections he got as a president apply now that he is a candidate?\n\nWhile Trump was in the White House, he put forward arguments in several cases – sometimes successfully, sometimes not – that his status as president gave him certain legal protections.\n\nBut those protections do not now apply to him just because he has announced his bid to reclaim the White House. The residual fights over conduct he engaged in while president will continue, but he doesn’t have any special legal tools to shield things he does or says while he is just a candidate.\n\n“There’s no executive privilege or anything that attaches right now as a candidate,” Muller said.\n\nThe main advantage being a presidential candidate gives Trump is the promise of delay: that if he can drag out the legal processes long enough that they are not resolved if and when he is reelected, he can then try to use the presidency as a shield then.\n\nWhat does his presidential run mean for the criminal investigations surrounding him?\n\nTrump’s announcement that he was running for president did not create any formal, legal obstacles for criminal investigators examining potential wrongdoing by him or his allies. But Trump’s candidacy could inject other political and practical considerations.\n\nAs CNN previously reported, the Justice Department was weighing in the weeks leading up to Trump’s announcement whether to appoint a special counsel. DOJ officials have debated whether doing so could insulate the department from allegations that the investigations are politically motivated attacks on President Joe Biden’s 2024 rival.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland avoided answering a CNN question about the possibility in March, while insisting that the department does “not shy away from cases that are controversial or sensitive or political.”\n\nAs of earlier this month, no decision had been made public.\n\nNo matter where Garland lands on the special counsel question, Trump’s candidacy undoubtedly raises the stakes of the investigation. DOJ will likely be especially cautious and only bring charges if the department is extremely confident it could secure a conviction, former prosecutors said.\n\nTrump’s announcement could even speed things up.\n\n“I think that the Department of Justice will, with reason, understand that it needs to move like in the first quarter of next year, before the campaign truly gets underway,” Rosenzweig said. “So it can’t wait … to bring an indictment until January 2024.”\n\nWhat does it mean for the civil litigation Trump is facing?\n\nTrump faces legal exposure from the myriad civil lawsuits that have been filed against him, which range from a civil fraud case brought by the New York attorney general, to lawsuits seeking damages for his conduct ahead of the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack to the defamation complaint brought by a woman who has accused him of rape.\n\nIn the cases concerning his conduct while he was in the White House, Trump has sought to raise arguments about legal protections he said his status as president gave him. But he doesn’t get any additional protections by just announcing a presidential campaign.\n\n“The United States Supreme Court actually approved of civil litigation against President Clinton in the ’90s, while he was sitting as president. So surely, merely being a candidate for office doesn’t prevent these kinds of cases from going forward,” Muller said.\n\nWhat does the presidential run mean for Trump’s defense?\n\nAt least in the immediate aftermath of the announcement, perhaps the most tangible effect of Trump declaring his candidacy, where his legal troubles are concerned, is that the Republican National Committee won’t foot the bill for the attorneys representing him in New York investigations scrutinizing his business practices.\n\n“We cannot pay legal bills for any candidate that’s announced,” RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel told CNN’s Dana Bash earlier this month.\n\nShe said the committee was willing to finance his legal defense in the civil fraud case brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James because the RNC sees that lawsuit as “a politically motivated investigation” that started when he was president.\n\nTrump has also used money he’s raised post presidency for his leadership PAC – a fundraising organ usually used to support other candidates – to pay for firms representing him in the James case and other matters.\n\n“We cannot do in-kind contributions to any candidate,” McDaniel said at the time. “Right now, he’s the former president who’s being attacked from every which way with lawsuits. And he’s certainly raised more into the RNC than we have spent on these bills.”", "authors": ["Tierney Sneed"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/trump-2024-presidential-bid/index.html", "title": "Donald Trump announces a White House bid for 2024 | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, aiming to become only the second commander-in-chief ever elected to two nonconsecutive terms, announced Tuesday night that he will seek the Republican presidential nomination in 2024.\n\n“In order to make America great and glorious again, I am tonight announcing my candidacy for president of the United States,” Trump told a crowd gathered at Mar-a-Lago, his waterfront estate in Florida, where his campaign will be headquartered.\n\nSurrounded by allies, advisers, and conservative influencers, Trump delivered a relatively subdued speech, rife with spurious and exaggerated claims about his four years in office. Despite a historically divisive presidency and his own role in inciting an attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, Trump aimed to evoke nostalgia for his time in office, frequently contrasting his first-term accomplishments with the Biden administration’s policies and the current economic climate. Many of those perceived accomplishments – from strict immigration actions to corporate tax cuts and religious freedom initiatives – remain deeply polarizing to this day.\n\nAs Trump spoke to a roomful of Republicans who expect him to face primary challengers in the coming months, he also claimed the party cannot afford to nominate “a politician or conventional candidate” if it wants to win back the White House.\n\n“This will not be my campaign, this will be our campaign all together,” Trump said.\n\nTrump’s long-awaited campaign comes as he tries to reclaim the spotlight following the GOP’s underwhelming midterm elections performance – including the losses of several Trump-endorsed election deniers – and the subsequent blame game that has unfolded since Election Day. Republicans failed to gain a Senate majority, came up short in their efforts to fill several statewide seats, and have yet to secure a House majority, with only 215 races called in their favor so far out of the 218 needed, developments that have forced Trump and other party leaders into a defensive posture as they face reproval from within their ranks.\n\nTrump’s paperwork establishing his candidacy landed with the Federal Election Committee shortly before he delivered his announcement at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nTo the delight of aides and allies who have long advised him to mount a forward-looking campaign, he spent only a fraction of his remarks repeating his lies about the 2020 election. Though he advocated for the use of paper ballots and likened America’s election system to that of “third world countries,” Trump also tried at times to broaden his grievances – lamenting the “massive corruption” and “entrenched interests” that in his view have consumed Washington. Many of Trump’s top advisers have expressed concern that his fixation on promoting conspiracies about the last presidential election would make it harder for him to win a national election in 2024.\n\nThroughout the hour-long speech, Trump made clear that he wants his campaign to be seen by Republicans as a sacrificial undertaking.\n\n“Anyone who truly seeks to take on this rigged and corrupt system will be faced with a storm of fire that only a few could understand,” he said at one point, describing the legal and emotional toll his presidency and post-presidential period has taken on his family members.\n\nOn the heels of last week’s midterm elections, Trump has been blamed for elevating flawed candidates who spent too much time parroting his claims about election fraud, alienating key voters and ultimately leading to their defeats. He attempted to counter that criticism on Tuesday, noting that Republicans appear poised to retake the House majority and touting at least one Trump-endorsed candidate, Kevin Kiley of California. At one point, Trump appeared to blame his party’s midterm performance on voters not yet realizing “the total effect of the suffering” after two years of Democratic control in Washington.\n\n“I have no doubt that by 2024, it will sadly be much worse and they will see clearly what has happened and is happening to our country – and the voting will be much different,” he claimed.\n\nBeating others to the punch\n\nTrump is betting that his first-out-of-the gate strategy will fend off potential primary rivals and give him an early advantage with deep-pocketed donors, aides say. He is widely expected to be challenged by both conservative and moderate Republicans, though the calculus of some presidential hopefuls could change now that he is running. Others – like his former Vice President, Mike Pence – may proceed anyway.\n\nTrump’s third presidential bid also coincides with a period of heightened legal peril as Justice Department officials investigating him and his associates revisit the prospect of indictments in their Trump-related probes. The former president is currently being investigated for his activities before and during the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol and his retention of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate after he left office. While Trump is counting on an easy path to the GOP nomination with his sustained support among the party’s base, his announcement is likely to dash the hopes of party leaders who have longed for fresh talent. In particular, top Republicans have been paying close attention to the next moves of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who won his reelection contest with a 19-point margin of victory and considerable support from minority and independent voters. Some Republican leaders may try to scuttle Trump’s campaign by elevating or encouraging alternative candidates, including DeSantis, who has been quietly laying the groundwork for a possible White House bid of his own.\n\nOf course, any countereffort to inhibit Trump’s path to the nomination is likely to prove difficult. Despite his myriad legal entanglements and the stain of January 6, the twice-impeached 45th president remains immensely popular among most Republican voters and boasts a deep connection with his core backers that could prove difficult for other GOP hopefuls to replicate or weaken. Even leading conservatives who disliked Trump’s pugnacious politics and heterodox policies stuck with him as president because he helped solidify the rightward shift of the US Supreme Court with his nominations – one of the most far-reaching aspects of his legacy, which resulted in the conservative court majority’s deeply polarizing June decision to end federal abortion rights. In fact, while Trump ended his first term with the lowest approval rating of any president, Republicans viewed him favorably, according to a May NBC News poll. That alone could give Trump a significant edge over primary opponents whom voters are still familiarizing themselves with.\n\nAmong those potential competitors is Pence, who would likely benefit from high name recognition due to his role as vice president. Pence, who has been preparing for a possible White House run in 2024, is sure to face an uphill battle courting Trump’s most loyal supporters, many of whom soured on the former vice president after he declined to overstep his congressional authority and block certification of now-President Joe Biden’s 2020 victory. Trump could also find himself pitted against DeSantis, who has risen to hero status among cultural conservatives and who is widely considered a more polished version of Trump. Even some of the former president’s advisers have voiced similar observations to CNN, noting that DeSantis also made inroads with major Republican donors during his quest for reelection and built a mountain of goodwill with GOP leaders by campaigning for federal and statewide Republican candidates in the middle of his own race.\n\nBeyond his potential rivals, Trump has another roadblock in his path as the House select committee continues to investigate his role in January 6, 2021, and Justice Department officials weigh whether to issue criminal charges. The committee, which subpoenaed him for testimony and documents in October and which Trump is now battling in court, held public hearings throughout the summer and early fall featuring depositions from those in Trump’s inner circle at the White House – including members of his family – that detailed his public and private efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results through a sustained pressure campaign on numerous local, state and federal officials, and on his own vice president.\n\nBut Trump’s desire to announce his campaign early can be especially traced to the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, which advisers say further emboldened his decision to mount what he believes will be a triumphant political comeback. The day after the search, the former president fielded calls from allies advising him to accelerate his 2024 timeline. That night, he huddled with House lawmakers in the Republican Study Committee and told them he’d “made up his mind” about launching a bid, though some of those same House Republicans later convinced him to wait until after the midterm elections to announce his next move.\n\nFew of those lawmakers were present for Trump’s speech on Tuesday, choosing to remain in Washington as House Republicans conducted their leadership elections and the party continues to grapple with its failures in highly prized midterm races. Rather, the room was filled with prominent election deniers like MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, several of Trump’s attorneys, and past and present aides. Before he entered the room on Tuesday alongside former first lady Melania Trump, several members of the ex-president’s family were also seen filtering into the ballroom, including Eric and Lara Trump, his son Barron, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, and Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is engaged to Donald Trump Jr. His eldest son was notably missing, along with daughter Ivanka, , who has since said she will no longer be involved in the political arena. A source close to Donald Trump Jr. said he was stuck on a hunting trip in the mountain west and unable to catch a flight back to Florida in time for his father’s announcement. Other guests included longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone; outgoing North Carolina Rep. Madison Cawthorn; former congressman and the current CEO of Trump’s Truth Social app Devin Nunes; and his chief political adviser Susie Wiles.\n\nPreparing for 2024\n\nFrom the moment Trump left Washington, defeated and disgraced, in January 2021, he began plotting a return to power – devoting the bulk of his time to building a political operation intended for this moment. With assistance from numerous former aides and advisers, he continued the aggressive fundraising tactics that had become a marker of his 2020 campaign, amassing a colossal war chest ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, and worked diligently to elect steadfast allies in both Congress and state legislatures across the country.\n\nWhile maintaining a home base in Florida, he also regularly jet-setted across the country for campaign rallies that afforded him crucial face time with his base and with candidates he bet would become valuable allies in the US Senate and House.\n\nThrough it all, Trump continued to falsely insist that the 2020 election was stolen from him, indulging in far-flung conspiracy theories about voter fraud and pressuring Republican leaders across the party’s election apparatus to endorse changes that would curtail voting rights.\n\nTrump’s aides were pleased earlier this fall when his public appearances and rally speeches gradually became more focused on rising crime, immigration and economic woes – key themes throughout the midterm cycle and issues they hope will enable him to draw a compelling contrast with Biden as he begins this next chapter. Allies of the former president have long said that he views the 2024 contest as an opportunity to regain what he believes is his: another four years in the Oval Office.\n\nBut there is no guarantee that Trump will glide easily to a nonconsecutive second term. In fact, it could be quite difficult.\n\nNot only does history offer just one example of such a feat (defeated in 1888 after his first term, President Grover Cleveland was elected again in 1892), no previously impeached president has ever run again for office. Trump was first impeached in 2019 on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of justice, and then again in 2021 for inciting the riot at the US Capitol. Though he was acquitted by the Senate both times, 10 House Republicans broke with their party the second time around to join Democrats in a vote to impeach him. Seven Republican senators voted to convict him at his Senate trial.\n\nTrump has also been the subject of a bevy of lawsuits and investigations, including a New York state investigation and a separate Manhattan district attorney criminal probe into his company’s finances, a Georgia county probe into his efforts to overturn Biden’s election win in the state, and separate Justice Department probes into his campaign’s scheme to put forth fake electors in battleground states and his decision to bring classified materials with him to Mar-a-Lago upon leaving office.\n\nTrump’s actions since he left Washington have, for the most part, signaled his interest in an eventual return. While most former presidents go quietly into retirement – resurfacing to assist their parties during midterm cycles or for the opening of their presidential libraries – Trump bucked tradition to instead plot the comeback he now hopes to make. Despite its distance from Washington, Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club has transformed into a new hub for Republicans and a home base for his political machine. Assisted by a small group of paid staffers, he has hosted numerous candidate and committee fundraisers and seen a rotating cast of party leaders and congressional hopefuls filter through its gilded hallways in the hopes of nabbing his endorsement or reingratiating themselves with his base. Trump’s schedule has enabled him to build close relationships with party leaders and fringe figures – from House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy of California to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia – whose support in a contested primary could ultimately help him clear the field. Many of the aides who have been with him since he left the White House are expected to continue on as campaign hands, as the former president and his de facto chief of staff, longtime Florida GOP strategist Wiles, aim to maintain a lean operation much like the early days of his 2016 presidential campaign. Among those who are likely to be involved are Wiles, Taylor Budowich, Chris LaCivita, Steven Cheung, Justin Caporale and Brian Jack. Brad Parscale, who managed part of Trump’s failed 2020 campaign will not be part of his 2024 operation, nor will Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who was deeply involved in his quest for reelection.\n\nTime in office\n\nAs president, Trump faced criticism over several of his actions, especially his management of the worst public health crisis in nearly a century – the Covid-19 pandemic – though his administration helped facilitate the development of vaccines to treat the novel coronavirus in record time. He also was blasted by critics over his handling of Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico in 2017; the White nationalist rally, also in 2017, in Charlottesville, Virginia, where Heather Heyer was killed while walking with a group of counterprotesters; and Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nWhile in office, Trump signed sweeping tax cuts into law, enacted controversial hard-line immigration policies, including a policy that separated migrant children from their families and one known as “Remain in Mexico,” which the US Supreme Court ruled in June could be ended by his successor, and appointed hundreds of federal judges with deep conservative credentials. He also successfully nominated three Supreme Court justices, whose decisions this year as part of the court’s majority have shifted American society and laws rightward on issues such as abortion, guns, religious freedom and climate change.\n\nThe former real estate businessman and reality TV star was first elected to office in 2016, beating out a wide field of more than a dozen GOP candidates in an ugly primary, and then prevailing over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in a contentious general election, despite sexual misconduct allegations that would have typically been campaign-ending.\n\nAs president, Trump was an impulsive leader, who dispensed with long-standing norms, often announcing policy and Cabinet personnel changes on Twitter. (He was ultimately banned from the platform following the US Capitol riot and was later barred from Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube as well.)\n\nHe pushed an “America First” foreign policy approach, pulling the US out of international agreements such as the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal, a pair of controversial moves that were decried by many of America’s top European allies.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story mistakenly said who was likely to be involved in the Trump campaign. Brad Parscale will not be involved in the 2024 operation. It has also been updated to correctly characterize former President Donald Trump’s position on paper ballots, fix the spelling of Justin Caporale and reflect additional developments.", "authors": ["Gaborr Kristen Holmes Veronica Stracqualursi", "Kristen Holmes", "Veronica Stracqualursi"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/fact-check-trump-announcement-speech-2024/index.html", "title": "Fact check: 20 false and misleading claims Trump made in his ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump began his 2024 presidential campaign just as he ended his presidency in 2021: with a whole lot of inaccuracy.\n\nLike many of Trump’s speeches as president, his announcement speech at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Tuesday was filled with false claims about a variety of topics – from his record in office to his Democratic opponents to the economy, the environment and foreign policy.\n\nHere is a fact check of 20 false or misleading things he said. This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/16/politics/trump-presidential-bid-analysis/index.html", "title": "As he launches presidential bid, Trump offers a dark vision voters ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIt’s American carnage, round three.\n\nEx-President Donald Trump on Tuesday dragged Americans back into his dystopian worldview of a failing nation scarred by crime-ridden cities turned into “cesspools of blood,” and swamped by immigrants. He added a scary new twist at a time of global tensions, claiming the country was on the verge of tumbling into nuclear war.\n\nLaunching his bid for a third consecutive Republican presidential nomination, Trump conversely painted his own turbulent single term, which ended in his attempt to destroy democracy and a mismanaged pandemic, as a “golden age” of prosperity and American global dominance.\n\nThe new Trump – for the 2024 campaign – is the same as the old Trump.\n\nHe pounded out a message of American decline, highlighted raging inflation and slammed President Joe Biden as aged, weak, and disrespected by US enemies, while highlighting his own chummy ties with global dictators, like North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who seek to weaken American power.\n\nWhen the 76-year-old former property tycoon, reality star and commander in chief promised a new “quest to save our country,” he encapsulated the challenges that his new campaign poses for his own party and the rest of the United States.\n\nTo begin with, in the gold-leafed ballroom of his Mar-a-Lago resort, Trump steered clear of the election denialism that helped doom multiple Republican nominees in the midterm elections and that has inspired skepticism of his viability among GOP lawmakers in Washington.\n\nBut as usual, his self-discipline didn’t hold, as he descended further into his personal obsessions the longer he went on, portraying himself as a “victim,” raising new suspicion about the US election system and slamming ongoing criminal probes against him as politicized and deeply unfair. The speech lacked the riotous nature and energy of his campaign rallies. But Trump’s material was a familiar rhetorical cocktail of grievance certain to enthuse his base supporters.\n\nHowever, it may have come across to many of the swing voters in the states that he lost in 2020 as authoritarian demagoguery. Many of those voters deserted Republicans yet again last week, as the party failed to win back the Senate and as it still waits to confirm it will win only a slim majority in the House. Many GOP lawmakers squarely blame the lack of a red wave on Trump – for foisting extreme, election-denying candidates on the party in key states. That’s why there is increasing interest in potential alternative candidates like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who roared to reelection last week, and has recently proved, unlike Trump, that he can build a broad coalition with Trump-style policies but without the chaos epitomized by the 45th president.\n\nAnd yet by launching his campaign so early – before the 2022 election is even finalized – the ex-president is seeking to freeze the GOP field. And there is so far no evidence that his devoted supporters will desert him.\n\nWhat could be the opening acts of a new election clash between Trump and Biden unfolded over multiple time zones. As Trump was speaking, the current president – who confounded historic expectations of a midterm election drubbing – was at another beach resort, in Bali, Indonesia.\n\nBiden spent the moments leading up to Trump’s speech huddled with other world leaders seeking a united response to a possibly alarming escalation in the war in Ukraine after an explosion on the territory of NATO ally Poland. There was some irony to the fact that Biden was leading the same Western alliance at a moment of peril that Trump frequently had undermined while in office. (Biden said after a day of rising global tensions that first indications were that the missile that fell onto a Polish farm, killing two people, did not originate in Russia.)\n\nEpitomizing the gulf between a president’s duties and the frivolity of the campaign trail, Biden, when asked if he had a comment on Trump’s launch, replied: “No, not really.”\n\nTrump seeks a historic comeback under the threat of criminal probes\n\nTrump referred briefly to the FBI search of his home at Mar-a-Lago for his hoard of highly classified documents and subpoenas sent to his family members. It was a reminder that his campaign raises the extraordinary scenario of a candidate for president running for a new term while facing multiple criminal investigations and the possibility of indictment by the Justice Department. Trump, who has not been charged with a crime, is being investigated over the classified documents, the run-up to the US Capitol insurrection on January 6, 2021, and in Georgia over his attempt to steal Biden’s win in the crucial swing state in 2020.\n\nTrump has already claimed that he is being persecuted because Biden wants to stop him from becoming president again – an accusation likely to be embraced by his millions of supporters. Thus, the clash between his campaign and various investigations into his conduct promises to inflict even more damage on political and legal institutions that he kept under continuous assault as president.\n\nOne thing noticeably missing from Trump’s speech was acknowledgment of his unprecedented attempt to interrupt 250 years of peaceful transfers of power between presidents. But the Capitol insurrection is an indelible stain that is sure to haunt his campaign. CNN has exclusively reported that top DOJ officials have considered whether a special counsel would be needed during the Trump campaign to avoid potential political conflicts of interest.\n\nTrump is trying to pull off a historic feat accomplished by only one previous president – Grover Cleveland, who became the only commander in chief to serve nonconsecutive terms after he won a return to the White House in 1892.\n\nA Trump victory in 2024 would represent a stunning rebound given that he is the only president to have been impeached twice – once for trying to coerce Ukraine into investigating Biden, and secondly for inciting the mob attack on the Capitol, one of the most flagrant assaults ever on US democracy.\n\nA test for the GOP\n\nA return to the Oval Office for Trump would stun the world. His record of disdaining US allies and coddling dictators such as Russian President Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un fractured decades of US foreign policy and made the United States – long a force for stability in the world – into one of its most erratic powers.\n\nTrump left office in disgrace in 2021, after the assault on the Capitol, not even bothering to attend the inauguration of his successor and insisting ever since that the election was corrupt – despite no evidence and against the findings of multiple courts and his own Justice Department.\n\nEver since, the ex-president has made his lies about the 2020 election the centerpiece of a political movement that still has millions of followers – as was seen with the primary victories of some of his handpicked candidates in this year’s midterm elections.\n\nBut many Trump-backed candidates failed to win competitive general elections. And Trump’s 2024 campaign will test whether there are Republicans who, while they may be drawn in by Trump’s bulldozing style and populist, nationalist instincts, will tire of the drama and chaos that surround him. It will also pose a question of whether a new generation of Republicans, who have tapped into his political base and the “America first” principles of Trumpism – like DeSantis, for example – are ready to challenge the movement’s still wildly popular founder.\n\nTrump was already rejected by a broad general election audience once – he lost by more than 7 million votes in 2020. The same pattern appeared to exert itself as the GOP fell short of expectations in the midterms, which ironically will give Trump-aligned lawmakers strong leverage in what’s likely to be a narrow House Republican majority.\n\nAnd even if he secures the nomination again, it’s an open question whether he’ll be able to recreate his 2016 winning coalition after alienating moderate and suburban voters or whether a combination of motivated base voters and previously disaffected Republicans returning to the fold will be able to make up the difference.\n\nA norm-busting first term\n\nTrump’s first term between 2017 and 2021 was one of the most tumultuous periods in American political history.\n\nHe shattered the traditions and restraints of his office, subjecting political institutions – designed by the Founders to guard against exactly his brand of autocratic egotism – to their ultimate test.\n\nThe 45th president’s reputation was also stained by his negligent denial and mismanagement of a once-in-100-years pandemic. He skipped over his failed leadership in the emergency during his speech on Tuesday night.\n\nTrump’s flouting of science and public health guidelines came back to haunt him as he contracted Covid-19 in the fall of 2020. He survived a serious bout with the help of experimental drugs before theatrically ripping off his mask in a White House photo op when he returned from the hospital.\n\nOne important aspect of his pandemic strategy was a success, however. An early White House bet to invest big in vaccine development by private firms and scientists, under the title of Operation Warp Speed, put the US in better position than many other industrialized nations.\n\nThe coronavirus destroyed the roaring economy Trump had hoped to ride to reelection, leaving as his most important achievement the shaping of a conservative Supreme Court majority, which has already dramatically altered American society with its overturning of Roe v. Wade and could last a generation.\n\nBut history will most remember him for his two impeachments, both following abuses of power designed to manipulate the free and fair elections that are at the root of America’s democratic system in order to prolong his tenure in office.\n\nThe House select committee investigating the insurrection has uncovered damning evidence in Trump’s inner circle about his behavior in the run-up to January 6 and during the insurrection. Former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson, for instance, testified that chief of staff Mark Meadows said Trump thought Vice President Mike Pence deserved the calls for him to be hanged by insurrectionists. There was also evidence of Trump’s vicious pressure on local officials and election workers in states such as Georgia.\n\nYet there remain questions about whether the committee will be able to hold accountable a man who has always dodged responsibility in a wild and whirling life in business, reality television and politics.\n\nEven if the committee advises the Justice Department that prosecuting Trump is merited, it’s unknown whether the evidence it has collected would be sufficient to secure a conviction. And Attorney General Merrick Garland would be faced with a massive dilemma given the extraordinary implications of bringing criminal charges against an active presidential candidate.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/11/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/politics/liz-cheney-justice-department-january-6-ccntv/index.html", "title": "Cheney says DOJ not prosecuting Trump if there's evidence could ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWyoming Rep. Liz Cheney said if the Justice Department does not prosecute former President Donald Trump for his role in the insurrection at the US Capitol and “the facts and the evidence are there,” the decision could call into question whether the United States can “call ourselves a nation of laws.”\n\nIn an interview with CNN’s Kasie Hunt, Cheney – the GOP vice chair of the House select committee investigating the events surrounding the January 6, 2021, insurrection – said Trump is “guilty of the most serious dereliction of duty of any president in our nation’s history” and pointed to a judge who’s said he likely committed crimes. She said the House committee is “going to continue to follow the facts. I think Department of Justice will do that. But they have to make decisions about prosecution.”\n\n“Understanding what it means if the facts and the evidence are there, and they decide not to prosecute – how do we then call ourselves a nation of laws? I think that’s a very serious, serious balancing,” Cheney said.\n\n“The question for us is, are we a nation of laws? Are we a country where no one is above the law? And what do the facts and the evidence show?” Cheney said.\n\nShe sidestepped questions about whether Trump being prosecuted by President Joe Biden’s Justice Department would only add to his strength with the Republican Party’s base ahead of the 2024 presidential bid that Trump has repeatedly teased.\n\n“I don’t think that it’s appropriate to think about it that way,” said Cheney, who’s facing a Trump-backed challenger in a primary later this month.\n\nShe alluded to Judge David Carter, a federal judge in California who ordered right-wing attorney John Eastman to turn over 101 emails from around January 6, 2021, writing in March that he “finds it more likely than not that President Trump corruptly attempted to obstruct the Joint Session of Congress on January 6, 2021.”\n\n“I think he’s guilty of the most serious dereliction of duty of any president in our nation’s history,” Cheney said of Trump. “You’ve had a federal judge in California say that it’s more likely than not that he and John Eastman committed two crimes.”\n\nCheney’s comments come as the House panel prepares for a busy August. A committee spokesperson also said last week that the committee intended to share 20 transcripts with the Justice Department, a move that comes as the department’s criminal investigation into January 6 is heating up.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney is interviewed by CNN's Kasie Hunt in Laramie, Wyoming, on Wednesday. Rachel Woolf for CNN\n\nThe House committee is preparing to release its final report ahead of November’s midterm elections.\n\nCheney faces a series of Trump-aligned challengers in her August 16 primary, including the Trump-endorsed Harriet Hageman, a former Wyoming national Republican committeewoman who has advanced conspiracy theories about the 2020 election.\n\nCheney is the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney. Her reelection campaign unveiled an ad on Thursday in which the former vice president lays into Trump over his lies about widespread fraud in the 2020 election.\n\n“He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him,” the former vice president says in the spot.\n\n“He is a coward. A real man wouldn’t lie to his supporters. He lost his election and he lost big. I know it, he knows it and, deep down, I think most Republicans know it,” Dick Cheney adds.\n\nLiz Cheney wouldn’t say whether her father has urged her to run for president in 2024.\n\n“Look, Dick Cheney is a big Liz Cheney supporter,” she said.\n\nShe said the former vice president shares “this real sadness, frankly, about what’s happening to our party, and a real despair about how it could be that so many Republicans would refuse to stand up and tell the truth.”\n\n“And it is a scary moment for the nation,” she added.\n\nCheney says more to come from the committee this fall\n\nLiz Cheney, who has courted Democratic voters in Wyoming’s primary, said she doesn’t see the House committee’s work through the lens of political outcomes.\n\nCheney said the House panel will continue to lay out evidence in the coming months and that she expects the committee to “have an opinion” about making criminal referrals to the Justice Department.\n\n“There’s much more that we have not yet shared in hearings and that we anticipate we will share in the fall,” she said. “And we will also make decisions about criminal referrals. And ultimately, the decision about prosecution’s up to the Justice Department. But I would anticipate that the committee will have an opinion on it.”\n\nCheney said that during the committee’s probe, she has learned that Trump’s effort to block the 2020 election results were “a more sophisticated and broader-reaching effort than I understood coming into it.”\n\n“I think all of us on the committee have had that same reaction, which is that there’s so much, there was so much more that was happening in multiple different areas, whether it was the pressure on state officials or the pressure on the Justice Department” or efforts to push former Vice President Mike Pence to reject some states’ electoral votes.\n\n“The volume of information has been more than I expected,” she said.\n\nCheney praised Pence for rejecting the pressure from Trump. She said Pence, who, as vice president oversaw the session of Congress in which electoral votes were officially counted, “was a hero on January 6.”\n\n“It’s very clear that there was tremendous pressure from a number of different places on him. And he did his duty and he didn’t succumb to that pressure and if he had succumbed to that pressure, things would have been very different,” she said. “And so I think that that we owe him gratitude for how he conducted himself and for his refusal to do what Donald Trump wanted him to do, which would have been illegal.”\n\nCheney faces voters on August 16\n\nCheney said she expects to win her primary in less than two weeks, despite her opponents attacking her role on the committee.\n\n“I don’t expect to lose. I’m working hard to earn every single vote and, ultimately, I really believe that the people of Wyoming fundamentally understand how important fidelity to the Constitution is; understand how important it is that we fight for those fundamental principles on which everything else is based,” she said.\n\nHowever, the congresswoman also made clear that she is not tempering her criticism of Trump at all – even if it costs her the House seat that her father held and that she has held since 2017.\n\n“We’re in a situation where former President Trump has betrayed the patriotism of millions and millions of people across our country, and many people here in Wyoming, and he’s lied to them,” she said. “And what I know to do is to tell the truth, and to make sure that people understand the truth about what happened and why it matters so much.”\n\nAsked why she thinks voters believe Trump, Cheney added: “It’s just consistent lying about what happened about the election, playing on people’s patriotism. And he’s so dangerous that, you know, my view is that at the end of the day, if defending the Constitution against the threat that he poses means losing a House seat, then that’s a sacrifice that I’m willing to make. I don’t intend to lose. But some things are more important than any individual office or political campaign.”\n\nCheney would not discuss her political plans after this month’s primary. But she said she will do “whatever is necessary” to keep Trump from becoming the GOP presidential nominee for a third consecutive election in 2024.\n\nShe said she intends to be “a big part of making sure that we protect the nation” from Trump, whether she wins reelection or not.\n\nCheney also urged members of both parties to band against GOP candidates who have advanced Trump’s lies about election fraud and are seeking to take over the election machinery of key states this fall.\n\nRepublicans in recent months have nominated candidates who have embraced Trump’s lies about election fraud for offices that control the election machinery in a series of states, including some of the nation’s most competitive presidential battlegrounds: Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania. The party has also endorsed an election denier for the top elections post in Michigan.\n\n“I don’t think anybody should vote for any election denier,” Cheney said. She cast defeating those candidates as critical to stopping Trump from circumventing the will of American voters if he is nominated for president in 2024.\n\n“I think we have to make sure that we come together and form alliances across party lines, to make sure that the people that we are electing are not going to unravel the republic,” she said.\n\nCheney lambasted Democrats for meddling in GOP primaries to boost election deniers that they think will be less viable general election candidates, as was the case in the primary defeat this week of Republican Rep. Peter Meijer of Michigan, one of the 10 Republicans in the House who voted to impeach Trump following the insurrection. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee pumped more than $300,000 into television ads to boost Trump-endorsed John Gibbs against him.\n\nCheney said Democrats’ involvement in the race was “terrible.”\n\n“All of us, again, across party lines, have got to make sure that we are supporting people who believe fundamentally in our democratic system,” she said. “And so I think that it’s inexplicable and wrong for the Democrats to be funding election deniers, particularly against one of the 10 Republicans who so bravely stood up and did the right thing.”\n\nCLARIFICATION: This headline and story have been updated to clarify the conditions that Cheney thinks would call into question the US as a “nation of laws” and to include additional information from the interview.", "authors": ["Eric Bradner"], "publish_date": "2022/08/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/18/politics/justice-department-trump-special-counsel/index.html", "title": "DOJ announces special counsel for Trump-related Mar-a-Lago and ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland on Friday appointed a special counsel to oversee the criminal investigations into the retention of national defense information at former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort and parts of the January 6, 2021, insurrection.\n\nBoth investigations implicate the conduct of Trump, who on Tuesday declared his candidacy in the 2024 presidential race, making him a potential rival of President Joe Biden.\n\n“Based on recent developments, including the former president’s announcement that he is a candidate for president in the next election, and the sitting president’s stated intention to be a candidate as well, I have concluded that it is in the public interest to appoint a special counsel,” Garland said at the Justice Department on Friday.\n\nJack Smith, the former chief prosecutor for the special court in The Hague, where he investigated war crimes in Kosovo, will oversee the investigations.\n\nSmith “has built the reputation as an impartial and determined prosecutor,” Garland said.\n\nTrump has sought to paint the investigations as politically motivated, including at his Tuesday presidential announcement, where he said he was the victim of a “weaponization” of the justice system.\n\nSpeaking at the America First gala at Mar-a-Lago on Friday night, the former president called the special counsel appointment an “appalling announcement” and a “horrendous abuse of power.”\n\nThe Mar-a-Lago probe burst into public view when the FBI executed a search warrant on Trump’s Florida resort in August. Trump went to court to secure an order requiring that a third attorney review the materials seized in the search. Documents marked as classified were excluded from that review by an appellate court, allowing for their use in the criminal probe. Investigators have also brought witnesses before a federal grand jury that has been empaneled in DC in the probe.\n\nThe prosecutions of those who physically breached the US Capitol have been the most public aspect of the Justice Department’s January 6 probe, and those will remain under the purview of the US Attorney’s office in Washington, DC. But behind the scenes, prosecutors have subpoenaed scores of witnesses close to the former president for documents and testimony in the probe.\n\n“I intend to conduct the assigned investigations, and any prosecutions that may result from them, independently and in the best traditions of the Department of Justice,” Smith said in a statement Friday. “The pace of the investigations will not pause or flag under my watch. I will exercise independent judgment and will move the investigations forward expeditiously and thoroughly to whatever outcome the facts and the law dictate.”\n\nInvestigations heating up\n\nAccording to multiple sources, both the Mar-a-Lago investigation and the January 6 investigation around Trump are aiming to gather more information and bring witnesses into a federal grand jury in the coming weeks. Prosecutors sent out several new subpoenas related to both investigations in recent days, with quick return dates as early as next week.\n\nSome of the witnesses being pursued in this round had not spoken to the investigators in these cases before, according to some of the sources.\n\nMany in Trump’s orbit had believed and hoped that the investigation had slowed or even halted, as they hadn’t heard from the Justice Department for weeks after meeting their subpoena document deadlines, multiple sources said.\n\nSome of the subpoenas issued in the probe have indicated a wide-ranging investigation that touches on nearly all aspects of the efforts to overturn Biden’s electoral victory. They signaled that investigators are interested in the plot to put forward fraudulent electors in states Biden won, the work Trump allies did to push baseless election fraud claims and how money flowed to support those various efforts.\n\nTrump’s team had been discussing in recent days the likelihood that the Justice Department would appoint a special counsel, multiple sources familiar with the talks told CNN.\n\nTrump’s lawyers had been dreading the prospect, concerned it could drag out the investigation they have fought continuously in court. And Trump himself has complained about the matter, likening the prospect to former special counsel Robert Mueller, who oversaw the Russia investigation.\n\nThe former president on Friday indicated that he had believed federal investigations into him were slowing down or over until the announcement from Garland. He repeatedly called the investigations political and said it was not a fair situation and would not be a fair investigation, telling the crowd at Mar-a-Lago, “You’d really say enough is enough.”\n\nJustice Department officials had been debating for weeks whether to appoint a special counsel, CNN previously reported.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Tierney Sneed Evan Perez", "Tierney Sneed", "Evan Perez"], "publish_date": "2022/11/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/16/politics/charging-trump-fundraising-election-lies-high-bar/index.html", "title": "Charging Trump for fundraising off election lies would face high bar ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nWhile the House January 6 committee is making its case to the American public that then-President Donald Trump ripped off donors with false fundraising pitches after the 2020 election, prosecutors would face higher hurdles if they were to pursue a criminal fraud case in court.\n\n“Is it a grift? Yeah, it’s a grift. But is a grift always illegal? Not necessarily,” said Paul Pelletier, a former federal prosecutor who previously led the Justice Department’s fraud section.\n\nOne state attorney general, New York’s Letitia James, has already said she will investigate the committee’s allegations of fraud and potential misconduct. “The new details revealed tonight related to January 6 are disturbing,” James tweeted hours after the committee’s findings were made public this week. “It’s my duty to investigate allegations of fraud or potential misconduct in New York. This incident is no exception.”\n\nDuring its hearing on Monday, the committee outlined a startling set of financial figures, alleging Trump had raised $250 million off false claims that the election was stolen. Much of that money was raised through dozens of daily email blasts sent between the election and January 6, 2021, with many donations coming in amounts of $20 or less, the committee said.\n\nDonors were encouraged to contribute to a so-called “Official Election Defense Fund,” which did not exist and was simply a term used for marketing, the committee said. Most of the money ultimately went toward a PAC, called Save America, formed less than a week after the election, that distributed it to other political ventures. Some of the funds landed with the company that organized the January 6 rally and even to the Trump family business, the committee said.\n\n“The big lie was also a big ripoff,” said Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California, one of the Democrats on the panel.\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat who’s the committee’s chair, told CNN on Tuesday that there was still a question as to whether Trump and his family were themselves trying to benefit from the fundraising.\n\n“Obviously, quite a bit of the money went to the Trump Hotel. It went to non-profits associated with people who work for the President. And obviously, this was not the intent that a lot of the fundraising emails were being sent. So clearly, they were misled at best. And in some instances, they were just patently untrue,” Thompson said.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland has already promised, in a speech marking the one-year anniversary of the attack on the Capitol, that the Justice Department will examine the financing behind the insurrection.\n\nA high bar to clear\n\nYet if the federal prosecutors were to pursue a case, they’d need to answer many unknowns that the House left unanswered in its short presentation on Monday – and think through the implications of charging a fundraising operation for a sitting president running for reelection.\n\n“In a normal situation, could you get people charged criminally? Of course,” said Adav Noti, legal director of the Campaign Legal Center, a non-profit government watchdog. “This is not a normal situation. We’re talking, at the time, the sitting president of the United States. That’s not a run-of-the-mill decision for the Department of Justice to make.”\n\n“Did people who gave that money think they were putting it into a perpetual account that could be drawn on by the campaign organizers for whatever they wanted? Maybe the donor wouldn’t care about that, but the law cares,” said Noti.\n\nAs in all investigations, any potential criminal case would turn on the evidence, former prosecutors say.\n\n“There are two big complications off the bat” with bringing a criminal case based on the fundraising emails, said Elie Honig, a former federal and state prosecutor who’s a CNN senior legal analyst. “What does the fine print say, and you have to tie the fraud specifically to whoever you want to charge.” In the case of Trump, he could be layers removed from the person who wrote and sent the fundraising email, Honig said.\n\nProsecutors would also face questions of whether there are victims willing to be witnesses in the case, and who, if anyone, intended to use the fundraising effort as a bait and switch.\n\nA fine-print disclosure on Trump’s fundraising blasts stating that the money may go to a “recount account” only if a donation reached nearly $10,000 could further complicate a possible case.\n\nOther former public integrity prosecutors and white-collar attorneys agreed the possibility of a wire fraud criminal investigation looks clear – but bringing a case may not be as simple as it seems.\n\n“I think the legal jeopardy for Trump world is pretty clear,” Daniel Goldman, a lawyer who worked on the case against Trump during his impeachment proceedings related to January 6, said on CNN on Tuesday. “Presumably Donald Trump didn’t know that he was getting $250 million on a bogus claim. But it’s harder to prove that with actual evidence than it is just to assert that.”\n\nGoldman outlined how prosecutors would need to find donors and nail down that they had intended to donate to a legal defense fund, and that they had been victimized by having their money sent toward an unadvertised purpose.\n\n“You’d show the legal defense fund doesn’t exist. And you basically got a criminal case. It’s a pretty textbook case of wire fraud,” Goldman said. “The more difficult thing is to attach this to Donald Trump.”\n\nState prosecutors could be a likely route\n\nIf the Justice Department ultimately didn’t pursue the accusations, state-level law enforcement may be interested in them. James, in New York, who has built her political persona around conducting a years-long investigation into the Trump Organization, is already signaling that route.\n\nState attorneys general have consumer protection law they could deploy to investigate whether any donors were misled by the campaign solicitations, and they have recently focused on fundraising tactics involving the Trump campaign.\n\nIn an important test case of the scope of state attorneys general’s power to investigate federal fundraising practices, four states, including New York, won a key ruling earlier this year related to WinRed, a company that processes online donations.\n\nFour attorneys general – from New York, Connecticut, Maryland and Minnesota – opened investigations into WinRed after The New York Times published an article detailing how the Trump campaign and WinRed used pre-checked boxes to sign donors up to make repeated contributions.\n\nThe states sent subpoenas for records seeking information about clients who used the pre-checked boxes, complaints from donors and refunds that had been provided. WinRed sued to block the subpoenas, arguing that state consumer protection laws were preempted by the Federal Election Campaign Act. The Trump campaign refunded some of the donors.\n\nEarlier this year, a federal judge sided with the attorneys general and dismissed the lawsuit, saying they had the power to investigate federal campaigns.\n\nJustice Department investigation thus far\n\nSo far, there has been no public indication that federal prosecutors are scrutinizing the broader post-election fundraising that largely went to the political action committee Trump controls.\n\nBut the inquiry is wide, according to grand jury requests shared with CNN. The Justice Department’s January 6 grand jury investigation has sought information about Trump rally organizing and the campaign’s use of Trump electors in battleground states where he lost the popular vote.\n\nSeveral months ago, the Justice Department also was looking into fundraising conducted for a different fund, Defending the Republic, which was promoted by the conservative attorney Sidney Powell, who was involved in Trump’s legal challenges after the election. While Powell’s attorney told CNN in January that she was cooperating with the inquiry, it’s unclear where that investigation now stands.\n\nHistorically, the Justice Department has used its public corruption prosecutors to bring cases against political fundraising scams, including in the border wall charity investigation where Steve Bannon was indicted. Trump pardoned Bannon at the end of his presidency.\n\nIn the We Build the Wall case the alleged deception was explicit and the men took steps to try to conceal their wrongdoing, according to the indictment.\n\nProsecutors allege the men falsely told the public in donor solicitations, public statements and on social media that “100% of the funds raised” would be used for construction of the wall and not a “penny” would be used to compensate Brian Kolfage, a US veteran working with Bannon on the wall effort. Instead, prosecutors alleged, Kolfage and Bannon used shell companies to route hundreds of thousands of dollars to themselves, which were used to cover personal expenses. Kolfage pleaded guilty in April and is awaiting sentencing.\n\nThe Manhattan District Attorney’s Office is investigating Bannon and whether he violated state laws with his role in the fundraising effort, CNN has reported. Recently, several people in Bannon’s “immediate circle” were subpoenaed to appear before a state grand jury, sources told CNN.\n\nAsked previously about the grand jury subpoenas, Bannon’s attorney Robert Costello told CNN: “I am unaware of these matters.”\n\nIn other schemes, sometimes known as “scam PACs,” prosecutors say the misdirection is often brazen. In one, a Maryland political consultant took in donations for specific purposes to support candidates. Yet he never intended to spend the money on what was advertised, and instead put donations toward asking for more donations. He received a prison sentence of three years.\n\nIn another case announced last year, three men associated with PACs were accused of soliciting donations for 2016 presidential candidates, but the money went to benefit them personally. One of the three men has pleaded guilty.", "authors": ["Katelyn Polantz Kara Scannell", "Katelyn Polantz", "Kara Scannell"], "publish_date": "2022/06/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/31/politics/trump-delaying-2024-decision/index.html", "title": "Trump weighs delaying 2024 decision as political and legal troubles ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nDonald Trump is considering waiting until after the November midterms to launch a third presidential campaign as he navigates a widening array of legal troubles and mounting concerns that some of his hand-picked Senate candidates may be weaker than he once thought, sources familiar with his thinking tell CNN.\n\nAfter months of eyeing Labor Day weekend as the target launch date for a 2024 campaign, Trump has spent the past few weeks backing away from that timeline following the FBI search of his Mar-a-Lago estate and an increased panic among Republicans that the party may not be in for the red wave it has long anticipated this November.\n\nWhile his timeline could shift again between now and November, the onslaught of political and legal concerns has the former President feeling nervous about prematurely diving into the 2024 primary, according to nine former and current Trump aides and allies who requested anonymity to discuss internal matters.\n\nThe arguments from advisers wanting him to take his time with a campaign announcement have varied. Believing he will be the undisputed front-runner regardless of when he announces, some have said that if he launches another White House bid too early, he will run out of money around the time Republicans host their nominating convention, leaving him cash-strapped and vulnerable during the general election.\n\nBetter to address the legal fallout from the FBI search first, other advisers have told Trump and his team.\n\n“Everyone was operating under the assumption that shortly after Labor Day would be the best possible time to launch, but that has changed and he’s being told to deal with the FBI stuff first,” said a Trump adviser.\n\nOtherwise, advisers say, the former President is more likely to be blamed for potential losses in the midterms if he becomes a candidate for president before November and his legal troubles distract from the bread-and-butter issues most Republicans – but especially those running in competitive races – would prefer to focus on.\n\nAs Trump-backed Senate candidates in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Arizona struggle to eclipse their opponents in fundraising and recent polls, a growing number of Trump confidants have shared concerns with him that a pre-midterm announcement would be weaponized by Democrats, who remain eager to distract from inflation and rising crime and are well-versed already in using Trump as a campaign foil.\n\n“There is a direct tie if Trump becomes a campaign ad in November and Republicans lose the Senate, and the last thing he wants is to be blamed,” said a former Trump campaign aide.\n\nTrump himself has started complaining in private about Mehmet Oz’s performance in the Pennsylvania Senate contest and a spate of bad press that Georgia Senate hopeful Herschel Walker generated earlier this summer when it became public that he had fathered several children out of wedlock despite routinely criticizing absentee fathers, this aide said.\n\nIn the days after federal investigators searched his waterfront residence in early August, Trump was inundated with calls from allies urging him to announce his bid for president immediately.\n\n“It was so hot,” said one Trump ally, describing the surging support Trump encountered among both grassroots supporters and top Republicans after he revealed the FBI had searched his home.\n\nBut as the legal battle over records seized during the search continues to play out and new details emerge about the sheer volume of classified records Trump was apparently storing haphazardly at Mar-a-Lago, others in Trump’s orbit have urged him to put any campaign announcement on hold until he addresses his legal woes. The FBI warrant unsealed earlier this month revealed three possible federal crimes as reason for the search: violations of the Espionage Act, obstruction of justice and criminal handling of government records. In a late Tuesday court filing, the Justice Department said documents were “likely concealed and removed” from a storage room at Mar-a-Lago as part of an effort to “obstruct” the FBI’s investigation. Trump, who has not been charged with a crime, has repeatedly denied wrongdoing while boasting that the FBI search has buoyed his 2024 prospects and sent a jolt of energy through his political base.\n\nAnother Trump adviser who had previously pushed for a pre-November campaign announcement has since recanted, joining those who believe that waiting until after the midterms is a more prudent approach.\n\n“There’s no urgency because he’s not going to be outshined by someone else,” said former Trump campaign aide Bryan Lanza, pointing to the crowd of potential 2024 rivals who rushed to Trump’s defense – or lobbed sharp criticism at the Justice Department – after learning that federal investigators had executed a search warrant at his home.\n\n“I personally feel like it’s a sign of weakness if he announces before the midterm,” said Matt Schlapp, a top Trump ally who chairs the American Conservative Union. Trump had previously considered a pre-midterm announcement as one way to clear the field of prospective challengers, something that Schlapp and others now say he no longer needs to worry about.\n\nSome in Trump world still want him to announce now\n\nDespite Trump being counseled by a growing number of advisers to delay his campaign announcement until later this fall or winter, not everyone in his inner circle has been convinced that that’s the right move.\n\nOne source close to Trump dismissed the escalating political and legal concerns as “excuses,” arguing that the former President is already being blamed for the shifting midterm forecast and putting off a presidential campaign launch is unlikely to inoculate him from further criticism among Republicans if the party either fails to win the Senate or disappoints in its overall gains.\n\n“They are going to blame him no matter what, so he should just announce,” this person said.\n\nPeople familiar with Trump’s thinking said he has been more receptive to postponing his campaign announcement until after the midterms in part because of the way Republicans rallied behind him following the FBI search. The former President has recently told allies he doesn’t think he will face a formidable challenger in the 2024 GOP primary, according to three people familiar with his comments, one of whom said Trump has been quick to point out how Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis compared the FBI search to “Banana Republic” tactics. DeSantis is widely expected to be a top primary rival if he runs for the nomination against Trump.\n\n“He’s up to his eyeballs in legal troubles but that hasn’t stopped him from totally relishing this,” said a second person close to the former President, who requested anonymity for fear of retribution.\n\nSo far, the consensus among Republican operatives two years out from the 2024 election is that Trump is unlikely to face a real primary threat even though he is widely expected to field challenges from a handful of GOP hopefuls. Former Vice President Mike Pence, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan are some of the likeliest rivals Trump could face if he does run again.\n\nSchlapp, who believes Trump will indeed attract primary competitors, said none would be “serious in terms of being able to win the nomination.” He added that Trump’s outrage over the FBI search will give him something to tap into if and when he does announce a third presidential campaign.\n\n“Sometimes I think he’s better the more acrimonious he gets,” Schlapp said, claiming that Trump’s early August appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Dallas was a turning point for some Republicans who were previously on the fence about his desire to mount a comeback bid after losing to Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nTwo days before federal investigators conducted their search of Mar-a-Lago, Trump used the speech to complain that he is “always being persecuted.”\n\nOne of the Trump advisers took it a step further, suggesting that an indictment of Trump by the Biden administration “would be beneficial” to the former President at this juncture.\n\n“It would just appear too partisan at this point,” this adviser said.\n\nBiden, who has insisted he had no advance warning of the search, has stressed the independence of the Justice Department. But Trump has frequently taken to his social media platform to blast what he’s called a politically motivated “witch hunt” and railed against the FBI and Biden, including in a frenzy of posts on Truth Social on Tuesday alone.\n\nPrioritizing his legal fights\n\nWhile Trump hasn’t made a firm timing decision yet as he mulls a 2024 bid, his lack of planning for a campaign rollout has signaled to those around him that he wants to bide his time.\n\nUntil adding former Florida Solicitor General Chris Kise to his legal defense team on Tuesday, Trump had been struggling to navigate the legal jeopardy he finds himself in as federal investigators sift through the classified documents they seized from his residence – possibly building a criminal case in the process.\n\nThose around him say Trump appears to be putting his political ambitions on the backburner – if only temporarily – to give his legal team space to operate and strategize without the time constraints that a presidential campaign would demand. The former President has spent the three weeks since the FBI conducted its search at Mar-a-Lago trying to capitalize on the moment politically, while his attorneys have meanwhile struggled to develop a clear strategy. His legal team waited until weeks after the search, for example, to file a so-called special master request for an independent review of the materials taken from his home, which is the subject of a hearing this week.\n\n“Right now, it’s a question of whether he wants to turn everything political or gain some legal stability to make sure everything turns out OK before taking that next step,” said one of the Trump advisers.", "authors": ["Gaborr Kristen Holmes", "Kristen Holmes"], "publish_date": "2022/08/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/11/politics/trump-campaign-fundraising-super-pac/index.html", "title": "What a third White House campaign might mean for Donald Trump ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe stark video that former President Donald Trump shared on his Truth Social platform this week following the FBI search of his Florida estate had all the makings of a traditional presidential campaign ad.\n\nIt melded Trump’s words decrying high inflation and a messy US withdrawal from Afghanistan with videos of violent crime and war.\n\n“But soon, we will have greatness again,” Trump intoned.\n\nThe video is just one recent example of the former President hinting broadly at a 2024 campaign without formally declaring a bid for the White House. But even as Trump’s allies urge him to speed up a campaign announcement in an effort to blunt his deepening legal troubles, moving forward could constrain his ability to tap into the vast war chest he has amassed since leaving the White House, campaign finance experts say.\n\nHere’s a look at Trump’s fundraising operations and some of the regulatory and legal hurdles he could face as he plots a third presidential campaign:\n\nHow is Trump currently raising money?\n\nThe former President controls a well-funded political operation that includes a super PAC – which can raise and spend unlimited sums – along with several traditional political action committees.\n\nAt the heart of Trump’s political operation is Save America, the leadership PAC that he established within days of losing the presidential election in November 2020 that collected massive sums in the waning days of his administration.\n\nAlthough Trump’s fundraising pace has slowed some in 2022, Save America ended June with more than $103 million remaining in its cash reserves, according to its latest filing with the Federal Election Commission (FEC).\n\nThat’s an unprecedented stockpile of political money for a former president and amounts to nearly three times the cash that the Republican National Committee had remaining in its coffers at June’s end.\n\nAs he did during his presidency, Trump has relied on small-dollar donations to fuel his political operation.\n\nAnd he continues to bombard his supporters daily with pleas for cash. One text used the recent FBI search at his Mar-a-Lago estate to ask supporters to “rush in a donation IMMEDIATELY to publicly stand with President Trump against this NEVERENDING WITCH HUNT!”\n\nDeclaring a third run likely would super-charge Trump’s fundraising – although it risks drawing attention and money away from other Republicans on the ballot in this fall’s midterm elections.\n\nRonna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, has cautioned against any presidential contender stepping on the midterms.\n\n“I would say to any candidate, let’s not skip over what is going to be one of the most important and consequential midterms in our country’s history,” McDaniel said recently on Fox. “We need to get behind these House candidates and these Senate candidates and make sure we win in November.”\n\nHow do leadership PACs and super PACs differ from presidential campaign committees?\n\nSuper PACs can raise unlimited amounts of money from individuals, unions and corporations and must operate independently of the candidates they support. Presidential campaigns, however, are barred from accepting union and corporate money and face strict contribution caps.\n\nLeadership PACs also face contribution limits. They are generally established to allow politicians to support other candidates. But over the years, they’ve become campaigns-in-waiting for presidential contenders – providing a source of political contributions to pay staffers, underwrite travel and other political expenses.\n\nThe rules on spending by leadership PACs are far more relaxed than those for campaign committees. The FEC does not restrict politicians from using donors’ contributions to leadership PACs to pay personal bills.\n\nHow would a campaign affect payments for Trump’s mounting legal expenses?\n\nAs a presidential contender, Trump’s spending would face heightened scrutiny because it is “illegal to convert campaign money to the personal use of the candidate,” said Adav Noti, a former Federal Election Commission lawyer who is senior vice president and legal director of the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center\n\nIt would violate campaign finance laws, for instance, for Trump to use donations to his presidential campaign to pay legal fees for personal or business matters that are not directly related to his candidacy, such as the New York attorney general’s civil investigation into the Trump Organization’s finances, Noti added.\n\nBut money raised by Trump’s presidential campaign could pay legal bills connected to his conduct as a candidate or officeholder, said Richard Briffault, a Columbia Law School professor and an expert on campaign finance law.\n\nThe Republican National Committee has paid some of Trump’s fees related to the New York probe, citing his role as “a leader of our party.” But an RNC official recently told CNN that those payments are expected to end should he become a 2024 candidate, under the party’s “neutrality policy.”\n\nCan Trump use Save America’s money to run a traditional presidential campaign?\n\nFor the most part, no.\n\nSave America cannot transfer unlimited sums directly into his campaign coffers. As a general rule, PACs cannot donate more than $10,000 over a two-year election cycle to any single candidate.\n\n“We’ve never had a former president with a leadership PAC before, much less with nine figures sitting in it,” Noti said. “But the law, at least, is clear that it can’t go to the campaign.”\n\nCould Trump transfer the millions in Save America to a super PAC that backs his candidacy?\n\nNoti argues that rolling Save America’s money into a super PAC also would be prohibited if the super PAC is focused solely on advancing Trump’s presidential ambitions.\n\nBut other election law experts say a candidate might push the envelope.\n\nFor instance, a recent 3-3 deadlock at the FEC – in a case that turned on whether Florida Rep. Byron Donalds had broken campaign laws aimed at keeping big pots of money at the state level out of a federal super PAC – could provide a blueprint for a candidate to move leadership money to a super PAC.\n\nTransferring a candidate’s leadership PAC money into a super PAC that benefits that candidate “clearly violates the intentions” of the law, Briffault said, but “it’s not clear that anyone would blow the whistle on that.”\n\nAnd Fred Wertheimer, of the Democracy 21 watchdog group, said with the FEC’s six-member panel often deadlocked, “There’s no enforcement.”\n\nWhen does Trump become a candidate?\n\nTrump has not declared his candidacy and has not filed any paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to register as a 2024 presidential contender.\n\nBut campaign finance watchdogs argue that Trump has been skirting campaign finance laws for some time by talking and acting like a candidate without formally registering as one and complying with federal fundraising and spending limits.\n\nJust consider his public statements: Back in February at the Conservative Political Action Conference Trump said of another presidential campaign: “We did it twice and we’ll do it again. … We’re going to be doing it again a third time.”\n\nAnd, as CNN’s Melanie Zanona reported, Trump told a group of House Republicans attending a dinner at his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf club recently that he’s “made up his mind” about launching a 2024 presidential bid and it’s just a matter of “when” he announces it, according to one attendee, Indiana Rep. Jim Banks.\n\n“If you walk like a duck, sound like a duck, are a duck, you are supposed to register as a candidate,” said Stephen Spaulding, a former Federal Election Commission lawyer who is now senior counsel for policy at the watchdog group Common Cause.\n\nTrump has “clearly bent over backwards to hint about what his intentions are,” Spaulding said.\n\nTrump spokesman Taylor Budowich did not answer a question from CNN about the former President’s potential announcement and said he failed “to see the news value of the opinions of leftist campaign finance ‘experts’ or Democrat-funded organizations.”\n\nPoliticians often delay their announcements because they lose their ability to coordinate activities with super PACs and other outside organizations once they formally become a candidate, experts say.\n\n“What we’ve seen over the last several election cycles is candidates basically pretend they are not candidates,” Noti said, “so they can get their super PACs and their outside (groups) up and running.”\n\nA Democratic super PAC, American Bridge 21st Century, has pressed regulators at the Federal Election Commission to take Trump to task for his all-but-declared candidacy, with no success.\n\nLast month, American Bridge filed a federal lawsuit in an effort to force agency action, but it appears unlikely the case will be resolved in time to influence the 2024 election.", "authors": ["Fredreka Schouten"], "publish_date": "2022/08/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/03/politics/doj-trump-investigation-expansion-special-counsel/index.html", "title": "Exclusive: DOJ mulling potential special counsel if Trump runs in 2024", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nAs Donald Trump inches closer to launching another presidential run after the midterm election, Justice Department officials have discussed whether a Trump candidacy would create the need for a special counsel to oversee two sprawling federal investigations related to the former president, sources familiar with the matter tell CNN.\n\nThe Justice Department is also staffing up its investigations with experienced prosecutors so it’s ready for any decisions after the midterms, including the potential unprecedented move of indicting a former president. Top aides to Trump have been eyeing the third week of November as an ideal launch point for his campaign, with two sources telling CNN on Friday morning that the team has specifically discussed November 14.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the election, the Justice Department has observed the traditional quiet period of not making any overt moves that may have political consequences. But behind the scenes, investigators have remained busy, using aggressive grand jury subpoenas and secret court battles to compel testimony from witnesses in both the investigation into Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election and his alleged mishandling of national security documents kept at his Palm Beach home.\n\nNow federal investigators are planning for a burst of post-election activity in Trump-related investigations. That includes the prospect of indictments of Trump’s associates – moves that could be made more complicated if Trump declares a run for the presidency.\n\n“They can crank up charges on almost anybody if they wanted to,” said one defense attorney working on January 6-related matters, who added defense lawyers have “have no idea” who ultimately will be charged.\n\n“This is the scary thing,” the attorney said.\n\nTrump and his associates also face legal exposure in Georgia, where Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis is investigating Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election in the Peach State and expects to wrap her probe by the end of the year.\n\nIndicting an active candidate for the White House would surely spark a political firestorm. And while no decision has been made about whether a special counsel might be needed in the future, DOJ officials have debated whether doing so could insulate the Justice Department from accusations that Joe Biden’s administration is targeting his chief political rival, people familiar with the matter tell CNN.\n\nSpecial counsels, of course, are hardly immune from political attacks. Both former special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation and special counsel John Durham’s investigation into the origins of the FBI’s Russia probe came under withering criticism from their opponents.\n\nThe Justice Department declined to comment for this story.\n\nBringing on a brain trust\n\nThe Justice Department has brought in a brain trust for high-level advice on the Trump investigations, according to people familiar with the moves.\n\nThe Department of Justice building on Thursday, Aug. 18, 2022 in Washington, DC. Kent Nishimura/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images\n\nTop Justice officials have looked to an old guard of former Southern District of New York prosecutors, bringing into the investigations Kansas City-based federal prosecutor and national security expert David Raskin, as well as David Rody, a prosecutor-turned-defense lawyer who previously specialized in gang and conspiracy cases and has worked extensively with government cooperators.\n\nRody, whose involvement has not been previously reported, left a lucrative partnership at the prestigious corporate defense firm Sidley Austin in recent weeks to become a senior counsel at DOJ in the criminal division in Washington, according to his LinkedIn profile and sources familiar with the move.\n\nThe team at the DC US Attorney’s Office handling the day-to-day work of the January 6 investigations is also growing – even while the office’s sedition cases against right-wing extremists go to trial.\n\nA handful of other prosecutors have joined the January 6 investigations team, including a high-ranking fraud and public corruption prosecutor who has moved out of a supervisor position and onto the team, and a prosecutor with years of experience in criminal appellate work now involved in some of the grand jury activity.\n\nTaken together, the reorganization of prosecutors indicates a serious and snowballing investigation into Trump and his closest circles.\n\nGarland’s big decision\n\nThe decision of whether to charge Trump or his associates will ultimately fall to Attorney General Merrick Garland, whom President Joe Biden picked for the job because his tenure as a judge provided some distance from partisan politics, after Senate Republicans blocked his Supreme Court nomination in 2016.\n\nAttorney General nominee Merrick Garland at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Jack Gruber/USA Today\n\nSeveral former prosecutors believe the facts exist for a potentially chargeable case. But Garland will have to navigate the politically perilous and historic decision of how to approach the potential indictment of a former President.\n\nIn March, Garland avoided answering a CNN question about the prospect of a special counsel for Trump-related investigations, but said that the Justice Department does “not shy away from cases that are controversial or sensitive or political.”\n\n“What we will avoid and what we must avoid is any partisan element of our decision making about cases,” Garland said. “That is what I’m intent on ensuring that the Department decisions are made on the merits, and that they’re made on the facts and the law, and they’re not based on any kind of partisan considerations.”\n\nGarland’s tough decisions go beyond Trump. The long-running investigation of Hunter Biden, son of the president, is nearing conclusion, people briefed on the matter say. Also waiting in the wings: a final decision on the investigation of Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz, after prosecutors recommended against charges.\n\nIt likely won’t take long after the midterms for focus to shift to the 2024 presidential race. That could incentivize top DOJ officials to make crucial charging decisions as quickly as possible, including whether to bring charges against Trump himself or other top political activists, other sources familiar with the Justice Department’s inner workings say.\n\n“They’re not going to charge before they’re ready to charge,” one former Justice Department official with some insight into the thinking around the investigations said. “But there will be added pressure to get through the review” of cases earlier than the typical five-year window DOJ has to bring charges.\n\nGeorgia complications\n\nMatters could also be complicated by the situation in Georgia, where Willis is investigating Trump’s efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election there. Willis has said she’s aiming for a special grand jury to wrap up its investigative work by the end of the year.\n\nWillis has observed her own version of a quiet period around the midterm election and is seeking to bring witnesses before the grand jury in the coming weeks. Sources previously told CNN indictments could come as soon as December.\n\nKey Trump allies, including South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows are among witnesses that have tried to fight off subpoenas in the state probe into efforts to interfere with the Georgia 2020 election.\n\nHow those disputes resolve in Georgia – including whether courts force testimony – could improve DOJ’s ability to gather information, just as the House Select Committee’s January 6 investigation added to DOJ’s investigative leads from inside the Trump White House.\n\nA not-so quiet period\n\nThe months leading up to the election have provided little respite from the political and legal activity around the investigations. The DC US Attorney’s Office – which is still shouldering the bulk of the January 6 investigations – has dealt with burnout in its ranks, as prosecutors are taking to trial or securing guilty pleas from more than 800 rioters who were on the grounds of the Capitol and still look to charge hundreds more.\n\nTrump has also foiled the DOJ’s efforts to keep things quiet in the weeks leading up to the election, leading to a steady barrage of headlines related to the investigation.\n\nTrump’s legal team successfully put in place a complicated court-directed process for sorting through thousands of documents seized from Mar-a-Lago, to determine whether they’re privileged and off limits to investigators. But the Justice Department and intelligence community have had access for weeks to about 100 records marked as classified that Trump had kept in Florida.\n\nThe outcome of the intelligence review of those documents may determine if criminal charges will be filed, according to one source familiar with the Justice Department’s approach.\n\nYet in both investigations, under-seal court activity never subsided, with the Justice Department trying to force at least five witnesses around Trump to secretly provide more information in their grand jury investigations in Washington, DC, CNN has previously reported.\n\nOn Tuesday a federal judge ordered Trump adviser Kash Patel to testify before a grand jury investigating the handling of federal records at Mar-a-Lago, according to two people familiar with the investigation.\n\nJudge Beryl Howell of the DC District Court granted Patel immunity from prosecution on any information he provides to the investigation— another significant step that moves the Justice Department closer to potentially charging the case.\n\nThis story is breaking and will be updated.", "authors": ["Evan Perez Katelyn Polantz Jeremy Herb", "Evan Perez", "Katelyn Polantz", "Jeremy Herb"], "publish_date": "2022/11/03"}]}

I went to Paradise Valley Christian School in kindergarten and first grade. Mrs. Dalton was my first-grade teacher and that's when I started becoming a conscious adult. (laughs). So yeah, I have a lot of memories there. I remember it always being so extremely hot. But I also lived in Lake Havasu, actually. So I've lived in a couple places in Arizona. But Scottsdale has always been a really beautiful place in my mind. I have hiked Camelback Mountain. You are talking to a Super Bowl performer who has hiked your mountain. So I know about you guys a bit.\"\n\n9/27: Paramore\n\nParamore’s Tour Two is playing Comerica Theatre in Phoenix on Sept. 27.\n\nThe tour is in support of “After Laughter,” their first album in more than four years.

Produced by Justin Meldal-Johnsen and Paramore’s own Taylor York, the album also marks the return of original Paramore member Zac Farro. Billboard declared the song “Hard Times” to be “an addictive, Talking Heads-inspired jam that sounds like it could follow ‘Ain’t It Fun’ as a Hot 100 smash,” while Rolling Stone praising “Told You So” as “polyrhythmic funk-pop.” And Variety raved about the album: “Paramore has never sounded — or looked — more defiantly joyous... ‘After Laughter’ sounds like it’s about when life kicks you in the gonads. Instead of crying about it, hopefully Paramore will come back fighting and chop life’s head clean off.”\n\n9/24 Fleet Foxes\n\nFleet Foxes are bringing Beach House to Comerica Theatre on Sept. 24.\n\nTickets go on sale at 10 a.m. Friday, May 12, at livenation.com and ticketmaster.com.\n\nThe tour is in support of their forthcoming followup to 2011’s “Helplessness Blues,” a rustic gem whose more inspired moments felt like Brian Wilson writing harmonies for Crosby, Stills & Nash.\n\nThe much-anticipated “Crack-Up” hits the streets on June 16.\n\nThe lead single, a majestic chamber-folk suite called \"Third of May / Ōdaigahara,\" made our playlist of best March singles. In an interview with Pitchfork, Robin Pecknold talked about the inspiration for the single – his relatoinship with Skyler Skjelset, the childhood friend with whom he formed Fleet Foxes in 2006. The date in the title refers to May 3, 2011, the release date of “Helplessness Blues,” their previous effort, after which they embarked on a lengthy hiatus. It’s also Skjelset’s birthday. “It addresses our distance in the years after touring that album, the feeling of having an unresolved, unrequited relationship that is lingering psychologically,\" Pecknold said. \"Even if some time apart was necessary and progressive for both of us as individuals, I missed our connection, especially the one we had when we were teenagers, and the lyrics for the song grew out of that feeling.”\n\n9/26: Imagine Dragons\n\nImagine Dragons are launching their tour in support of “Evolve” at Talking Stick Resort Arena on Sept. 26 with special guests Grouplove and K.Flay.\n\n“Evolve” is set to be released June 23.

TIME called “Believer” “another showstopper of an anthem,” while Entertainment Weekly noted its “thudding tribal drums, a massive shout along chorus, and a wicked bassline that’s the sonic equivalent of a slug to the gut.”\n\nVerified pre-sale goes from 10 a.m. Monday, May 15 to 10 p.m. Thursday, May 18.

To charge by phone, call 480-847-4681. All tickets are subject to facility and ticketing surcharges. All ages welcome.\n\nNow celebrating more than 50 years of touring, Rush's impact on the American music scene has been profound. He helped shape the folk revival in the '60s and the renaissance of the '80s and '90s, his music having left its stamp on generations of artists. Rush’s early recordings introduced the world to the work of Joni Mitchell, Jackson Browne and James Taylor, and in more recent years his Club 47 concerts have brought artists such as Nanci Griffith and Shawn Colvin to wider audiences when they were just beginning to build their own reputations.\n\nRush began his musical career in the early '60s playing the Boston-area clubs while a Harvard student. The Club 47 was the flagship of the coffee house fleet, and he was soon holding down a weekly spot there, learning from the legendary artists who came to play, honing his skills and growing into his talent. He had released two albums by the time he graduated. Rush displayed then, as he does today, an uncanny knack for finding wonderful songs, and writing his own - many of which have become classics re-interpreted by new generations. Signed by Elektra in 1965, Rush made three albums for them, culminating in “The Circle Game,” which, according to Rolling Stone, ushered in the singer-songwriter era.\n\nPepsi Amphitheater season\n\nLooking to beat the Phoenix heat while taking in an outdoor concert?

And that means more seats have been added for the show.\n\nThe additional tickets go on sale at 11 a.m. Monday, May 8 at the Celebrity Theatre, 440 N. 32nd St., in Phoenix, or online at celebritytheatre.com. To charge by phone, call 602-267-1600 ext. 1. All tickets are subject to facility and ticketing surcharges. All ages welcome.\n\nWilson launched the “Pet Sounds” tour last year to honor the 50th anniversary of the Beach Boys’ finest hour with two fellow Beach Boys – Al Jardine and Blondie Chaplin – joining in the celebration (although Matthew Jardine, Al’s son, would go on to be the MVP with those amazing high notes when the tour played Phoenix last year).\n\nReleased on May 16, 1966, “Pet Sounds” is among the most acclaimed recordings in the history of rock and roll, with NME, Uncut and Mojo all declaring it the greatest album of all time. And with good reason.\n\nWilson started working on the \"Pet Sounds\" sessions while the other Beach Boys were off touring on the hits. Inspired by the Beatles’ “Rubber Soul,” he set out to create a masterpiece that marked a huge departure from the classic Beach Boys sound, although he’d hinted at the new direction in the more ambitious moments of “Today.”\n\n“It’s really been a trip to sit here and think about releasing Pet Sounds 50 years ago,” Wilson says. “I love performing this album with my band and look forward to playing it for fans all across the world.”\n\nIn addition to a full performance of the classic album, Wilson will be treating fans to highlights of his 54-year career with the Beach Boys as well as solo cuts.\n\nIn my review of last year’s show, I wrote:\n\nIt’s a magical — at times transcendent — night, an opportunity to witness Wilson reconnect as best he can with “Pet Sounds” in a 50th anniversary celebration of an undisputed masterpiece whose legacy hasn’t endured so much as blossomed with each passing year.\n\nIt’s a beautiful album whose bittersweet charms are heightened, in a way — made more cathartic and more poignant — by those obvious reminders that the man who poured his heart and soul into the making of that masterpiece has never been the same. Could never be the same. Will never be the same.\n\nAnd here he was revisiting “You Still Believe in Me,” “I’m Waiting For the Day,” “God Only Knows,” “I Know There’s an Answer,” “I Just Wasn’t Made for These Times,” the heartache, the longing, the vulnerability he brought to those recordings duly underscored by the realities of Wilson’s life.\n\nThis was especially true of his vocal on “Caroline, No,” the album’s final song, on which a girlfriend’s haircut is the catalyst for a heartbreaking ballad about wishing he could go back to the way things used to be.\n\nHe’s assembled a stellar assortment of backing musicians for the tour, including fellow Beach Boy Al Jardine, who actually appears on “Pet Sounds,” and another former Beach Boy, Blondie Chaplin, who joined in the ‘70s.\n\nThere were 10 or 11 musicians on stage, including several multi-instrumentalists, allowing him to capture every richly textured nuance of the album — French horn, xylophone, saxophone, bass harmonica, electrotheremin, several keyboards, flute and a wide assortment of percussion instruments.\n\nThat also meant a wealth of vocalists on hand to reconstruct those awe-inspiring harmonies, with Matt Jardine emerging as the evening's MVP on that front, nailing every key falsetto part.\n\n7/19: Chris Isaak\n\nChris Isaak returns to the Celebrity Theatre on Wednesday, July 19th, for an 8 p.m. show.\n\nTickets ($60 and $90) go on sale at 10 a.m. this Friday, May 5 at the Celebrity Theatre, 440 N. 32nd St., Phoenix, celebritytheatre.com and 602-267-1600 ext. 1.\n\nThe star has worn his share of hats since \"Wicked Game\" turned up in David Lynch's \"Wild at Heart.” He’s been a talk-show host, a sitcom star, a SWAT commander in \"The Silence of the Lambs,\" No. 68 on of VH1's list of sexiest artists and a singer whose music continues to embody the qualities that made his early records so evocative.\n\n\"First Comes the Night,\" his latest effort, finds Isaak channeling the sound and spirit of the Sun recording artists he saluted on \"Beyond the Sun,\" especially Roy Orbison and Elvis Presley, while sounding more timeless than retro.\n\n“My last release was ‘Beyond The Sun’ — my tribute to Sun Records with a lot of covers,” Isaak says. “So this time around I had a lot of new material that I was thrilled to record.”\n\nThis is the first time album Isaak has written and recorded so much in Nashville, a change in location he explored partly upon the suggestion of his friend Stevie Nicks. For all the firsts, there’s a strong through-line that continues from Isaak’s earlier triumphs like “Silvertone” (1985) and “Heart Shaped World” (1989).\n\n“I guess you can make a drink with many ingredients, but if one is very strong, that’s what you taste,” says Isaak with a laugh. “For better or worse, I have a tendency to dominate because I have a big voice and some twisted ideas.”\n\nAs for the show, expect the usual mixture of pathos and humor from Isaak and his band.\n\nDoors open at 6 p.m All tickets are subject to a surcharge.\n\n10/31: Halsey\n\nSpend Halloween with Halsey when the singer brings her U.S. tour to Talking Stick Resort Arena on Oct. 31 with PartyNextDoor and Charli XCX.\n\nThe eight-week tour is in support of Halsey’s second album, “hopeless fountain kingdom,” out June 2.\n\nPre-sales run May 8 through May 11 at hfktour.com, with general on-sale scheduled for May 12.

As the press release says, “OML isn’t bigger, louder, or more avant-garde, it’s more human.”\n\nThe set list will combine their biggest hits and songs from the new album.\n\n“Our fans know how much love we put into our live show,” says guitarist Brad Delson. “They know how much we enjoy the connection when we play a fan favorite on stage.

Tickets for the newly scheduled dates will go on sale on May 5. Tickets held for previous “Unbreakable” tour events that are now re-scheduled will be honored at the new dates. For more information please visit livenation.com.\n\nThe legendary entertainer began her sold out “Unbreakable” tour in August 2015, but just one year ago reached out directly to fans via Twitter with news of her focusing on starting a family, confirmed months later with the arrival of her first child. Jackson has taken the past year to enjoy pregnancy and motherhood, and is now ready to return to the live stage to give the fans everything they could hope for in one epic concert event. The State of the World Tour is a continuation of the “Unbreakable” tour and will include fan favorites from her chart-topping “Unbreakable” album, an array of the socially conscious music she’s released throughout her career, and other smash hits and soon-to-be released new tracks with a state of the art live production.\n\nJackson has won six Grammys, two Emmys, a Golden Globe Award and a nomination for an Academy Award along with dozens of American Music Awards, MTV Video Music Awards and Billboard Music Awards. She has received accolades as an actress as well, including the NAACP Best Supporting Actor award. With sales of more than 160 million records worldwide, Jackson stands as one of the best-selling artists of all time with a string of hits that have left an indelible impression on pop culture.\n\n7/14: Anthony Hamilton\n\nGrammy-winning neo-soul singer Anthony Hamilton will play the Celebrity Theatre at 8:30 p.m. Friday, July 14.\n\nTickets ($41, $51 and $61) are on sale now at Celebrity Theatre or online at www.celebritytheatre.com. To charge by phone, call 602-267-1600 ext.1.\n\nIt's been 13 years since a slow-burning ballad called \"Charlene” hit the pop charts, positioning North Carolina-born Hamilton as a major player in the soul revival a year after singing the hook on the Nappy Roots' rap track \"Po' Folks\" earned the singer his first Grammy nomination. And although he hasn't had much luck crossing over to the pop charts since that debut single, Hamilton's still making good on the artistic promise of those early records on his latest album, last year’s “What I’m Feelin’.”\n\nOther song of note include “Can’t Let Go,” which topped the Adult R&B charts, and “You Got the Love I Need,” a collaboration with Al Green for which he won a Grammy.\n\n10/14: Harry Styles\n\nHarry Styles of One Direction is playing Comerica Theatre on Oct. 14.\n\nTickets go on sale at 10 a.m. Friday, May 5 at ticketmaster.com and the Comerica box office. Fan registration for all North American dates has already begun through Ticketmaster’s Verified Fan program. Supplies are limited, further information here.\n\nStyles’ self-titled debut album will be released globally on Friday, May 12. The 10-track album features the lead single “Sign of the Times,” which topped the charts in more than 84 countries the day it was released. The album was executive produced by Jeff Bhasker, with additional production from Alex Salibian, Tyler Johnson and Kid Harpoon.\n\nStyles began to showcase the live show with his debut performance on NBC’s “Saturday Night Live,” where he premiered the album track “Ever Since New York” and the single “Sign of the Times,” with an additional performance of the single on BBC talk show “The Graham Norton Show.” He is set for upcoming appearances on NBC’s “Today Show Summer Concert Series” May 9, followed by a week-long residency on CBS’ “The Late Late Show with James Corden” May 15-18.\n\n11/18: Fall Out Boy\n\nTalking Stick Resort Arena in downtown Phoenix is the final stop on the “M A N I A” tour for Fall Out Boy on Saturday, Nov. 18.\n\nPre-sale tickets will be available beginning Monday, May 1. General tickets will be available at 10 a.m. Friday, May 5, at ticketmaster.com.\n\nOne dollar of every ticket sold will benefit a number of Chicago-area charities via the newly launched Fall Out Boy Fund.\n\nThe news of the tour was accompanied by the release of “Young and Menace,” the first taste of their seventh album, “M A N I A,” which is set to arrive Sept. 15.\n\nPete Wentz says, “There’s a lyric in the song, ‘trying to send the world a message, I was young and a menace,’ that reminded me of growing up in the suburbs of Chicago. I didn't look like anyone there or feel like anyone – I felt like an outsider in my own town. It wasn't until I discovered punk rock and that community that I realized I did fit in somewhere in this world – with the other people who didn't fit in. It’s hard to rationalize rage – it’s hard to quantify anxiety ... this song does neither, it embraces the wave.\"\n\nThe album is their follow-up album to “American Beauty/American Psycho,” a platinum effort that debuted at No. 1 on Billboard in early 2015.\n\n7/12: Kendrick Lamar\n\nKendrick Lamar is launching The DAMN. Tour at Gila River Arena in Glendale on Wednesday, July 12, with Travis Scott and D.R.A.M.\n\nThe DAMN. Tour follows a spectacular appearance at Coachella, which you can read about in our review here, and the release of his critically acclaimed fourth album, “DAMN.,” his third release to hit the charts at No. 1, selling more than 603,000 album units.\n\nPitchfork hailed “DAMN.” As “a widescreen masterpiece of rap, full of expensive beats, furious rhymes, and peerless storytelling about Kendrick’s destiny in America” while Rolling Stone called it “a dazzling display of showy rhyme skills, consciousness-raising political screeds, self-examination and bass-crazy-kicking.”\n\nTickets go on sale to the general public starting at 10 a.m. Friday, April 28. For complete presale details and ticket information, please visit www.ticketmaster.co\n\n7/18: Earth, Wind & Fire with Chic\n\nEarth, Wind & Fire and CHIC ft. Nile Rodgers will bring 2054 The Tour to Talking Stick Resort Arena on July 18 with a DJ and a specialized seating configuration toward the front of the stage where seats will have additional space between them to encourage fans to dance, dance, dance, dance as Chic would put it (yowzah, yowzah, yowzah)\n\nTickets go on sale at 10 a.m. Friday, April 28, at www.ticketmaster.com. American Express cardholders will have access to presale tickets in select cities beginning 10 a.m. Monday, April 24.

Get your feet ready for a deluge of hits,\" says Rodgers, who was honored with an Award for Musical Excellence from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Earth, Wind & Fire were inducted in 2000.\n\n11/4: Sebastian Maniscalco reschedules\n\nSebastian Maniscalco has postponed his Celebrity Theatre stop on the Why Would You Do That? tour, originally scheduled for this Friday, April 21, to Saturday, Nov. 4.\n\nWhy would he do that?\n\nManiscalco shared a note with fans on social media.\n\n\"I would do anything for my fans who support me tremendously,\" the comic writes. \"Anything but miss the birth of my first child! WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?! Phoenix, I will have to reschedule this weekend’s show because baby Maniscalco is on the way! I’ll see you guys on November 4th instead! Thank you for understanding.\"\n\nAll tickets will be honored on the new date.\n\n10/5 Flaming Lips and Mac DeMarco\n\nThe Flaming Lips and Mac DeMarco are playing Comerica Theatre on Thursday, Oct. 5.\n\nThe Lips last played the Valley last October at the Arizona State Fair, a magical night to which I responded in my review (which you can read in its entirety just by clicking these words):\n\n“It takes a certain breed of entertainer to lead the members of an audience on an emotional journey from the smile-inducing spectacle of ‘Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots, Pt. 1,’ with Wayne Coyne surrounded by giant inflatables, including Santa Claus, to the existential majesty of ‘Do You Realize??,’ which brought me to tears.\n\nAnd I’m pretty sure the Flaming Lips would be the only actual entertainers in that certain breed.\n\nCoyne is such a bizarre, enigmatic performer, giving into the silliest aspects of the task at hand, with his bag of confetti, his smoke gun and his crazy jacket with strands of multi-colored lights hanging like extra-long fringe, while gleefully spreading his message of peace and love and making the most of the moment you’re in because ‘you realize that everyone you know someday will die.’”\n\nTickets are on sale at ticketmaster.com, the Comerica Theatre box office and 800-745-3000.\n\nThe Canadian singer-songwriter most likely to perform nude (with apologies to Gordon Lightfoot), DeMarco is touring an album titled “This Old Dog,” his much-anticipated followup to “Another One.”\n\nDeMarco is known for two things – songs that reach inside your soul and force you to reflect on what you’ve done and how you plan to make it right, and being a total goof onstage. A bit Paul Westerberg in that respect. And as Smokey Robinson, who may not have been writing specifically about DeMarco, could tell you, “There’s some sad things known to man / But ain't too much sadder than the tears of a clown.”\n\nI caught his set last Friday at Coachella, writing:\n\n“He mocked his placement on the bill. ... He brought out former bassist Pierce McGarry for an extended bit in which the bassist kept insisting he was actually Orlando Bloom. … He joked about King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard, whose set had preceded his own on that stage. And he joked with a fan in the audience about his hat. ... As for the music, it was often as sublime as his behavior was ridiculous, from 'Salad Days' through 'On the Level.' \"\n\n9/10: Florida Georgia Line with Nelly\n\nFlorida Georgia Line will bring Nelly and Chris Lane to Ak-Chin Pavilion on Sunday, Sept. 10.\n\nGet tickets at at ticketmaster.com.\n\nThe country duo and Nelly are touring together, of course, because of their collaboration on the remix of “Cruise,” a bro-country landmark that five years later, remains the biggest-release digital release the country genre has ever produced.\n\nFour subsequent Florida Georgia Line followed “Cruise” to No. 1 on Billboard’s country charts while going multi-platinum -- \"Stay,\" the Luke Bryan-assisted \"This is How We Roll,\" \"Dirt\" and \"H.O.L.Y.\" (from their latest album, \"Dig Your Roots\").\n\n7/25: Buckingham McVie\n\nLindsey Buckingham and Christine McVie of Fleetwood Mac: The Rumours Years are headed to Phoenix in support of their first album as a duo, playing Comerica Theatre on Tuesday, July 25, with the Wallflowers.\n\nThe 10-song album is due to hit the streets June 9, preceded by a single, “In My World,” available now.\n\nThe collaboration began three years ago, when McVie rejoined Fleetwood Mac for their “On With The Show” tour. The duo went in to record new material prior to rehearsals for the tour and their natural creative chemistry was reignited. According to Buckingham, “We were exploring a creative process, and the identity of the project took on a life organically. The body of work felt like it was meant to be a duet album. We acknowledged that to each other on many occasions, and said to ourselves, ‘What took us so long?!!’”\n\nMcVie says, “We’ve always written well together,Lindsey and I, and this has just spiraled into something really amazing that we’ve done between us.”\n\nSessions for the album took place at The Village Studios in Los Angeles, where Fleetwood Mac recorded several of their classic albums, including “Tusk.” Buckingham and McVie were joined in the studio by fellow bandmates Mick Fleetwood and John McVie, who supplied much of the dynamic rhythmic engine.\n\nTickets are on sale at livenation.com.\n\n10/3: The Shins with Spoon\n\nThe Shins and Spoon will be playing four concerts together this year. And one of those concerts is happening right in Phoenix (your reporter is resisting the urge to end that sentence with several exclamation marks).\n\nThe tour hits Comerica Theatre on Tuesday, Oct. 3, in support of two of this year’s most acclaimed releases, the Shins’ “Heartworms” and Spoon’s “Hot Thoughts.” Tickets are $39.50-$50 and available through ticketfly.com.\n\nThe Shins recently headlined the opening night of McDowell Mountain Music Festival, where the songs from that new album, of which there were many, more than held their own against such classics as “Caring is Creepy” and “New Slang.” You can see how that set went, complete with pictures, here.\n\nIn an interview quoted on Pitchfork, James Mercer, the last remaining member of the “Oh, Inverted World” lineup, said the new music is closer to the way they sounded on their first three albums by design.\n\n“I’m really excited about this record,” he said. “I think we’ve got something that Shins fans will really love, and I think there’s some other things on there that are different enough. I made a concerted effort on certain songs to fit the palette, to use the palette that I’ve used historically for the band.”\n\nSpoon’s fourth album in a row to crack the Top 10, “Hot Thoughts,” was released to just the sort of hyperventilating praise you can expect from critics when a new Spoon album hits the streets. And with good reason. They’ve already given us a number of the century’s best rock releases. And this new one more than lives up to the promise of that legacy. I now defer you to the wisdom of the Consequence of Sound reviewed who suggest that Britt Daniel’s “big statement is his Body of Work, of which every fine part adds up to a greater sum. Here comes another one.”\n\n8/25: Yestival\n\nFresh from taking their long-denied place in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the members of Yes will be bringing a festival called Yestival to the Celebrity Theatre, with Todd Rundgren and Carl Palmer’s ELP Legacy on Friday, Aug. 25.\n\nTickets ($49.50, $89.50 and $125) are available at Celebrity Theatre, 440 N. 32nd St., Phoenix, www.celebritytheatre.com or 602-267-1600 ext. 1.\n\nYes will play a set of greatest hits from every album up to 1980’s “Drama,” showcasing the storied career of one of the world’s most influential, ground-breaking, and respected progressive rock bands.\n\nThat era produced such Yes staples as “Roundabout,” “I’ve Seen All Good People,” “Yours is No Disgrace,” “Long Distance Runaround,” “Heart of the Sunrise” and “Close to the Edge.”\n\n“We are looking forward to presenting songs from each of the first nine studio albums, including some surprises,” says guitarist Steve Howe.\n\nFor the purpose of this tour, Yes will feature Howe, Alan White (drums), Geoff Downes (keyboard), Jon Davison (vocals) and Billy Sherwood (the late Chris Squire’s chosen successor on bass).\n\n10/4: Father John Misty\n\nFather John Misty is playing the Orpheum Theatre in Phoenix on Wednesday, Oct. 4, in support of “Pure Comedy.\"\n\nTickets are on sale at phoenix.ticketforce.com.\n\nThe singer’s darkly comic narratives, often done in character, have marked Misty as his generation’s Randy Newman – not that I see Pixar work in Misty’s future. “Pure Comedy” is guaranteed to figure prominently on the shortlist of the year’s most celebrated albums, a third straight triumph for the singer-songwriter. Mojo said this album lifts him “to another level altogether,” while the Skinny raved: “He embraces the role, plays up to it, uses it to bend and manipulate the parameters of modern rock music and has managed to create something bitingly acerbic and cynical, yet achingly sincere. Again.”\n\nHe topped our playlist of best February singles with a track from “Pure Comedy” called “Ballad of the Dying Man,” on which he turns his darkly comic eye for detail on a self-important know-it-all who wonders on his deathbed if he’s “successfully beaten back the rising tide of idiots, dilettantes and fools on his watch.”\n\nWeyes Blood opens.\n\n10/8: Scorpions\n\nThe Scorpions Crazy World Tour is bringing Megadeth to Talking Stick Resort Arena on Sunday, Oct. 8.\n\nTickets are $40-$125 at www.dannyzeliskopresents.com.\n\nWhy Crazy World? If you have to ask:\n\n\"When our album 'Crazy World' was released back in '91, right at the end of the Cold War,” Klaus Meine says, “we toured around a world that was pretty crazy back then, but there was so much hope in the air for a more peaceful future. Now, 26 years later, things are getting more crazy every other day. After all these years, Crazy World is still a good motto for our upcoming world tour. We are very much looking forward to seeing all of you out there.\n\nFounded in Hannover, West Germany, in 1965, Scorpions released their debut album, “Lonesome Crow,” released in 1972. They rose to arena status with seminal releases “Lovedrive,” “Virgin Killer” and “Animal Magnetism.” In 1982, they topped the U.S. rock charts with \"No One Like You,\" a soaring power ballad they soon followed with their first Top 40 single, \"Rock You Like a Hurricane.\" Their biggest U.S. hit came later with another ballad, \"Wind of Change.\" They finished 46th on VH1's Greatest Artists of Hard Rock, and \"Rock You Like a Hurricane\" was No. 18 on VH1's list of the 100 Greatest Hard Rock Songs.\n\nThe set will offer a mix of fan favorites and highlights of their 19th studio release, “Return To Forever,” released in 2015 as part of their 50th anniversary festivities.\n\n5/2: New Found Glory\n\nPop-punk veterans New Found Glory are bringing their 20th Anniversary Tour to the Nile Theater in Mesa on May 2. They've been called \"the greatest pop-punk band in history\" by Bad Religion's own Brett Gurewitz, who scooped them up for Epitaph after they walked out on Geffen. Their first album for the label, \"Not without a Fight,\" debuted at no. 12 with Alternative Press declaring it \"a reminder of why we fell in love with NFG in the first place.\" After two albums on Epitaph, they switched to Hopeless for 2014's \"Resurrection,\" which Kerrang! declared \"a powerhouse of a record, the brave onward steps of New Found Glory proving that hope — like pop-punk — is not dead.\"\n\nDetails: 7 p.m. Tuesday, May 2. Nile Theater, 105 W. Main St., Mesa. $24-28. www.niletheater.com.\n\n5/4: Zac Brown Band\n\nThe Zac Brown Band will bring their Welcome Home 2017 tour to Gila River Arena in Glendale.

Genasis and Kap G. In a break with arena tradition, Brown takes the stage at the start of the show and brings his guests out as the party goes, which means you’d do well not to show up late hoping to blow off the opening acts. The R&B star topped the Hot 100 in 2005 with \"Run It!,\" his first single, which went on to be his first of several multi-platinum hit, from the chart-topping \"Kiss Kiss\" to “With You,” \"No Air,\" \"Forever,\" \"Deuces, “Look at Me Now” and “Loyal.”\n\nDetails: 7:30 p.m. Monday, May 15.

Then, he added five more trophies to his mantel at the 2016 Academy of Country Music Awards. How does he do it? By being really good.

Given countries’ current promises, Earth’s temperature will climb to between 2.1 and 2.9 degrees Celsius by 2100.\n\nUltimately, the world needs to cut its fossil fuel emissions nearly in half by 2030 to avoid 1.5 degrees, a daunting prospect for economies still very much beholden to oil, natural gas and coal.\n\n“No country has a right to be delinquent,” US Climate Envoy John Kerry told reporters in October. “The scientists tell us that what is happening now – the increased extreme heat, extreme weather, the fires, the floods, the warming of the ocean, the melting of the ice, the extraordinary way in which life is being affected badly by the climate crisis – is going to get worse unless we address this crisis in a unified, forward-leaning way.”\n\nHere are the top issues to follow at COP27 in Egypt.\n\nA fight over ‘loss and damage’\n\nPeople in Pakistan take refuge from flooding in a makeshift camp on August 31 in the Jaffarabad district of Balochistan province. Fida Hussain/AFP/Getty Images\n\nDeveloping and developed countries have for years tussled over the concept of a “loss and damage” fund; the idea which suggests countries causing the most harm with their outrageous planet-warming emissions should pay poorer countries, which have suffered from the resulting climate disasters.\n\nIt has been a thorny issue because the richest countries, including the US, don’t want to appear culpable or legally liable to other nations for harm. Kerry, for instance, has tiptoed around the issue, saying the US supports formal talks, but he has not given any indication of what solution the country would sign on to.\n\nMeanwhile, small island nations and others in the Global South are shouldering the impact of the climate crisis, as devastating floods, intensifying storms and record-breaking heat waves wreak havoc.\n\nThe deadly flooding in Pakistan this summer, which killed more than 1,500 people, will surely be an example the countries’ negotiators point to. And since September, more than two million people in Nigeria have been affected by the worst flooding there in a decade. At this very moment, Nigerians are drinking, cooking with and bathing in dirty flood water amid serious concerns over waterborne diseases.\n\nLoss and damage will have space on the official COP27 agenda this year. But beyond countries committing to meet and talk about what a potential loss and damage fund would look like, or whether one should even exist, it is unclear what action will come out of this year’s summit.\n\n“Do we expect that we’ll have a fund by the end of the two weeks? I hope, I would love to – but we’ll see how parties deliver on that,” Egypt’s chief climate negotiator Ambassador Mohamed Nasr recently told reporters.\n\nFormer White House National Climate Adviser Gina McCarthy told CNN she thinks loss and damage will be the top issue at the UN climate summit this year, and said nations including the US will face some tough questions about their plans to help developing nations already being hit hard by climate disasters.\n\n“It just keeps getting pushed out,” McCarthy said. “There’s need for some real accountability and some specific commitments in the short-term.”\n\nA tense US-China relationship\n\nXi Jinping, President of the People's Republic of China, left, and John Kerry, US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate. Getty Images/AP\n\nPeople will be watching to see if the US and China can repair a broken relationship at the summit, a year after the two countries surprised the world by announcing they would work together on climate change.\n\nThe newfound cooperation came crashing down this summer when China announced it was suspending climate talks with the US as part of broader retaliation for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan.\n\nKerry recently said the climate talks between the two countries are still suspended and will likely remain so until China’s president Xi Jinping gives the green light. Kerry and others are watching to see whether China fulfills the promise it made last year to submit a plan to bring down its methane emissions or updates its emissions pledge.\n\nThe US and China are the world’s two largest emitters and their cooperation matters, particularly because it can spur other countries to act, too.\n\nCan the world raise enough money?\n\nThis year's UN climate summit is being held in the Egyptian resort city of Sharm El-Sheikh, where thousands of climate negotiators and advocates will gather to raise their ambitions on the climate crisis. Mohamed el-Shahed/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSeparate from a potential loss and damage fund, there is the overarching issue of so-called global climate finance; a fund rich countries promised to push money into to help the developing world transition to clean energy rather than grow their economies with fossil fuels.\n\nThe promise made in 2009 was $100 billion per year, but the world has yet to meet the pledge. Some of the richest countries, including the US, UK, Canada and others, have consistently fallen short of their allocation.\n\nPresident Joe Biden promised the US would contribute $11 billion by 2024 toward the effort. But Biden’s request is ultimately up to Congress to approve, and will likely go nowhere if Republicans win control of Congress in the midterm elections.\n\nThe US is working on separate deals with countries including Vietnam, South Africa and Indonesia to get them to move away from coal and toward renewables. And US officials often stress they want to also unlock private investments to help countries transition to renewables and deal with climate effects.\n\nCountries are straight up off-track\n\nShips carry coal outside a coal-fired power plant in November 2021 in Hanchuan, Hubei province, China. Getty Images\n\nCOP27 is intended to hold countries’ feet to the fire on fossil fuel emissions and gin up new ambition on the climate crisis. Yet reports show we are still off-track to keep global warming under 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n\nA UN report which surveyed countries’ latest pledges found the planet will warm between 2.1 and 2.9 degrees Celsius. Average global temperature has already risen around 1.2 degrees since the industrial revolution.\n\nRecords were set last year for all three major greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nThere is a spot of encouraging news: the adoption of renewable energy and electric vehicles is surging and helping to offset the rise in fossil fuel emissions, according to a recent International Energy Agency report.\n\nBut the overall picture from the reports shows there is a need for much more clean energy, deployed swiftly. Every fraction of a degree in global temperature rise will have stark consequences, said Inger Andersen, executive director of the United Nations Environment Program.\n\n“The energy transition is entirely doable, but we’re not on that pathway, and we have procrastinated and wasted time,” Andersen told CNN. “Every digit will matter. Let’s not say ‘we missed 1.5 so let’s settle for 2.’ No. We must understand that every digit that goes up will make our life and the life of our children and grandchildren much more impacted.”\n\nThe clock is ticking in another way: Next year’s COP28 in Dubai will be the year nations must do an official stocktake to determine if the world is on track to meet the goals set out in the landmark Paris Agreement.\n\nThis story has been updated.", "authors": ["Ella Nilsen"], "publish_date": "2022/11/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/05/middleeast/egypt-protests-crackdown-cop27-intl/index.html", "title": "Egypt faces criticism over crackdown on activists ahead of COP27 ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nEgypt is facing a barrage of criticism over what rights groups say is a crackdown on protests and activists, as it prepares to host the COP27 climate summit starting Sunday.\n\nRights groups have accused the Egyptian government of arbitrarily detaining activists after Egyptian dissidents abroad called for protests to be held against President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi on November 11, during the United Nations climate talks.\n\nAccording to rights groups, security forces have been setting up checkpoints on Cairo streets, stopping people and searching their phones to find any content related to the planned protests.\n\nThe Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF), an NGO, said Wednesday that 93 people had been arrested in Egypt in recent days. It said that according to national security prosecution investigations, some of those arrested have allegedly sent videos calling for protests over social messaging apps. Some were also charged with abuse of social media, spreading false news and joining terrorist organizations – a repressive charge commonly used by the security apparatus against activists.\n\nIndian climate activist Ajit Rajagopal was detained in Cairo last Sunday after setting off on a protest walk from the Egyptian capital to Sharm el-Sheikh, the Red Sea resort where the COP27 conference will be held from November 6 to 18. Rajagopal was released after a brief detention in Cairo along with his friend, lawyer Makarios Lahzy, a Facebook post by Lahzy said. Reuters, which spoke to Rajagopal following his release Monday, cited the Indian activist as saying he was still trying to get accredited for COP27 but did not plan to resume his march.\n\nCNN has reached out to the Egyptian authorities for comment.\n\nEgypt went through two mass uprisings in 2011 and 2013 which eventually paved the way for then-military chief Sisi to take power. Thousands of activists have since been jailed, spaces for public expression have been quashed and press freedom diminished.\n\nWhile protests are rare – and mostly illegal – in Egypt, a looming economic crisis and a brutal security regime have spurred renewed calls for demonstrations by dissidents seeking to exploit a rare window of opportunity presented by the climate summit.\n\nOne jailed activist, British-Egyptian citizen Alaa Abdelfattah, escalated his hunger strike in an Egyptian prison this week, amid warnings by relatives over his deteriorating health. “Alaa has been on hunger strike for 200 days, he’s been surviving on only 100 calories of liquid a day,” said Sanaa Seif, Abdelfattah’s sister, who is staging a sit-in outside the UK Foreign Office in London.\n\nA place for dialogue\n\nCOP, the annual UN-sponsored climate summit that brings together the signatories of the Paris Agreement on combating climate change, is traditionally a place where representatives of civil society have an opportunity to mingle with experts and policy makers and observe negotiations firsthand.\n\nIt is not uncommon to see a young activist approaching a national delegation walking down the corridor to their next meeting or an indigenous leader chatting to a minister on the sidelines of a debate.\n\nAnd while security is always strict – this is, after all, a gathering attended by dozens of heads of states and governments – peaceful protests have always been part of COP. Tens of thousands of people marched through the streets of last year’s host city of Glasgow, Scotland, during the summit.\n\nYet Egypt has tightened the rules on who can access the talks.\n\nAs in the past, this year’s COP conference will take place across two different sites. The official part of the summit is run by the UN and is only accessible to accredited people, including the official delegations, representatives of NGOs and other civil society groups, experts, journalists and other observers.\n\nThen there is a separate public venue where climate exhibitions and events take place throughout the two weeks of the summit. But while this public part of the summit was in the past open to anyone, people wishing to attend this year will need to register ahead of time.\n\nThe chance to protest will also be restricted.\n\nWhile the Egyptian government has pledged to allow demonstrations, it has said protests will have to take place in a special “protest zone,” a dedicated space away from the main conference site, and will have to be announced in advance. Guidelines published on the official COP website say that any other marches would need to be specially approved.\n\nAnyone wanting to organize a protest will need to be registered for the public part of the conference – a requirement that may scare off activists fearing surveillance. Among the rules imposed by the Egyptian authorities on the protests is a ban on the use of “impersonated objects, such as satirical drawings of Heads of States, negotiators, individuals.”\n\nRights groups sound alarm\n\nThe UN has urged Egypt to ensure the public has a say at the conference.\n\nThe UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk said it was “essential that everyone – including civil society representatives – is able to participate meaningfully at the COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh” and that decisions about climate change need to be “transparent, inclusive and accountable.”\n\nSeparately, a group of five independent human rights experts, all of them UN special rapporteurs, published a statement last month expressing alarm over restrictions ahead of the summit. They said the Egyptian government had placed strict limits on who can participate in the talks and how, and said that “a wave of government restrictions on participation raised fears of reprisals against activists.”\n\n“This new wave follows years of persistent and sustained crackdowns on civil society and human rights defenders using security as a pretext to undermine the legitimate rights of civil society to participate in public affairs in Egypt,” the group said in a statement.\n\nA group of Egyptian civil rights groups has launched a petition calling for the Egyptian authorities to end the prosecutions of civil society activists and organizations and end restrictions on the rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly.\n\n“The Egyptian authorities have for years employed draconian laws, including laws on counter terrorism, cyber crimes, and civil society, to stifle all forms of peaceful dissent and shut down civic space,” the groups said in the petition.\n\nHuman Rights Watch, Amnesty International, Friends of the Earth and scores of other groups have also spoken up, demanding the release of detained activists.\n\nIn the lead-up to the climate conference, the Egyptian government presented an initiative pardoning prisoners jailed for their political activity. Authorities also pointed to a new prison, Badr-3, 70 kilometers (43 miles) northeast of Cairo, where other prisoners were moved to purportedly better conditions.\n\nBut rights groups said the government’s initiatives amounted to little change.\n\n“Ahead of COP27, Egypt’s PR machine is operating on all cylinders to conceal the awful reality in the country’s jails, where prisoners held for political reasons are languishing in horrific conditions violating the absolute prohibition of torture and other ill-treatment,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s secretary general.\n\n“Prisoners are facing the same human rights violations that have repeatedly blighted older institutions, exposing the lack of a political will from the Egyptian authorities to bring an end to the human rights crisis in the country.”", "authors": ["Ivana Kottasová"], "publish_date": "2022/11/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/19/world/cop27-egypt-agreement-climate-intl/index.html", "title": "COP27: Summit agrees to help climate victims. But it does nothing to ...", "text": "Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt CNN —\n\nThe world has failed to reach an agreement to phase out fossil fuels after marathon UN climate talks were “stonewalled” by a number of oil-producing nations.\n\nNegotiators from nearly 200 countries at the COP27 UN climate summit in Egypt took the historic step of agreeing to set up a “loss and damage” fund meant to help vulnerable countries cope with climate disasters and agreed the globe needs to cut greenhouse gas emissions nearly in half by 2030.\n\nThe recent devastating floods across Pakistan are just one example of the suffering caused or made worse by the climate crisis. Fida Hussain/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe agreement also reaffirmed the goal of keeping global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.\n\nHowever, an attempt to address the biggest source of the planet warming emissions that are causing the climate crisis ended in a fiasco after a number of nations, including China and Saudi Arabia, blocked a key proposal to phase out all fossil fuels, not just coal.\n\n“It is more than frustrating to see overdue steps on mitigation and the phase-out of fossil energies being stonewalled by a number of large emitters and oil producers,” German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said in a statement.\n\nAddressing the summit early on Sunday morning, the European Union’s Climate Chief Frans Timmermans said the EU was “disappointed” with the final outcome of the summit.\n\n“What we have in front of us is not enough of a step forward for people and planet … we should have done much more,” Timmermans said.\n\nVictory for climate crisis victims\n\nThe agreement to help the world’s most vulnerable countries deal with loss and damage represents a breakthrough, however, in what has been a contentious negotiation process.\n\nIt marks the first time countries and groups, including longtime holdouts like the United States and the EU, have agreed to establish a fund for nations vulnerable to climate disasters made worse by pollution disproportionately produced by wealthy, industrialized nations.\n\nNegotiators and non-governmental organizations observing the talks praised the deal as a significant achievement, after developing nations and small island countries banded together to amplify pressure.\n\n“The agreements made at COP27 are a win for our entire world,” Molwyn Joseph, chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, said in a statement. “We have shown those who have felt neglected that we hear you, we see you, and we are giving you the respect and care you deserve.”\n\nThe creation of the fund also became one of the key demands of activists attending the summit. Unlike in previous years, when huge protests and loud calls for action become part of the event, demonstrations were muted this year.\n\nProtests are rare and mostly illegal in Egypt and the Egyptian government put strict limits on protesters attending the conference.\n\nStill, the biggest protest of the summit saw hundreds of activists marching through the venue last weekend, demanding climate payments. On Friday, 10-year-old Ghanian activist Nakeeyat Dramani received a standing ovation in the plenary after calling on the delegates to “have a heart and do the math.”\n\nClimate activists staged a number of protests during the conference, demanding end of fossil fuels and climate finance. Sean Gallup/Getty Images\n\nThe fund will focus on what can be done to support loss and damage resources, but it does not include liability or compensation provisions, a senior Biden administration official told CNN.\n\nReaching the agreement was not easy. The summit was originally scheduled to end on Friday, but went well into overtime with negotiators still trying to hammer out the details as the conference venue was being dismantled around them.\n\nThe US and other developed nations have long sought to avoid such provisions that could open them up to legal liability and lawsuits from other countries. And in previous public remarks, US Climate Envoy John Kerry had said loss and damage was not the same thing as climate reparations.\n\n“‘Reparations’ is not a word or a term that has been used in this context,” Kerry said on a recent call with reporters earlier this month. He added: “We have always said that it is imperative for the developed world to help the developing world to deal with the impacts of climate.”\n\nDetails on how the fund would operate remain murky. The text leaves a lot of questions on when it will be finalized and become operational, and how exactly it would be funded. The text also mentions a transitional committee that will help nail down those details, but doesn’t set specific future deadlines.\n\nAnd while climate experts celebrated the win, they also noted the uncertainty going forward.\n\n“This loss and damage fund will be a lifeline for poor families whose houses are destroyed, farmers whose fields are ruined, and islanders forced from their ancestral homes,” World Resources Institute CEO Ani Dasgupta said. “At the same time, developing countries are leaving Egypt without clear assurances about how the loss and damage fund will be overseen.”\n\nAn outcome on a fund came this year in large part because the G77 bloc of developing nations stayed unified, exerting increased leverage on loss and damage than in past years, climate experts said.\n\n“They needed to be together to force the conversation we’re having now,” Nisha Krishnan, resilience director for World Resources Institute Africa told reporters. “The coalition has held because of this conviction that we did need to stay together to deliver this – and to push the conversation.”\n\nFor many, the fund represents a hard-fought years-long victory, pushed over the finish line by the global attention given to climate disasters such as Pakistan’s devastating flooding this summer.\n\n“It was like a big buildup,” former US climate envoy Todd Stern told CNN. “This has been around for quite a while and it’s getting all the more aggravating to vulnerable countries because there’s still not a lot of money getting put into it. As we can see the actual disaster impacts of climate change are getting more and more intense.”\n\nThe EU's Frans Timmermans speaks to reporters during the summit. Thomas Trutschel/Photothek/Getty Images\n\nText on 1.5 degrees remains\n\nGlobal scientists have for decades warned that warming must be limited to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels – a threshold that is fast-approaching as the planet’s average temperature has already climbed to around 1.1 degrees.\n\nBeyond 1.5 degrees, the risk of extreme drought, wildfires, floods and food shortages will increase dramatically, scientists said in the latest UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report.\n\nBut while summit delegates affirmed the goal of keeping global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, climate experts expressed dismay about a lack of mention of fossil fuels, or the need to phase them down to keep global temperatures from rising. As it did last year at the Glasgow summit, the text calls for a phasedown of unabated coal power, and “phase-out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies,” but does not go further to call for a phase-out of all fossil fuels, including oil and gas.\n\n“The influence of the fossil fuel industry was found across the board,” Laurence Tubiana, CEO European Climate Foundation, said in a statement. “The Egyptian Presidency has produced a text that clearly protects oil and gas petro-states and the fossil fuel industries. This trend cannot continue in the United Arab Emirates next year.”\n\nIt took some dramatic action to even hold onto the 1.5-degree number struck in Glasgow last year.\n\nOn Saturday, EU officials threatened to walk out of the meeting if the final agreement failed to endorse the goal to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. In a carefully choreographed news conference, Timmermans, flanked by a full line-up of ministers and other top officials from EU member states, said that “no deal is better than a bad deal.”\n\n“We do not want 1.5 Celsius to die here and today. That to us is completely unacceptable,” he said.\n\nThe talks were further complicated by the fact that Kerry, who was leading the US delegation, tested positive for the coronavirus on Friday. He continued to communicate with his team and his foreign counterparts by phone, but his physical absence was noticeable during the crunch time at the summit.\n\nUS Climate Envoy John Kerry gestures toward his Chinese counterpart Xie Zhenhua at the COP27 summit. Nariman El-Mofty/AP\n\nThe US and China resume climate talks\n\nAside from the final agreement, the summit brought several other significant developments including the resumption of formal climate talks between the US and China – the world’s two largest greenhouse gas emitters.\n\nAfter China froze climate negotiations between the two countries this summer, US President Joe Biden and China President Xi Jinping agreed to reestablish US-China communications when they met last week at the G20 summit in Bali, paving the way for Kerry and his Chinese counterpart Xie Zhenhua to meet again formally.\n\n“Without China, even if the US is … moving towards a 1.5-degree program, … if we don’t have China, nobody else can make … that goal,” Kerry told CNN last week.\n\nThe two sides met throughout the second week of COP, trying to pick up where they left off before China suspended the talks, according to a source familiar with the discussions. They were focused on specific action points, such as enhancing China’s plan to reduce emissions of methane – a powerful greenhouse gas – and their overall emissions target, the source said.\n\nUnlike last year, there was no big, joint climate announcement from the two countries. But the resumption of formal communication was seen as an encouraging sign.\n\nLi Shuo, a Beijing-based global policy adviser for Greenpeace East Asia said this COP “saw extensive exchanges between the two sides, led by Kerry and Xie.”\n\n“The challenge is they should do more than talk, [and] also need to lead,” Shuo said, adding the restarted formal dialogue “helps to prevent the worst outcome.”", "authors": ["Ivana Kottasová Ella Nilsen Rachel Ramirez", "Ivana Kottasová", "Ella Nilsen", "Rachel Ramirez"], "publish_date": "2022/11/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/11/01/cop-27-climate-change-summit-starts-sunday-egypt-what-know/10659315002/", "title": "COP27 climate change summit starts Sunday in Egypt: What to know", "text": "COP27 is the annual United Nations meeting of the 197 countries that have agreed to the U.N.

Speaking in London at the release of her book, \"The Climate Book,\" the 19-year-old who has gained global fame in the fight against climate change said the meetings are mostly a chance for \"leaders and people in power to get attention, using many different kinds of greenwashing.\"\n\nAHEAD OF THE SUMMIT:Flurry of climate change reports have ominous message\n\nWATCH:Climate questions — Who is most vulnerable?\n\nHere's what to know about COP27:\n\nWhat is COP27?\n\nCOP27 is the annual United Nations meeting of the 197 countries that have agreed to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, originally adopted in 1992. The meeting is the decision-making body of the countries that signed onto the framework. It is held to assess how well nations are dealing with climate change.\n\nWhat are the dates of COP27?\n\nThe U.N. Climate Change Conference runs Sunday to Nov. 18.\n\nWhere is COP27 being held?\n\nIt's being held in the Red Sea resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh, between the desert of the Sinai Peninsula and the Red Sea. It is known for its sandy beaches and coral reefs and is a major tourist destination for divers. It's pronounced Sharm-el-shake.\n\nWhat does COP27 stand for?\n\nCOP is short for \"Conference of the Parties,\" because it is a conference of the parties or countries that signed the agreement. This is the 27th meeting of all the signatories. The first was in 1995 in Berlin. The numbering is slightly off because COP 26 was postponed for a year because of COVID-19. It's pronounced cop (as in police) 27.\n\nIs COP27 necessary?\n\nBefore the industrial revolution, the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was 280 parts per million. CO2 traps the sun's heat, warming the plant. This year's measurement is 419 parts per million, a number not seen since the Pliocene Epoch 4.1 to 4.5 million years ago. At that time, the sea level was about 78 feet higher than today, the average temperature was 7 degrees Fahrenheit higher than in pre-industrial times, and studies indicate large forests occupied areas of the Arctic that are now tundra, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nCritics have said the entire process of annual meetings and small, incremental and sometimes bureaucratic change is too little, too late. Speaking in London on Sunday, Thunberg said rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented change is needed to deal with global warming.\n\nCOP27 has also been criticized for allowing Coca-Cola, one of the world's largest plastic producers, to be a major sponsor of the event. The company has responded that it is prepared to do its part to fight against climate change.\n\nIs this year's COP especially important?\n\nThose attending would tell you every COP is important.\n\nBut next year's should get even more attention. It will be the first time the nations that signed the Paris Agreement in 2015 (at COP21) will tell the world how well they've implemented their climate plans and identify what still needs to be done. It is being called the Global Stocktake and will be presented at COP28 in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nHEALTH:How climate change is hurting Americans’ health – and what experts suggest we do about it\n\nELECTION:Climate change on ballot in midterms, Boris Johnson drops his return bid: 5 Things podcast\n\nWhat's expected to happen in Egypt?\n\nThis year countries are supposed to deliver updated plans on how they're going to lower their greenhouse gas emissions, something they agreed to do at last year's COP in Glasgow, Scotland.\n\nOnly 23 out of 193 countries have submitted their plans to the U.N.\n\nBecause this COP is being held in Africa, it's expected to include more focus on African issues. This is not the first COP to be held in Africa, however. The 2001 and 2016 meetings were in Morocco, 2006 in Kenya and 2011 in South Africa.\n\nWhat is 'loss and damage' financing, and what does it have to do with COP27?\n\nCOP27 is also supposed to take on \"loss and damage\" financing. That's the controversial question of how poor and vulnerable nations dealing with climate change might be compensated by wealthy countries.\n\nDeveloping countries are demanding some type of global compensation or aid fund, saying their people are living with – and dying from – climate change caused by more developed nations that got wealthy by burning fossil fuels.\n\nWho is attending?\n\nMore than 35,000 people from around the world are expected to be in Egypt at the meeting, from official government delegations to climate activists who are will be corralled into a separate designated protest area away from the conference center. Protests are severely restricted in Egypt.\n\nBiden is expected to attend for at least a day. This will be the first COP after the United States' landmark Inflation Reduction Act was passed in August, the largest single climate action the nation has taken.\n\nKing Charles III of the United Kingdom, a passionate advocate on behalf of the environment before taking the throne in September, has attended previous COPs.

The short protest was mostly silent and did not involve the four activists moving away from their seats.\n\n“And I said I understand, but just to be clear, you guys knew we had no weapons because we have to go through a very extensive security to get into COP in general, and they said, ‘Well, no security is 100%.’ “\n\nThe UNFCCC, the UN body that is sponsoring the talks and is responsible for security in the venue, told CNN on Tuesday the four have been suspended for breaching the conference’s rules. A spokesperson for the UNFCCC said “media actions and publicity events” are only allowed in designated areas, and not inside the conference room.\n\nCNN witnessed three of the activists being denied entry to the venue on Monday afternoon, with UN staff telling them they have been suspended. CNN has asked the White House for comment, but has not heard back.\n\nThe episode is just the latest example of the somewhat heavy-handed approach to protests the UN and the Egyptian government adopted at the conference held in the Red Sea resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh.\n\nClimate activists briefly interrupted Biden's speech on Friday. Sean Gallup/Getty Images\n\nThe four activists had their credentials suspended after the protest. Ivana Kottasova/CNN\n\nThe annual conference has always been seen as the place where activists and members from civil society groups get to interact with government officials and observe negotiations firsthand.\n\nHuge protests and loud calls for action have become part of the event over the years. When climate activists marched through the streets of Glasgow during the COP26 conference last November, it was one of the biggest protests the UK has ever seen. At COP25 in Madrid in 2019, tens of thousands of protesters filled the city center, just as they had the year before in the Polish city of Katowice, the host of COP24.\n\nBut at this year’s iteration of the summit, protesters have mostly been sidelined into spaces far away from the negotiations.\n\nThe biggest protest of the summit so was held inside the conference on Saturday, when a large group of people marched through the venue, demanding rich countries to pay the world’s most vulnerable countries for loss and damage caused by the climate crisis.\n\nBut most other protests have been so small they are almost hard to spot by anyone who doesn’t know they are happening.\n\nA small group of activists has been staging protests around the venue in the past few days, holding up banners calling for plant-based diets as a solution to the climate crisis. On Monday, a group of young protesters from the Fridays for Future took photos at the conference, calling on G20 leaders to act on climate.\n\n“It hurts to say this, but they don’t get attention. There’s so many actions that happen within the COP space that are meaningful – people whose communities, our communities, are affected are speaking about it, and they offer solutions to these problems but there’s no coverage at all,” said Big Wind, climate activist and a member of the Northern Arapaho Tribe.\n\nA protester outside the COP27 venue advocates for veganism as a solution to the climate crisis. Ivana Kottasova/CNN\n\nProtests are rare – and mostly illegal – in Egypt and the Egyptian government said anyone wishing to protest during the summit can only do so in a special dedicated “protest zone” away from the main conference site.\n\nTo access the zone, people need to register, a requirement which may scare off activists fearing surveillance. Among the rules imposed by the Egyptian authorities on the protests is a ban on the use of “impersonated objects, such as satirical drawings of Heads of States, negotiators, individuals.”\n\n“All the meetings that we had, I can only speak for myself, but they were really trying to instill fear in us, you know, it’s such a repressive state … but inside the [conference venue], that is supposed to be UN territory,” said Jacob Johns, another of the group of activists who had been suspended from the conference. “And so for the UN to be denying people free speech in that space that is supposed to be theirs is just, you know, a slap in the face. It’s hypocrisy.”\n\nThis story has been updated with a response from the UNFCCC.", "authors": ["Ivana Kottasová"], "publish_date": "2022/11/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/11/politics/joe-biden-egypt-cop27/index.html", "title": "Biden says US is back as a leader on fighting climate change as he ...", "text": "Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Friday used a short visit to the United Nations climate change summit in Egypt to tell the world the United States was ready to take back its leadership role on fighting a warming planet after the passage of one of the president’s key priorities.\n\nIn a speech to the United Nations COP27 summit, Biden proclaimed the US is back as a global leader on climate change following passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which included around $370 billion in clean energy incentives meant to slash the use of harmful greenhouse gases.\n\n“My friends, I came to the presidency determined to make … transformational changes that are needed, that America needs to make and we have to do for the rest of the world, to overcome decades of opposition and obstacles of progress on this issue alone,” Biden said, “to reestablish the United States as a trustworthy and committee global leader on climate. As I stand here before you, we’ve taken enormous strides to achieve that.”\n\nBiden added that other nations must similarly raise to the challenge.\n\n“To permanently bend the emissions curve, every nation has needs to step up,” he said. “At this gathering, we must renew and raise our climate ambitions. The United States is acting. Everyone has to act. It’s a duty and responsibility of global leadership.”\n\nBiden arrived Friday to the climate summit underway in an Egyptian Red Sea resort eager to highlight major new US investments toward limiting climate change, a sharp difference from the last time he showed up at a climate conference empty handed.\n\nDuring his speech, Biden apologized for the US withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accord under former President Donald Trump, and said he was trying to prove to skeptics that “good climate policy is good economic policy.” He said those steps would drive progress and durable economic growth around the world.\n\nHe highlighted a new proposed rule requiring large federal contractors to develop carbon reduction targets and disclose their greenhouse gas emissions, leveraging the federal government’s purchasing power to combat climate change in the private sector and bolster vulnerable supply chains.\n\nBiden also announced new rules from his administration intended to further clamp down on super-polluting greenhouse gas methane. The Environmental Protection Agency plans to further strengthen an earlier regulation it announced to cut down on methane pollution from the oil and gas sector. As proposed, the updated rule would reduce methane emissions from oil and gas by 87% below 2005 levels.\n\nThe newly enhanced rule would also require oil and gas companies to respond to “credible third-party reports” of large methane leaks. The EPA rule still must go through a public comment process before it’s finalized.\n\nBiden announced new partnerships with foreign nations on cutting methane and several other new international climate initiatives. The US will double a multi-year pledge of adaptation funding to $100 million, and announce new climate partnerships with African and Pacific Island nations.\n\nThe actions the nation is taking means the US will “meet our emissions targets by 2030,” Biden said.\n\n“The climate crisis is about human security, economic security, environmental security, national security and the very life of the planet,” Biden said.\n\nBiden speaks at the COP27 summit on Friday. Kevin Lamarque/Reuters\n\nWorries about Republicans back in Washington\n\nYet many nations who have sent representatives to this week’s conference in Egypt are focused on another matter: demanding climate reparations be paid by wealthy and high-emitting countries like the United States to smaller, poorer nations who have felt the outsized effects of climate change.\n\nIt’s a proposal some European countries have latched onto, and have goaded Biden into supporting. But political constraints both in the United States and elsewhere make significant progress unlikely, at least in the near-term.\n\nBiden has already struggled to gain backing in Congress for global climate resilience funding, which would help low-income nations prepare for the adverse effects of a warming planet, like floods and other extreme events. If Republicans seize control of one or both chambers, the prospects of any new climate legislation over the next two years appears dim.\n\nWhen he was asked by reporters in Egypt how he plans to convince Republicans to fund his climate initiatives, Biden replied: “Reality.”\n\nSpeaking at the climate conference Thursday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi acknowledged that after the midterm contests, Democrats will need to partner with Republicans on taking steps to fight climate change, even as she cast doubt on the opposing party’s willingness to take action.\n\n“Our colleagues said, ‘Why are we having this discussion, there is no climate crisis, it’s all a hoax,’” she said of the GOP reaction to investments meant to combat climate change that were included in the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\n“We have to get over that,” she went on. “I place my confidence in their children, who will hopefully teach their parents that this is urgent, long overdue.”\n\nBiden’s climate envoy John Kerry on Wednesday announced a new plan to raise cash for climate action in the developing world by selling carbon credits to companies wishing to offset their emissions. He said the proposal would help countries decarbonize their energy system. But the plan has already attracted criticism because of the way it will be financed – with money raised in sales of carbon credits, which allow companies to pay for someone else to cut their planet-warming emissions, instead of cutting their own.\n\nBut he was frank in an interview with CNN’s David McKenzie that “there is not enough money in any country in the world to actually solve this problem,” referring to accelerating the energy transition and tackling the climate crisis.\n\nMeeting with El-Sisi\n\nEgyptian leader Abdel Fattah el-Sisi hosts Biden on the sidelines of the COP27 summit Friday. Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMeeting with Egypt’s military-backed leader Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, Biden thanked the host of this year’s COP27 summit for reminding the world of the urgency of the climate crisis.\n\n“It is an urgent crisis and we all have to do considerably more,” Biden said.\n\nHe said with Sisi he would discuss a wide range of issues, including the US-Egypt defense partnership, a more integrated Middle East, and – critically – human rights.\n\nThe president is only expected to be in Egypt for roughly three hours. He is stopping over on his way to other international summits in Asia.\n\nThe ensuing years saw the overthrow of the authoritarian leader Hosni Mubarak during the Arab Spring followed by a period of instability and the elevation to power of el-Sisi, whom Biden’s predecessor Donald Trump once referred to as his “favorite dictator.”\n\nBiden has kept Sisi at arms’ length over the course of his own presidency, and limited some military aid over human rights concerns. Ahead of their meeting, Biden said he was “looking forward to our conversation,” and praised Egypt for supporting Ukraine at the United Nations and for helping broker a ceasefire during a cross-border conflict in Gaza last year.\n\nSpeaking ahead of Biden, el-Sisi also raised the subject of human rights, claiming he’d established a comprehensive approach. The US has previously accused Egypt of a woeful human rights record.\n\nBefore he departed, Biden was urged by human rights activists and a group of House Democrats to raise with el-Sisi the imprisonment of British-Egyptian activist and writer Alaa Abd el-Fattah, who is currently on a hunger strike.\n\nA senior administration official said that the US is “concerned” about the case and that “human rights will feature prominently” in the president’s conversations abroad.\n\nAsked by reporters if he discussed el-Fattah with el-Sisi, Biden said, “What we talked about is the relationship between the United States and Egypt.”\n\nThis is a breaking story and will be updated.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak Ella Nilsen", "Kevin Liptak", "Ella Nilsen"], "publish_date": "2022/11/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/17/africa/cop27-egypt-africa-climate-intl-cmd/index.html", "title": "COP27: Activists hoped Egypt would bring a focus on Africa.

Ivana Kottasova/CNN\n\nThe Egyptian government, which is hosting and presiding over the UN-sponsored climate talks, had promised this year’s summit would finally be the “African COP” that would put the needs of the continent front and center.\n\nUnfulfilled promises\n\nBut according to many representatives of countries across Africa, that promise remains largely unfulfilled.\n\nMohamed Adow, the director and founder of Power Shift Africa, a non-governmental organization focused on accelerating renewable energy there, said at an event on Sunday that the developments so far show the conference was “African in the name only.”\n\nAny hopes that the summit would really focus on Africa were dashed early, when the conference participants denied a request by a group of African governments to include a discussion about the continent’s “special needs and circumstances” on the official agenda.\n\nPhilip Osano, the director of the Africa Center at the Stockholm Environment Institute, told CNN that the recognition of the special circumstances was one of the top three priorities for many African governments, along with climate finance and the clean energy transition.\n\n“Africa contributes less than 4.8% of emissions, but the impacts have now become very serious, that’s why this is a priority item,” he said.\n\n“The bad news is, it’s off the agenda. But it’s very complicated, because other parts of the world – especially small island states, developing countries – everybody is kind of having a special circumstance when it comes to climate.”\n\nMithika Mwenda, the Kenyan co-founder of the Pan African Climate Justice Alliance, said he was “outraged” by the decision not to include the discussion on the agenda. Speaking after the item was struck, Mwenda said the development “set the stage for another COP that will fail millions of Africans dying unjustly” from climate change.\n\nThis year's climate conference was widely billed as \"Africa COP.\" Ivana Kottasova/CNN\n\nPaying for loss and damage\n\nSome of the leaders of countries that are most vulnerable to the climate crisis – many of which are in Africa – have come to Sharm el Sheikh with high hopes that developed countries would finally agree to pay for the loss and damage already caused by climate change.\n\nThe idea is simple: countries that got rich using fossil fuels that have caused the crisis should help those that are most affected by it deal with the devastating consequences.\n\nGoing into the summit, leaders of climate-vulnerable countries said this was their number one priority, and there was hope that a new funding facility could be established this year. But negotiations have proven tough. Some of the richest countries are united in pushing against the idea of setting up a new fund.\n\nThe United States, the European Union and the United Kingdom have all been trying to kick the can down the road, saying they want to establish a “process” that would lead to an “outcome” by 2024.\n\nBut for countries that are seeing their coasts disappear and their people drown in devastating floods or starve because of droughts, that is not good enough.\n\n“We had pledges, statements and commitments. But we need comprehensive proposals. We already have concept notes, we already have proposals, we already have our [emission cutting plans], we need to move into implementations,” Edward Bendu, the chief environmental officer at Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Lands, Country Planning and the Environment, told CNN in an interview at the summit.\n\nBendu, who is representing a country that is among the most impacted by the climate crisis, said that access to existing climate finance is difficult and that the current financing options are not fit for purpose.\n\n“It takes about three four years to access funds,” he said. “That’s too late for us, we can’t address the loss and damage issues that way.”\n\nThere have been some positive movements coming from the summit. Germany has been spearheading a new loss and damage program called the Global Shield that it hopes would make money available faster for countries suffering from weather disasters.\n\nThe EU and several of its member states announced Wednesday they “will provide over €1 billion ($1.04 billion) for climate adaptation in Africa.” The bloc also said it would add €60 million ($62.2 million) to the loss and damage pot.\n\nBut as is often the case with climate finance announcements, the devil is in the detail.\n\nDelving into the figures, it emerged that of the €345 million ($357 million) the European Commission would contribute to the package, only €220 million ($228 million) is a “new commitment,” according to a statement released Wednesday.\n\nThe rest of the €345m was already pledged elsewhere in the past. And as for the €60 million for loss and damage, that money is included in the €220 million rather than being an additional sum. The EU didn’t give a breakdown on the contributions from individual states. CNN has contacted the bloc for comment and more details on the announcement.\n\nFor the developing world, the bottom line remains that the promise of funding remains unfulfilled. Under the Paris Agreement, rich countries pledged to provide $100 billion a year in climate financing to developing world by 2020. Two years after the deadline, the target has still not been met.\n\nEnergy front end center\n\nThe battle over Africa’s future energy infrastructure has emerged as one of the key issues at the summit.\n\nAround 600 million Africans don’t have access to electricity and almost a billion don’t have clean cooking facilities, relying instead on burning solid biomass, kerosene or coal as their primary cooking fuel, according to the International Energy Agency.\n\nExperts and activists are stressing that many African countries are getting locked in fossil fuel investments that are polluting and will likely prove uneconomical in a few years.\n\nIt is not a hypothetical issue. Many of the world’s richest countries are pushing for more fossil fuel investments in several African countries as they try to wean themselves of Russian gas because of the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe German Chancellor Olaf Scholz flew to Dakar earlier this year and held talks with the Senegalese president Macky Sall – the chair of the African Union – about the development of a new offshore natural gas field. And earlier this month, the Italian energy giant ENI started exporting natural gas from a new deep sea gas field in Mozambique.\n\nThese developments are making activists particularly furious.\n\n“It’s a hypocrisy and we are calling it out,” said Omar Elmaawi, a Kenyan activist who has spent years campaigning against the planned East African Crude Oil Pipeline, which is meant to transport oil from Uganda to Tanzania, where it could be sold on international markets.\n\n“Africa has contributed very little to the climate problem, but the fossil fuel companies are using that to their advantage. They say Africa has been left behind and therefore they want to explore the potential so that they can help us develop,” Elmaawi told CNN.\n\n“But that narrative doesn’t hold up because although they’re calling it ‘development’ they want to exploit these resources and send them into the Global North,” he added.\n\nKenyan climate activist Omar Elmaawi poses for a picture at the COP27 summit in Egypt. Ivana Kottasova/CNN\n\nElmaawi said he understood the money big fossil fuel companies are offering may look like a lucrative option to some African governments. But he and his fellow activist say they want their governments to think about the future.\n\n“My assessment has always been either our government leaders are really ignorant and stupid, or, some of them have been compromised and they are not working in the best interest of their people,” he said.\n\nWhat Elmaawi, Adow and other activists want is for the COP27 conference to help African countries foster more investment into renewable energy.\n\nAccording to the IEA, Africa has around 60% of the world’s best solar-energy resources, but only 1% of installed photovoltaic capacity.\n\nAdow said Africa could easily become a renewable energy superpower.\n\nBut instead, he said, “European countries want to turn Africa into their gas station.”", "authors": ["Ivana Kottasová"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2022/11/21/cop-27-climate-change-outcomes-loss-damage-fund/8240761001/", "title": "COP27 outcomes: Loss and Damage Fund, climate change actions ...", "text": "The annual U.N. Climate Change Conference ended in Egypt with a groundbreaking but highly contentious decision: A fund would be created to help poor nations hit hard by climate disasters.\n\nThe meeting was supposed to end Friday night but missed the deadline and went into intense overtime until early Sunday, when delegates finally agreed on a package of decisions.\n\nMeanwhile, delegates from the more than 190 attending sidestepped two other contentious issues by not moving forward with language on the need to phase out all fossil fuels and to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\nWhat was decided at COP27 this year, what wasn't and what mattered? Here's what to know.\n\nWhat is COP27?\n\nCOP27 is the annual United Nations meeting of the 197 countries that have agreed to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, originally adopted in 1992. The meeting is the decision-making body of the countries that signed onto the framework. It is held to assess how well nations are dealing with climate change.\n\nDOES IT DO ANY GOOD? Diplomats are talking about climate change, again\n\nWhat is the 'Loss and Damage' fund?\n\nIn 1991, the tiny island nation of Vanuatu suggested countries that had done the most to cause climate change over the past 250 years should pay to help countries most affected by it.\n\nFinally, this year the member nations of COP agreed to create a \"Loss and Damage\" fund to compensate vulnerable nations as they deal with rising sea levels, massive storms and droughts. The details are still being worked out.\n\nTwo sticking points came from the United States and China:\n\n►Some wealthy nations, including the U.S., had long fought such a fund, worried they could face unlimited liability as the biggest historical emitters of greenhouse gases. In the end, the agreement says nations cannot be held legally liable for previous emissions, assuaging some of those fears.\n\n►China, Brazil, India and South Africa argued developed nations were subjecting them to a double standard – they got rich burning unlimited fossil fuel but now want developing nations to hold back. Others said that as the world's biggest current emitter of greenhouse gases, China shouldn't be eligible for compensation from the fund even though the United Nations still considers it a developing country.\n\nREAD MORE:COP27 approves compensation fund to help pay for climate change damage in poor countries\n\nWhat didn't happen at COP27?\n\nLast year's conference in Glasgow, Scotland, agreed to the \"phasedown of unabated coal.\" There had been hope that would be expanded at this year's conference to include oil and gas.\n\nCountries that produce oil and gas, including Canada and Saudi Arabia, instead emphasized technologies to clean up rather than phase down such fuels, according to the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London.\n\nThis \"low emissions\" language was considered a significant loophole because it could justify new fossil fuel development.\n\nCan we keep temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius?\n\nMany countries were frustrated that nations at this year's summit didn't include stronger language to get countries to cut greenhouse gas emissions. This, they said, puts the world on track to blow past the Paris Agreement goal from 2015 to keep temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius — 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit — above pre-industrial levels.\n\nThat 1.5 degree target is expected to be overshot, though not by as much as in the past. The International Energy Agency says that if the commitments made in Egypt are fully implemented, warming can be limited to 1.7 degrees.\n\nThat's down from previous forecasts of \"well over 2 degrees\" and is \"something we can be proud of, even if we recognize we are just getting started,\" U.S. climate envoy John Kerry said in his closing statement.\n\nStaying at these levels requires countries to actually do what they have pledged to do. Allowing temperatures to go higher would create \"an unlivable world,\" says U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres\n\nWhy Biden's meeting with China may be the biggest news\n\nIt could be argued that one of the most influential climate actions of this year happened 6,000 miles away – in Bali, Indonesia. That's where President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping met on the sidelines of the G-20 summit, four days after Biden spoke at COP27.\n\nIn a three-hour private talk, Biden and Xi agreed to restart mutual talks about international climate negotiations, which have been stalled since August when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan.\n\nBIDEN TAKES CLIMATE VICTORY LAP:To some, US is doing too little\n\nChina and the United States are the world's two largest emitters of carbon dioxide and play a crucial role in lowering global levels. At the meeting, Biden said: \"The world expects, I believe, China and the United States to play key roles in addressing global challenges, from climate changes, to food insecurity, and to – for us to be able to work together.\n\nWhat's up for next year's COP in Dubai?\n\nNext year's COP conference in Dubai is scheduled to be a \"stock-taking.\" This is something that takes place every five years and assesses how far the world has come in meeting the climate-saving goals set in 2015 in Paris. It requires countries to report on their efforts so the world as a whole can identify what still needs to be done.\n\nNext year's COP will take place Nov. 30 through Dec. 12, 2023, in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nElizabeth Weise covers climate and environmental issues for USA TODAY.

As the talks hit a critical stretch, he is “working with his negotiations team and foreign counterparts by phone to ensure a successful outcome of COP27.”\n\nIt is bad timing for the chief US climate negotiator to fall ill; the final Friday at the annual summit is always crunch time for negotiators to reach a deal that nearly 200 nations can agree to. But this year the issues are particularly thorny – the US represents a major holdout on the critical issue of a loss and damage fund, which would help the world’s developing and most vulnerable countries recover from climate disasters they did little to cause.\n\nLoss and damage is not the only outstanding issue. World leaders at COP27 are also frantically trying to hash out a deal that would safeguard the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels.\n\nJust hours before the Sharm el-Sheikh summit was officially due to end on Friday – and as the conference venue was being dismantled around negotiators – this year’s COP president Sameh Shoukry said he was “concerned” by the summit’s lack of progress so far.\n\n“I remain concerned at the number of outstanding issues including on finance, mitigation, adaptation, loss and damage and their inter-linkages,” Shoukry told the conference.\n\n“Today, we need to shift gears again. Time is not on our side,” he added.\n\nThe Egyptian COP presidency has taken a relaxed approach to Covid-19 at the conference. The organizers did not require participants to be vaccinated or show a negative Covid-19 test when registering, although they “strongly recommended” that attendees be up-to-date with their vaccinations before arriving.\n\nMasks, too, were wholly optional and rare to spot inside the venue – although the number of people wearing them increased noticeably over the past few days.\n\nAs the number of people who tested positive grew and the news of a potential outbreak started to spread, more attendees began to mask up. Still, even on Friday, as news of Kerry’s positive test broke, most people remained without masks.\n\nThe Chinese delegation stood out by strictly requiring anyone who wanted to step foot inside the country’s pavilion to mask up and sanitize their hands.", "authors": ["Ella Nilsen Ivana Kottasová", "Ella Nilsen", "Ivana Kottasová"], "publish_date": "2022/11/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/10/politics/federal-contractors-carbon-rule-biden/index.html", "title": "Biden proposing new rule requiring federal contractors to set carbon ...", "text": "Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt CNN —\n\nThe Biden administration will propose a rule this week requiring large federal contractors to develop carbon reduction targets and disclose their greenhouse gas emissions, leveraging the federal government’s purchasing power to combat climate change in the private sector and bolster vulnerable supply chains.\n\nPresident Joe Biden is expected to highlight the proposed action when he speaks Friday at the international COP27 climate summit being held in Egypt at the Red Sea resort Sharm El-Sheikh.\n\nThe proposed rule would require companies that do more than $7.5 million annually in business with the government to set carbon reduction goals that line up with the Paris Climate Accord, which seeks to limit global warming by reducing emissions.\n\nLarger companies would also be required to disclose a range of greenhouse gas emissions, including emissions from vehicle fleets and energy usage.\n\nThe White House said the move would make the United States the first national government to require its major suppliers to set emissions reduction goals in line with the Paris agreement. The US federal government represents the largest buyer of goods and services in the world, purchasing over $630 billion last fiscal year, according to the White House.\n\nThe rule could cover roughly 85% of emissions associated with the federal supply chain, the White House said. That’s more than twice the emissions generated from operating the 300,000 buildings and 600,000 vehicles the federal government owns outright.\n\nRequiring those companies the government does business with to set carbon reduction goals would make for a significant use of its weight.\n\n“Ignoring climate impacts, and the big clean energy opportunity in front of us, is risky business. Today, the President is using the unparalleled buying power of the federal government to accelerate the pace with which we will get more actionable climate risk data and analysis into the market,” Biden’s National Climate Adviser Ali Zaidi said in a statement.\n\nThe rules would be different for companies of different sizes, and wouldn’t apply to contractors with less than $7.5 million in annual contracts.\n\nLarger companies would be required to disclose escalating types of greenhouse gas emissions, depending on the size of the company’s contracts with the government.\n\nAt the COP27 summit, Biden is expected to highlight the proposed rule along with other steps his administration has taken to combat climate change. That includes the largest US investment toward the effort contained in the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nWhite House officials have underscored how different the situation is from last year’s climate meeting in Scotland, when Biden arrived with his climate agenda stalled.\n\nStill, hope is not high among participants at this week’s summit that significant new steps toward limiting global warming will emerge. High energy costs and a looming global recession have made taking significant climate action politically difficult.\n\nStill, administration officials said the proposed rule would amount to a major step forward.\n\n“On week one, President Biden charged us to make the federal government climate-ready and resilient. Requiring major federal suppliers to disclose emissions and risks strengthens our supply chain and brings us closer to reaching our net-zero emissions goals,” said Council on Environmental Quality Chair Brenda Mallory.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/11/10"}]}

But it is also the story about the human capacity for forgiveness and a young woman’s struggle to find peace.\n\nStill shrouded in darkness, she sat alone in her car, parked between night and day, between this world and the next.\n\nBehind her, a family of teddy bears sat strapped in by a seat belt. In the front seat next to her was a digital recorder. And a gun.\n\nShe picked up the recorder and clicked it on.\n\n\"This is Paula Cooper.\"\n\nA short introduction, a simple statement. Even though nothing had been simple about being Paula Cooper.\n\n\"I believe today is the 26th; 5:15 will be my death.\"\n\nShe saw it clearly now, even in the pre-dawn gloom. She'd spent so much of her life searching for peace. But early on the morning of May 26, 2015, the end was in sight. She would reach it before sunrise.\n\nShe just had a few things left to say.\n\n—\n\n\"My sister. My queen. My everything.\"\n\nEvery morning she spoke to Rhonda. Why should this morning be different?\n\n—\n\n\"My mother, I felt like you didn't love me. You didn't care about me. You cut me off. You judged me. You didn't want me at your church. You hurt me about the man I loved. But I still love you.\"\n\nOthers had forgiven Paula. Yet she never felt it from the woman who mattered most.\n\n—\n\n\"To Monica, I'm so sorry. This pain that I feel every day. I walk around. I'm so miserable inside. I can't deal with this reality.\"\n\nMonica had been like a godmother in the fairy tales — someone to fill the void in the absence of a mother's love.\n\n—\n\n\"LeShon, I love you. … You showed me how to love.You showed me how to be a woman.\"\n\nLeShon looked beyond Paula's past. As if it had never occurred.\n\n—\n\n\"Michael, I'm so proud of you. And thank you for apologizing.\"\n\nMichael was her first love. She wanted a life with him; he wanted something else.\n\n—\n\n\"Meshia … you helped me when I was down, but I explained to you better than anybody how I feel.\"\n\nMeshia knew Paula's pain; she'd just been unable to stop it.\n\n—\n\nThese were the people Paula loved most. And to each one she had revealed part of herself, but never the whole. It was a select list from a life populated by characters: Her brutal father and her innocent victim; the judge who condemned her and the man who forgave her. There were friars and a bishop and a pope; jailers and journalists; people who were zealous to save her life and people eager to end it. There were too many to consider, really. And the sun would be up soon. She could wait no longer.\n\n\"Forgive me,\" she said in a recording that would soon become part of a police investigation. \"I must go now.\"\n\nHer coda finished, Paula stepped out of the car and into the shadows. She took a seat against a blighted tree. She felt the breeze in her hair. She felt the gun in her hand.\n\nShe was familiar with death. She'd seen it up close. She'd been condemned to it, resigned to it and reprieved from it. She had debated its merits and come to terms with it. Never had she stopped thinking of it.\n\nBut the question that would vex those she was leaving behind was maddeningly simple.\n\nWhy, after all she had endured and all she had survived, after all she had done and seemed capable of doing, had she chosen to die now?\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nThe garden spot in the woods — where her father grew vegetables and beat his daughters — was only an occasional venue of torture.\n\nMore often, for Paula Cooper, it happened at home.\n\nAs a child, Paula went to bed night after night next to her sister, listening to their parents argue, listening to her father make threats to come after them. Sometimes her mother would talk him out of it. Sometimes the man's wrath ebbed and they fell asleep. Sometimes they would be jarred awake at 3 o'clock in the morning, her father standing over them, ready to beat them.\n\nPaula believed there were other kinds of families out there. She watched the people on \"The Cosby Show,\" and they seemed to have such a nice family. But that was television. This was real. This was her family. And it looked as if there was no escaping it.\n\n—\n\nPaula was born in Chicago to Herman and Gloria Cooper on Aug. 25, 1969. Her sister, Rhonda, was three years older. Early on, the family lived in Michigan City, but by the time Paula was old enough for school they had moved to Gary.\n\nThe girls attended Bethune Grade School, a stone's throw from home. They went to nearby New Testament Baptist Church, where Paula sang in the choir and helped with the little children's Bible classes.\n\nBy the late 1970s, Gary's downward spiral from a midcentury boomtown was picking up speed. Manufacturing jobs were disappearing. White families were fleeing to the suburbs. Crime was rising. Like many black families still in the city, the Coopers were left in the wake of all this.\n\nGloria worked as a lab tech at a hospital. She had an assortment of health problems, none of them helped by the drugs and booze she added to the mixture.\n\n\"One day my mother be nice, the next day she be angry,\" Paula would tell Woman's Day, years later, when her story was national news. \"And the next day she be real strange-acting.\"\n\nHerman worked for U.S. Steel and worked construction, but his employment was sporadic. He had a girlfriend on the side and would be gone for long stretches. When he returned, chaos followed. Herman and Gloria were a volatile pair, drinking hard and arguing often, creating an atmosphere that was not just unstable, but dangerous.\n\nThe result, as Paula would say later, was that the girls had to \"fend for themselves.\" Sometimes, on evenings when Herman was gone and Gloria worked late, Paula took meals with the next-door neighbors, who allowed her to stick around and watch TV. Most of the time the girls had food and nice clothing. But, as Rhonda would say later, \"we hardly ever had any love.\"\n\nExcept from each other.\n\nIn the middle of all the darkness, Paula and Rhonda clung tightly to each other. They found moments to giggle together, play pranks together and share secrets.\n\nMore than just a sister, Rhonda became Paula's caregiver. Yet, through their early years, they were unaware of an important family secret: Rhonda was the child of a different father. It was a secret Gloria took great pains to hide, even though she allowed Rhonda's father, Ronald Williams, to visit occasionally. She said he was her uncle.\n\nBefore Herman came along, Ronald and Gloria were engaged. They broke it off, as Williams would later tell a courtroom, because he felt Gloria had a \"split personality.\" In short, he thought she was crazy.\n\nLiving with Herman Cooper didn't help.\n\nHerman beat everyone in the house. He beat Gloria in front of the girls. He beat the girls together. He beat them separately, sometimes in front of their mother. Sometimes Gloria seemed to egg on the violence.\n\n\"We did everything we was supposed to do, but it just wasn't never good enough for her,\" Paula told Woman's Day many years later. \"… She get mad at us and he'd beat us. 'Be a man,' she'd tell him. 'Take care of it,' she'd say. And he'd take care of it.\"\n\nThe girls grew up unable to remember a time before the abuse. When they were little, Paula would later say, Herman beat them \"for the things little kids do.\" When they were older, Rhonda remembered, he beat them for forgetting to take out the trash, for not doing the dishes and for skipping school.\n\nHerman employed an assortment of tools for punishment, whatever he could get his hands on — shoes, straps, sticks, a broom. Sometimes he used an electrical cord from an air conditioner.\n\n\"He'd triple it up and go to work,\" Paula would say later. \"It got to the point I was so used to it I didn't cry anymore.\"\n\nTo heighten the pain, Herman sometimes ordered the girls to remove their clothes before a beating. Questioned later, he denied that he ever abused the girls at all.\n\n—\n\nThis stark picture of Paula Cooper's childhood emerges from several sources; the courtroom testimony from Rhonda and her father; testimony from Dr. Frank Brogno, a clinical psychologist who discussed what he learned from examining Paula. Some of the glimpses into the darkness come from now-yellowed news clippings. Others come from anecdotes Paula shared with friends and loved ones and the few journalists she favored. Finally, there's the freshest source of insight into Paula's world — more than 100 personal letters she wrote to a treasured friend that were reviewed by IndyStar.\n\nTaken together, they amount to a catalog of horrors. Her father's beatings, Paula said, left her \"close to death so many times.\" With no apparent means of escape, she seemed to stop fearing death at all. \"I just cried,\" she wrote, \"until all my tears were gone away.\"\n\n—\n\nIn 1978, when Paula was 9, the tears were still flowing. Her parents separated, but it was often fuzzy as to when they were back together and when they were apart. Once, when Herman returned home to find the doors locked, he forced his way in. According to testimony Rhonda gave in court, Herman entered their home, beat up their mother and raped her in front of the two girls.\n\nThe incident seems to have been a tipping point. Not long after, Gloria began telling her daughters the world had nothing to offer them. Instead, she said, they'd all be better off going to heaven. On this point, Rhonda would say later, Gloria began pressuring her daughters. Eventually, the girls came to believe, like their mother, they had nothing to live for.\n\nGloria phoned Ronald Williams, Rhonda's father and steady friend. It was late. She'd been drinking and taking pills. She was crying. Herman had been giving her problems, she said, and things weren't good at work.\n\nShe was thinking of killing herself.\n\nWilliams had heard this kind of talk from Gloria before. Always, he had been able to console her, to talk her back from the precipice. He reminded her that she had Paula and Rhonda to think about. What would happen to them? His question made Gloria think. But only for an hour.\n\nShe called Williams back. Between her tears and her wailing, Gloria said: \"I finally found out what I'm going to do with the kids.\"\n\nWilliams was alarmed. He demanded to know what she meant.\n\n\"I'm going to take them with me,\" she replied. \"I'm going to let you speak to your daughter and Paula for the last time.\"\n\nThe girls took the phone in turns. They were crying, too. Rhonda said they were going to heaven with their mother.\n\n\"Don't do nothing drastic,\" Williams told them. \"Let me speak to your mother, OK.\"\n\nThe phone went dead.\n\nWilliams panicked. Gloria and the girls had recently moved. She hadn't shared their new address. He didn't know where to find them, how to stop her.\n\nHe called the operator and asked for his last call to be traced; it was no good. He called Gary police. Without an address, they could do nothing.\n\nThere was nothing anyone could do. Williams waited. For three weeks, he waited. He feared what had become of them.\n\nHad Gloria killed them all?\n\n—\n\nAfter she hung up the phone, Gloria decided not to act right away; she'd wait until morning. When she awoke, Gloria took the girls out to the car in the garage. She put them in the back seat and started the engine. The garage door remained closed.\n\nFrom there, accounts differ. Williams testified that a friend told him neighbors noticed something and called the fire department. Rhonda testified that, as the fumes gathered, the girls drifted off to sleep. They thought they were going to heaven; instead, they woke up in bed. How they got there isn't clear. Rhonda said Gloria had changed her mind. When the girls awoke, she said, their mother was coughing on the lawn.\n\nFrom then on, Williams tried to coax Gloria into letting him have the girls. Rhonda was his daughter, and he was fond of Paula, too. Gloria would have none of it.\n\n\"I'd rather see them both dead,\" she said.\n\n—\n\nThe girls survived their first brush with death. But Paula and her sister were being shaped in a world without hope. And now their mother had planted a seed: The ultimate escape was death.\n\nRhonda looked around at this nihilist world and began seeking a way out. Several times she tried to run. Soon, she began taking Paula with her. \"I couldn't take it no more in that house,\" she would say, \"and I didn't want her to, either.\"\n\nBy 1982, when both girls were teenagers, they made an unsuccessful attempt to run and were sent — together — to the Thelma Marshall Children's Home in Gary. Within a short time, they were returned to the Coopers. For Paula, it was the beginning of a cycle — of running and being returned home. For Rhonda, that cycle ended only when she learned Ronald Williams was her biological father. At her first opportunity, she left the Coopers to live with him.\n\nIf the move helped Rhonda, it had grievous consequences for Paula, then 13. Her sister had been the most stable person in her home. Now she was gone. Paula came to believe her parents blamed her for Rhonda's departure. Now that her father's anger had one less target, Paula's beatings grew more frequent and more brutal. Even as her parents divorced, Herman never quite left the picture. And his handiwork began to show.\n\nAt school, Paula revealed to an administrator a rash of injuries — a bruise on her thigh, a welt on her arm, a rug burn on her elbow.\n\nWhen a welfare caseworker visited the Cooper home, Herman and Gloria cursed at her. They blamed Paula's problems on interference from the courts, from the school psychologist and from the welfare department itself. When the caseworker recommended family counseling, Gloria said she'd rather go to jail.\n\nAt various times, Gloria and Herman seemed to vacillate between wanting Paula and considering her a curse. Paula began running away on her own. After one attempt, welfare officials wanted to send Paula home, but her mother objected. If Paula returned, Gloria vowed to leave.\n\nOn another occasion, when Rhonda made a rare visit to spend a weekend with Paula and her mother, arguments ensued and Williams returned for Rhonda. He couldn't find her there, but he found Paula. She was crying so loudly he heard her without going in. Gloria, who stood in front of the house fuming about Paula, simply said: \"I'm going to kill that bitch.\"\n\nPaula emerged and, seeing Williams, ran to him and jumped into his arms. He asked her if her mother would really hurt her.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nWilliams told her to get in the car. Gloria charged out toward them and began to threaten Paula. \"I'm going to kill you and if I don't (Herman) will.\"\n\nWilliams considered it serious business to take Paula. He lived in Illinois and assumed it would be a crime to take a child across the state line without permission of the parents. He took her anyway. Gloria and other family members threatened to phone the police.\n\nAt his home, Williams asked Paula what she wanted to do. They talked about the logistics of her staying with him without her mother's permission. It would be impossible for her to go to school. Then there was the trouble Williams might face. With tears, Paula looked at Williams and said, \"It's best for me to go home … I don't want to get you in no trouble.\" Paula's respite lasted only a few hours.\n\nEven though he wasn't keeping Paula, Williams couldn't fathom returning her home. Instead, he just let her walk away. She was young, no more than 13, but Williams believed she was safer on the streets of Chicago than at home. Under scrutiny for making such a choice, Williams later told a courtroom he thought Paula was in danger there. \"I would rather see her in the street as a slut than for her mother to blow her brains out.\"\n\nFor several days, Paula survived on her own. Inevitably, she wound up back home.\n\n—\n\nBy 1983, when Paula turned 14, she stayed away from home as much as possible. She was smoking cigarettes and drinking. She smoked marijuana almost daily. Tall, but heavy, she took speed to lose weight. She tried cocaine. She skipped school routinely. She was sexually active. Years later, she would warn others against making similar choices. But for the moment, it was her life.\n\nAnd it was a rootless life. She spent six months at a children's home in Mishawaka and three months in a juvenile detention center. She was removed from one home after only six days after she threatened a staff member and another resident — with a knife.\n\nWith each new address, Paula changed schools. She attended four high schools without ever finishing the 10th grade. Her schoolwork, decent at first, nosedived. She called a teacher \"crazy,\" resulting in a suspension. She struggled to keep friends. She developed a reputation as a bully. All the while, Paula struggled to wake up in the mornings. When she was evaluated for the problem, a doctor at a local hospital asked if she ever thought of killing herself.\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied.\n\nFor that answer, she was sent to a mental hospital. Released four days later, she returned home.\n\n\"I told people I needed help and to talk, but all they did was move me from home to home,\" Paula would write a few years later. \"I didn't care about life or trouble or consequences at all.\"\n\n—\n\nPerhaps the pinnacle of Paula's abuse came, ironically, after her father visited Gary police seeking advice on how to deal with a wayward child. Paula was 14, and Herman Cooper couldn't keep her reined in. Frustrated, he asked the police what he should do with her. It was a family matter, they said; he should do what he thought was right.\n\nFor Herman Cooper, that meant one thing: another beating. But for what he had in mind this time, he'd need some privacy. He took Paula to a woody patch near a spot where he kept a garden. Paula had been there before; so had Rhonda.\n\n\"If you scream where I take you,\" he told Paula, \"no one will hear you.\"\n\nSeveral times in her life, Paula thought her father was going to beat her to death. This was one of them. \"He just kept beating me and beating me,\" she would tell the clinical psychologist, for what seemed like half an hour. Instead of the cord or a broom or a stick, this time Herman beat her with his bare hands.\n\nWhen he was done, Herman put Paula in the car to take her home. But as they drove through the darkening streets of Gary, Paula knew she couldn't go back there. Not when the possibility of more punishment lay ahead in the Cooper house of horrors.\n\nAs Herman pulled the car up to the house, Paula jumped out and took off running into the night. Running and screaming. Herman gave chase, but porch lights began to click on. Up and down the street, neighbors stepped out to investigate the commotion. The neighbors had seen this show before; it never seemed to end. This time, though, Herman retreated.\n\nPaula ran until she wound up where the night had begun — at the police station. She told officers there about the beating, told them she couldn't go home. At least not while Herman was around. The state pulled her away from the Coopers. It isn't clear from the record where she was placed. But soon, she was sent back home.\n\n—\n\nIn the summer of 1984, when Paula turned 15, she felt as lonely as ever.\n\nAdrift, Paula briefly took up with a guy she hoped might offer her a haven. Later, she would tell others he was a rough character who dealt drugs and treated her poorly. The one thing he did for Paula was leave her pregnant.\n\nMany teenage girls would consider pregnancy a tragedy; Paula saw it as a blessing. She had almost forgotten how to care about anyone. She wanted a family, wanted someone to belong to. The child growing inside her represented someone she could love, someone who would love her in return.\n\nAnd then it was gone.\n\nGloria had been dead set against the pregnancy; she wanted Paula to end it. Paula refused and ran off — perhaps to seek help from a woman she knew in Chicago. Her mother tracked her down and, as Paula would write years later in a letter and tell friends, forced her to have an abortion.\n\nPaula was several months into the pregnancy; the procedure nearly killed her. \"She took something that would have completed my life,\" Paula would write later, \"and after that I felt I had no one.\"\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nRuth Pelke was gentle, an old woman with silvery hair and horn-rimmed glasses. As her stepson Robert and his wife pleaded for her to leave Gary, she listened.\n\nRobert pledged to do everything necessary to make her house ready for sale — the legal stuff, the touch-up jobs, whatever. She listened as they talked to her about how dangerous her neighborhood had become.\n\nBut Ruth didn't really need reminding. Her Glen Park neighborhood was still one of the better places to live in Gary, although that wasn't saying much, given the city's downward lurch. There were abandoned houses now. There were burglaries. Her own home had been hit five times in recent years, including when her husband, Oscar, was still alive. Now, at 78, she was widowed and alone, and things were only getting worse. But Ruth had been in Glen Park for 41 years; it was home. She still had some good neighbors. Just as important, she had a mission.\n\nFor decades, she'd opened her home and heart to the neighborhood children. She'd taught them the Bible using felt cutouts of Bible characters that she stuck to a flannel board. She'd given the kids candy when they memorized Scripture. She'd driven them to church. She believed these were children who needed hope, and they could find it in Jesus. No, she finally said that night after her stepson's plea — she wouldn't be leaving the home in her neighborhood.\n\n\"I'll stay here until I go there,\" she said.\n\nRuth Pelke was pointing a finger to heaven.\n\n—\n\nThe next day, Tuesday, May 14, 1985, Ruth's doorbell rang.\n\nShe answered it and found three teenage girls standing on her porch. She didn't recognize them, but she opened her door. One of the girls said, \"My auntie would like to know about Bible classes. When do y'all hold them?\"\n\nRuth wasn't up to teaching anymore, but she wanted to help the girls. \"Come back on Saturday,\" she said. And closed the door.\n\n—\n\nThe girls — Karen Corder, Denise Thomas and Paula Cooper — walked back across the alley. Sitting on a porch, April Beverly was waiting.\n\nThe foursome — all ninth- and 10th-graders at Lew Wallace High School — left school at lunchtime that afternoon with no intention of going back. The girls walked the 10 blocks or so to an arcade near 45th and Broadway where they spent what little money they had on games and candy. When their money was gone, they headed back to the house where April was staying with her sister.\n\nThey were a ragtag bunch.\n\nAt 16, Karen Corder — known to her friends as \"Pooky\" — was the oldest. More than two years earlier, she'd given birth to a baby boy whom she'd delivered in a toilet. She'd managed to keep the pregnancy secret from her parents until the child was born, according to court records.\n\nAt 15, April Beverly was seven months pregnant. She was part of a divided family with 11 children, and she bounced between two homes, her father's and her sister's. Her mother was dead, her father had remarried. On occasion, April benefited from the kindness of the old lady across the alley. She'd listened to Ruth Pelke's Bible lessons. And the old woman had brought food over to April and her siblings when she was concerned they might be hungry.\n\nAt 14, Denise Thomas was the youngest of the four and the smallest. The others were mature young women — at different places on the spectrum of teen motherhood. Denise still looked very much like a little girl. In the context of this group, some would later describe her as a tag-along.\n\nAnd, of course, there was Paula Cooper. At 15, she was only months removed from an unwanted abortion that had nearly killed her. She was tall, somewhat heavy and had the bearing of a girl beyond her years. She would be described as the \"prime mover\" of the quartet — the ringleader. But it was a label she'd never cop to.\n\n—\n\nTo date, the sum total of their illicit behavior was strictly small-time. Karen had tried her hand at shoplifting. Paula, Karen and April had pulled off a burglary a few days before that netted them $90. Mostly, the girls were truants. And on this Tuesday afternoon away from school, their immediate priority was to raise some money so they could go back to the arcade.\n\nTheir first attempt was a harebrained scheme April cooked up to get some cash from a woman up the street. All four girls had gone to the woman's door. April introduced Denise, the small one, as her daughter. April claimed the woman's husband had taken $20 from Denise and they'd come to collect it. For added zest, April threw in this detail: The woman's husband had been naked when he stepped into the street to take Denise's money.\n\nThe woman didn't go for it.\n\nAfter that failure, April turned her focus to Ruth Pelke. She seemed to recall the lady keeping a jar of $2 bills. She thought the woman might even have some jewelry. The question was how to get to it all.\n\nAs they sat on the porch at her sister's house, April asked Paula to come inside — she might know where there was a gun. For the girls, a gun crime would be a considerable step up the criminal ladder. But the gun wasn't where April thought it was; she couldn't find it. Then it occurred to April: Something else might do.\n\n\"I have a knife you could scare the lady with,\" she said.\n\nSoon, April produced a 12-inch butcher knife. It was sharp and had a curving blade that graduated to a fine point. It was a cooking tool, but also a potentially lethal instrument. Paula took the knife and hid it in her light jacket. Out on the porch, she and April explained to the other girls: This was their new weapon of choice. And Karen came up with another approach to getting inside the old lady's home: They would ask her to write down the time and place where the Bible classes would be.\n\nIn all this planning, Paula and the other girls would forever swear, the subject of killing the old woman never came up. The most they would admit, according to Corder, was that they'd knock out the woman and rob her. Still, the reality of what they were planning — to con their way into her house, pull a knife and take the old woman's valuables — was fraught with danger.\n\nAs their scheme unfolded, April stayed back again, resting on her sister's porch; she didn't want the old woman to recognize her. Karen, Paula and Denise crossed the alley.\n\nThey rang the bell, and soon Ruth Pelke appeared at the door. This time, when she answered, Karen said: \"My auntie wants to know where the Bible classes are held at. Could you write it down for me?\"\n\nRuth said she no longer taught the classes, but she knew of a lady. \"I'll look up her telephone number for you.\" She invited the girls to come in. And she turned to walk to the desk on the far side of the room.\n\n—\n\nRuth Pelke looked for all the world like the kindly grandmother drawn up in children's books. She was also a woman whose Christian faith was essential to who she was. She went to church on Wednesday nights and twice on Sundays. She visited church members who were too old or too sick to get out. She sang in the choir. She hosted missionaries in her home on their trips back from foreign lands. She took her own missionary journeys, going deeper into the heart of Gary to share her faith with children.\n\nWhat followed — recorded in statements to police, testified to in court, reported in newspaper accounts and, in brief instances, described in letters Paula would write years later — was a scene that would shock Northwest Indiana and the rest of the state.\n\nAs Ruth Pelke crossed her living room to the desk where she kept phone numbers, she felt a pair of arms wrap around her neck.\n\nPaula had put her jacket on the couch and run up on Ruth, grabbing her from behind. For a moment, the teenager and the old woman struggled. Ruth still tended a garden and did a little work outside the house to keep fit, but she was in no shape for a chunky 15-year-old girl who now had her in a headlock.\n\nPaula threw Ruth to the floor.\n\nOn a table nearby sat an item some would describe as a vase but others likened more to a triangular snow globe. One of the girls picked it up and hit Ruth Pelke over the head. Prosecutors would allege it was Denise Thomas; Paula took the blame.\n\nPaula demanded to know where Ruth kept her valuables. She threatened to cut her with the knife. \"Give me the money, bitch,\" she said.\n\nRuth looked up and said simply: \"You aren't going to kill me.\" She began hollering for help. Paula's anger rose now. Then she looked at Ruth's head. Blood was streaming from the place where she'd been hit with the vase. Paula saw the blood and reacted in a way she would struggle to explain for the rest of her life.\n\nTo police investigators, she would say she entered \"a blackout stage.\"\n\nTo a judge, she would say, \"Something clicked in on me.\"\n\nTo a psychologist, she said the sight of the blood altered her perception of whom she was attacking: \"I saw somebody else inside of that body.\"\n\nSeveral friends and supporters who heard similar explanations from Paula concluded that, in this moment, Paula no longer saw the meek and mild Bible teacher in front of her. They believed Paula saw the woman who watched her suffer so many beatings and did nothing to stop them, the woman who took away the baby she'd wanted to love. They were convinced that, in the defenseless woman pinned to the floor, Paula saw her mother.\n\nWhatever she saw, Paula reached for the knife. She grabbed it by the handle and began slashing. She sliced open the old woman's cheek. She stabbed at her head, without deep penetration. Ruth fell back, flat on the floor. And Paula went to work, cutting her arms and legs.\n\nThe other girls stood by in disbelief.\n\nKaren Corder, the oldest, told Paula to stop.\n\nDenise Thomas, the youngest, cried and screamed for Paula to quit. Later, she would claim she yelled, \"I'm getting out of here,\" only to be met with a withering threat from Paula: \"Leave and you're dead.\"\n\nPaula's barrage was relentless. She stabbed the old woman in the belly and, finally, thrust the blade deep into the side of Ruth's chest. With that, Paula stopped; she pulled back from the carnage.\n\n\"I can't take it no more,\" she said.\n\nPaula looked at Denise; she told her to come hold the knife. But Denise refused. She looked at Karen, communicating the same message. Karen knelt beside the wounded woman. The blade remained lodged in her chest. And Karen held it in place.\n\nApril Beverly, who concocted the robbery scheme, initially held back. After the others went inside, she had come up to Ruth's porch and acted as lookout. Now she entered the house. The old woman was lying on her back, her dress covered in blood, her arms and legs still moving. Karen, she noticed, held the knife as it protruded from the woman's side. To April, it appeared that Karen wasn't just holding it: She was wiggling the knife back and forth. Out of some morbid curiosity, she would tell police later, Karen pushed the blade farther into the hole to see how deep it would go. At one point, she concluded, \"The bitch won't die.\"\n\nKaren estimated she held the knife in Ruth Pelke's side for upwards of 15 minutes; Paula thought it closer to 30.\n\nRuth Pelke moaned through most of this. The old woman's torn and tortured face was too much for the girls to bear. One of them went to the bathroom and got a towel to cover Ruth's face — and try to smother the last breaths of life from her. Paula and Denise said it was Karen; Karen said it was Paula.\n\nIn her dying moments, Ruth Pelke managed to share a few last words. Denise heard her saying the Lord's Prayer.\n\n\"Our Father, which art in heaven …\"\n\nPaula had stalked in and out of the room, and the last words she heard from Ruth were something else. Words that would haunt her the rest of her life.\n\n\"If you kill me,\" she heard Ruth say, \"you will be sorry.\"\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nPaula and Denise began tearing the house apart, rifling through drawers, ripping items off shelves and upending furniture.\n\nFor Paula, it was a mad search for some reward for the awful business she'd just concluded. There had to be some money somewhere. Maybe some jewelry. But as she continued her desperate search, a nervousness began to grow inside her. Whether it was regret for the killing or the chilling final words of her victim, she felt uneasy. And she didn't like it. As they were going through the upstairs rooms, Paula tried to pull herself away. But the only place to go was back downstairs, where the source of her angst lay dead on the floor. She resumed the treasure hunt and soon managed to turn up some cash — all of $10. She came across a key and thought it might start the old woman's Plymouth in the garage. She ran out to give it a try. Nothing.\n\nApril joined in the search and quickly turned up another key. This time when Paula tried it, the engine stirred to life. April went inside to fetch the other girls.\n\nBy then, Karen and Denise were alone with Ruth Pelke's body. Karen had watched the rise and fall of the old woman's chest until it grew shallower. Finally, it stopped. Maybe April sensed some new panic; she sternly warned the other girls: \"If you tell anyone, I'll kill you.\"\n\nThe girls had spent roughly an hour in the old woman's house. They hadn't found a jar of $2 bills. They hadn't found a trove of jewelry. But it was time to go. Someone might come looking. Before they could leave, Karen grabbed one last item.\n\nShe knelt down again beside Ruth. The butcher knife was planted firmly in the left side of her chest, just below her breast. Karen grabbed the handle. She pulled it out. As they headed out to the car, Karen carried the knife at her side. She climbed into the back of the car and dropped it to the floor. The blade was still coated in blood.\n\n—\n\nPaula Cooper was 15. She was too young to drive. But with her three accomplices as passengers, she managed to steer Ruth's car out of the neighborhood and onto 45th Avenue. They were just down the street from Lew Wallace High School. School was out now and, almost immediately, they saw a classmate walking along the street. Almost reflexively, they waved to Beverly Byndum. And Beverly waved back.\n\nThis was the paradox they now faced. They were teenagers in possession of a car, the apex of adolescence. Yet they had acquired it in the most horrific way imaginable. Years later, Paula would say things just \"got out of control.\" But here she was — a killer. Now that the deed was done, now that they had a few bucks, Paula and the others seemed in no mood to enjoy it.\n\nBefore they arrived at the video arcade, Karen asked Paula to let her out of the car; she wanted to go back to April's house. Paula let her go, but not before asking her to perform a little task: Go back to the old lady's house and get the jacket Paula had left inside.\n\nNext, Denise said she wanted to go home. She asked Paula to let her out at a convenience store and she would make her way from there.\n\nWhen Paula and April pulled up to Candyland Arcade, they were alone. For a few minutes, they just sat there, talking about what they'd done. April hadn't witnessed everything that went on inside the house. It's not clear how many of the missing details Paula shared.\n\nPaula said she needed to use the restroom, and she ventured into the arcade. When she returned, five girls from school were standing around the car. One of them was Beverly Byndum, whom they had passed on the street. Her sister, Latesha, asked where they had come by the car. Paula said it was her sister's.\n\nWithin minutes, Karen walked up to the arcade out of breath, as if she had been running to catch up with the crew. Wherever she had been, she hadn't stayed long. Paula pulled her aside and asked if she'd gone back to the house, if she'd picked up the jacket. No, Karen replied. It was probably the last place on Earth she wanted to go. And she didn't hang around long enough to talk further about it. In a few minutes, she caught a bus for home.\n\nWhether Paula remembered it or not, she had left more than her jacket in the house. Inside one of its pockets was a newly filled prescription for birth control pills — her pills. She had picked them up earlier that morning before school. It was just one of the clues she had left for investigators to find.\n\nPaula and April looked around at the girls and asked if anyone wanted a ride home. Eagerly, their friends piled into the Plymouth. Latesha Byndum was among those who jumped into the back. As she did, she felt her foot brush across something on the floor. She reached down to pick it up. It was a knife. And there was blood on it. There was also blood on her shoe. Latesha looked at Paula and April in the front seat and asked, \"What you all do? Just kill somebody?\"\n\nThe girls looked back at Latesha.\n\nNo, they replied.\n\nAnd, in a response that would reverberate across the community, Paula and April laughed.\n\n—\n\nPaula and April dropped off their passengers at various addresses around Gary. But details about where and how they spent their next two days are choppy and imprecise.\n\nProsecutors would characterize their time in the car as a joy ride. But from this point on, Paula and April seemed to have a different sense of what to do next.\n\nApril wanted to go to a park in Hammond; she wanted to see her brother Tony; she wanted to see her boyfriend. When she found $40 in Ruth Pelke's glove box, she wanted to spend it. When they picked up April's boyfriend and he brought some alcohol, she drank it.\n\nPaula wanted to go to a girl's home where she had lived for a time; she wanted to pick up some friends there. But she quickly decided she and April needed some time to focus on what to do next. When April found the money, Paula thought they should save it for gas. While April got drunk, Paula wanted nothing to drink. She was too nervous.\n\nMost symbolic of their division, perhaps, is what happened to the money from Ruth's glove box. The girls wrestled over it, and one of the $20 bills was torn. Paula gave up the fight. April could keep the money and do with it what she wanted.\n\n—\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the day after the crime, Robert Pelke phoned Ruth's house to check up on her. She didn't pick up the phone, and he decided to check on her in person. Just three days before, he and a large portion of the extended Pelke family had taken Ruth out for a Mother's Day dinner. Just two days earlier, Robert and his wife had pushed Ruth to think about selling her house and leaving Gary. Robert rang the doorbell, with no idea how prescient that conversation had been.\n\nThere was no answer, so Robert opened the mail slot on the door and called inside. There was only silence. But through the mail slot, something caught Robert's eye: The dining room was torn apart. He went to fetch a spare key Ruth kept hidden outside. Looking around the place, he noticed Ruth's car was missing from the garage, and he assumed Ruth must be gone, too.\n\nHe found the key, unlocked the door and stepped into the house. The place appeared to have been ransacked. Pictures that had adorned the walls were now scattered about the floor. Cushions from the couch had been pulled up and cast about. And then his eyes turned to the dining room floor.\n\nThe cloaked figure of a woman lay there motionless. Her dress was caked in blood. Her arms were slashed. A towel masked her face.\n\nRobert knelt down next to her. He pulled the towel away and called her name. Still, there was no movement. He touched her, and the body was cold. He knew she was dead.\n\nRobert got up and went for the phone. In an age when every phone was a landline, Ruth's had been ripped from its place on the wall. He stepped outside and began going door to door, looking for someone who would let him use their phone. But at house after house, he found nobody. Finally, Robert looked farther up the street and saw a man and a woman getting out of a car. He approached them and asked them to call the police.\n\nHis stepmother had been murdered.\n\n—\n\nRobert's son, Bill Pelke, arrived home just after 3 o'clock from his shift at Bethlehem Steel and soon received a phone call. It was one of his uncles. Nana, he said, was dead.\n\nNana was the term of endearment everyone in the family used for Ruth. Bill had grown up listening to her Bible stories. He'd loved her flannel board tales of the three men in the fiery furnace, of Noah and the ark and his favorite — Joseph and the coat of many colors.\n\nEven as a 37-year-old man, he still loved to go to Nana's house for the holidays, to warm himself beside her fireplace and congregate there with the rest of the family. His grandfather had passed almost two years before, but Nana was still a magnet. She could still bring the family together. And now, suddenly, she was gone.\n\nAt such moments of shock, the brain's processor goes into hyperdrive. And some key facts rushed through Bill's head: Nana had been 78; she was the oldest Pelke; she'd had a good life; it must have been her time. But that instant of comfort evaporated quickly. He sensed something else in his uncle's voice that was borne out in his next words: There'd been a break-in at Nana's house. He didn't know if there was a connection.\n\nBill hung up and turned on the television, wondering if there might be some news about it. Sure enough, his father appeared on camera. He was saying something about it being a terrible murder. For Bill, everything else was a blur; he had to go. He had to be with his family.\n\nAs it turned out, Ruth Pelke had been dead for a full day.\n\n—\n\nBy that spring of 1985, crime was a painful reality in Gary. Its murder rate was among the highest in the country. It was on its way to becoming the murder capital of the United States.\n\nGary was a city in decline; poverty was growing like a cancer. But the violence was being spread through an influx of gangs with names such as The Family and the Black Gangster Disciples.\n\nYet as accustomed to crime as the city had become, the murder of Ruth Pelke shocked and angered people in a whole new way. There was the innocence of Ruth herself — the elderly Bible teacher. As one observer put it, she was a grandma to the neighborhood. The killing's effect also might have been amplified because it happened in Glen Park, which a prosecutor later described as a \"last bastion\" of the white population in a city from which white residents had disappeared.\n\nOn the day after the discovery of Ruth's body, The Post-Tribune in Gary devoted two front-page columns to the story: \"Bible teacher, 77, murdered in her home.\" It had her age wrong, but the dominant image on the page was a picture of Ruth — silver-haired and smiling behind her horn-rimmed glasses from another era.\n\nThe newspaper reported that neighborhood children \"were visibly upset and shaken by the murder.\" They spoke of Pelke as \"meek and mild,\" serving cookies during summer Bible classes and giving out boxes of candy to the children who memorized Scripture.\n\nAs for who might be responsible, the initial story carried some important nuggets: Police were searching for a 15-year-old girl who'd been seen driving Pelke's blue Plymouth. They weren't releasing her name, but the girl was a student at Lew Wallace High and lived in Gary's Marshalltown neighborhood.\n\n—\n\nPaula Cooper lived in Marshalltown.\n\nAs they combed through Ruth's house, police found the jacket with the prescription in the pocket. Eyewitnesses had seen Paula and the other girls in a car that matched the description of Ruth's missing Plymouth. And on the day Ruth's body was discovered, Gloria Cooper phoned police to report her 15-year-old daughter missing; she'd been missing since the day before.\n\nThe ink was barely dry on the newspaper stories when Karen Corder, walking around school on Thursday, two days after the crime, began looking for someone on whom she could unload her conscience. She had opted out of the joy ride and gone home and had a couple of restless nights' sleep. She found a gym teacher who'd been nice to her and said they needed to talk; she'd witnessed a murder. Soon, police were at the school. They took Karen and Denise into custody. And Karen was telling her story about the crime.\n\nIn the two days since the killing, Paula and April — with April's brother, Tony — had driven aimlessly from Gary to Hammond and to various parts of Chicago's South Side. They'd had no real sense of direction.\n\nTony pressed on in Ruth's Plymouth until the gas needle dropped well below empty. Then he pushed it some more. Finally, the car died. Their money gone, they found a phone and called April's sister. Thursday night, with the police dragnet closing around them, she took the girls to see the Gary police.\n\n—\n\nDetective William Kennedy Jr. had been looking for Paula Cooper and April Beverly for the better part of two days. When his phone rang around midnight, the news was good: They'd turned themselves in.\n\nIn addition to being a cop, Kennedy worked security at Lew Wallace High School. He'd seen Paula Cooper walking the halls. He never knew her name, but they'd exchanged hellos. Now, he was tidying up the loose ends of a case for murder against her.\n\nWhen he arrived at the station, Paula's parents were waiting. Kennedy asked Herman and Gloria Cooper if Paula could make a formal statement about the crime. Herman, speaking for everyone, declined. They were interested in talking to a lawyer, and he seemed annoyed at the article in the morning paper, which he felt pointed a finger at Paula even if it didn't name her.\n\nThe Coopers met briefly with Paula, then returned to the waiting room. Soon, Rhonda arrived at the station. She'd read the papers. She knew Paula was in jail. And she was upset. She wanted to see her sister.\n\nGloria was OK with that but urged her to persuade Paula to talk about what she'd done. When the police wouldn't let Rhonda see her sister without a parent, Gloria agreed to go with Rhonda.\n\nAfter so many years of turmoil and strife, Gloria and her two daughters were together again — for a moment alone in a police interrogation room. What they said isn't clear. But when Kennedy, the detective, rejoined them, Gloria gave Paula a nudge.\n\n\"Say something,\" she said.\n\nPaula hesitated. She said she didn't want anyone looking at her. So Kennedy turned 45 degrees and looked at a wall. Paula began to speak. She kept speaking for 15 minutes. She laid out the essential elements of Ruth Pelke's murder, described the girls' desire for money and a car, described how they came up with the Bible class as their way in. She described how she got the knife and stabbed the old woman more times than she could remember. She talked about the aftermath, when they took the car and gave rides to their friends. At one point, according to the account the detective would later make from his \"mental notes,\" Gloria Cooper asked Paula in front of the detective: Were you and Karen basically responsible for the lady's death?\n\nPaula's answer: \"Yeah, you could say that.\"\n\nWhen Paula was done, Kennedy left the room. Her mother and her sister left, too. As Paula stood alone in the interrogation room, April Beverly was giving a statement in a room nearby. When Kennedy returned to Paula, she was newly animated. She began unloading a rapid-fire addendum to her confession to the detective.\n\n\"April is lying. She's lying on me, so I'm going to tell you where the murder weapon is. It's at the McDonald's in Hammond on Calumet Avenue, next to the police station. Her brother threw it out the car right by the drive-thru window side. It was by a tree right there.\"\n\nFor Paula, this was the start of one of the great grievances of her life — her claim that the other girls lied. A few details aside, their stories largely matched up. But in the discrepancies, Paula saw injustice. And correcting the narrative to fit her exact version of the truth would become an obsession.\n\nThe legal ramifications of what she'd shared, in her two statements, were that Paula had essentially confessed to the key elements of the murder. She had gift-wrapped a case for the authorities. She also had put herself in the cross hairs of a zealous prosecutor. She had no idea just how precarious her own life had become.\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nJack Crawford — with a swooping, blow-dried haircut that gave him an appearance not unlike the televangelists of the era — came before a bank of reporters with material certain to make a splash.\n\nA rising star in Indiana's Democratic Party, Crawford had swept into the Lake County prosecutor's job years before, having pledged to get tough on crime. Since then, he had pursued the death penalty more than any other prosecutor in the state. In the first five months of 1985, he'd already won four death penalty convictions.\n\nNow, flanked by a pair of cops, Crawford came before the gathered media with an announcement sure to make headlines: For the first time in Lake County, his office was charging four girls with murder. He would seek the death penalty against the oldest — 16-year-old Karen Corder — and if the other girls were moved out of juvenile court, he'd likely seek death for them, too.\n\n\"I've been a prosecutor for seven years,\" Crawford told the media, \"and we've never had a case like this before.\"\n\nAs zealous as he was, Crawford privately acknowledged that same day that his chance for death sentences had already taken a big hit. That's because the clerk's office announced that the judge handling the Ruth Pelke cases was Superior Court Judge James C. Kimbrough Jr.\n\nKimbrough was a former public defender and NAACP lawyer who'd grown up in the civil rights heartland of Selma, Ala. More important than all of that, everyone around the courts — from prosecutors and public defenders to reporters and clerks — knew Kimbrough hated the death penalty. Hated it for its unfairness. Hated it for its inability to deter crime. And in a county where other judges had shown themselves willing to brandish the ultimate weapon, Kimbrough hadn't sent anyone to the electric chair during 12 years on the bench. Only once had he come close: Kimbrough sentenced a man to death who had been convicted of a double murder. Soon, though, the judge reversed himself and gave the man a new trial. Eventually, he was set free.\n\nSo, at word of Kimbrough's assignment, Jack Crawford and his team murmured that the path to a death sentence was a steep one. \"We certainly thought we had an uphill climb,\" he would say later.\n\n—\n\nIn the Lake County Juvenile Detention Center, Paula Cooper's life behind bars was getting off to a rough start.\n\nShe was no stranger to jail, having spent three months in the same detention center two years earlier after she ran away from home. She was a bit weepy then, even tender, the guards remembered. But this 15-year-old version of Paula Cooper was angrier, explosive and cocky. She acted as if she owned the place. She was a handful.\n\nTwo weeks after the crime, Paula took a seat next to two of her friends in the jail during \"quiet hour.\" Soon they grew noisy. A guard told them to shut up and disperse; Paula refused. The guard ordered her back to her cell. But as she stepped into the hall, Paula struck the guard across the bridge of the nose. She fought until reinforcements arrived to pull Paula off. As they were dragging her away, Paula issued a warning: They'd better transfer the guard or she would get a knife and come after her.\n\nThe dust-up prompted a transfer for the girls — from the juvenile center to the Lake County Jail. It also made the local papers, which didn't help the cause of saving their lives.\n\nBy the end of July 1985, the cases against all four girls were formally moved to adult court. Crawford, after sifting through the ample evidence, made his purpose clear: He would seek the death penalty against all four.\n\nThe case had pricked the public's consciousness of crime at a new level.\n\nCrawford's decision made news on the Chicago television stations; it made headlines across Indiana. The public defender assigned to represent Paula, Kevin Relphorde, was incredulous. \"They must be the youngest females in the country facing the death penalty,\" he told reporters.\n\nBy then, Paula and Karen, sharing a cell in the Lake County Jail, had been locked up two months. They began telling jail staff they were considering suicide. On cards they were given to report health problems, they wrote things such as \"Give me the electric chair\" and \"Give me that shock. I want to die.\"\n\nAs a precaution, jail officers took their personal belongings and stripped them to their underwear; they were on suicide watch.\n\nPaula and Karen responded by banging on the bars and making noise. To calm them, a nurse broke out the oral sedatives. Karen took hers; Paula refused. The guards teamed up to hold down Paula so the nurse could give her a shot. But as they tried to restrain her, Paula jumped up and hit one guard in the shoulder.\n\n\"Oh you tough, huh?\" the guard replied. \"You stabbed an old lady.\" It was less than professional, but it was a gut reaction.\n\n\"Yeah, I stabbed an old lady,\" Paula replied. \"And I'd stab that bitch again. I'd stab your fucking grandmother.\"\n\nThe jail incidents were part of a pattern to be repeated in years to come. Paula didn't respond well to restraints; she bucked authority. In such instances, she could be aggressive and hostile. A psychologist noted her tendencies and something else plain to see: Battered and badgered as a girl, she was now mistrustful and suspicious.\n\nSoon, Paula's interaction with the jail staff would grow more complicated. By August 1985, about the time she turned 16, Paula began receiving a series of private visitors. Two were male corrections officers. Another was a male recreational therapist. They weren't visiting just because of their jobs.\n\nThey were coming for sex.\n\n—\n\nOutside the jail, the stories about the angry young prisoners seemed only to add to the public's contempt. And as the details of their crime emerged, they were already easy to hate. Especially the girl who had wielded the knife — Paula Cooper.\n\nPaula had not just killed Ruth Pelke; she had stabbed her 33 times, according to the coroner. Some of the cuts on her arms looked like saw marks, as if the knife had been pulled back and forth. In other instances, the 12-inch knife had been wielded with such ferocity that the tip of the blade went through Ruth's body, pierced the carpet on which she lay and chipped the wood flooring beneath. Worst of all, it appeared Ruth Pelke survived the torturous assault for more than 30 minutes. The Post-Tribune called it \"possibly the most brutal killing in Gary history.\"\n\nIf all that wasn't bad enough, two of the girls had bragged about the killing at school. As defendants go, they were about as unsympathetic as they come. With guilt hardly in doubt, letters began appearing in the Gary newspaper debating the punishment. Some asked for mercy; others wanted severe justice. One letter directed at Paula appeared under the headline, \"She should pay.\"\n\nAll of it left Kevin Relphorde, Paula's lawyer, searching for a viable strategy to save Paula's life. The evidence was overwhelming, and the prosecutor was determined, which made a plea deal unimaginable. Paula's childhood had been bad, but it didn't seem to add up to an insanity plea. Her youth and relatively clean prior record were assets, but they looked meager compared to the brutality of the crime. Then there was the jury. Any panel drawn from across Lake County would be mostly white. And Paula was a black teenager who had killed an old white woman. All of it added up to a grim outlook.\n\nAs best as Relphorde could figure, the only thing Paula had going for her was the judge. Relphorde knew of Kimbrough's opposition to the death penalty. Ultimately, he suggested to Paula a stomach-churning strategy: Plead guilty.\n\nRelphorde was a part-time public defender who'd never handled a death penalty case. But he figured Paula's chances were better in the hands of a liberal judge than with 12 angry jurors.\n\nAs risky as it sounded, Relphorde wasn't the only person who sized things up the same way. David Olson, who was Karen Corder's attorney, came to a similar conclusion. He'd had a nightmare about Karen, he told the Post-Tribune in March 1986, and awoke fearful of \"losing her.\" His fears were amplified when he attended the trial of Denise Thomas, the first suspect to answer for the death of Ruth Pelke.\n\nJust before the case against Thomas went to trial, in November 1985, prosecutors withdrew the death penalty charge, concluding she'd been more of a bystander to the crime.\n\nBut that didn't stop the jurors from reacting strongly to the horrific details of Pelke's death. They quickly found Denise guilty. Olson didn't want to risk that with death on the line for his client. So in March, 10 months after the crime, Karen went before Kimbrough with a guilty plea. Her sentencing would follow two months later.\n\nHow well Paula understood the risks of her plea — and how much say she had in it — is now a matter of dispute. Relphorde said he met with Paula regularly to talk strategy and that the plea was ultimately her decision. Years later, Paula would recall only three brief meetings with her attorney, who she said assured her the judge opposed the death penalty and would be sympathetic to a black girl. If she pleaded guilty, she said she was told, she wouldn't get a death sentence.\n\nOn April 21, 1986, Paula appeared in court to plead guilty to murder.\n\nHerman Cooper came to the courtroom that day; so did Paula's sister, Rhonda. But Gloria Cooper, Paula's mother, was nowhere to be found. She had moved to Georgia and stopped answering the calls of Paula's attorney.\n\nWhen the hearing began, Kimbrough asked Paula more than once if she knew she could be sentenced to death. Each time, Paula answered yes. To the most important question — How do you plead? — she never hesitated: Guilty.\n\nFor the record, Paula retold the story of the crime — the scheme to get into the house; what she did to Ruth; how the girls took the car.\n\n\"We went to commit a robbery, you know,\" she told the judge.\n\nWas there any discussion in advance about what you'd do with Mrs. Pelke? he asked.\n\n\"No. It wasn't a discussion to go and kill anyone, you know.\"\n\nKimbrough accepted the plea. Paula's life was now in his hands. But she would have to wait months for an answer. Relphorde left convinced Paula had made her best play: \"We were basically throwing ourselves on the mercy of the court.\"\n\nPaula's strategy seemed to appear sound when, in May 1986, Kimbrough spared Karen Corder's life, giving her 60 years in prison. In fact, three of the girls had escaped with their lives. Denise Thomas, found guilty at trial, received a 35-year sentence. April Beverly, who conceived the robbery but waited outside during the killing, pleaded guilty in exchange for a 25-year prison term.\n\nOnly Paula's fate remained unresolved.\n\nLost in the news of Corder's reprieve, perhaps, was some language the judge used in reference to Paula. It seemed ominous. Kimbrough said it had been \"conceded by all that Paula Cooper was the leader of this group of four young ladies. That Paula Cooper was the dominant factor in the crime.\" He said Corder was \"operating under the substantial domination of Paula Cooper.\" Despite such words, the prevailing view in legal circles was that Kimbrough would spare Paula's life.\n\n—\n\nAs her judgment approached, there were hints that Paula Cooper's case was starting to resonate beyond Indiana. Jack Crawford's first clue came when his secretary stepped into his office with an unusual message: \"There's a man outside who says he's from the Vatican. He's dressed like a monk and wants to talk to you about Paula Cooper's case.\"\n\nCrawford took a look. Sure enough, in a brown tunic bound at the waist with a cord, there stood a Franciscan friar. He told Crawford he was from Rome. He offered a letter validating his credentials. And he brought a simple message: Pope John Paul II and the Vatican weren't pleased with Crawford's decision to seek the death penalty.\n\nCrawford was Roman Catholic. He'd gone to Notre Dame. He knew the church's opposition to the death penalty. But, as he explained to the friar, this was a legal decision, not a religious one. The friar left unsatisfied. He would not be the last Franciscan to stand with Paula.\n\nMore surprising than the friar's appearance was the visit Crawford received in June 1986 from Paula's attorney, Kevin Relphorde.\n\nIt was just weeks before Paula's sentencing, and Relphorde had few cards to play in Paula's defense. This time, though, it appeared he might have a game changer.\n\n\"You can't execute Paula Cooper,\" he said.\n\n\"Well, why is that, Kevin?\" Crawford asked.\n\n\"She's pregnant.\"\n\n—\n\nThe sex scandal at the Lake County Jail erupted in June 1986.\n\nFor months, corrections officers Vernard Rouster, 25, and Parmaley Rainge, 27, had been coming to see Paula for sex, officials discovered. So, too, had Michael Dean Lampley, a recreational therapist from a mental health center. Their encounters occurred even as a 40-year-old female corrections officer and a police patrolman were supposed to be maintaining security for the state's highest-profile murder suspect.\n\n—\n\nOne of the guards admitted the sex began when Paula was still a week shy of 16 — the age of consent in Indiana. That people working in the jail were having sex with a captive wasn't illegal in Indiana in 1986. After the revelation, the jail workers resigned their jobs and the therapist was fired, but no one was prosecuted. Supervisors on the jail floor were suspended — for 15 days.\n\nFor all of its tawdriness, the scandal had the potential to affect Paula's case. State law prohibited the execution of a pregnant woman; punishment would have to wait. And while a death penalty appeal was certain to outlast a pregnancy, the strange episode raised the possibility of a sentencing delay.\n\nKimbrough ordered a medical exam for Paula. Quickly, the matter was put to rest: She wasn't pregnant. But, in a sign of the times, public discussion about the scandal seemed to focus less on the culpability of the jailers than on the promiscuity of the 16-year-old girl in jail.\n\nJames McNew, a deputy in Crawford's office who prosecuted the case, told the Post-Tribune he suspected Paula Cooper tried to get pregnant to stir up sympathy and avoid death.\n\nHowever it came about, the sex scandal prompted a change in state law: It became a crime for jailers to have sex with their prisoners. Soon, though, the jailhouse sex scandal would become little more than a footnote before a judgment heard around the world.\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nBill Pelke sat on the wrong side of the courtroom.\n\nHis grandmother was the murder victim. Unwittingly, Bill took a seat on the side of the murderer. He was unfamiliar with the trappings of the courtroom. And unlike some in the community — in his own family — Bill carried no blood lust into the chamber. He thought people who committed murder should die. And Paula Cooper had killed his beloved Nana. But he wasn't fuming about it.\n\nBill had stayed away from the previous court hearings, but decided this was one he shouldn't miss. It was July 11, 1986. And for Paula Cooper, it was judgment day.\n\nCourtroom 3 of Lake Superior Court was a small space. The gallery, oriented outside a circle where the business of the court was conducted, had seats for just 43 onlookers. This day, it was packed to overflowing. People stood, straining to hear, just outside the public entrance. Lawyers and other court personnel did the same just outside the doors normally used by the judge and juries. All wanted to know the fate of a 16-year-old girl who faced a potential death sentence.\n\nInto this cauldron, Paula Cooper entered under the escort of a jail matron. She didn't need to look around to see she had few friends in the room. Her sister and her grandfather were there, but neither of her parents was present. Her mother had moved to Georgia, her father to Tennessee. As Paula entered, the matron said something that made the young defendant smile. The gesture surprised Bill Pelke; it struck him as unbefitting for the moment. When this day is done, he thought to himself, she's not going to be smiling.\n\nDeputy Prosecutor James McNew began the proceedings by calling Bill's father to testify. Robert Pelke hadn't missed a hearing — for Paula or any of the other girls. He had been the family spokesman, and he wanted a death sentence for Paula. He described going to Ruth Pelke's home when she hadn't answered the phone, finding her home in disarray and her body on the floor. He described her bloody dress and the towel wrapped around her head. When the attorneys finished questioning him, Robert asked to read a statement to the court.\n\nThis, Robert Pelke said, was a crime that deserved the maximum sentence the law would allow. He quoted the Bible about submitting to authorities and God's vengeance and punishing evildoers. He said Paula gave Ruth no second chance, and he saw no reason to give Paula one.\n\n\"Paula reveled in her doings and enjoyed it,\" he said. He spoke of ridding society of those who would prey upon the innocent. \"This is a tragedy that should never have happened,\" he said, \"and a tragedy that family and friends will never forget.\"\n\nNext, one of the girls from Lew Wallace High School testified about seeing Paula and the others on their joy ride and about finding the bloody knife on the floor of the car.\n\nA crime lab technician discussed grisly photos from the scene — pictures of Ruth Pelke, of the knife-torn carpet and the gouge marks in the hardwood floor.\n\nThe prosecution introduced into evidence the autopsy report, which expressed the damage done by the 33 stab wounds. There was also an anatomical diagram noting the points where Ruth had been wounded — so many it looked like a star chart.\n\nJailers who had been attacked and threatened by Paula detailed her bad behavior; they recounted her admission about stabbing \"an old lady.\"\n\nEntering into evidence the grisly details of the crime and the accounts of Paula's callous behavior was part of the prosecution's effort to build a case that the only just punishment was death.\n\nIn Paula's defense, only three witnesses spoke.\n\nRhonda Cooper gave a picture of how she and Paula grew up terrorized in the home of Herman Cooper. She testified to the beatings, to their father's raping their mother in front of them, to their mother's suicide attempt and to their attempts to run away.\n\nRonald Williams, Rhonda's biological father, testified that he wanted to take Paula away from the misery, but her mother refused. He spoke of Gloria's threats against Paula and of the suicide attempt.\n\nDr. Frank Brogno, a Gary psychologist who examined Paula, described how Paula's abuse left her angry and confused, depressed and hostile. He said she was prone to confusion and bizarre thinking, even drifting into fantasies. Still, he said, Paula knew right from wrong. There was still hope for her, but also a real danger she could become a sociopath.\n\nMcNew, on cross-examination, ripped into the doctor. He pointed out how Brogno had testified in Karen Corder's case that Paula was the \"prime mover\" in the crime.\n\n—\n\nRelphorde made a plea for Paula's life, saying she had gone to Ruth Pelke's home to rob, not kill. He said the other girls were intensely involved in the crime and their lives had been spared. The death penalty, he said, was applied at the whim of prosecutors. He said Ruth Pelke, a woman of faith, wouldn't want Paula to die. In the end, he said, Paula was the handiwork of an abusive home and a system that failed her.\n\n\"I don't think Paula was born violent,\" he said. \"I think Paula was a product of what was done to her.\"\n\nMcNew, closing the prosecution's case, checked all the boxes needed for a death sentence: Paula wasn't crazy. She wasn't doing someone else's bidding. She'd struck the death blows. She had a criminal record, as far as a juvenile goes, for skipping school and running away from home. And Paula's abusive childhood? To use that for an excuse, McNew said, was to insult everyone who has endured similar treatment and found a way to overcome the horrors. Giving Paula the death penalty, McNew said, would have a sobering effect on others who might be considering crime. But McNew said there was one reason, above all, for a death sentence.\n\n\"I am not seeking a deterrence to crime when I ask the death penalty on Paula Cooper. I seek justice for the family of Ruth Pelke.\"\n\n—\n\nWith the attorneys done, Kimbrough asked Paula if she had anything to say. And Paula did not shrink from the moment.\n\nShe hadn't wanted a trial, Paula began; she only wanted to tell the truth. \"Now my family life, it hasn't really been good. … Nobody understand how I feel.\"\n\n\"This man,\" she said, pointing to the prosecutor, \"sit here and say he want to take my life. Is that right? I didn't go to Mrs. Pelke's house to kill her. It wasn't planned. I didn't go there to take somebody's life. It happened. It just happened. Something. It wasn't planned. We didn't sit up and say we was going to go and kill this innocent old lady. I didn't even know the lady. But everybody put the blame on me.\"\n\nShe said Jack Crawford had described her in the newspaper as the ringleader. \"I wasn't the ringleader. I didn't make those girls go,\" she said. \"They went on their own.\"\n\nLooking around at the people in the courtroom, Paula seemed disgusted. \"Well, where was all these people at right here when I needed somebody? Where was they at? They turned their backs on me and took me through all this. All I can say is now, look where I am now, facing a possible death sentence.\"\n\nShe pointed at the Pelke family and repeated her plea that killing wasn't her intention. \"I hope you all could find some happiness in your hearts to forgive me. And I know your mother was a Christian lady, and she is in heaven right now. I read my Bible. How do you think I feel? I can't sit here and tell you I understand how you feel because I don't.\"\n\nShe acknowledged that \"sorry\" would never be good enough.\n\nPaula looked to Judge Kimbrough. But, as Bill Dolan would report in the Post-Tribune the next day, the judge \"didn't return her gaze.\" \"I don't know what the decision is going to be today, or whenever you make your decision. I know justice must be done. And whatever the circumstances, or whatever your decision is, I will accept it, even if it is death.\" She acknowledged she couldn't change what happened: She hoped to get out one day and start life over, maybe even finish school.\n\n\"Will I have a chance?\" she asked. \"Will I get a chance?\"\n\nFor a couple of minutes, Paula rambled. She repeated that she hadn't forced the other girls to act; she felt it important everyone know she wasn't a gang member. Then she reined it back in for one final thought: \"I am sorry for what I did. And I know my involvement in this case is very deep. But all I can ask you is not to take my life. That is all I can ask you. That is all I can ask is to spare my life.\"\n\nSuddenly, a commotion broke out in the courtroom. There was shouting in the gallery. \"My grandbaby, my grandbaby.\"\n\nBill Pelke looked at the wailing man near him and saw the tears run down his cheeks; the visage burned into Bill's memory. He watched the man as the bailiff escorted him out of the courtroom.\n\nIt was Paula's grandfather, making one final plea on Paula's behalf.\n\nNow it was up to the judge.\n\n—\n\nJudge James C. Kimbrough had been wading through the sordid details of Ruth Pelke's murder for more than a year. He'd parsed the depressing narrative, and people had speculated whether he had a death penalty in him, especially for a girl. Now they were about to get their answer.\n\nThere was no doubt about Paula Cooper's guilt. Kimbrough dispatched that with his first breath. The murder had been disturbing: Paula had inflicted the 33 stab wounds in the body of 78-year-old Ruth Pelke.\n\nThose were the strikes against her.\n\nBut the defendant had no prior criminal history, and she was 15 at the time of the crime.\n\nThose were factors to consider on her behalf.\n\nThe other requirements for the death penalty, Kimbrough said, didn't work in the defendant's favor. She acted of her own free will. She wasn't under the influence of drugs. Her mental problems didn't rise to the level of incompetence. But all those things, Kimbrough said, were legalities. Ultimately, he said, death penalty cases boil down to a \"political utterance.\"\n\n\"This case has received an unusual amount of publicity,\" Kimbrough said. \"There is worldwide interest in the outcome of these proceedings today. And the court is certainly aware of that interest.\"\n\nWhen he left law school in 1959, Kimbrough said, he had been \"totally against\" the death penalty — and most of the country shared the view.\n\nNearly 30 years later, he said, public sentiment had changed, perhaps because of the violent activities of people such as Paula Cooper. Now, the vast majority of the public favors the death penalty, Kimbrough said, Normally, he wrote out his sentences in advance. But this case had challenged him to the point he'd been unable to do so.\n\nKimbrough praised the deputy prosecutor for speaking \"eloquently\" — he said McNew brought the matters into focus \"better than all of the turmoil that I have been through in the last several months.\"\n\nHe criticized state law for being too general when it came to giving minors the death penalty. It left him unsure what to do on that fundamental question. \"I don't know what the right political answer to that question is.\"\n\nThen Kimbrough, in a moment of vulnerability judges don't always reveal, showed some insight into his restless mind. \"I don't believe I am ever going to be quite the same after these four cases. They have had a very profound effect on me. They have made me come to grips with the question of whether or not a judge can hold personal beliefs which are inconsistent at all with the law as they were sworn to uphold. And for those of you who have no appreciation of it, it is not a simple question. It is not a simple question for me.\"\n\nKimbrough interrupted his confessional to take issue with something Robert Pelke said: \"I do not believe the failure to impose the death penalty today would be unbiblical. … I don't profess to be an expert in religion. But I know the Bible has passages which are merciful, and do not demand or mandate an eye for an eye.\"\n\nReturning to his inner turmoil, Kimbrough said he'd concluded that a judge must decide a case based on facts, regardless of whether it satisfies him. \"I will tell you, very frankly now, on the record, that I do not believe in the death penalty.\"\n\nThis seemed to launch Kimbrough on a rant. \"Maybe in 20 years, after we have had our fill of executions, we will swing back the other way and think they are unconstitutional. Maybe.\"\n\nAt about this point, Jack Crawford, sitting at the prosecutor's table, was ready to give up hope for a death penalty. He turned to McNew, he remembered later, and whispered into his ear.\n\n\"He's not going to give it.\"\n\nThen Kimbrough directed his eyes to the girl awaiting his judgment.\n\n\"Stand up, Paula.\"\n\nShe had stabbed Ruth Pelke 33 times, he said. He was concerned about her background. She had been \"born into a household where your father abused you, and your mother either participated or allowed it to happen. And those seem to be explanations or some indication of why you may be this type of personality that you are.\"\n\n\"They are not excuses, however.\"\n\nHowever.\n\nThat word caught Crawford's attention. So did the fact that Kimbrough's shoulders seemed to slump, as if the weight of the moment was getting to the judge. Crawford leaned in and whispered again to McNew.\n\n\"I think he's going to give it. I think he's going to give it.\"\n\nKimbrough continued.\n\n\"You committed the act, and you must pay the penalty,\" Kimbrough said. Briefly, he trailed into some legalese about the charge. Then he gathered himself for the final judgment.\n\n\"The law requires me, and I do now impose, the death penalty.\"\n\n—\n\nThe courtroom erupted.\n\n\"What did he say?\"\n\nPaula Cooper looked at Kevin Relphorde for help; amid the chaos, she wasn't sure what had just happened. She looked back for the judge; he had already left the bench. She asked Relphorde what had happened. He delivered the verdict again: He gave you the death penalty.\n\nThe smile Paula wore into the courtroom was gone, indeed. Bill Pelke took note of that. Instead, he saw a river of tears streaming down her cheeks. As she was led from the courtroom, the tears soaked the top of her blouse.\n\nJust like that, Paula Cooper — at 16 years, 10 months and 16 days — became the youngest person ever sentenced to death in Indiana; she was now the youngest female on death row anywhere in the United States. In this age before the cellphone, news reporters from national outlets raced out of the courtroom to the nearest bank of pay telephones. It took a few hours, but the verdict soon circled the globe.\n\nIn the hallway outside the courtroom, Rhonda Cooper yelled in anguish at members of the Pelke family and the prosecutors nearby.\n\n\"Are you satisfied now?\"\n\nThey seemed satisfied.\n\nStrangely, one of the most unsatisfied people in the building was the source of the commotion: Judge Kimbrough.\n\nAfter delivering the verdict, he darted out of the courtroom and into the hallway leading to his chambers. There, between the two rooms, he spotted William Touchette, a public defender who handled appeals. Kimbrough told Touchette to follow him.\n\nTouchette (pronounced TOO-shay) had been among those outside the courtroom straining to hear the proceedings. Like so many local lawyers, he was friendly with the judge; they'd socialized outside of work. He followed Kimbrough into his chambers.\n\nThe judge was angry. As angry as Touchette had ever seen him. Angry that the defense hadn't given him enough to spare Paula Cooper's life. Then Kimbrough uttered seven words Touchette would never again hear from a judge.\n\n\"I want you to get me reversed.\"\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nPaula Cooper's death sentence was one of Indiana's biggest news stories in 1986. It garnered network television news coverage. Once it hit the international news wires, it was picked up by newspapers in Europe, where it inspired protests.\n\nBut Monica Foster, working for a nonprofit death penalty defense group in Downtown Indianapolis, somehow missed all that. To her, it was as if the Paula Cooper case had never happened.\n\nIt wasn't that Foster was uninterested in current events or that she was dull. In fact, Foster was a wunderkind. She'd graduated from high school at 16, college at 19 and law school at 22. She'd come to work for the Indiana Public Defender Council, researching and offering advice to lawyers with death penalty cases, even before finishing her law degree. But at 27, she had a tendency to get absorbed in her work. And when that happened, the outside world ceased to exist.\n\nSo when William Touchette, the Lake County attorney preparing Paula Cooper's appeal, called the council looking for some help, Foster knew nothing of the case. Without hesitation, Foster agreed to be Touchette's local connection to Paula, who was being held at the Indiana Women's Prison on the city's east side. Foster even said she'd donate her time, seeing the client on evenings and weekends, as a sideline.\n\nFoster didn't realize she'd just signed on to the case that would become the most noteworthy of her career.\n\nWhen the case file arrived in her office, Foster began reading about Paula Cooper. Right away, she was puzzled.\n\nHere was a black girl from Gary who had been sentenced to death by a black judge whom even Foster knew to be one of the most liberal, anti-death penalty jurists in the state. The girl had brutally murdered an elderly woman during a robbery, but Foster told the people in her office that to get a death sentence from this judge Paula Cooper had to be some kind of rabid animal.\n\n\"She must be frothing at the mouth.\"\n\nFoster decided to go to the prison and see Paula Cooper for herself.\n\n—\n\nPaula had arrived at the Indiana Women's Prison — America's oldest women's prison — five days after her sentencing.\n\nEstablished shortly after the Civil War, it was originally in the countryside east of Indianapolis. Over time, brick storefronts and wood-frame houses sprang up around the prison's series of boxy brick buildings — situated around a grassy courtyard — and now the prison was landlocked in the middle of an urban neighborhood.\n\nAwaiting Paula was a cell tucked away on the second floor of the segregation unit. It was stark: block walls and tile floor; aluminum sink and toilet; a desk and a chair; all of it packaged in a space slightly bigger than a walk-in closet.\n\nShe had one window to the outside world. Depending on which side of the hallway she was assigned at the time, it featured either a view of the courtyard or, just beyond a fence topped by razor wire, the backside of a row of decaying houses.\n\nPaula's cell had two metal doors. One was made of bars, the other was solid. Most of the time, the solid door remained open, allowing her to talk through the bars to passing guards and nearby prisoners. But when the solid door was closed, it was as if she was locked in a vault. Worse, the prison had no air conditioning. As summer temperatures outside climbed into the 90s, the only air moving through the wing was pushed by a floor fan at the end of the hall. Most of the time, the place felt like the inside of a cook stove.\n\nHere, Paula Cooper spent 23 hours a day. In the remaining hour, she had 30 minutes to shower and 30 minutes for recreation, which meant a short walk to a larger room where she could play Ping-Pong or cards with other prisoners. Meals were delivered to her cell.\n\nShe was 16 years old and, in the grand scheme of things, set apart from the rest of the human race.\n\nThe treatment was harsher than what Paula's three co-defendants in the murder of Ruth Pelke faced. They were housed elsewhere in the prison, with the general population. They had greater freedom of movement, time outdoors and an ongoing interaction with other people. Paula was allotted 10 hours of visits per month, but she wasn't sure who would fill the time. Her sister had moved to Minnesota. Her mother had moved to Georgia. Her father had moved to Tennessee. Paula was as alone as she could be.\n\nYet she faced a struggle greater than isolation and heat. She lived in fear that the executioner was coming for her any minute. Whatever she'd been told about the appeals process hadn't registered. She thought she was about to be taken away and killed. She existed moment to moment, in dread the guards were about to drag her away to the electric chair. In letters, she would describe her situation in the bleakest of terms — \"a mental hell.\" Paula needed hope. She needed a friend. But who?\n\n—\n\nMonica Foster entered the security checkpoint at the Indiana Women's Prison and was shown to the glass-walled consultation room. In short order, she watched as a guard escorted her client in to meet her.\n\nPaula Cooper was nothing like she expected. Monica came looking for the heartless killer who had murdered an old woman in cold blood, fought the guards at the county jail and been given a ticket to the chair by the most liberal judge in Lake County.\n\nInstead, Foster found a girl, sobbing uncontrollably, who had been on suicide watch. Foster tried to calm her. After some questioning, she gathered the reason for the emotional meltdown: Paula thought they were coming any time now. To kill her.\n\nFoster's blood boiled. She realized that, since the sentencing, no one had explained to Paula the years of appeals; the good chance for a reprieve; and, should all else fail, the notice she would receive well ahead of an execution. Foster felt sorry for Paula. She explained the process. Above all, she told Paula she'd never be ambushed by the executioner.\n\nPaula went back to her cell in a little better shape, but Foster left the prison rattled. She couldn't believe how she had misjudged her client. She realized that her role in this case was about more than legal counsel. She would need to offer her client a shoulder to cry on, an ear to listen.\n\nFoster began going to the prison on weekends, sitting and talking with Paula for hours. She listened to Paula talk about being depressed, and she tried to buck her up. She listened to Paula's troubles with the prison administration and offered advice on ways to get along. She listened to Paula describe the abuses of her childhood, and Foster shared some of the tougher aspects of her own. The conversation wasn't always heavy. Sometimes they talked about places they dreamed of going and about men Foster was dating. Paula, in particular, was quick with a jab about Foster's romantic failures. Even in a maximum security prison, with one of them facing death, they spent a good deal of time laughing. And Foster found Paula's laugh to be infectious. That she could laugh at all impressed Foster. The girl seemed to have some kind of resiliency. After a while, Foster could deny it no longer: She liked Paula Cooper.\n\n—\n\nBill Pelke felt no such affection.\n\nIn the 18 months since Paula Cooper killed his grandmother, Bill had lost the ability to think of Ruth Pelke as the sweet person she'd been; he could only see the murder victim. He couldn't remember the warmth of Ruth's home; he could only think of it as a crime scene. When Paula Cooper received her sentence, Pelke felt justice had been served. His father, Robert Pelke, warned him that the justice wouldn't last. On a trip to Florida they took to get away from it all, Robert Pelke said Paula would probably never see the electric chair. \"Some do-gooder will probably come along and help get her off death row,\" he'd said. Bill struggled to imagine it; he just tried to get on with his life.\n\nBut moving on wasn't easy. And at 39, Bill already had other things on his mind that bothered him. He'd dropped out of college and wound up in Vietnam during the height of the war. As a radio operator, he was supposed to take cover during the fighting and call in air support. But he still carried shrapnel in his side from the wounds he suffered. Worse than that, he carried memories of the Army buddies who'd never come back. The experience left him sick of death. When he returned home, he'd married and started a family, but his marriage failed. So many things in his life hadn't gone as he'd planned. One afternoon in November 1986, all of this seemed to coalesce in Bill's mind.\n\nBill worked in a steel mill as a crane operator. He sat 50 feet above the manufacturing floor in the cab of his crane, moving heavy loads as the need arose. But on this Sunday night shift, things were slow; his mind began to drift. He wondered why life was so hard, why God had allowed Ruth to suffer such a horrendous death. He wondered why his family — his good family — was made to suffer in the wake of the crime. It was an unlikely perch for prayer, but Bill closed his eyes and began seeing images in his mind. He saw the courtroom where Paula had been sentenced to death. He remembered the outburst of her grandfather and the tears streaming down the man's face. He remembered Paula's reaction and the tears streaming down hers, how they soaked her blouse.\n\nA hard realization hit Bill: Ruth wouldn't have wanted these things. She had invited Paula and the girls into her home to help them find faith. It occurred to Bill that Ruth would be more interested in Paula's salvation than her execution. He was certain, too, that Ruth would have hated seeing Paula's grandfather in anguish.\n\nBill thought of the Bible stories Ruth had taught and the lessons he'd learned from a lifetime in church. He remembered Jesus taught that you shouldn't forgive someone just seven times, but 70 times seven — in other words, forgiveness should be a habit. He remembered being taught that the measure of forgiveness we show others is the measure by which we shall be judged. He remembered hearing about Jesus on the cross, offering salvation to the man dying next to him, offering grace to those who sought his death. \"Forgive them,\" Jesus had said, \"for they know not what they do.\"\n\nAnd then Bill realized something: Paula hadn't known what she was doing. Nobody in their right mind would take a 12-inch butcher knife and stab someone 33 times. It was crazy. Senseless.\n\nIn his mind, Bill began to see a new image: It was the picture of Ruth, the one published countless times since her death — silver hair, horn-rimmed glasses, sweet smile. Except now, he saw her face in the picture with tears running down her cheeks. Bill felt certain Ruth wanted someone from her family to show love to Paula and hers. Bill wasn't capable of it right then, but he thought he should try. He was a blue collar guy — a steelworker — and now he was at work crying a river of his own tears. From his seat in the cab of the crane, Bill prayed: \"God, give me love and compassion for Paula Cooper and her family.\" In return, he promised God two things. First, Bill would give credit to God for giving him the ability to forgive Paula whenever success came his way. Second, he'd walk through whatever door opened as a result of forgiving Paula.\n\nEventually, the sweet memories of Ruth would come back to Bill. He would be able to put aside the horror story. First, though, he felt he had to take a greater leap of faith. He had to get in touch with his grandmother's killer. He had to reach out to Paula Cooper.\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nThe next day, Bill phoned Paula's attorney. He wanted her prison address, and he was willing to do whatever it took to help save Paula's life. Kevin Relphorde's response wasn't encouraging: \"It's kind of late for that.\"\n\nUndeterred, Bill took the address and sat down at a desk in his Portage home to write perhaps the most intense letter of his life. He told Paula he had forgiven her; he wanted to visit her; there were Bible verses his grandmother would want him to share. He also wanted to meet her grandfather, he of the tearful courtroom outburst.\n\nBill dropped the letter in his mailbox and, at some level, thought that would be the end of it. But in the days following, he found himself checking his mailbox almost daily. Ten days after he sent his letter, an envelope showed up. The return address said: \"Ms. Paula Cooper.\"\n\nThe envelope was thick. Inside, he found a letter dated Nov. 10, 1986, six pages of a teenage girl's loopy cursive, written in pencil, on pink stationery. The contents were far from a schoolgirl's bubble gum dreams. It was a snapshot of Paula's mind on death row. Her thoughts darted back and forth — between apologies and self-pity, between empathy for those who hated her and preachiness about why they should forgive her. Much of the letter was frenetic. Sentences ran on and on like the transcriptions of a nervous talker. Her misspellings and limited punctuation seemed to reflect the erratic schooling of someone who'd been on the run since eighth grade. But it also bore the hallmarks of a mind in overdrive, overloaded with conflicting emotions. Here are some excerpts. Periods have been added for clarity.\n\nBill 11/10/86\n\nHello how are you? fine I truly hope. me I'll survive, I received your letter today & it was nice of you to write me. one of Ms Pelkes friends wrote me also, I answered it back also. Im not the mean type of person your family thinks I am but I can except that. I really do. your cousin Robert was something else & what he said about not knowing if Ms Pelke would forgiving me. Ive read my bible & I know it says the way you judge others the Lord will judge you the same way. Ive prayed for your family. a lady in a wheel chair use to visit me at the jail. she said God would be pleased if I prayed for all of you, I am doing fine. They treat me ok & I am always isolated 23 hrs a day. thats how it is on death row, it is a mental hell because no one cares except for themselves. I am thankful to the Lord for them letting the others have a little time, because I've had hell all my life. so it really doesnt matter if I live or die because Im ready any time they come …\n\nIn his initial letter, Bill expressed a desire to save Paula from her death sentence. But in her reply, Paula told Bill he need not write, travel or speak on her behalf; she just wanted his forgiveness. She seemed proud of her performance in court — how she looked his family in the face and apologized. She seemed to excuse her parents for missing her sentencing. Although they had beaten and neglected her, Paula said, her actions affected them, too.\n\nAt various times, her words ranged from fatalistic to self-pitying:\n\nI cant stay here like this & I don't want to be here, I deserve a chance one that Ive never had before. but one day Ill be free even if its when Im dead…\n\nI cry every time I think of your grand mom. the others think it's a joke because you all let them be free. Im not an evil person, or what ever you think of me to be, Im just some one who is real angry, angry with life & all the people around me …\n\nIve never done anything wrong before except ask for help, I was turned away & introduced into a life of drugs, sex & crime, but now its too late for help. Im dying inside because of this but I only hope for the best for others.\n\nIn closing, she made it clear she wanted more interaction with Bill, even if she was passive about it. She would put him on her list of allowable prison visitors; she would write him whenever he wrote her; she offered her grandfather's phone number and address. In a dark world, it was as if she had seen a flicker of light.\n\nWell, Ill go now, Ill continue to pray for all of you.\n\nTake care\n\nPaula\n\nTheir first exchange was the start of a surprising correspondence that would span years and delve into the core themes of Paula's life — searching for forgiveness; grappling with remorse; her closeness with death; her search for peace.\n\nThe letters also chart the course of a relationship that many people would struggle to understand, especially Bill Pelke's father.\n\n—\n\nAfter a second exchange of letters with Paula, Bill felt compelled to share with his parents the news of his surprising correspondence: His father had once warned of a do-gooder who would get Paula off death row. Now it appeared Bill wanted to be that do-gooder.\n\nAt first, his parents were speechless. \"We don't understand why you are doing this,\" his mother, Lola, said. Surprisingly, his father acquiesced.\n\n\"Do what you got to do,\" Robert said.\n\nBill wrote Clarence Trigg, the superintendent of the Indiana Women's Prison, a letter that spent most of a page describing Ruth Pelke's faith and her commitment to sharing it. He concluded with a request:\n\nClarence, if Ruth Pelke could speak with you right now, I am sure she would say, \"Please let Billy see Paula.\"\n\nThank you for your consideration\n\nIn the name of Jesus and His Love\n\nWilliam R. Pelke\n\nBut the prison doors weren't about to open to Bill anytime soon. Corrections officials didn't know what to make of his request — a murder victim's grandson seeking an audience with her killer. They suspected he had another motive, such as revenge.\n\n—\n\nThe aftermath of Paula's case was confounding in other ways. Since giving Paula a death sentence, Judge James C. Kimbrough had been very public about his discomfort with his own ruling. Based on the law and the case in court, he said Paula qualified for the death penalty. But he hadn't been able to square it with his own opposition to capital punishment. The decision was costing him sleep. In an interview with the (Gary) Post-Tribune, published Aug. 4, 1986, a reporter noted the judge's nervous appearance.\n\nHe fidgeted in his chair. His gaze varied — at times less steady and slanted toward the desktop. He removed his glasses, toying with them.\n\nFriends who knew Kimbrough said the judge was different than he'd been before the Paula Cooper sentencing. The man they knew as friendly and jovial, even gregarious, was more reclusive, less outgoing. \"It weighed heavily on his mind,\" said Earline Rogers, a state legislator and a friend. \"That was something he felt legally he had to do but, personally, he would not have taken that path.\"\n\nSome in the legal community began to think there was a good chance Paula's death sentence would be overturned. But Kimbrough wouldn't live to find out.\n\nOn April 30, 1987, less than a year after his judgment of Paula, Kimbrough drove his car into the back of a semi and was killed. He had been drinking. The tragedy cast a pall over the Lake County courts, but it also landed hard at the Indiana Women's Prison. When Monica Foster told Paula her judge was dead, Paula was inconsolable. Days later, in a letter to Bill Pelke, she shared her thoughts about the judge.\n\n\"all I could do was cry, even though Kimbrough sentenced me to die. I felt a closeness to him as if he were my father. I have been sentenced to die many times by a lot of people and it's only words. We are all on Death Row and the last day of April his death sentence was completed & it should teach a lot of people we all have a date that is already planned & the way it will happen.\"\n\nPaula's own father had been cruel; at least Kimbrough had agonized over the punishment he gave.\n\nThe letter about Kimbrough was the 20th she'd written to Bill Pelke in less than six months. She was surprising herself at her output: \"I didn't even know I had a good handwriting or a great vocabulary until I was locked up.\"\n\nBy then, she was 17 and a condemned killer with hours to contemplate her past, present and future. Several themes recurred in her writing.\n\nLife on death row. She struggled to sleep, to breathe, to deal with the noise. \"To be on death row is worst than when I was in a mental hospital. At least it was quiet.\" She had ailments from toothaches to a bad back. Mostly, she was confused and on edge. Life on the row made her feel like \"a walking time bomb.\"\n\nMemories of the murder. Her thoughts were plagued by it. She described what she did to Ruth Pelke as \"awful.\" She wished she could erase it. \"Every day,\" she said, \"I see my nightmare.\"\n\nDeath. It was constantly on her mind, whether by execution or by her own hand. She alternated between dread of the electric chair — \"I hope it never happens to me\" ­— and anticipation of it — \"sometimes I wish they would just go ahead & do it. They continue to put this death threat on my life and I'm tired of it.\"\n\nSuicide. She seemed to ponder the merits of killing herself. She wasn't sure what it would solve but, in words that seemed to echo from her mother, she said, \"there isn't anything here for me.\" She talked about hanging herself but acknowledged she couldn't follow through. \"I know that if I do that I might go to hell (and) I don't want that to happen.\"\n\nMeanwhile, people from across the country wrote her. Some, including a death row inmate in North Carolina, wanted a romantic relationship. Some wanted answers to the plague of juvenile crime. Others sent her Bibles and tried to save her soul. Yet her faith — another frequent topic — had grown cold. As a child, she read her Bible often, she said, but \"my faith started to shatter because of a lot of feelings, hopes and unanswered prayers. I love the Lord but we aren't rea", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/12/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/04/26/school-satan-club-plane-swap-fail-amazon-helix-news-around-states/50142737/", "title": "After School Satan Club, plane swap fail: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: The state will remember the Holocaust, the systematic slaughter of Jews and other people by Nazis, with events planned for this week in Montgomery and Birmingham. The Alabama Holocaust Commission is sponsoring an annual gathering of remembrance Tuesday at the Alabama Department of Archives and History in the capital. A child survivor of the Holocaust, Inge Auerbacher, is scheduled to speak, and a state proclamation will be presented. A commemoration will also be held Thursday at Temple Beth-El in Birmingham. The program will feature George Nathan, the son of Alabama Holocaust survivors Henry and Sophie Nathan. The family lived in both Anniston and Birmingham after arriving in the United States. About 6 million people were killed by the Nazis in the early 1940s during World War II. The state Holocaust commission holds events each year to remember the victims.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Legislators are considering a request by Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s administration that the state take over part of a federal environmental permitting program, though some members of the state Senate’s budget-writing committee have expressed concerns with the potential costs. Administration officials have said the idea behind the proposal is to speed the construction of roads, bridges, mines and drilling projects, the Anchorage Daily News reports. While the state would have to follow federal standards, critics of the proposal say the state has traditionally favored development and underfunded oversight capabilities. Industry groups say the current permitting process is too slow. The House included a $4.9 million increase to the budget of the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, which expects to hire 28 new staff members. The funding was part of the House version of the state operating budget, which passed earlier this month; senators currently are working on their version. If the proposed increase is approved, department officials plan a two-year process to take over part of the federal Clean Water Act known as Section 404. Permits issued under that section determine whether a developer can fill wetlands, rivers or other bodies of water during construction.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Aviation history wasn’t made Sunday night, but disaster was avoided, as cousins Luke Aikins and Andy Farrington were unsuccessful in completing the first-ever “plane swap.” One plane spiraled out of control as the two pilots were thousands of feet in the air. Both pilots were safe with no reported injuries. The Red Bull-sponsored flight, which took place at an undisclosed location in Arizona, began as the two pilots ascended to the skies about 5:45 p.m. local time. Nearly an hour later, the two jumped out at 12,100 feet in the air with the airbrake system engaged on both planes. Aikins was able to successfully get into the other plane, but Farrington was unable to do the same. The plane spiraled out of control as Farrington could be heard saying on-air: “Blue plane is out of control.” Farrington then deployed his parachute and safely landed in a remote area. The uncontrolled plane had a parachute on it that automatically activated when it got to a certain altitude, and it was deployed before touching the ground. The condition and location of the plane weren’t immediately known. The 6-mile-per-hour winds created good conditions for the stunt, the pilots said leading up to the stunt, as the area had faster winds in the days leading up to the event. But Farrington was unsure what happened.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Friday said he was refusing most of $146 million in federal pandemic rental assistance the state was to receive, citing the state’s low unemployment rate and economic climate. With Hutchinson’s decision, Arkansas joins Nebraska in turning down the latest round of pandemic rental assistance funds. Hutchinson, a Republican, asked U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen that the state be allowed to use 39% of the funds — about $60 million — for “housing stability” programs offered by nonprofit groups that would include job training, education and treatment as well as some rental assistance. Arkansas still has about $20 million from the first round of rental assistance that was given to states. “Our economy has returned, there’s jobs aplenty out there and we have existing programs in place for rental assistance that were pre-pandemic,” Hutchinson told reporters at a news conference at the Capitol.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Nearly 2,000 homeless people died in Los Angeles County during the first year of the pandemic, an increase of 56% from the previous year, driven mainly by drug overdoses, authorities said. The findings released Friday in a report from the county’s Department of Public Health showed that despite initial fears, the coronavirus itself was not the main culprit in deaths among California’s largest-in-the-nation unhoused population. But it did cut people off from mental health and substance abuse treatment after services were drastically reduced to prevent the spread of the virus. Between April 1, 2020, and March 31, 2021, the county recorded 1,988 deaths of homeless people, up from 1,271 deaths during the same period a year earlier, the report said. During both of those years, drug overdoses were the leading cause of death, but they increased by 78% in the pandemic’s first year. In the pre-pandemic year, the Department of Public Health reported 402 fatal overdoses. In the year after the outbreak, the number nearly doubled to 715, the report said. The report found that 179 homeless people died from COVID-19 during the pandemic’s first year. A San Francisco study released last month showed similar findings: Between March 2020 and March 2021, there were 331 homeless deaths recorded in San Francisco, more than twice the number of any previous year, with the leading cause of death being drug overdose, according to a study conducted by the University of California San Francisco and the city’s Department of Public Health.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: Heading into what experts speculate may be one of the worst summers of wildfire the state has seen, Gov. Jared Polis and state fire officials are preparing for the future. “We are vastly improving our year-round fire response, expanding our arsenal of world-class firefighting tools and continuing to activate every tool we have to help our communities prepare for and respond to the threat of wildfires and climate change,” Polis said in a press release Friday. In the past two years, Colorado has experienced the three largest wildfires in state history – the Cameron Peak Fire, the East Troublesome Fire and the Pine Gulch Fire – and just five months ago it saw the most destructive fire in state history, the Marshall Fire. Just last week brought wildfires in Monte Vista, near Longmont; between Gypsum and Dotsero, in Custer County; and northeast of Las Animas, according to state officials. “Colorado could very well be headed towards the worst wildfire season in the state’s history. We need to take action,” state Senate President Steve Fenberg said. He is supporting legislation that would invest $15 million in first responders and communities to improve the state’s emergency dispatch system and add a second air tanker and two high-quality helicopters. The bill would also create the Office of Climate Preparedness.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew London: The recent appearance of two cruise ships in the city has raised hopes that Connecticut might stand to benefit from the return of an industry decimated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The two ships, part of American Queen Voyages, were on a tour of the East Coast and Canada and were the first cruise ships to stop in New London in four years. Both are scheduled to stop in New London on the way back south in the fall. The ships each brought about 90 passengers and 75 crew members and were met with gift bags, discounts in local restaurants and a driving tour of the city. Connecticut also has deep-water ports in New Haven and Bridgeport that can handle large ships, but the state often isn’t seen as a cruise destination. “It’s encouraging that with the industry just really trying to make a comeback, they picked New London,” Mayor Michael Passero told the New Haven Register. Connecticut ports could benefit from Canada’s reopening its own ports to cruises after two years, as well as from industry trends toward more domestic routes and smaller ships that cater to an older clientele, said Chris Gray Faust, managing editor of consumer review site Cruise Critic. “There has been a pivot toward more domestic cruises,” Gray Faust told the newspaper. “Some of these ports are ones that you don’t think of as cruise ports, necessarily.”\n\nDelaware\n\nNew Castle: The Wall That Heals, a traveling replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, is returning to the First State on Tuesday. The Vietnam War memorial will be escorted by Delaware State Police and veterans on motorcycles to New Castle, where it will be met by students and volunteers at Southern Elementary School about 1:45 p.m. Tuesday and at William Penn High school about 2:30 p.m. The Wall That Heals is a mobile exhibit that features a three-quarter scale replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. The replica, built in 1996, stands 7 feet 6 inches high at its tallest point and 375 feet long. Similar to the original, it is erected in a chevron shape and allows visitors to do name rubbings of individual service members’ names. Visitors can also experience the Wall rising above them as they walk toward the apex, a key feature of the Washington memorial. After arrival at William Penn High School – the first school in the nation to host the wall – the setup will begin Wednesday. The Wall will be open to the public 24 hours a day, starting Friday and ending Sunday at 2 p.m. More than 100 volunteers are needed to guard the wall, help with parking and assist with events in the coming days. An opening ceremony begins at 9 a.m. Thursday with a Prisoner of War keynote speaker. A candlelight vigil will be held at 8 p.m. Saturday to read the names of Hometown Heroes from the exhibit with a procession along the wall and a 21-gun salute.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Jon Stewart, accepting the Kennedy Center’s Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, warned Sunday night that speculation about the future of comedy amid increased audience cultural sensitivity was ignoring a true and enduring threat: authoritarian governments around the world. “Comedy doesn’t change the world, but it’s a bellwether,” Stewart said. “When a society feels under threat, comedians are who gets sent away first.” Stewart pointed in the audience to Egyptian comedian Bassem Youssef, whose Stewart-inspired political comedy show earned him both fame and self-imposed exile. Youssef’s story is “an example of the true threat to comedy,” Stewart said. The intersection of comedy and politics was the main theme as celebrities and comedy royalty gathered to honor Stewart, who set the modern template for mixing the topics during his 16-year run hosting TV’s “The Daily Show.” Stewart, the 23rd recipient of the prize, was honored in testimonials from fellow comedians and previous Mark Twain Prize recipients. And his political influence was apparent Sunday from a guest list that included House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and White House press secretary Jen Psaki. This was the first Mark Twain ceremony since Dave Chappelle’s in 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic scuttled the event in 2020 and 2021.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: The judge overseeing jury selection for a man who murdered 17 people at a high school declared Monday that the process will start over, conceding she should have questioned 11 potential jurors who said they would not follow the law before she dismissed them. In granting the motion filed by Nikolas Cruz’s prosecutors over the strong objection of his attorneys, Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer nullified two weeks of work by prosecution and defense lawyers, forcing them to begin the entire process anew Monday. As a result, almost 250 potential jurors who had said they could sit for a four-month trial will not be called back next month for further questioning. More than 1,200 candidates had been screened. Prosecutor Carolyn McCann made her argument after miscommunication caused 11 jurors who were improperly dismissed by Scherer two weeks ago not to be told to return to court Monday as had been planned for further questioning. Scherer said they would be brought in next week, but McCann argued that more time would be wasted if it turned out the potential jurors had to be struck anyway. She said the prosecution has just as much right to question potential jurors and to an untainted final panel as the defense. “This is not harmless error,” McCann said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Officials have put the brakes on the city’s largest road race. The Rock ’n’ Roll Marathon has brought tens of thousands of runners to Georgia’s picturesque founding city since first adding Savannah to its race roster in 2011. But Mayor Van Johnson said the city won’t be granting marathon organizers a permit or paying the $25,000 contract fee this year. Organizers released a statement saying a comeback in 2023 appears unlikely. They had intended to return to Savannah this fall, and runners had been registering for the race before City Hall announced its decision. Johnson told news outlets Savannah needs a break from the marathon to evaluate whether it’s worth the cost – not just in taxpayer money for sanitation and extra police but also in hassles to residents and businesses affected by street closures. He said the city has recouped “a relatively very small percentage” of what it has spent on the event. Visit Savannah, the city’s tourism bureau, reported the 2019 marathon had an economic impact of $23 million. Michael Owens, president of Savannah’s Tourism Leadership Council, said the race gave the city’s hospitality industry a needed shot in the arm during what’s otherwise a slow period for tourists right before the holidays. “To be honest with you, it’s devastating,” Owens told WTOC-TV. “I’ve gotten more phone calls about this than anything. I’ve gotten more calls about the cancellation of Rock ’n’ Roll than I did in the beginning of the pandemic.”\n\nHawaii\n\nWahiawa: The only skilled nursing and rehabilitation facility in central Oahu expects to close this summer. Wahiawa General Hospital said it plans to close its long-term nursing center July 22, citing insufficient insurance reimbursements and continued financial challenges, Hawaii News Now reports. It’s also been struggling to hire and retain staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. Wahiawa General, a small independent hospital, had received millions in taxpayers dollars to keep it afloat in the past, but it is still losing over a million dollars a year. It also doesn’t have the money to improve existing facilities, such as the long-term nursing center, which was built in 1966. Hospital administrators said many of the patients in Wahiawa are covered by the Supplemental Security Income program or Medicaid, which have low reimbursement rates. The long-term care center has 115 beds, according to its website. It currently has 60 patients. John McDermott, the state’s long-term care ombudsman, said Hawaii can’t afford to lose nursing homes, especially when the state’s senior population is increasing so rapidly. The nearest alternatives for skilled nursing and rehabilitation are in Kaneohe and Pearl City. Wahiawa General is giving 90 days’ notice and helping to relocate patients.\n\nIdaho\n\nLewiston: Jurors convicted a 17-year-old boy of first-degree murder after about three hours of deliberation Thursday. Demetri Ewing and his father Clyde Ewing were both charged with first-degree murder in connection with the Jan. 8, 2021, shooting death of Samuel Johns, The Lewiston Tribune reports. Clyde Ewing has pleaded not guilty, and his trial is scheduled to begin May 16. Ewing, who was 16 at the time of the shooting, was charged as an adult and could face up to life in prison when he is sentenced in June. During Demetri Ewing’s nearly two-week trial, Nez Perce County prosecutors said the father and son were in the midst of a family dispute over a missing gun and an Army bag that had belonged to Clyde Ewing’s late father. Prosecutors said the pair believed the bag had been left at Johns’ home, so they left their motel in Clarkston, Washington, and rode bicycles to Johns’ residence in the neighboring town of Lewiston, Idaho. Nez Perce County Prosecutor Justin Coleman said the Ewings used zipper-style cable ties to bind the hands of a woman in the home, and that one of them shot and killed Johns. Under Idaho law, prosecutors are not required to prove which defendant killed someone, only that a person was killed in the process of another planned felony like a burglary.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A man seen on video wheeling a bulky suitcase out of a woman’s apartment has been acquitted of murder. Cook County Judge Diana Kenworthy noted a lack of evidence against Jimmy Jackson, 75, and said the video was not enough to convict him. Daisy Hayes, 65, disappeared in 2018. Family members were stunned by the verdict Friday. “All I could do is scream and just run out the courtroom – like, what didn’t you see?” daughter Teresa Smith said of the video. Jackson, 75, and Hayes, 65, had an intermittent relationship. “You see him struggling with this suitcase. You see him actually put the suitcase in the dumpster. You actually see him take garbage from other dumpsters to put on top of her so it can be concealed,” Smith said. Jackson was arrested in Tennessee after Daisy disappeared.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Local native and 12-time Grammy-winning singer and producer Babyface will headline the Madam Walker Legacy Center on June 17 as part of a weekend­long Juneteenth celebration at the historic theater. Tours of the newly remodeled center, a family-friendly outdoor block party and other musical performances will be spread throughout Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Babyface, whose given name is Kenneth Edmonds, will also be inducted into the Madam Walker Legacy Center Walk of Fame. His credits include some 250 top-10 R&B and pop hits, working with the likes of Beyoncé, Aretha Franklin and Whitney Houston. He last performed in Indianapolis on the free stage of the Indiana State Fair in August.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The local school district plans to hold a series of discussions to address school violence following a shooting outside East High School last month. The five public meetings will give the school community a chance to talk about concerns related to violence in schools and communities and how to begin healing from the shooting death of Jose Lopez-Perez, 15. While Des Moines Public Schools is hosting the events, outside community groups will guide the conversations. Lopez-Perez was shot and killed outside the school March 7. Also injured were East High School students Kemery Ortega, 18, and Jessica Lopez, 16. Ten teenagers have been charged with Lopez-Perez’s death and the shooting. The meetings’ topics will be guided using information gleaned from earlier conversations with student following the shooting. East High School students focused their discussion on student health and well-being, school climate, culture, and safety, said Madeline Cano, the East community school coordinator. Students also said they wanted to see the school “bounce back from COVID.” The community school coordinators help support students and families within Des Moines schools and the community.\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: A Wyandotte County judge struck down a GOP-authored congressional map enacted earlier this year and ordered the Legislature to take steps to address what he considered to be gerrymandered district lines. It is the first time a state-level judge has waded into redistricting for the U.S. House, though the ruling is all but certain to be appealed, setting up a showdown at the Kansas Supreme Court. Wyandotte County District Court Judge Bill Klapper called the maps passed over the veto of Gov. Laura Kelly earlier this year “motivated at least in part by an intent to dilute minority voting strength” and said state courts had the right to take up redistricting cases. Three lawsuits were filed challenging the map, arguing the new district lines illicitly divide the Kansas City area and improperly place Lawrence in the sweeping 1st Congressional District dominated by western Kansas. Supporters say the decision to divide Wyandotte and Johnson counties, as well as splitting Kansas City between the 3rd and 2nd districts, was born out of simple math, with population growing in the region. But critics argue the endeavor amounted to nothing more than racial and political gerrymandering, something cited by Klapper in his 200-plus-page opinion that quoted everything from the French philosopher Montesquieu to folk music.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: An arson unit is investigating after a fire destroyed a synagogue and worship center on the final day of Passover. Rabbi Avrohom Litvin, regional director of Chabad of Kentucky, said the blaze started as a grease fire in a building adjoining Louisville’s Chabad House early Saturday, WDRB-TV reports. Firefighters brought it under control, but it apparently rekindled around noon, and the Chabad House caught fire. Litvin said the Chabad House was quickly engulfed in flames, and the roof collapsed. No one was injured, but the sanctuary and nearly everything in it was destroyed, Litvin said. Only the Torah scrolls were rescued, having been removed that morning for an off-site remembrance service due to electricity being cut off at the synagogue. Litvin said it was a “miracle” the 75 congregants – including 25 children – were not in the synagogue at the time of the larger fire and in harm’s way. “There’s a story of a man who was on his way to a big vacation, and he breaks his leg, and he feels so bad that God let his leg be broken just before his vacation,” he said. “And then he reads that the plane went down, and he says, ‘God saved my life by breaking my leg.’ “So I absolutely see the hand of God here. ... Yes, this leg got broken; the core of the building is gone. But we can rebuild the building.” Litvin said officials told him they have not uncovered any evidence of arson, though their investigation is ongoing, including determining if the second fire was a reignition of the first.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A small, historically Black university known for its success in getting graduates into medical school announced Thursday that it is now planning its own medical school. The coronavirus pandemic emphasized the need for greater diversity in medicine because representation and trust are part of the reasons for health disparities affecting underrepresented populations, said Reynold Verret, president of Xavier University of Louisiana. “Xavier was founded with the mission of promoting the creation of a just and humane society through education,” he said in a news release announcing plans for a medical school and graduate school of health sciences in New Orleans. “The establishment of graduate education programs dedicated to the preparation of more black healthcare professionals is a natural extension of our foundress’ legacy as we approach our second century of service. It is also where we are called to answer a critical need of our nation.” For decades, the Catholic school founded in 1925 has graduated more African American students and students of color who go on to get medical degrees and health doctorates than any other higher education institution in the U.S., the news release said.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Democratic Gov. Janet Mills asked tribal chiefs and legislative leaders in a letter made public Monday to drop their effort to amend a 1980 land settlement deal that gave the state of Maine some governmental power over tribes. Mills said the proposal to expand tribal sovereignty could be a setback in tribal relations with her administration, instead of building on recent successes. “I do not wish to have a confrontation,” she wrote in the letter. “It would serve no constructive purpose and only inflame emotions on all sides of the discussion.” The letter was written Thursday night, the day before the bill failed to advance in the appropriations committee. Maggie Dana, chief of the Passamaquoddy Tribe at Pleasant Point, said previously she hoped the governor would be “on the right side of history” and agree to the long-sought changes. For the tribes, it has been a long, frustrating battle since they traded some rights to the state under the $81.5 million Maine Indian Land Claims Settlement Act of 1980, signed by President Jimmy Carter. Because of the settlement, tribes in Maine have less autonomy than tribes elsewhere across the country, and their reservations are treated like municipalities, subject to state law. Critics of extending tribal sovereignty feared there could be unintended consequences and further litigation if that changed.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: A potentially lucrative revenue stream for struggling commercial fishermen and women could become a reality as the state begins to research a shrimp fishery in Maryland’s warming waters. The bill, introduced by state Sen. Mary Beth Carozza, R-Worcester, would allow the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to establish a shrimp fishery pilot program for certain commercial licenses. “As a lifelong commercial fisherman, I have seen changes to our environment, our fisheries and our livelihood,” said Sonny Gwin, a fisherman based in Ocean City. “An abundant amount of shrimp has been seen in Maryland waters, both in the Atlantic Ocean and its tributaries. We would like to have the opportunity to participate.” Gwin said the first step in diversifying the industry on the Delmarva Peninsula is understanding the impact it could have. Warming waters in the Atlantic Ocean are among the reasons much of the seafood caught off Maryland’s coast is becoming more diverse. White shrimp, which typically thrive in the Gulf of Mexico and south Atlantic Ocean, used to only venture as far north as North Carolina in any significant numbers. But as water temperatures rise off the coast of Maryland, shrimp have moved farther north.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nNantucket: Scientists at MIT are proposing releasing hordes of genetically altered mice on the posh vacation destination of Nantucket to combat the growing scourge of Lyme disease. Researchers with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab’s Mice Against Ticks project explained their plan to residents of the island off Cape Cod at a recent meeting, The Boston Globe reports. The scientists said hundreds of thousands of native white-footed mice engineered to resist the bacteria that causes Lyme could help slow disease transmission. They say if Lyme were less prevalent among mice, then fewer ticks would contract the disease, leading to less cases among humans. The proposal would require review from regulators, not to mention local support, but Joanna Buchthal, the project’s research director, argues the idea offers a “real, if revolutionary, way” to address the disease. “With so many people suffering from Lyme every single day, which is an awful disease, we need a solution urgently,” she told the newspaper. Nantucket is one of Massachusetts’ hot spots for Lyme disease, which is now the most common infectious disease on the island, the Globe reports. Incidents of Lyme disease have nearly doubled nationwide since 1991, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nMichigan\n\nTaylor: A person taking part in a suburban Detroit police training program suffered a gunshot wound and was hospitalized, Michigan State Police said. The shooting happened Sunday afternoon during the exercise at a Taylor city park for the city’s volunteer auxiliary police program. The civilian was a “role player” in a training scenario when an auxiliary officer in the training fired a shot from his service revolver, hitting the person in the abdomen, state police said. The person was taken to a hospital in stable condition. State police investigators were reviewing the shooting at the request of Taylor police. The volunteers with Taylor’s auxiliary police assist the city police force during emergencies and help with other duties such as home and business checks and anti-crime programs, according to the city website.\n\nMinnesota\n\nCrookston: Volunteers and National Guard members in northwestern Minnesota spent two days sandbagging to fortify the city from an expected record flood along the Red Lake River. Gov. Tim Walz authorized 100 members of the Guard to assist with the flood fight after heavy rains forced the the tributary of the Red River to spill its banks. At least 50 Guard members were on hand over the weekend to aid efforts through Sunday. The National Weather Service has been predicting the Red Lake River to near 29 feet Monday or Tuesday. The record high water mark was 28.4 feet in 1997. No injuries or damages have been reported, and the city has not asked anyone to evacuate, Crookston Police Chief Darin Selzler said. Officials were switching from a sandbagging to monitoring stage late Sunday, the Crookston Times reports. Several counties in the northwestern Minnesota region have declared local emergencies and activated their emergency plans, according to Walz’s office. Many county roads were covered with water or washed out, and officials warned motorists about attempting to drive through flooded areas. The Red Lake River flows into the Red River at East Grand Forks and Grand Forks, North Dakota, where officials from both cities have started to activate permanent flood protection measures.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state is enacting a new law that says state and local government agencies cannot withhold services or refuse jobs to people who choose not to get vaccinated against COVID-19. The ban applies to state agencies, city and county governments and schools, community colleges and universities. COVID-19 vaccination mandates have not been widespread in Mississippi, but some lawmakers said they were acting against the possibility of government overreach. Republican Gov. Tate Reeves said Friday that he had signed House Bill 1509, and it became law immediately. “Government shouldn’t be in the business of forcing Americans to choose between the COVID-19 vaccine & putting food on their tables, sending their kids to school, or visiting a small business,” Reeves said on Twitter. The law specifies that COVID-19 vaccinations cannot be required for children to attend school or day care. It does not change Mississippi’s other childhood vaccination requirements, which are some of most stringent in the nation. The law also says anyone in Mississippi can cite “a sincerely held religious objection” to avoid a public or private employer’s COVID-19 vaccination mandate.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A bill approved by the state Senate would impose limits on Missouri’s public records law to exclude certain types of documents and communications and no longer classify some meetings of elected officials as “public.” Senate Bill 741 was initially designed to limit personal information of constituents from being public in records requested by members of the public but was amended Thursday by Sen. Andrew Koenig, R-St. Louis, to include a litany of other adjustments to the Missouri Sunshine Law. The law allows for members of the public, press and other organizations to request and acquire government documents. Under the bill, documents and communications “that do not have substantial administrative or operational value” would not be considered public records and could thus be made unobtainable through a request. “A lot of times when you’re working on a bill, you’re going to go through many drafts, and you want to be able to think out loud with your staff a little bit, and it might not even be a good idea,” Koenig said. “When it’s not a working document, I think it’s appropriate for that to not necessarily be public.” The legislation allows the state to close any document kept by lawmakers and staff “that contains information regarding proposed legislation or the legislative process.”\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A judge has temporarily blocked enforcement of a state law that required transgender people to have undergone a “surgical procedure” before being allowed to change the sex listed on their birth certificates. District Judge Michael Moses of Billings ruled Thursday that the law is unconstitutionally vague because it does not specify what surgical procedure must be performed. The law also required transgender people to obtain a court order indicating they’d had a surgical procedure. Because he could grant the temporary injunction based on the vagueness issue, Moses said he did not further analyze the constitutionality of the law. “We are thrilled that the court recognized the substantial and unnecessary burdens this law places upon transgender individuals in violation of their constitutional rights,” said Akilah Lane, staff attorney at the ACLU of Montana, which challenged the law. The plaintiffs – Amelia Marquez, of Billings, and a transgender man who is not identified in court records – wanted to change the sex on their birth certificates without undergoing costly surgical procedures. Both argue having a birth certificate that does not match their gender identity puts them at risk of embarrassment, discrimination, harassment or violence if they are asked to provide their birth certificate.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Google says it will invest more than $750 million in the state in 2022, including construction of a data center in Omaha. The Omaha World-Herald reports the investment also includes an expansion of Google’s existing data center in Papillion. Company leaders did not provide specific financial details for that or any of the other projects during an event with elected leaders in Papillion. The new northwest Omaha data center will be the third Google data center to open in the region. Along with the facility in Papillion, Google has one in Council Bluffs. The Nebraska projects are part of Google’s investment of about $9.5 billion in offices and data centers across the U.S. A company official said Google didn’t have any job figures for the Omaha area.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: An electric scooter sharing program years in the making has finally launched. The City Council approved an exclusive three-year franchising deal with Bird, a company that partners with cities to provide e-scooters and e-bikes. On Thursday, city officials and Bird representatives met for a ribbon-cutting ceremony to mark the official start of the program, which aims to bolster “micromobility” transport options downtown and in Midtown. Bird’s e-scooter fleet will deploy in phases over the next eight weeks, with the full fleet reaching approximately 1,000 scooters, a schedule released by City Council shows. The program operates at no cost to the city, which will receive a cut of every scooter ride around town. Riders will pay $1 to start the vehicle and 39 cents a minute thereafter, with Reno receiving 25 cents per ride and $20 per scooter in registration fees, though certain riders can get a 50% discount. The Bird deal has been years in the making as the city opted for a cautious approach to reimplementing an electric vehicle sharing program after its first partner, Lime, saw its electric bikes vandalized at the rate of nine per week in 2018.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state Senate has killed a proposed expansion of New Hampshire’s education tax credit program, arguing it would diminish the benefits for current beneficiaries. House Bill 1298 would have raised the upper income limit for the state’s tax credit scholarship program from 300% of the federal poverty level to 500%. Created in 2013, the program provides scholarships for students by allowing businesses to donate to the scholarship fund that administers the program and receive a credit on their business taxes. The scholarships may be used for private school tuition. Advocates for the bill had argued that the expansion would allow the program to boost families in the middle class. Currently, the program can benefit any family of four making up to $83,250 per year; expanding it would allow a family of four making up to $138,750 to access the funds. But a bipartisan group of state senators said the expansion would only mean more students would be competing for the same pool of funds donated by businesses. “The (Senate education) committee heard concerns about the neediest of students receiving less funding from this tax credit program as this bill would open the pool to a larger population of students,” said Sen. Denise Ricciardi, R-Bedford Republican.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nOcean City: The developers of a wind energy farm off the southern New Jersey coast said Monday they have hired two companies to connect the project to the electrical grid on land. Ocean Wind 1 has signed contracts with companies that will build electrical substations on land and run power lines from the offshore wind farm to the onshore connection points. Ocean Wind 1 – a joint venture between Orsted, the Danish wind power company, and Newark-based PSEG – hired JINGOLI Power LLC and Burns & McDonnell Engineering Company Inc. The moves come as New Jersey is working aggressively to become the East Coast hub of the fast-growing offshore wind energy industry. In February, six companies bid a combined $4.37 billion for the right to build wind energy projects on the ocean floor off New Jersey and New York in the U.S. government’s largest such auction in history. Before that happened, New Jersey’s Board of Public Utilities approved three offshore wind energy projects: two by Orsted and one by Atlantic Shores. Those three projects combined aim to provide enough electricity to power more than 1.6 million homes. The Ocean Wind 1 project is among those three and could provide enough power for 500,000 homes.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nCarlsbad: State environmental regulators are reviewing plans submitted by Mosaic Potash to investigate and define the extent of groundwater contamination from discharges associated with potash mining along the Pecos River in southern New Mexico. The state Environment Department announced earlier this month that contamination had been detected in nearby groundwater monitoring wells between the company’s Laguna Grande lake and the river. As a result, the company was required to submit a plan for monitoring and dealing with the pollution. Potash mining is a main economic driver in Eddy County. A salt rich in potassium, potash is used mostly as a plant fertilizer and in animal feed. Carlsbad was the site of potash’s first discovery in North America in 1925 during oil drilling. The discovery led to a boom in development in the former ranching town that predated the area’s prominence in fossil fuels. Mosaic’s mine, about 16 miles east of Carlsbad, produces the ore both through its underground mining and via surface operations. Waste resulting from mining the ore is moved around the facility into multiple disposal areas, potentially leeching into groundwater supplies. Extracting potash from underground generates tailings that are disposed of along with salty brine water.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Several dozen teachers and other school employees in the city who officials said submitted fraudulent proof of COVID-19 vaccination were placed on leave as of Monday. The United Federation of Teachers is challenging the disciplinary action, which it says violates its collective bargaining agreement. The employees in question were placed on leave after investigators determined they had provided false vaccine cards, a spokesperson for the city Department of Education said. “Fraudulent vaccination cards are not only illegal, they also undermine the best line of protection our schools have against COVID-19 – universal adult vaccination,” the spokesperson, Nathaniel Styer, said in a statement. “We immediately moved to put these employees – fewer than 100 – on leave without pay.” A COVID-19 vaccination mandate took effect for New York City school employees last fall and was later expanded to include all city employees. The school vaccination rule was a key component of the city’s policy of opening all classrooms to in-person learning this academic year, rather than offering a remote option as some school districts did. The UFT said in a notice of claim that about 82 members were notified last week they were being placed on unpaid leave because they’d provided false proof of vaccination.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Leslie McCrae Dowless Jr., the key player in an absentee ballot fraud probe that led to a do-over congressional election, has died. His daughter, Andrea Dowless Heverly, wrote that her father “passed away peacefully” Sunday morning, according to a social media post. He had been diagnosed with an advanced form of lung cancer and died at his daughter’s home in Bladen County, his friend Jay DeLancy said. Dowless was in his mid-60s. The political operative was set to go on trial this summer on more than a dozen state criminal counts related to absentee ballot activities for the 2016 general election and the 2018 primary and general elections. A half-dozen others were also charged. Witnesses told state officials that Dowless, with help of his assistants, gathered hundreds of absentee ballots from Bladen County in 2018. Those workers testified they were directed to collect blank or incomplete ballots, forge signatures on them and even fill in votes for local candidates. The 2018 general election results for the 9th Congressional District were ultimately thrown out, and a new vote for the seat was ordered by the State Board of Elections, following an inquiry. Dowless was working in the 2018 congressional race for then-Republican candidate Mark Harris. No charges were filed against Harris.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Secretary of State Al Jaeger has approved the formatting of a petition for a proposed ballot measure to legalize recreational marijuana in the state. The sponsoring committee behind the petition must obtain 15,582 valid signatures by July 11 for the measure to be placed on November’s ballot. That figure amounts to 2% of North Dakota’s population. If supporters miss that deadline but obtain the signatures by April 21, 2023, the measure could be placed on the June 2024 ballot or come to a vote if a special election occurs before then. The proposed measure seeks to allow people age 21 or older to purchase and use marijuana under certain conditions, the Bismarck Tribune reports. It also sets up the framework for the sale of marijuana within North Dakota, a process that would be implemented by the state Department of Health and Human Services or another entity as determined by the Legislature. The department could register up to seven marijuana manufacturing businesses and 18 dispensaries. Similar petition drives have failed twice in recent years to gather enough signatures to place a measure on the ballot.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: State regulation of streams that flow temporarily after rainfall will be restricted under legislation signed into law by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine. Construction companies, the mining industry and other business groups say removing so-called ephemeral streams from regulation would make Ohio’s practice consistent with federal law. The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency created a permitting system for development projects affecting ephemeral streams after the government removed them from federal oversight in 2020 and left their regulation up to states. The EPA says about 36,500 miles of the state’s 115,200 miles of primary headwater streams are ephemeral streams. DeWine signed the bill last week, saying it strikes a balance between protecting state waterways and providing consistency in state regulations to support economic development. Environmental groups largely opposed the legislation, saying the streams play an important role in maintaining water quality. They also questioned why Ohio would remove the streams from regulation at the same time it’s spending millions to improve water quality under DeWine’s H2Ohio initiative.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: After calling for the disestablishment of a tribal reservation in eastern Oklahoma and criticizing the lingering impacts of the U.S. Supreme Court’s McGirt decision, a candidate for the 2nd Congressional District is receiving pushback from tribal leaders. John Bennett, 47, who is stepping away from his post as chairman of Oklahoma’s Republican Party to seek a seat in Congress, said he believes the court’s ruling continues to be an issue for law enforcement and needs to be reversed. “Congress needs to go back, and they need to de-establish the Muscogee (Creek) Nation reservation. I say once they do that, then they can carry on as they have, you know, all of these years,” Bennett told the Washington Examiner last week. “So when I get to Congress, this will be one of my priorities because it hurts everyone in my district, tribal and nontribal.” The Inter-Tribal Council of the Five Tribes, which includes the Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, Seminole and Muscogee Nations, said the anti-tribal rhetoric should not be welcome in Washington. In a statement signed by each of the tribes’ leaders, the group condemned Bennett’s comments for ignoring ongoing efforts to expand criminal justice systems alongside state and federal partners. They also said the call for a McGirt reversal is an attack on tribal sovereignty.\n\nOregon\n\nClatskanie: An investigator has determined that Clatskanie High School girls basketball players in northwest Oregon “more likely than not” used racist language against members of the De La Salle team during a December game. As a result, Clastkanie has been placed on probation by the Oregon School Activities Association until mid-February 2023, The Daily News reports. The association said the high school team’s players and coaches must engage with a guest speaker about equity and inclusion before next season, among other measures, and all Clatskanie student athletes and coaches must complete racial equity training and implicit bias training. A press release from Clatskanie High School athletic director and dean of students Ryan Tompkins on Wednesday confirmed the findings of the report more than two months after it was completed. Tompkins said the high school is prepared to meet the probation requirements. De La Salle North High School President Oscar Leong said he believes the drawn-out process of the investigation has resulted in positive change for student-athletes across Oregon. Additionally, the investigation found that Clatskanie school staff and referees assigned by the Lower Columbia Officials Association failed to address concerns about racially charged language after they were brought up during the game.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nDillsburg: A school board has denied a resident’s request form an After School Satan Club at Northern Elementary School. Hundreds from the community filled the auditorium for the Northern York County School District board meeting last week and erupted into applause when the votes were taken on the issue. Only board member Thomas Welch voted in favor of the club. The evening had more than two hours of citizen comments, with the majority opposed to the adoption of the club. Many comments focused on the age of the children the club would target, the cultural and biblical issues, and the content on the Satanic Temple’s website for the program. Many of the residents spent the evening rallying the crowd and quoting Christian scripture, saying regardless of any laws that allow freedom of speech, proposing the club is morally wrong. One said the introduction of the club would contribute to a social decline in school. “So nobody benefits from having an After School Satan Club, whether it be those who are against them or those who are in favor of them, because Satan always does harm all the time. That, philosophically, has been proven,” a resident asserted. There were some voices in support, saying that they understood the concerns but that the formation of the club was a constitutional right.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The U.S. Supreme Court will not take up a conservative advocacy group’s challenge to the state’s campaign finance laws. The Gaspee Project and national conservative legal groups appealed to the high court after two lower federal courts ruled against their 2019 lawsuit arguing Rhode Island’s campaign finance disclosure laws are unconstitutional. The Supreme Court denied Gaspee’s appeal petition Monday, according to Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha and the Campaign Legal Center, which defended the state’s campaign finance laws in the case. “To reduce political corruption, we need real transparency about who is spending big money in elections and to that end, voters in Rhode Island have a right to know who is attempting to influence their votes,” Campaign Legal Center Senior Vice President Paul Smith said in a news release. “This denial of review from the Supreme Court of the United States means that vital right will remain in place and continue to enable Rhode Islanders to be well-informed before heading into the voting booth.” The 2019 lawsuit from Gaspee and the Illinois Opportunity Project sought to strike down Rhode Island’s disclosure laws around “independent expenditures,” spending to influence an election that is not coordinated with any campaign.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nYork: A county is suing two cities inside its border, saying they are refusing to keep up with a deal to pay $73 per day to house jail inmates from the cities. York County said it will continue to take inmates from Rock Hill and Tega Cay until the court rules, The Herald of Rock Hill reports. Rock Hill officials said they don’t mind paying a fair fee, but York County has failed to give a detailed assessment of how it came up with a $73-a-day cost per inmate. The county originally wanted to charge $100 but lowered the assessment after Rock Hill asked for details, the city said in a statement. Documents obtained by the newspaper showed the cities were paying about $43 a day per inmate before the fees were increased. York County said other cities in the county like Fort Mill, Clover and the city of York have signed an agreement to pay the $73 fee. York County is asking a judge to decide if the county, which is legally required to have a jail, has to take inmates from cities without a written agreement on fees. Rock Hill officials said their residents and businesses pay York County $7.9 million in property taxes that help run the jail and the sheriff’s office.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Despite an annual $15 million given to the Bridge Improvement Grant program and other additional funding focused on bridges, the state continues to tread water when it comes to how quickly work is done, leaving hundreds of bridges requiring “high priority” corrective repairs and dozens closed. An analysis of data through the Federal Highway Administration’s National Bridge Inspection program focused on the vast amount of data that FHA collects on the nation’s bridges, looking at data from 2015 and the most recent data from 2021. To some, the bridge program, as well as other aspects of the 2015 transportation package, haven’t panned out the way they were supposed to. “I know I’m sounding a little bit negative about it, but I feel like we got duped a little bit,” Brown County Highway Superintendent Dirk Rogers said. The BIG program was created as a collaboration between the state and local governments. To be eligible to participate, counties had to enact local wheel taxes on vehicles so they had a source of local funds in the program. Since 2015, 37 counties have added a wheel tax, according to the South Dakota Department of Revenue, and only six counties in the state don’t have a wheel tax.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state will soon add harsh penalties against public schools that allow transgender athletes to participate in girls’ sports, under legislation signed into law by Republican Gov. Bill Lee. Lee quietly signed the proposal last Friday without comment. The governor had previously signed a measure last year mandating that student-athletes must prove their sex matches that listed on the student’s “original” birth certificate. If a birth certificate is unavailable, then the parents must provide another form of evidence “indicating the student’s sex at the time of birth.” This year, the GOP-controlled Legislature decided to add penalties to that ban, which is in effect even as a lawsuit challenging its constitutionality makes it way through court. A trial has been tentatively set for March 2023. According to the bill, Tennessee’s Department of Education would withhold a portion of state funds from local school districts that fail to determine a student’s gender for participation in middle or high school sports. The measure does not specify exactly how much money should be withheld by the state. The bill will go into effect July 1. “Telling transgender students that they can’t participate as who they really are amounts to excluding them from sports entirely – depriving them of opportunities available to their peers and sending the message that they are not worthy of a full life,” Henry Seaton, ACLU of Tennessee’s transgender justice advocate, said in a statement.\n\nTexas\n\nEagle Pass: Search crews on Monday recovered the body of a Texas National Guard member who went missing after jumping in the river on the U.S.-Mexico border to help a migrant who was struggling to swim across. The body of Spc. Bishop Evans was found three days after he was reported missing in the Rio Grande near the border city of Eagle Pass. The local sheriff has said Evans jumped into the river without his jacket or radio to help a woman who appeared in distress while trying to swim over from Mexico. “Our National Guard soldiers risk their lives every day to serve and protect others and we are eternally grateful for the way SPC Evans heroically served his state and country,” Gov. Greg Abbott said in a statement Monday. The body was found near the boat ramp of a bridge in Eagle Pass, said Democratic state Sen. Roland Gutierrez, whose district includes Eagle Pass. Migrant rescues are common in the river along the Texas border, and the attempted crossings are also sometimes deadly. Maverick County Sheriff Tom Schmerber said the bodies of as many as two migrants a week are sometimes found along his county’s section of the river. Evans was assigned to Abbott’s sprawling border mission known as Operation Lone Star. Gutierrez said Evans is at least the fifth Guard member known to have died during the mission that began last year. He called for an inquest into their deaths.\n\nUtah\n\nCedar City: Four people were killed when a single-engine airplane on a sightseeing tour crashed minutes after takeoff in rural southwestern Utah, authorities said Sunday. Deputies discovered the aircraft after responding to a report of a fire just before 7 p.m. Saturday about 5 miles east of Cedar City, the Iron County Sheriff’s Office said. Pronounced dead at the scene were pilot Steven Eatchel and his wife, Lindsay Eatchel, of Springville, Utah; Thomas Eatchel, of Heber City, Utah; and Danielle Deagostini, of Sandy City, the sheriff’s office said. The National Transportation Safety Board identified the aircraft as a Diamond DA-40 and said it was investigating the crash. No cause was immediately identified. The plane earlier in the day flew from Spanish Fork to Cedar City, where it had a layover of about 21/ 2 hours at the regional airport before taking off and heading east toward some mountains for a sightseeing tour of Zion National Park, the sheriff’s office said. Radar communication with the aircraft was lost about four minutes after it took off. The position of the downed aircraft and damage to foliage at the crash site suggested it was headed west when it crashed, the sheriff’s office said.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The share of Vermonters living with a disability is growing quickly, yet nobody is sure just how many people fall under this category – an uncertainty that may affect how the state allocates money for support. Vermont’s population of people who have at least one disability rose nearly 10% between 2011 and 2020 to over 14% of people in the state, according to a study by Avacare Medical Blog, which analyzed 2021 U.S. Census Bureau data. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says about 1 in 5 adults in Vermont has at least one disability. Even higher is the figure from the Vermont Department of Health, which says 24% of Vermont adults had at least one disability as of 2019. How people are polled and how disability is defined can make it difficult to understand the true number of those living with a disability in Vermont, said Sarah Launderville, executive director of the Vermont Center for Independent Living. “I think that there’s a bunch of people who might not think that they fit into that category of disability because of the way that we look at disability in society,” Launderville said. To be considered disabled by the Social Security Administration and receive financial support, a person’s disability cannot be “partial” or “short-term,” meaning a medical condition prevents ability to work, according to the agency website. However, not all types of disabilities prevent someone from working or living independently.\n\nVirginia\n\nFalls Church: The Arlington County Board gave unanimous approval Saturday to Amazon’s plans to build a unique, helix-shaped tower as the centerpiece of its emerging second headquarters in northern Virginia. Amazon announced the plans in February 2021 for the eye-catching, 350-foot tower to anchor the second phase of its redevelopment plans. The new office towers will support a second headquarters for Amazon that is expected to welcome more than 25,000 workers when complete. The helix is one of several office towers granted approval, but it stands out. The spiral design features a walkable ramp wrapping around the building with trees and greenery planted to resemble a mountain hike. Amazon has said the building is designed to help people connect to nature, and the outdoor mountain climb will be open to the public on weekends. The plans have gone through the famously thorough review process of Arlington County, including numerous public hearings. Earlier this month, the county planning commission voted 9-0 to support the project. On Saturday, the County Board voted 5-0 to approve the plans. They also include park space and will accommodate a community high school, along with ground-level retail. Amazon has said it hopes to complete the project in 2025.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympic National Park: The Olympic Peninsula has lost 45% of its glacier coverage since 1980, according to a new study by Portland State University professor Andrew Fountain and co-authors from Washington state and British Columbia. The peninsula’s remaining 250 glaciers, which covered about 2 square miles at last estimate, should be gone in another 50 years as humanity’s pollution continues to overheat the planet, the study found. Fountain told KUOW glaciers worldwide are getting a kind of double whammy, with less snow in the winter and more melt in the summer. Beyond the fascination they provide for a small community of researchers, glaciers serve as frozen reservoirs. “These glaciers provide water during the hottest, driest parts of the year,” Fountain said. Salmon and people in glacier-fed watersheds rely on nature’s ice chests to keep rivers flowing and cool each summer. Fountain said a rapid end to fossil fuel burning could delay the glacial melt-off by a few decades. “We have to encourage our lawmakers to start enacting legislation to cut greenhouse gases,” he said. “I think, for the foreseeable future, the fate(s) of the glaciers on the Olympic Peninsula are sealed.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nNorthfork: Several communities in the state’s southern coal fields celebrated the completion of a long-awaited project to bring clean water to local communities last week. The Elkhorn Water Project began in 2015 and included a new 400,000-gallon water storage tank on Elkhorn Mountain. The recently completed second phase brings county water to 112 McDowell County Service District customers in Upland, Kyle and Powhatan; 163 customers in Northfork and Algoma; and 101 in Keystone, the Bluefield Daily Telegraph reports. Many water systems in the area were installed in the early 1900s by coal companies and have been failing for years. Residents of Keystone, for example, were under a boil-water notice for more than a decade. U.S. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., met with local and state officials Thursday to celebrate the completion of the second phase. Capito said clean drinking water is among the basic infrastructure rights, which also include good roads and broadband access.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWaukesha: Five months after an SUV plowed through the crowd and killed six people at a Christmas parade, the city continues to have the tragedy in mind in legislative decisions. Various committees have studied proposals for things such as a permanent parade memorial, safety barricades and public consideration of how to address the 2022 parade. The actions complement an effort by nonprofit organizations to collect and disperse funds to aid the hundreds of victims in the parade tragedy. Waukesha’s Christmas Parade in 2021 will forever stand for the tragedy that it was, and a special commission with the city has begun to try to figure out how to memorialize those who died. The Waukesha Parade Memorial Commission has considered creating three sites: a permanent large memorial, possibly in Grebe Park, and one or two smaller sites along the parade route on Main Street. “It’s about what we can to help avoid this anytime in the future, not just for Waukesha but for any community,” said Jerry Couri, the commission’s chairman, whose business, Couri Insurance Agency, has long been a fixture on Main Street. The commission began with the expectation of having the permanent memorial in place in 14 to 15 months. Couri said members are keeping that time frame in mind as they develop ideas.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Conservation groups are still seeking protections for a rare plant that scuttled plans for a gypsum mine in the Bighorn Basin area, the Casper Star-Tribune reports.

The program Partners in Preservation says the old Monroe County Courthouse is receiving $125,000 to repair serious structural problems in a wall. Recipients were announced following an online vote. The 115-year-old former courthouse is now a museum that tells the story of Lee and fellow writer Truman Capote, who were both from Monroeville. Lee’s Pulitzer Prize-winning book used the red-brick structure as the model for a pivotal trial scene in her story of racial injustice. The two-story courtroom was then recreated as a Hollywood set for the 1962 movie based on Lee’s novel. Partners in Preservation is a project of the National Trust for Historic Preservation and American Express.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Leaders of the state Senate majority and minority say Attorney General Kevin Clarkson is violating the state constitution by not defending a law that encourages construction firms to use Alaska workers on state contracts. The Anchorage Daily News reports Senate President Cathy Giessel and Minority Leader Tom Begich, in separate letters, say Clarkson should be defending the law until it’s ruled on by a judge. Clarkson says he took an oath to defend the U.S. and Alaska constitutions. He says local-hire law violates those constitutions, and it makes sense to stop enforcing it. At the time of its passage, Alaska’s local-hire law was believed to be in accordance with the law, and it has remained in force for 30 years. A construction company challenged the law this year.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: In this city widely credited as the birthplace of the 1980s Sanctuary Movement – an effort by churches to help refugees from Central America and shield them from deportation – a group of activists is looking to revive that history of aggressively resisting immigration authorities. Voters will decide Tuesday whether to designate Tucson as Arizona’s only sanctuary city, a direct challenge to President Donald Trump and to the anti-illegal immigration law that put a spotlight on the state nearly a decade ago. Many in Tucson are eager to send Trump a message that disapproves of his immigration policies. But even some on the left worry the measure would merely draw the ire of the president and his allies in the Arizona Legislature without improving conditions for migrants.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: North Little Rock has its eyes on the future as the city builds upon its downtown district, but school district officials want to make sure it doesn’t forget the past when it comes to the Ole Main High School building, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. The North Little Rock School District recently announced plans to form a task force to provide direction to the Board of Education on how to preserve the historic building that is adjacent to the current high school, which opened in 2015. Board members will suggest one person each for the committee along with three at-large positions and one designated position for the North Little Rock History Commission. The task force will meet and report to the School Board. Board President Tracy Steele said he has already fielded numerous calls from people who want to be on the board.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The start of the commercial Dungeness crab season will likely be delayed by a week to lower the risk of whales getting entangled in fishing lines. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife said opening day of the season may be postponed from Nov. 15 to Nov. 23. The department said the earlier date presents “a significant risk” of whale entanglement. CDFW Director Charlton Bonham said fishing, environmental and management agencies were consulted before making the preliminary decision. The recreational crab season began Saturday. State health officials warned people not to consume the internal organs or guts of crab caught in two coastal areas due to the presence of domoic acid, a naturally occurring toxin that can cause vomiting or diarrhea when consumed.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A state legislative committee formed in the wake of a fatal shooting at a suburban school has proposed five bills that legislators hope will make schools safer. The Denver Post reports the interim committee didn’t introduce any bills on controversial topics, such as gun control or arming teachers, during its work following the May 7 attack on STEM School Highlands Ranch. Police, teachers and others told committee members that Colorado has good programs to prevent violence, but they aren’t used consistently statewide. Lawmakers also expressed concern about gaps and duplication in the state’s school safety programs. The committee’s draft bills approved last week for consideration by the 2020 Legislature include bills that would reorganize the Safe2Tell anonymous tip system and create a working group to continue studying school safety.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The leader of a coalition of cities and towns across the state says municipal officials are facing an “environmental crisis” of diseased trees, warning the first significant snowfall this year could bring down hundreds across the state, as well as thousands of tree limbs. Connecticut Conference of Municipalities Executive Director Joe DeLong sent a letter Thursday to Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont, seeking additional resources and help dealing with the fallout of trees infested and subsequently weakened by emerald ash borer beetles and gypsy moth caterpillars. Over the weekend, utility crews were restoring power to communities affected by a strong Halloween night storm that left behind numerous downed wires. In Marlborough, local officials say many of the limbs fell on power lines because the trees were too brittle to withstand the high winds.\n\nDelaware\n\nNewark: Beginning early next year, the city’s police officers will be wearing one more piece of equipment: body cameras. At a Newark City Council meeting last week, council members approved a nearly $630,000 request for video equipment, including 60 body cameras. The devices cost about $350,000. The rest of the money will go toward replacing dashboard cameras in Newark patrol vehicles and updating video equipment in interview rooms. The $628,867.77 required for all the equipment, which will be provided by Axon, formerly known as Taser International, will be paid out over five years. Federal and state grants will cover $152,640, while the other $476,227.77 will be paid through Newark’s 2019-2023 Capital Improvements Program.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The mayor and the chair of the D.C. Council have nominated two people to represent the city on the regional transit authority board. The Washington Post reports D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson nominated former federal transportation official Stephanie Gidigbi to serve as one of the district’s two voting members on the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority board. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser nominated Lucinda Babers, a deputy mayor for infrastructure. The board spots were vacated when Councilman Jack Evans and Corbett Price resigned their seats after an ethics scandal. Evans resigned this summer after a legal memo saying he knowingly violated board ethics became public. Price later resigned after he lied about the findings of the ethics probe. The full D.C. Council must approve the nominations.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: A new report is recommending a new board, inspector general and ethics standards for the scandal-plagued Florida Virtual School. The Orlando Sentinel reports the recommendations released Friday by the Florida Department of Education also say Florida’s public online school needs to implement cybersecurity measures. The school had a data breach last year, and its former general counsel resigned following an investigation by the Sentinel that documented accusations of improper spending and behavior. Gov. Ron DeSantis and state lawmakers ordered a state takeover of the online school, which operates as its own $240 million public school district serving more than 200,000 students. All Florida public high school students are required to take at least one virtual class, and many choose the school as the provider.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A memorial service was held over the weekend to remember the victims of the Atlanta child murders in the 1970s and 1980s. WSB-TV reports dozens of people, including some family members of the victims, gathered for the service Saturday. The string of murders of mostly black boys terrorized the city between 1979 and 1981. The service included the lighting of candles, songs and a procession of hearses. “The pain is still here,” said Catherine Leach, who lost her son Curtis Walker 40 years ago. Wayne Williams was given two life sentences in 1982 for convictions in the deaths of two adults, thought to be among 29 black children and young adults killed. Police blamed him for the other killings but never charged him. There has been a renewed push to reexamine evidence in the case.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: An environmental advocacy group has filed a lawsuit against a federal agency for what it says is a failure to protect habitat for 14 endangered species on Hawaii island. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports the Center for Biological Diversity says the failure to designate critical habitat for the plants and animals in a timely manner is a violation of the Endangered Species Act. The lawsuit names Interior Secretary David Bernhardt and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as defendants. The national organization says the Fish and Wildlife Service listed 15 plant and animal species in Hawaii as endangered in October 2013. The lawsuit says the agency was required under the act to designate critical habitat but has only done so for one of the protected species.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: About 35,000 Idaho residents have signed up for Medicaid under expanded coverage in the first few days it has been offered. The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare said Monday that’s more than a third of the estimated 91,000 people who are eligible. The agency started taking applications Friday. Idaho voters authorized Medicaid expansion last year with an initiative that passed with 61% of the vote, but lawmakers earlier this year added restrictions requiring five waivers. Federal officials have yet to approve any of the waivers, but enrollment is proceeding with coverage starting Jan. 1. The expansion provides Medicaid to people earning up to a maximum of 138% of the federal poverty level. That maximum is about $17,000 a year for one person and $35,500 for a family of four.\n\nIllinois\n\nPeoria: Officials at Bradley University are marking the first phase of a $100 million new business and engineering building. The (Peoria) Journal Star reports university officials dedicated the building in a Friday ceremony attended by hundreds. Officials say the building’s design will allow students to better collaborate with an open atrium and wide hallways. Crews are still putting the final touches on the 270,000-square-foot Business and Engineering Convergence Center as faculty and staff move in. Classes will start within a few weeks. The building will have 200 offices, dozens of classrooms and more than 40 specialized labs. Work is yet to begin on the second phase, which will include the building’s final wing and require demolition of the old engineer building.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A state legislative panel is recommending that Indiana’s legal age for buying cigarettes be raised from 18 to 21. The Legislature’s public health study committee approved the recommendation last week after hearing testimony recently on the change that has failed to advance among lawmakers for several years. The Journal Gazette reports the proposed age change would cover both traditional and electronic cigarettes. Committee chairman Sen. Ed Charbonneau of Valparaiso says he doesn’t expect action until at least the 2021 legislative session, when a new state budget is considered, because Indiana cigarette tax revenue could decline with the change. Sen. Vaneta Becker of Evansville countered that the state might see a loss in tax revenue initially but will save on long-term health expenses.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: The University of Iowa has developed a temporary card to allow students who lack other forms of identification to vote in Tuesday’s election. The card was created at the nudging of student government organizers committed to making voting more accessible to students in the wake of changes to the Iowa Code in 2017 requiring IDs at the polls. Student government collaborators are hopeful this week’s combined city-school election will serve as a test run for the temporary IDs, leading up to the 2020 presidential election. According to the Iowa secretary of state’s office, unregistered residents can vote on the day of an election by showing proof of residency and a school-issued photo ID – but that ID must include an expiration date. The UI’s standard student ID card does not include one, but the temporary cards do: Nov. 6, just one day after the election.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Abortion opponents pushing for a constitutional amendment to ban the procedure in the state are meeting resistance from other anti-abortion groups. Two legislative committees have recommended that lawmakers consider the issue during the 2020 legislative session. The recommendations come as lawmakers try to determine how to respond to a Kansas Supreme Court ruling that the state’s constitution guarantees a right to abortion. Kansas News Service reports that at a hearing last week, some advocates pushed for a “personhood amendment” that would ban all abortions in Kansas. But some of the state’s largest anti-abortion groups say the personhood amendment is not practical. Anti-abortion legislators have generally deferred to Kansans for Life on abortion policy issues for more than two decades. That group argues that an incremental approach builds public support for greater restrictions.\n\nKentucky\n\nGrand Rivers: Officials say they’ve installed a riverbed bubbler and sound system in a lake as an experimental and environmentally friendly way to keep an invasive fish from spreading. The Paducah Sun reports federal, state and local officials are holding an event Friday to showcase the deployment of the bio-acoustic fish fence at Barkley Dam in western Kentucky. It will be evaluated over the course of the next three years, although officials hope to see some preliminary results next year. Several agencies in Kentucky and Tennessee are combining funding, technology or staff to help stop the spread of Asian carp. Lyon County Judge-Executive Wade White says if the bio-acoustic systems proves effective, it will likely be used in other places to deter the spread of the fish.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLafayette: A volunteer search-and-rescue group says it has changed its name to avoid confusion with a similarly named organization whose leader is accused of taking money from a fundraiser meant for children. The director of Pinnacle Search and Rescue, formerly known as Cajun Navy 2016, told KADN-TV it sped up its name change when the president of a separate group called America’s Cajun Navy was charged with fraud two weeks ago. News outlets report the change also comes as its own president, Jon Bridgers, faces fraud charges after a homeowner said he agreed to do contracting work on a house but never finished. Pinnacle Search and Rescue director Ben Husser said some were confusing the two organizations. Both groups include private boat owners who assist rescue operations.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Gun control advocates say they plan to keep pushing for tighter gun controls in Maine, despite the failure of a flurry of proposals to move forward during the coming legislative session. Democrats proposed several changes to the state’s gun laws for the session that begins in January, but the Legislative Council rejected most of them and tabled one. Proposals need the council’s approval to move on to legislative committees and the full Statehouse. Members of the Maine chapter of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America say the proposals would’ve protected children from potential school shootings and gun accidents in the home. Republican Sen. Jeffrey Timberlake, who sits on the council, said the proposals didn’t rise to the level of emergency legislation, which is the purpose of the session.\n\nMaryland\n\nGermantown: A decision by a county executive to ban a police station from displaying a “thin blue line” flag is drawing criticism from Gov. Larry Hogan. The wooden flag was a gift from a local resident in recognition of National First Responders Day. It was to be displayed in the 5th District Station. News outlets report that Democratic Montgomery County Executive Marc Elrich said the flag provides a symbol of “support” to some but is a symbol of “dismissiveness” to others. The “thin blue line” flag has been labeled by some as a response to the Black Lives Matter movement. Hogan, a Republican, said in a series of tweets Sunday that he was “offended and disgusted” that Elrich had prohibited officers from displaying the flag.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWellfleet: A marine biologist is reporting a sharp rise in number of sunfish stranded on Cape Cod beaches. The unusual-looking migratory fish, which can grow to nearly 9 feet long and weigh thousands of pounds, can be found in mid- to late summer off the state’s coast. Marine biologist Carol “Krill” Carson tells the Cape Cod Times that a couple dozen or more are usually found stranded on beaches annually. So far, about 130 have been stranded this year. Carson says this year is “out of control,” noting the stranding season starts in mid-August and runs through ecember. She has a network of about 30 volunteers who assist her in returning the fish to the sea or taking tissue samples if it’s dead. The sunfish is capable of long migrations to the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico in the winter.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The state is lowering or eliminating fees assessed on people who register to use marijuana for medical reasons. The Marijuana Regulatory Agency announced last week that new rules are in effect. The application fee for a two-year registry card is now $40, down from $60. A $10 fee to update, replace, add or remove a caregiver has been eliminated. Caregivers, who supply patients with marijuana, will no longer have to pay a $25 background check processing fee. Marijuana Regulatory Agency Executive Director Andrew Brisbo says the state has worked hard to streamline the process for cardholders, not only lowering costs but also making it easier for patients to apply for and receive their cards.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: An enterprising college student who drove to Iowa every weekend to buy hundreds of Krispy Kreme doughnuts that he then sold to his own customers in the Twin Cities area has been warned by the confectionary giant to stop. There have been no Krispy Kreme stores in Minnesota for 11 years. Jayson Gonzalez, 21, of Champlin, Minnesota, would drive 270 miles to a Krispy Kreme store in Clive, Iowa, pack his car with up to 100 boxes of a dozen doughnuts, then drive back north. He charged $17 to $20 per box and said some of his customers spent nearly $100 each time. Gonzalez said he did not receive a discount from the store in Iowa. But less than a week after the St. Paul Pioneer Press reported on his money-making scheme, Gonzalez received a phone call from Krispy Kreme’s Nebraska office telling him to stop. In a statement Sunday night, Krispy Kreme said it’s looking into the matter.\n\nMississippi\n\nGlendora: Men carrying a white nationalist flag were caught on security cameras trying to film in front of a new memorial to lynching victim Emmett Till. Patrick Weems, executive director of the Emmett Till Memorial Commission, says cameras captured the incident Saturday. Security footage from the commission shows the men, one carrying a neo-Confederate group flag, filming at the site. They are seeing running away when a security alarm sounds. Weems says he believes they were filming a propaganda video. Till was 14 when he was beaten and killed in 1955 after he whistled at a white woman. The memorial is at the site where Till’s body was pulled from a river. A bulletproof memorial to Till was dedicated Oct. 19 after the first three markers were vandalized.\n\nMissouri\n\nCape Girardeau: A program that helps young men reach their full potential is earning accolades from southeast Missouri leaders and members of the Legislature’s Black Caucus. The Southeast Missourian reports the Honorable Young Men Club provides mentoring for students in the Cape Girardeau School District, but its organizers hope to expand elsewhere. The program was begun in 2016 by four former Southeast Missouri State University football players, including one now with the Baltimore Ravens, Aaron Adeoye. The other three recently hosted a gathering to show the benefits of the program. The event was organized by former Republican Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder. Co-founders say students who participate in the program have better grades, higher attendance and fewer suspensions than their peers.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Figures from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis indicate that Montana outpaces neighboring Wyoming when it comes to recreation economies. The Billings Gazette reports that based on data from 2017, the analysis puts Montana’s total outdoor recreation value at $2.3 billion, compared to $1.6 billion in Wyoming. This is the first national report to drill into state-by-state recreation economies. Rachel VandeVoort, director of the Montana office of Outdoors Recreation, said the state-by-state analysis is helpful in making decisions, such as investing in habitat, protecting public or private lands, or contributing funding to new opportunities. University of Wyoming economics professor Rob Godby attributes the disparity between the two states to Montana’s larger population and more urban areas, which means more businesses catering to hunters, anglers, skiers and bikers.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The Salvation Army’s annual Tree of Lights campaign is set to get underway in the area this week with the annual lighting of metal Christmas trees in front of American National Bank branches in central Omaha and in Council Bluffs, Iowa. In Omaha, hundreds are expected to gather Friday for the lighting of a 75-foot tall, 2-ton metal tree with more than 60,000 LED lights and 600 lit snowflakes, topped by a 6-foot star. The event features live music, food, reindeer and other Christmas-themed offerings. Across the Missouri River, the Salvation Army will also light a Christmas tree atop the American National Bank branch in Council Bluffs and serve refreshments. The lighting ceremonies kick off the Salvation Army’s red kettle bell-ringing drive.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A new commander has been chosen to lead Nevada’s 152nd Airlift Wing, also known as the “High Rollers.” Col. Jacob Hammons, an F-16 pilot from Las Vegas, replaced Reno native Col. Eric Wade during a change-of-command ceremony Saturday at the Nevada Air National Guard base. “(I’m) excited, ready to get going,” Hammons said. The 152nd Airlift Wing includes 1,016 airmen, most of whom serve one weekend a month and two weeks each year as traditional guardsmen in a reserve force that supports the federal government overseas, according to the Nevada Air National Guard. The unit provides tactical airlift worldwide and expeditionary combat support. It also operates the U.S. Forest Service’s Modular Airborne Fire Fighting System, which transforms cargo aircraft into firefighting air tankers.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Fifth graders across the state are heading to the polls this week to elect the next “Kid Governor.” This is the second year the state has participated in a national civics program aimed at encouraging civic engagement by teaching students about the history of voting rights, the qualities of good leaders and the mechanics of campaigns. More than 450 students in six New Hampshire schools participated last year, selecting Lola Giannelli, of Nashua, as their first Kid Governor. She has spent the past year promoting efforts to protect animals from abuse. The seven candidates hoping to succeed her have platforms that include topics such as bullying, underage tobacco use, and college and career awareness. Voting started Monday and ends Nov. 12.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Nearly a third of the state’s lawmakers also work in other government jobs with payments that not only increase their pensions but also raise ethical questions about whom they serve when they cast votes in the Legislature, an investigation finds. The 37 lawmakers holding more than one government job or contract racked up nearly $2.7 million in additional taxpayer income beyond their $49,000-a-year Statehouse salaries, the investigation found. Due to quirks in state law, longtime lawmakers can still pad their pensions even though a series of reforms in the past decade limited the plump payout for newer legislators. Good-government groups say so-called double-dipping creates an increased risk of conflict, potential favoritism and a drain on public dollars.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nCarlsbad: Members of this arid state’s congressional delegation are looking for ways to combat water scarcity here and across the West. U.S. Sen. Tom Udall is blaming climate change for growing water scarcity, worrying that New Mexico snowpacks are getting smaller and unable to adequately feed the Rio Grande and the rest of the state’s groundwater supplies. He and other lawmakers last week introduced the Western Water Security Act of 2019. They say the goal is to strengthen New Mexico’s water infrastructure and focus efforts on conservation and the restoration of water supplies throughout the West. The latest federal drought map shows a big pocket of moderate to severe drought over the Four Corners region, where New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado and Utah meet.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The city’s police commissioner is retiring after three years, and a top deputy will succeed him as the leader of the nation’s largest police department, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Monday. James O’Neill, 61, moved the police department away from controversial “broken windows” policies and oversaw continuing drops in crime. He will remain on the job until next month, when he leaves for a job in the private sector. Chief of Detectives Dermot Shea, a 28-year department member who started as a patrolman in the south Bronx, will be the new commissioner. Shea rose to prominence as the department’s statistical guru, and de Blasio said he is “one of the best-prepared incoming police commissioners this city has ever seen.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A treasure hunter who accuses the state of misusing his images from Blackbeard’s flagship says he’ll ask for 10 times the damages he originally sought, now that a court ruling has come down in his favor. John Masters of Intersal Inc. says he plans to seek $140 million in damages from North Carolina following the ruling Friday from the state Supreme Court that the case must return to Business Court. He said an expert witness had put Intersal’s losses from the state’s use of more than 2,000 images and more than 200 minutes of film at $129 million. He’s seeking another $11 million for losses over a permit that the state denied him, which would have allowed Intersal to search for a Spanish ship. Almost a quarter-century ago, Masters’ father discovered the wreckage of the Queen Anne’s Revenge, which ran aground in Beaufort, in what was then the colony of North Carolina, in 1718.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State wildlife officials say the number of tags issued for the upcoming deer hunt is up by about 10,000. The Game and Fish Department says about 67,500 deer tags have been issued. Wildlife division chief Jeb Williams says the deer population is trending up in western North Dakota, while the eastern part of the state has been slower from the rough winters of 2009, 2010 and 2011. The Bismarck Tribune reports Williams says there are fewer acres idled under the federal Conservation Reserve Program than a dozen years ago, which means less habitat. In 2018, 64% of tag holders harvested a deer, a little below the department’s benchmark of 70%. The season opens at noon Friday and ends Nov. 24.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The Ohio Veterans Hall of Fame will honor 20 veterans at this year’s annual induction ceremony. Members of the 2019 class will be inducted Thursday at the Radiant Life Church in the Columbus suburb of Dublin. Gov. Mike DeWine and Deborah Ashenhurst, director of the Ohio Department of Veterans Services, will honor the class with medals. Officials say the public is invited to the 10 a.m. ceremony. Former Gov. George Voinovich established the Hall of Fame in 1992 to recognize outstanding professional achievement, service to the community and selfless acts of veterans following their military service. Honorees include astronauts, volunteers, community leaders, veteran advocates and former government officials, among others. The 2019 class joins 875 Ohio veterans inducted since the Hall of Fame was created.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: More than 400 inmates walked out the doors of prisons across the state Monday as part of what officials say is the largest single-day mass commutation in U.S. history. Monday’s release of inmates, all with convictions for low-level drug and property crimes, resulted from a bill signed by new Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt. The bill retroactively applied misdemeanor sentences for simple drug possession and low-level property crimes that state voters approved in 2016. Stitt has made reducing Oklahoma’s highest-in-the-nation incarceration rate one of his top priorities and has appointed reform-minded members to the state’s Pardon and Parole Board. The board last week considered 814 cases and recommended 527 inmates for commutation. However, 65 are being held on detainers, leaving about 462 inmates to be released Monday.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A timber investment firm is selling more than 3,000 acres along the Columbia River that has been used to grow poplar trees. The Capital Press reports Greenwood Resources had used the land to grow poplar trees for the U.S. paper industry, but experts say international competition and a low profit margin have made that difficult. Poplar plantations arose due to steep logging declines on federal land in the Pacific Northwest as paper companies worried about acquiring sufficient wood chips to run their plants. But that shortage never materialized, and efforts to grow larger poplar trees for use in furniture construction were stymied by competition from alder wood. Alder trees grow naturally in Pacific Northwest forests and don’t need to be grown on plantations, making them cheaper.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: After four years of testing, the Pennsylvania Turnpike says it plans to move ahead with a $129 million project to become a completely cashless toll system in two years, eliminating hundreds of toll-collecting and auditing positions along the way. Turnpike CEO Mark Compton told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette last week that “the goal is to have the system completely cashless by the fall off 2021.” Toll booths will still be at some exit ramps until 2026 to record E-ZPass signals or photograph license plates so bills can be mailed to drivers. The jobs of the 600 remaining toll collectors and toll auditors will be eliminated, but officials say they will have the opportunity to move into other turnpike jobs or to take classes at the turnpike’s expense.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Gun safety advocates want the state’s family court judges to require more domestic abusers to surrender their firearms. A report released Monday shows 34% of domestic abusers are being ordered to surrender their weapons in final orders of protection. That’s an increase from 5% before a 2017 state law regarding firearm surrenders took effect. In cases where a defendant is ordered to surrender firearms, 36% filed an affidavit – as required under the law – to prove they no longer have the weapons. The report was compiled by Everytown for Gun Safety and Moms Demand Action. Besides court files, it relies on observations of trained volunteers who monitored 289 domestic violence protection order cases between October 2018 and May 2019. Some judges disagree about how the law should be interpreted.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: State authorities are looking into the finances of Emanuel AME Church, which received millions in donations after a racist attack left nine worshippers at a Bible study dead in 2015. The Post and Courier reports State Law Enforcement Division spokesman Tommy Crosby confirmed the investigation last week but declined to elaborate. The church’s former secretary, Althea Latham, says she spoke to SLED agents recently about the handling of those donations. Latham has long contended that her contract wasn’t renewed less than two months after the shooting because she questioned processing and transparency surrounding the money that was coming in. Church leaders have said her contract simply wasn’t renewed. Latham hopes accountability will resolve lingering suspicions over the donations.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Feeding South Dakota is launching its yearly Thanksgiving Meal Drive as the nonprofit aims to help thousands of families who couldn’t otherwise afford the holiday. Givers who are looking for a way to help can donate food or money to Feeding South Dakota through Nov. 23. The nonprofit hopes to distribute 3,400 turkeys and meals to families across South Dakota on the Saturday before the holiday. Donors Greg and Pam Sands will match any online financial donations up to $15,000. A $20 gift is enough to pay for a turkey dinner for a family of four, according to Feeding South Dakota. People can make financial donations online or by phone at 605-335-0364, ext. 126.\n\nTennessee\n\nAshland City: Neal Ryder was growing produce in part to make his own baby food for 3-month-old son Griffin when he grew a whopping 22.6-pound sweet potato. Ryder says he didn’t realize a sweet potato could grow that big and didn’t consider himself a record-setter “by any means,” but he might have done just that. Guinness World Records shows that the heaviest sweet potato in the world was grown in Spain in 2004. It weighed 81 pounds and 9 ounces, according to Guinness World Records and the Great Pumpkin Commonwealth. Though Ryder’s sweet potato is a fraction of the world record, it could make Tennessee history. Last year, an East Tennessee woman grew a sweet potato that rang in at nearly 14 pounds. News reports from that time claimed it was a record.\n\nTexas\n\nSan Antonio: The mesquite, an iconic tree in the Lone Star State, provides a blessing and a curse, the San Antonio Express-News reports. Ranch manager Farron Sultemeier notes its beans provide late summer feed for cattle and wildlife. But it spreads ridiculously fast and is almost unstoppably invasive. Texas mesquites also produce thorns sharp enough to injure livestock and puncture a car tire. And they grow so gnarly and twisted, the wood is virtually useless for anything other than imparting a bold smokiness to meat – a signature of Texas barbecue. But that soon may change with two new, improved varieties developed by California-based Altman Plants. These experimental trees grow erect, spineless and fast, while still being able to survive and thrive in the harsh, semi-arid climate of South Texas. Altman Plants recently shipped about 150 of its two experimental hybrids – dubbed Mojave and Sonoran – from California to the San Antonio nursery where they’ll be propagated. Specimens should be available for purchase within a year.\n\nUtah\n\nAmerican Fork: A VW bus painted like a black chalkboard is inspiring creative drawings and bringing people together in this city. No matter where he parks the “chalkbus,” owner Jonathan Sherman says he comes back to find great new art adorning the sides. The Daily Herald reports that the story behind the bus inspired a documentary by college students at Utah Valley University. Sherman also lets bands cram into the bus to play music while he drives around town. Sherman, a licensed marriage and family therapist, says the bus seems to provide something people are missing by connecting them. He takes it each year to the Out of Darkness Suicide Prevention Walk in Salt Lake City and lets people draw on it there.\n\nVermont\n\nBennington: A private boarding school in New Hampshire has made a bid to buy a closed Vermont college. The Bennington Banner reports the head of Oliverian School in Pike, New Hampshire, and the board chairman of the former Southern Vermont College confirm the private school has offered $4.9 million for the 371-acre campus and buildings in Bennington. “We feel that our students and faculty would thrive here,” says Will Laughlin, head of Oliverian School. Southern Vermont College officials said the closure last spring after graduation was due to a decline in enrollment and related debt issues that face other small colleges in the Northeast. According to Oliverian School’s website, it’s an alternative college preparatory boarding school for adolescents who have not thrived in traditional settings.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A Catholic congregation of religious women that serves the elderly is leaving the state after 145 years. It’s the seventh time in six years that the congregation has pulled out across the country because fewer women are joining the order. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports Little Sisters of the Poor has about 30 locations in the U.S. and others in more than 30 countries. Its mission is to serve the elderly in nursing homes around the world. It came to the Richmond region in 1874. The order announced last week that it would be leaving St. Joseph’s Home in Henrico County. The 11 sisters who are leaving don’t yet know yet where they’ll go. But they could be sent to any home in the world that’s run by the religious order.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: State officials are notifying voters of a registration error that could affect about 1,000 people attempting to cast a ballot in the state election scheduled for Tuesday. The Seattle Times reports officials have contacted voters by phone and email after detecting a problem with voter registrations submitted through Washington’s health plan website. The website provides a voter registration option for people enrolling in health or dental coverage and transmits the information to the Secretary of State’s Office. Officials say the Washington Health Benefit Exchange underwent a system upgrade in August that caused some voter registration information to be transmitted to the wrong account in the state system. Officials say the Secretary of State’s Office discovered the registration error last week and fixed the problem by Thursday evening.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A wildlife official says a monthlong series of fall tours to see elk drew visitors from eight other states. Chief Logan State Park naturalist Lauren Cole told the Charleston Gazette-Mail that 227 people went on the sold-out tours in September and October. The elk were at the nearby Tomlin Wildlife Management Area and were imported from Kentucky and Arizona. They’re part of a Division of Natural Resources effort to restore the species to the state. Cole says elk were seen on 19 of the 20 tours. She attributed the one tour where elk weren’t seen to a group of hunters who were pursuing raccoons with dogs. Cole says visitors also saw deer, wild turkeys, rabbits and a black bear. The tours also were offered last year.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The University of Wisconsin-Madison is using rolling robots to deliver food. The school entered into a contact with Starship Technologies this summer to get access to a fleet of 30 robots that resemble coolers on wheels. The robots can navigate sidewalks autonomously, although human controllers can take over at a moment’s notice. Students and faculty can order food from several university restaurants through a Starship app on their phones and watch the robots’ progress as they travel to their address. Users will get an alert when the robot arrives. Each delivery will cost $1.99. That money will go to Starship Technologies. The robots began deliveries Monday on the campus’ north side. University officials hope to expand service campuswide once the robots have mapped the entire area.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Gov. Mark Gordon says he is open to the state pursuing a nuclear waste storage facility, though he doesn’t personally believe it’s the best industry for Wyoming. Gordon told the Wyoming Tribune Eagle’s editorial board last week that if a good reason can be found for such an industry in Wyoming, and it has adequate safeguards, he’s not going to stand in its way. The governor says he will wait to see what the Legislature finds in its studies of the idea before making a decision. This week in Casper, the Joint Minerals, Business and Economic Development Interim Committee will consider a bill authorizing the governor to negotiate with the U.S. Energy Department to store spent nuclear fuel rods within the state.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/shopper-news/2018/05/21/shopper-news-blog-0521-brings-you-latest-happenings-your-community/628411002/", "title": "Shopper-News blog: Land Use committee looks to the future", "text": "Shopper News\n\nWhat's new in your community?

Check back throughout the week.\n\nFARRAGUT\n\nLand Use committee looks to the future\n\nMargie Hagen, Shopper News correspondent\n\nThere is no better way to see an area than by examining it firsthand, and that’s just what the Comprehensive Land Use Committee (CLUP) did in mid-May when they walked about four miles along both sides of Watt Road.\n\nCLUP is a volunteer group composed of interested residents, town staff and elected officials. Community Development Director Mark Shipley and Assistant Director Bart Hose spearhead the committee. About a dozen members meet every four to six weeks to discuss and debate the direction the town will take with zoning and development.\n\nWith available open land in Farragut limited now, the committee looks at how to achieve smart growth for the long term, allowing commercial use while preserving quality of neighborhoods.\n\nResidents have been invited to participate in surveys and public meetings over the past year; a mid-March presentation provided examples of streetscapes, business use including building size and scale, and road design. Results from the group overwhelmingly showed a preference for small commercial use (no big-box stores) that would complement existing and new neighborhoods.\n\nMaking neighborhoods pedestrian and bike friendly with sidewalks and multi-use paths is another priority.\n\nTo that end, a new zoning district was developed and presented by Shipley’s department. “The Neighborhood/Convenience Commercial Zoning District was recommended for approval at the last planning commission meeting. It will go to BOMA in June. This district could help implement some of the land use concepts that were desired based on feedback we reviewed from the public workshop,” he said.\n\nPlanning for the town looks many years ahead; Shipley poses the question, “How would you envision Farragut in the next five, 10 or 20 years?” It’s a good question, as development and rezoning take time. Property owners have to come on board and topographical challenges have to be considered.\n\n“We have also to consider what people want to see in town,” said Alderman Ron Williams. And people want to see continued development of a town center at Kingston Pike and Campbell Station Road.\n\n“It’s underway right now with renovation of the Campbell Station Inn and construction at the new Farragut Gateway (old Silver Spoon location),” Williams said. A Starbucks with a drive-through and large patio will share space with a restaurant and other retail, according to Paul Schaffer, one of the developers of the project.\n\nResidents have been frustrated by the vacant buildings at the old Kroger and Ingles properties, but have to realize that the town can’t compel the owners and lessees to redevelop them. The good news is the town has been in talks with them about plans and both sites may see progress soon.\n\nNORTH\n\nJoshua and Sarah Ivester: pay it forward\n\nCarol Z. Shane, Shopper News correspondent\n\nJoshua and Sarah Ivester live by a philosophy that informs every corner of their work and their lives. “We’ve always just gone after what we love and what’s going to help our relationships and families stay strong,” says Sarah. “And we know if we continue working for the people who care about us, caring for each other and caring for the community, we’ll be fine.”\n\nTogether five years, they’re raising their 3-year-old son, Wyatt, in a home full of creativity, where their livelihoods represent much more than “just work.”\n\nNative Knoxvillian Joshua met art school student Sarah in Savannah, Ga., while he was working for Habitat for Humanity. Their first two years together were spent in Sarah’s home state, Colorado. Looking for a fresh start after Wyatt’s birth, “we saw that Knoxville is growing,” says Sarah, “and we thought it would be a cool thing to be a part of.”\n\nJoshua and his dad, Mike, are licensed electricians; they are A1 Electrical Service. Sarah’s passion was and is coffee; she is the coffee specialist at Wild Love Bakery on Central Avenue. “There’s a work ethic in serving the community this way. Working in coffee I’ve gotten to know a lot of the regulars. I’ve seen their pregnancies and births of babies, engagements, relationships – I’ve also seen tragedy in their lives and then been that person that they first see in the morning. I give them a good cup of coffee and just kind of ‘be that hug’ for people when they need it.” She knows a lot about her product, too. “The Bolivian coffees are just killing it this year.”\n\nMeanwhile, in addition to electrical work, Joshua fell into the business of scouting for and refurbishing furniture from the mid-20th century. He’s now a partner with Mid Mod Collective; his workshop adjoins the retail space.\n\n“You know, mid-century modern is often imitated,” he says. “But with these designers you have real craftsmanship. I don’t take that for granted.” He doesn’t take any shortcuts either, carefully selecting the products and the methods that best serve each piece. “There’s a right way and a wrong way to do this,” he says. “I want these pieces to last another 60 years.” His favorite moments are when a customer “might not even know that I’ve refurbished something, but they spot it and they just light up.”\n\nFollowing one’s passion, supporting each others’ successes and giving back – the Happy Holler business community is rife with this philosophy. “Keep paying it forward,” says Sarah, “and it pays you back.”\n\nMore:Falafel House owner Yassin Terou honored with Knoxville Peace Award\n\nMore:Sierra Hucklebee and Gibbs check region title off the list\n\nGIBBS\n\nGibbs JROTC builds its own challenging course\n\nAli James, Shopper News correspondent\n\n“One of our students, Jordan Bishop, approached me last fall as he needed to earn an Eagle Scout badge,” said First Sgt. Kirk Tower of Gibbs High JROTC Eagle Battalion. “I said I have this wild idea to put in an obstacle course.”\n\nUltimately, Bishop’s Eagle Scout troop and the JROTC members plan to install eight or nine obstacles — some in front of the entrance to the quarter-mile nature trail and others in the woods beyond the outdoor classroom on the Gibbs High campus.\n\nConstruction has been slow. First, the students found it challenging to translate the Army drawings of the various obstacles. “The course was based off regular Army courses,” said Tower. “For safety reasons we followed their design.”\n\nThe students started working with the plans last fall, then submitted them to Knox County Schools for approval. “They had to create a bill of materials and get costings to be approved before they could start,” said Tower.\n\n“We have used volunteer labor, cash and materials donations, so the cost has been minimal,” said Tower. “Everything, the wood, the hardware, has been donated from businesses such as Home Depot, Lowe's and Tindell’s.”\n\nThen since February, the weather has caused many of the workdays to be canceled.\n\n“Four obstacles are in progress,” said Tower. “Two of them are operational.”\n\nThe current obstacles are the “Belly Robber,” where the goal is to work the logs across the wooden frame; followed by the “Six Vaults,” where team members sprint to the obstacle, place their hands on it and throw the legs over. The other two in progress are the “High Step-Over” and the “Hip-Hip.”\n\n“We can eventually add a tire flip; the options are limitless,” said Tower.\n\nOnce they have made it through the four obstacles in phase one, they will take to the trail loop to conquer obstacles, such as an inclining wall, that will be built at a later date.\n\n“We are working with a school videographer to create a safety briefing,” said Tower. “Our goal is to allow other coaches, school, community and youth groups to use the course after they view the safety procedures.”\n\nCurrently, 79 students are enrolled in the JRTOC program and are in various grades. Some are taking Advanced Placement (AP) classes while others are in the Individualized Educational Program (IEP). “One thing that helps is giving these kids structure, but they often need to do something different every so often or they get bored.”\n\nThroughout it all, Tower said the development of leadership skills has really shone through. “The Eagle Scouts and Cadet leaders have guided the volunteers through the building process,” said Tower. “You can see their minds working.”\n\nTower hopes that by building the obstacle course they can attract more students to join the JROTC. “I was trained to always seek to improve things,” he said. “If adding this obstacle course improves our numbers, I’m all for it.”\n\nA ribbon cutting ceremony will be scheduled in the fall. The addition of signs recognizing the Eagle Scouts' work, the start and finish lines are in the works as well.\n\nUNION COUNTY\n\nBEARDEN\n\nArts and barbecue draw smiles at BMS\n\nJohn Shearer, Shopper News correspondent\n\nAs both a teacher and a parent, Mike Weininger has noticed that some special after-school events can be almost as stressful on the parents as on the students in the spotlight.\n\nThat might be due to having to eat supper quickly and rush to get to an event, trying to find a place to sit or park, or having to wait or sit longer than desired.\n\n“I’m restless and I have a hard time going to events after school,” he admitted. “I try to make events I’m involved with as casual and easy as possible. I put the parents first.”\n\nThat was the philosophy he tried to use while helping coordinate Bearden Middle School’s recent “Night of the Arts” event.\n\nAnd by all accounts, it did end up being more fun time than stress time.\n\n“The whole event was good all around,” said Weininger, an art teacher at the school. “People were smiling and were happy.”\n\nFor the first hour during the evening event on May 10, parents and others could casually look at students’ artwork in the Commons area in the middle of the school and enjoy Archer’s catered barbecue, chips and drinks.\n\nThey could also take comfort in the fact that 20 percent of the concession proceeds were going to the Second Harvest food bank, which helps with the backpack program to help feed students in need in Knox County.\n\nAnd while the palates were being satisfied, so were the auditory senses. That was due to some singing, including snippets from the recent musical “Into the Woods Jr.,” and music from some student jazz musicians on the upper mezzanine.\n\nIf the parents and other attendees weren’t relaxed enough by then, the school tried to further help by the second hour with a choral presentation in the auditorium led by musical director Scott Williams.\n\nDespite the casualness of the evening, though, it had been planned with much thought. Weininger said they tried to tie it in with their International Baccalaureate program, including by emphasizing personal and cultural expression.\n\nThis was shown in the use of the song “This Is Me,” from the recent movie “The Greatest Showman,” as well as art displays of face cups from Weininger’s art classes and face jugs from Jessie Winston’s students. Decorative masks were also displayed, and an interactive mural was used.\n\n“We encouraged kids to show us who they are in fun and engaging ways,” Weininger said.\n\nBEARDEN\n\nFARRAGUT\n\nTindal takes on tourism amid fiscal challenges\n\nMargie Hagen, Shopper News correspondent\n\nTourism coordinator Karen Tindal views her job through the lens of a tourist, asking herself, “What would entice me to come to Farragut? Where do I want to shop, dine, play and stay?” Answering those questions is her mission, and also the tag line for the Visit Farragut website she is helping the town develop; it will be launching soon.\n\nBuilding on the program originally envisioned in 2010, Tindal has been on the job since mid-February. Tasked with advancing priorities set by town staff, aldermen and public opinion, she is implementing the messaging and social media programs established prior to her hiring.\n\nA new “Just Visiting” link on the TOF website provides information on town-sponsored events throughout the year: Farragut Book Fest for Children, Bob Watt Fishing Rodeo, Lawn Chair Concert Series, Independence Day Parade, Halloween’s Freaky Friday and Light the Park are all free; bring the family.\n\nThe “New in Town” link is the go-to resource for new residents. A downloadable checklist lists emergency contacts, school information and utility services and more, making it easier to organize relocation details.\n\nOne of Tindal’s main projects now is gathering information promoting local businesses for the Visit Farragut website. Retail, restaurants, hotels and entertainment venues will able to highlight individual aspects of their establishments along with details about town-sponsored events and park activities. Using analytics from the website, she’ll be able to quantify results and determine where traffic comes from.\n\nThe tourism program and Tindal’s position have been a source of heated discussion since last September; Alderman Bob Markli was opposed to both, but was outvoted in prior votes. At issue were the part-time tourism position and the proposed hotel occupancy tax of 2.5 percent, earmarked to fund the program.\n\nThe ordinance to impose the tax failed on May 10 and in all likelihood is tabled until after the Aug. 2 election. The new board could revisit it then. So what does this mean for the tourism program and Tindal’s job?\n\nTown Administrator David Smoak gave this statement: “The tourism program was set to be funded in next year’s budget directly by revenues from the proposed tax.” Now that the money will not be available as expected, funding for the program will be limited and will take more time to implement.\n\nThat doesn’t discourage Tindal; “I’m marketing the town I love,” she said. A longtime resident, Tindal’s three children attended Farragut schools. She’s volunteered and directed many local events, saying, “I wanted to model community involvement for my kids. I didn’t take this commitment lightly. It’s a unique position for a unique town.”\n\nBringing businesses and the town together will mean spearheading a tourism advisory committee involving staff and officials, the Farragut Business Alliance, the Economic Development Committee and a variety of merchants, particularly the hotel owners. “It’s important to look at who the members will be and how we can all contribute,” Tindal said. “I’m looking forward to the challenge.”\n\nGIBBS\n\nTwo Gibbs players sign with colleges\n\nRuth White, Shopper News\n\nGibbs High senior Zach Ellis signed to play baseball at Bluefield College in Bluefield, Va., next season.\n\nHe has been a member of the Eagles baseball team for one season, where he played centerfield and left field. Before coming to Gibbs, he was on the baseball team at Central High.\n\nEllis selected Bluefield College because it was a nice, quiet place where he felt he could get a lot of stuff done. He also liked the coaching staff for the baseball team. While at Bluefield he plans to study education. He wants to become a physical education teacher and a coach in the future.\n\nCoach Geff Davis called Ellis a \"stabilizing force in the outfield\" and commented that he contributed well at the plate for the Eagles. \"Zach does a great job running bases and owns the bat well.\"\n\nAttending the signing with Ellis were his mom, Brandy Ellis, his brothers Nicholas and Austin, his grandparents Ronald and Faye Ellis, friends and teammates.\n\nWill McSwain signed to play baseball at Roane State Community College next season. He liked that RSCC was close to home and feels that it will give him his best opportunity to advance. While in college he plans to study to be a physical therapist.\n\nHe is a utility catcher, infielder and outfielder for the Eagles. Davis said Will \"has had a great run at Gibbs\" and added that he is currently leading the team in hitting and was Offensive Player of the Year in the district this season.\n\nMcSwain said playing for Davis and the Eagles has prepared him to expect to win. He called his teammates a \"good group of guys that are always ready to play\" and said that he loved his time at Gibbs.\n\nAttending the signing with Ellis were his parents, John and Christina McSwain, and his grandfather Samuel Burchfield. His sisters Mary Claire and Morgan Grace were unable to attend, but he was surrounded by his teammates and friends at the event.\n\nFARRAGUT\n\nSOUTH\n\nItch, sting, hurt? Herbalist has healing solutions\n\nHeather Robinson, Shopper News correspondent\n\nIt's summertime and the bugs are biting! But never fear, a local herbalist has remedies for all that ails you this summer!\n\nStay Away Bug Spray will keep the pests away, and a nice glass of A Midsummer Night’s Tea will keep you hydrated with lemongrass and hibiscus.\n\n“It's tart, tasty, cooling, refreshing and high in electrolytes to keep you hydrated!” explains Big Bright Circle Botanicals owner Kat Itz of her summer tea.\n\nItz became interested in living a more balanced and healthy lifestyle after studying to become a Licensed Massage Therapist and yoga teacher. Those practices empowered her to discover as much as she could about her own health and well-being.\n\n“The more I uncovered about holistic health and well-being, the better I felt and the more I wanted to learn,” says Itz.\n\nIn 2012, Itz took a class at the University of Mexico to continue her education and further her knowledge about herbal medicine.\n\n“It was all about medicine-making methods, how to make tinctures and herbal infusions, salves, etc.” says Itz. “I loved how hands-on it was!”\n\nItz has also studied at a Denver herbalist school named Herbalism Roots, where she found herself delving deeper into physiology and body systems. She studied the healing properties of plants and learned more about how they related to human pathologies. There, she also learned how to be an ethical steward of the land while working with plants as medicine.\n\nAfter gaining so much useful knowledge, she launched her own line of products named Big Bright Circle Botanicals. The items she makes are 100 percent handcrafted herbal medicine and plant-based skin care that contain “no scary ingredients you can't pronounce”.\n\n“The name Big Bright Circle alludes to the many circles around us in nature, like the sun and moon, the center of a flower, the iris of an eye, but also the changing of seasons,” says Itz. “Really I could go on forever about circles!”\n\nIn addition to her teas and sprays mentioned previously, Itz offers items like her Skin Saving Salve, which is great for dry skin and scrapes, and her Oxymel products that include turmeric to combat a variety of issues.\n\n“It is excellent for so many diverse complaints, like a muscular strain or joint pain, lousy digestion, a sore throat, or just a pick me up if you're already feeling groovy and want to keep it that way!” says Itz.\n\nHer business takes the concept of being a steward of the land to heart. She works hard to stay in balance and wanted her business to reflect that commitment to the Earth and the role she plays interacting with it.\n\n“If you peel back a layer, though, Big Bright Circle is more than herbal medicine and holistic healing. It is a way for me to support the kind of community I want to be a part of, to share knowledge, give back, and also listen, learn, grow, to honor the many sources of inspiration,” says Itz.\n\nItz came to Knoxville almost two years ago and has found South Knoxville to be a welcoming community that has helped support her efforts of healing and balance through herbalism.\n\n“South Knox has embraced me,” says Itz. “I'm so happy to call it home! One of the main draws for me has always been the kind, supportive and collaborative folks in my community. I felt that especially at Vestival last weekend!”\n\nFor more information regarding services offered by Itz, visit www.bigbrightcircle.com or find Big Bright Circle on Facebook for regular updates.\n\nMore:Moonshine cookies 'flying out the door' of Knoxville business\n\nKARNS\n\nHALLS\n\nA game-changing fun run at Sterchi Elementary\n\nAli James, Shopper News correspondent\n\nSterchi Elementary school’s PTA decided to put a little twist on the usual fun run last year. When it was the fourth- and fifth-graders’ turn, they added color stations and a dance party at the end. It proved to be so popular that it has become one of the most eagerly anticipated school events for both students and teachers.\n\n“It is our second year,” said principal Lynn White. “The fourth- and fifth-graders really look forward to it. We kick it off with a pep rally on May 2. Then there are daily reminders to make pledges per lap.”\n\nBoosterthon Fun Run takes care of all of the details. The national fundraising program is used at more than 1,600 schools across the country and promotes fitness, leadership and character.\n\n“Every day there’s a character trait,” said Leslie Marmorstein, PTA president. “After the pep rally, they show documentary-style videos teaching students how to develop positive attributes. They talk about character traits, such as, trustworthiness, self-awareness, creativity, focus and it ends with a life learner.” As part of the interactive character program, the traits tie into the \"Castle Quest\" story about a character who will inherit a castle if he or she passes each character test.\n\nThere are three levels of Boosterthon events. Sterchi chose to have the Boosterthon team visit for the pep rally and set up and supervise the entire color run.\n\nAfter just nine days of fundraising, the booster culminated in a day of fun runs on the school field. Classes assembled in their homerooms before running through an inflatable tunnel. Once on the field, the organizers played the national anthem, talked about good character traits and got the crowd excited.\n\nTo start, the organizers led a pacer lap behind a checkered flag. Then as the students completed each lap, they passed through a group of volunteers, who added a check mark to the back of their race T-shirt.\n\nEvery few minutes there was an airhorn sound signaling the time to run past one of the four color stations. That was when teachers and volunteers threw colored powder over their white T-shirts.\n\nEvery student gets to participate in the fun, regardless of financial participation. Throughout the 30-minute run, students can skip, dance, walk and run to upbeat themed music. After the laps were completed, the dance party got started with a big cloud of colored powders covering the kids and adults alike.\n\n“It’s really a positive group of kids,” said Marmorstein. “This is my favorite event. It promotes leadership, fun, fitness and, of course, character.” With parent participation on the decline, contracting a full-service fundraising program made sense for the PTA. Families can gather pledges from people they know, students run the laps around the track that Boosterthon sets up and sponsors can easily pay their pledge online or by check.\n\nThis year’s fun run raised $7,000 for Sterchi Elementary School. Proceeds are earmarked to assist with both technology needs or to purchase items for the playground. If they meet their fundraising goal, the PTA also hopes to contribute to the Accelerated Reader program.\n\nGIBBS\n\nGibbs High Eagles of the Month for April\n\nRuth White, Shopper News\n\nGibbs High School recently announced the students selected as April Eagles of the Month.\n\nSelections are made by staff members and are awarded for good grades, participation in the classroom and positive attitude. On occasion, the honor is given to a student who may have fallen on rough times but chose to work hard and make improvements in grades and attitude.\n\nRepresenting the senior class are Casey Atkins and Mason Robinson. Casey has been called \"a wonderful addition to any classroom\" and recognized for her hard work, helpfulness and sweet personality. Mason is known for being willing to help when needed with a smile on his face and positive attitude, regardless of the difficulty of the task.\n\nJunior class representatives are Zachary Bowlin and Randi Brown. Zachary is recognized for being prepared for class and going above and beyond as a student. Randi has been called a hard worker, always having her work done early and a joy to have in class.\n\nSelected from the sophomore class are Troy Davis and Sara Salmons. One of Troy's teachers said he is \"the kind of person whose positive attitude permeates through everything he does\" and said that Troy is a role model for other students. Sara is known for being prepared for class and having her work complete on time. She asks great questions in class and makes a wonderful addition to the classroom.\n\nNinth-grade students selected are Jaklyn Rutter and Zachary Sprague. Jaklyn is a creative student who always strives to do her best and is very conscious about making sure expectations from her teachers are met. One of Zachary's teachers said it simply, \"Zachary works hard every day in class.\"\n\nMore:From the runway: Spring and summer fashions benefit special needs program\n\nKNOXVILLE\n\nWUOT's Garrett McQueen is tapped by American Public Media\n\nCarol Z. Shane, Shopper News correspondent\n\nWe can say “we knew him when.”\n\nFans of WUOT-FM 91.9 have long known what a gifted announcer Garrett McQueen is. As host of The Afternoon Program, McQueen has shared musical insights from his own world as a professional bassoonist, and has introduced listeners to a variety of music by regional orchestras, people of color, women, and other composers and performers who aren’t heard very often in the classical music realm. And now he’s on his way to Saint Paul, Minn., as a hand-picked member of American Public Media (APM.)\n\nMcQueen didn’t set out to be a radio announcer. The Memphis native came to Knoxville in 2013 when he won the position of second bassoon in the Knoxville Symphony Orchestra. He says he’s loved his time here, and credits Knoxville and Knoxvillians with much of his developmental success as a musician and a person. But early on he was met with a less-than-welcoming sight: scores of Confederate flags at his very first outing with the orchestra, a Veterans Day Concert. “I didn’t even know that was a thing,” he says. That memory, coupled with a few unpleasant incidents in which he was harassed, informed his future programming at WUOT, and his subsequent rise in the public media world.\n\nA year and a half ago, he answered an ad for a sub at WUOT; soon, he was a regular. He says, “I felt it was important to expose my listeners, as much as possible, to ideas that weren’t being explored. One of the big things for me was the relationship between race and classical music.\n\n“You know, I don’t expect people to constantly think about the fact that I’m the only black musician in the KSO, but it’s something I think about. I think it’s important to show equity toward composers and genres of music that aren’t represented. I also love talking about the music of the 17th, 18th, 19th centuries – music that doesn’t necessarily have to do with race. But when I look at myself as a whole person I can’t not acknowledge those issues.”\n\nMcQueen’s programming and presence got him noticed.\n\nTodd Steed of WUOT submitted him for consideration as “a black talent in public media that you may not know, but should” to Current, a public media industry publication, and McQueen’s focus on inclusivity got him invitations to speak at the Sphinx Conference in Detroit and the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. When he was invited to play with the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra last November, representatives from APM reached out.\n\nHe’ll be leaving in June to join them as host of the nationally syndicated public radio service “Classical 24.”\n\nHe’s already guest-hosted “Performance Today” for APM. He chose “music from the South” as his focus and featured the KSO in the nationally aired program. “A big thanks to Visit Knoxville for footing the bill to make that happen!” he says.\n\n“You know, when we talk about music, civil rights, women’s rights – anything – we’re so great at lauding long-dead people. And we forget that things are going on right now. Music is being written right now. And we need to pay attention to that. I’m proud to have brought that to WUOT.”\n\nMore:Shopper News photos of the week\n\nMore:See inside: $2.3 million former home of Gov.

It took us four months to make phone calls and follow up with people to gather all the items. There are 238 items and I don’t even know how much money is out there ... a lot.\n\n“There are a number of wonderful and unusual things to bid on including a golf outing with Father Michael, several trips, and a live bee hive which already has several bids.”\n\nItems not receiving a bid are donated to a number of charities including Catholic Charities of Knoxville, which helps individuals and families in need.\n\nThe Mount LeConte Jug Band from Spring City provided toe taping music.

The old fort had its historical foundations in the late 1700s as a wooden stockade designed to help repel active pirates in the area. By the beginning of the 1800s, it had been converted to the permanent brick and stone structure that stands today.\n\nAt some level it is like a lot of island forts that dot the old British Empire. For my young son and daughter, it was grand place to play and imagine pirates of another era. Its parade grounds now play home to a huge swing set where my children loved to soar in the wind.\n\nWhat fascinated me was not the structure, but its name.\n\nThe fort was named for Gen. Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis. The name might not strike you at first, but think back on your American history. This fort was named for the same Gen. Cornwallis who surrendered to George Washington at Yorktown.\n\nIt was hard for me to believe that they would name a fort for a failed general, so I did some additional research. I discovered that Gen. Cornwallis had a marvelous military career prior to the American Revolution. That was why he was assigned the task to deal with the uprising. After his surrender to Washington he returned to England, but remained well regarded. In 1786 he was appointed Governor of India. He later served as Viceroy of Ireland. When you look back over the whole of his life, his defeat to the colonist was a small part of a distinguished career. That moment did not define his story.\n\nIn the Gospel, Peter found himself consumed by shame. Jesus had told Peter that he would deny him three times before the cock crowed on that night of pain. Peter protested, but now, as the cock crowed he had done it. He had denied Jesus and it seemed that there was no way to undo it.\n\nJohn 21 invites us to the seaside some days later. The disciples were back in their boats but had caught nothing. In a scene reminiscent of an early encounter with Jesus, the disciples heard a familiar voice telling them to cast their nets off the other side of the boat. When they came to shore, they shared a breakfast with Jesus. Then, Jesus did the unthinkable. In three questions, he restored Peter. Peter had been faithful before the denials and would now again lead the disciples. The denials would not define his story.\n\nSometimes it can seem like pain or sorrow or struggle will overcome us and define us for the rest of our lives. Grace is bigger than a moment, and our God is bigger than our failures. This moment or your current struggles do not have to define you. Through faith and grace, there can be more to your story.\n\nTom Ogburn is senior pastor at First Baptist Church in downtown Knoxville.

Gold Medal math facts.\n\nRuth White, Shopper News\n\nThird-grade students at Mooreland Heights Elementary have spent this school year learning 0-12 multiplication facts (at a rate of 25 per minute) and they gathered May 11 at Charter Doyle Park to show off what they knew and to compete for the gold medal in the Gold Medal Math competition.\n\nThe park was set up to resemble an Olympic-style course, complete with torch and five colored rings hanging behind the winners podium. Students competed in events for which they qualified and had to master the math facts the quickest to win points. Games such as \"Dressed to the Nines\" and \"Doughnut Dash\" made the event a fun competition with students racing to the finish line feeling successful. The end game – where students had to remember random facts – proved to be tough, but each team covered their game board (45 squares) with the team's representative colored squares.\n\nThe results: Gold medal went to Team Resourceful; silver medal was awarded to Team Tenacious; the bronze medal went to Team Amicable and fourth-place honors were given to Team Steadfast.

The walk is at the front of the school and featured personalized bricks from Gibbs alumni and community members.\n\nA classroom set of (30) Chromebooks and a charging station were purchased for use by students in the library or may be checked out as a whole set by a teacher. Several of the feeder schools to Gibbs High (Holston Middle and Corryton Elementary) are technology schools, and the foundation thought it important to have the high school they feed into also have technology available for the classroom.\n\nFairview Baptist Church donated over $26,000 for lighting improvements and other needed items in the school auditorium. Guests visiting the auditorium will notice two recently installed large-screen televisions on the sides of the stage.\n\nBoard member Don Ogle and A.C.E. Electric donated and installed outdoor lighting at the school entrance to enhance safety during evening events. Donations from the community through the foundation's barbecue luncheon, County Commissioner Dave Wright and board member Gary Acuff allow the foundation to give back to the school when needs arise. Acuff's mother, Mabel Acuff, was a longtime teacher and guidance counselor at the school.\n\nIn addition to the enhancements, the foundation was able to donate to the choral department trip to New York, where they performed at Carnegie Hall; established three $500 teacher grants for next year; and provided teacher appreciation and student recognition activities during the year.\n\nThe foundation is working toward purchasing additional computers for the students to use; updating the library furniture; purchasing needed media center equipment such as computers and cameras; supplying equipment and desktops for the robotics class and upgrading auditorium seating.\n\nAnyone interested in supporting Gibbs High through the foundation may visit the website www.gibbshighfoundation.org; visit Facebook @ GibbsHighFoundation or email gibbshighfoundation@gmail.com.\n\nNORTH\n\nHALLS/POWELL\n\nBrickey’s Robbie Norman will miss the daily joys\n\nAli James, Shopper News correspondent\n\nIt is 7:15 a.m. and excitement fills the Brickey-McCloud Elementary hallways. It is field day for kindergarten and first grade, while the fourth-graders are headed to a Smokies baseball game. Principal Robbie Norman is at the epicenter, and has been for 14 years – greeting students, listening to stories and \"wrapping my arms around my students and staff.\"\n\nNorman pauses to sing “take me out to the ballgame” with a student, fixes a backpack zipper, listens to bug facts from a first-grader and “giggles for no real reason” with a fourth-grader. All while dispensing hugs.\n\n“I came from Mooreland Heights Elementary, where we had 350 students, to Brickey, where there were 900,” said Norman. “I needed to wrap my arms around them still. I can see them every morning, and it is a way to be visible to all my students. I can look at their faces and see if something is not quite right or if they are excited.”\n\nNext up are school announcements, and Norman heads to the media center. A fifth-grade team films and broadcasts the daily updates to every classroom. “This way every student feels like they get to see me every day,” she said.\n\nAfter graduating from Carter High and the University of Tennessee, Norman taught first-grade at Carter Elementary. “I definitely felt drawn to this calling: 'Delight yourself in the Lord, and he will give you the desires of your heart,' said Norman. “I loved being a first-grade teacher and felt it would be all that I would do.”\n\nNorman taught for 20 years and earned her master's in administration and supervision.\n\n“The passion for becoming a principal just grew, but I was not quite ready,” she said. “I applied to be a curriculum coach.” Working at five schools in three years, Norman was able to watch five principals at work and see the things she did and didn’t want to add to her principalship.\n\nNorman decided she was ready to “make a difference in the lives of a whole school full of children.\" She accepted the position of principal at Mooreland Heights. In Norman’s fifth year at the school, she was recognized as Principal of the Year. “It was a highlight; the staff and I had worked so hard to have the highest gains that year in Knox County,” she said.\n\nFifteen years ago, the new Brickey Elementary building was built, with input from former principal Susan Turner. “She made the decisions and enjoyed it for a year before she turned it over to me,” said Norman. “We know what a gift we have with the whole school on one level and the different wings; it’s three acres under one roof.”\n\nNorman is set to officially retire on June 29, after she helps transition the new principal (who has not yet been named).\n\n“It’s a huge decision, this is 42 years and I wasn’t sure how I could stop, because I love what I do,” said Norman. “For the last three years I thought about it, but never felt completely at peace; I still felt so excited about coming to school. Everything came together in my heart and mind when I finally made my decision, I was at peace. Once again I am following my heart and that says it’s time.”\n\nMore:4 West Knoxville parks you can't miss this summer\n\nPOWELL\n\nKARNS\n\nGirl Scouts build robots, go for STEM badges\n\nNancy Anderson, Shopper News correspondent\n\nGirl Scouts aren’t just about the cookies. The organization recently rolled out 23 new badges for science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) related subjects including Earth science, Leap Bot engineering, and robotics.\n\nThis fall another series, or Journey, will roll out. “It’s Your Planet – Love It!\" The girls will explore the natural world by learning about the water cycle, completing energy audits, assessing air quality, calculating their \"food print,” and figuring out how much trash is created and how to reduce it.\n\nFor now, the girls of Beaver Ridge Troop 22045 are working on their Robotics Journey. They gathered at the Karns Youth Center to build a tin can robot with movable arms and googly eyes Monday, May 14.\n\nThey had to assemble the robot, wire it and insert the motor so that it could move. While the girls had plenty of can do attitude, no one finished the robot in one meeting. It typically takes three to five meetings to complete a badge. A Journey contains several badges.\n\n“We let them take as long as they need and they do everything on their own. We’re here to help, but we don’t take over. It’s trial and error for them. That’s the way they learn and they’ll be happy with themselves in the end,” said troop co-leader Jennifer Contreras.\n\nTo get all the badges in the Robot Journey the girls learn what robots are, how robots move, build a robot, design a robot, and showcase robots where they teach others what they learned in order to instill leadership.\n\nAfter learning what a robot is, the girls visited the Apple store to learn how to make a robot move using a simple program.\n\nEach level of Girl Scouts, from Daisies to Juniors to Ambassadors, takes a Journey working age-appropriate projects.\n\nIn Troop 22045, a multilevel troop, while the Brownies were assembling a tin can robot, the Daisies were learning about circuit boards. The Juniors recently learned how to assemble an EV-2 robot, which is more advanced than the tin can robot.\n\n“The girls really love going after the STEM badges, they learn that they can do anything the boys can do,\" said Contreras. \"They aren’t the easiest badges in the world to earn; there are some struggles. The girl learn that they can do anything they set their minds to, even if it’s a male-dominated field. They can go into the field their Dad is working in.\n\n“I think there are far more males in STEM related fields than females. Earning the STEM badges gives them a leg up and a step forward into gaining an interest in STEM fields and it happens at a very young age. They get exposure to STEM fields they might otherwise never be exposed to, or at least not at this young and impressionable age.\n\n“Girl Scouts are almost twice as likely as non-Girl Scouts to participate in STEM fields.\n\n“We had a Brownie, a second-grader, have an 'aha' moment when she learned that she could be a computer programmer just like her dad. She learned she can do anything a boy can do, and she’s farther ahead on building the tin can robot than anyone else.\n\nTroop 22045 meets every other Monday and every other Thursday at the Karns Youth Center.\n\nInfo: email Jennifer Contreras at abbysmom5@yahoo.com\n\n'Wilder Day' at A.L. Lotts: a unique look back\n\nJohn Shearer, Shopper News correspondent\n\nWhen Kathy Alexander was young, she was at her great-grandmother’s Knoxville home and was reading the Laura Ingalls Wilder book “Little House in the Big Woods” with much interest.\n\nBut then her great-grandmother, Merle Lloyd, added a realistic twist to the autobiographical children’s novel – she had also grown up as a pioneer in Wisconsin and had some experiences similar to Wilder's.\n\n“I thought that was the coolest thing,” Alexander recalled. “She took an interest in what I was reading and said, ‘This is real.’ ”\n\nAs a schoolteacher, Alexander has tried to add some real experiences as well to inspire her students and enhance their learning. What has resulted has been a quarter-century of Laura Ingalls Wilder Day programs at A.L. Lotts Elementary.\n\nFor her, this unique tradition for the fourth-graders at the Westland Drive school has never become burdensome, despite all the work involved.\n\n“I live for this day, and the children enjoy it,” she said while taking a brief break during this year’s special day on May 11. “I meet people in the grocery stores who were in this 20 years ago, and they say something like, ‘I was Nellie in the play.’ This is a rite of passage for fourth-graders here.”\n\nDespite all the fun had once again at this year’s special day – complete with dances and games, a play, old-fashioned craft demonstrations, a wagon ride and a family picnic – it was also likely a little melancholy for Alexander.\n\nThe reason is that she is retiring at the end of the school year, and this was her last year to coordinate the day as a full-time faculty member. However, she hopes the school keeps the tradition going and she will be glad to help as a retired volunteer, especially because her granddaughter attends the school.\n\n“Many parents and their children have approached me about the continuation of this special day in years to come,” she said. “It has yet to be decided as to what form that may take. I am certainly willing to help after I retire, as long as the students read the Laura Ingalls Wilder books.”\n\nWhile its future is uncertain, the past was an obvious part of the special day that Friday. Students and teachers were dressed in 19th century pioneer clothing and enthusiastically took part or watched the various activities inspired by Wilder’s books based on her childhood experiences.\n\nA highlight was a somewhat surprise appearance via Skype by Alison Arngrim, who played Laura’s friend, Nellie Oleson, in the 1970s and '80s NBC TV series “Little House on the Prairie.”\n\nAlexander said the youngsters had written out questions, but they did not know until that day that she would appear remotely from Philadelphia, where she was appearing at a comedy show.\n\n“She answered questions, like how it was to play somebody mean when you are not mean, and did she and Laura get along in real life,” Alexander said. They also wanted to know if a needle was really stuck in her foot in the episode titled “Bunny,” when she becomes paralyzed, she added.\n\nGoing that extra step to bring the past even more to life through the special programs is certainly not new to Alexander. In 1986, when she had her first Laura Ingalls Wilder Day while teaching at Sequoyah Elementary, actress Melissa Gilbert, who played Laura Ingalls in the TV series, made a special appearance in person.\n\n“She came that day and answered questions,” Alexander recalled. “She was gracious and wonderful and talked to children on their level.”\n\nAlexander continued to have some sort of special day or event to help the students, including in a modified form at PTA meetings when she was at Sarah Moore Greene Elementary from 1991-93.\n\nWhen A.L. Lotts opened near Pellissippi Parkway in 1993 and she began teaching there, the event really took off.\n\n“It goes with the curriculum,” she added in explaining a big reason why she coordinates the program every year. “We study pioneer life, and I want something real for my children with family values.”\n\nWhile the offerings have changed over the years, including going from having a covered-dish picnic to students bringing their own food or purchasing a pioneer-style meal in the cafeteria, the fun enjoyed by the students has not changed.\n\nFor example, fourth-graders Bryce Coulter, Natalie Newman and Landry McMurray were wearing big smiles along with their 19th century-style clothing.\n\nBryce said he enjoyed the dances, enthusiastically adding, “It was probably the best thing I ever experienced in my life. It was really fun.”\n\nNatalie said she enjoyed the play and portraying Laura Ingalls, while Landry liked the play and finally getting to take part as a fourth-grader. “They only do it in the fourth grade, and it is a really big thing for me,” she said.\n\nIt has been a pretty big event for Alexander, too.\n\n“I love this day because it brings to life what the students have studied about in social studies class,” she said. “The stories are real. Any time you can encourage children to do hands-on activities, sing songs, get up and move, or act something out, it makes what they have read become a part of them.”\n\nMore:Victor Ashe: Madeline Rogero fills airport post; police chief pick likely next\n\nBEARDEN\n\nOPINION\n\nContouring the body, bending the mind\n\nLeslie Snow, Shopper News columnist\n\nOn the day I learned that Jada Pinkett Smith’s 64-year-old mother has chiseled abs and a rockin’ bikini bod, I bought my first pair of Spanx. The irony hit me like a ton of bar-bells. I thought about Jada’s mom while I was driving to West Town Mall to purchase my new undergarment.\n\nI wondered what her life was like. Does she work out six hours a day? Does she live on chia seeds and iceberg lettuce? Does she stare at her naked body in awe or is her inner voice cruel and judgmental despite those impressive abs. Mostly I wondered if she was happy.\n\nStill deep in thought, I browsed the racks of intimate apparel until I found a 20-something saleslady willing to talk me through the endless iterations of Spanx.\n\nIn case you don’t know the term, Spanx is a modern-day girdle designed by a woman for women. (Should we say thank you?) In the continuum of female undergarments, first come corsets, then girdles, and then Spanx. If you Google corsets, and I did, you might be surprised to discover they originated in Italy and were introduced to the French court in the 1500s. They spread in popularity and were a big hit during the Victorian era when a minuscule waist was all the rage.\n\nThat means that for over 500 years, women have been binding themselves to perpetuate a fantasy of what women should look like. And there I was, at the mall, becoming one of those women by squeezing into what is essentially a Spandex sock.\n\nWhen I mentioned the tight fit to the saleslady, she chuckled softly. “If it’s comfortable,” she said, “it’s probably not doing its job.” Well I can tell you, my Spanx was doing a great job. Talk about an overachiever.\n\nClad in my Spanx, I stared at my body in the mirror and thought of Jada Pinkett Smith’s mom and her rockin’ bikini bod. And I realized, it’s either Spanx or sit-ups. So, I grabbed the Spanx and headed for the checkout counter.\n\nThe sales lady and I shared a moment. I mentioned that the Spanx was about the same price as the dress I just bought, and she laughed. Then she said something amusing like “At least it will always be in style.” I chuckled, heartily. But I wanted to have a deep conversation about corsets and body image and the role of women in society. “Can you be a feminist,” I asked her, “and still wear Spanx?” “Get over yourself,” she said with a wry smile. “Everyone you know wears them.”\n\nI wondered about that as I handed her my credit card. And I wondered about it again as I was walking out of the department store. I was so deep in thought that I almost didn’t hear the saleslady call out to me. “Ma'am! Ma'am!” she yelled. “Come back!”\n\nI turned to face her. I thought she wanted to continue our conversation about gender roles and the objectification of women. I thought she might tell me I was right to question my Spanx purchase.\n\nBut what she said was, “Your dress is tucked into your underwear.” I reached back and confirmed her assessment. “Why, yes, it is!” I said in surprise. And I laughed all the way to my car.\n\nSpanx or no Spanx, I am what I am. I am a 54-year-old woman walking through the mall with her dress tucked into her underwear. That’s who I am. I am gloriously imperfect. And I think I’m OK with that.\n\nLeslie Snow may be reached at snowcolumn@aol.com.\n\nMore:Catch up on last week's blog!", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/05/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/04/27/corrections-clarifications-2018/3031460001/", "title": "Corrections & Clarifications 2018", "text": "USA TODAY\n\nWe recognize that mistakes may happen – or that new information can emerge after a story is published – and we pledge to address all concerns quickly, fairly and transparently.

Rep. Wes Allen of Troy and Sen. Shay Shelnutt of Trussville are the sponsors of the Vulnerable Child Compassion and Protection Act. Allen said last week that children who struggle with their gender identity should receive mental health counseling and not medications or surgeries that cause physical changes. The Alabama House Health Committee approved Allen’s bill Wednesday morning, news outlets reported. Later, the Senate Health Committee approved Shelnutt’s bill in a 10-1 vote. Both bills will move on to the full House and Senate for consideration, respectively. Under the legislation, doctors would be charged with a felony for prescribing puberty-blockers or hormones to anyone under age 19. Surgeries on minors would also be prohibited. The bill also states teachers, principals and school counselors would be charged with a misdemeanor if they don’t tell parents their child identifies as transgender. This is the second bill in Alabama targeting transgender issues. Rep. Chris Pringle, R-Mobile, is sponsoring a bill that would prohibit public schools from allowing transgender students to participate on sports team that do not match the gender on their birth certificates.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The state approved a regulation change establishing a personal-use salmon dipnet fishery on a portion of the Susitna River. The Alaska Board of Fisheries voted last week to create the fishery that will be available from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. on Wednesdays and Saturdays between July 10 and July 31, The Anchorage Daily News reported. The Susitna system empties into Cook Inlet and is home to all five species of Pacific salmon. Dipnetters will be able to harvest up to 25 salmon in the new fishery in Southcentral Alaska, though chinook salmon will be off limits. Several groups backed the new fishery, including the Matanuska Valley Fish and Game Advisory Committee and the South Central Alaska Dipnetters Association, which both submitted proposals to the board. Personal-use fisheries are only open to Alaska residents and allow permit holders to harvest up to 25 salmon per head of household each year, with an additional 10 salmon for each additional family member. Personal-use salmon fisheries exist in Cook Inlet on the Kenai River, Kasilof River on the Kenai Peninsula and Fish Creek. There is also a personal-use fishery at the Copper River, which empties into Prince William Sound southeast of Anchorage. The proposal submitted by the Matanuska Valley committee said the new fishery would give area residents an opportunity to harvest salmon closer to home.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:Early risers in several Western states reported seeing what appeared to be a meteor streaking across the sky before dawn. The American Meteor Society received multiple reports from Arizona, California, New Mexico and Utah about the fireball. “This does appear to be a bright meteor as observations are spread out from Southern California, southern Utah, and Arizona,” observer Robert Lunsford with the American Meteor Society told KNXV-TV. The phenomenon was captured on video by meteorite hunter Robert Ward in Prescott, Arizona, and posted on the organization’s website. It was also captured by a video camera mounted on Phoenix City Hall. “This is the best time of the month to view meteor activity as the moon will not be a factor at all,” the American Meteor Society said in their Meteor Activity Outlook for the week, noting the moon’s current phase.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: State regulators have dismissed one violation and sustained two others against a medical marijuana dispensary in Hot Springs. The Arkansas Alcoholic Beverage Control Board voted Wednesday to sustain two violations against Green Springs Medical dispensary. The Hot Springs dispensary is the state’s most successful since opening May 1, selling more than 1400 pounds of medical marijuana as of Feb. 14, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported. The next closest dispensary, the Releaf Center in Bentonville, sold just more than 670 pounds in the same time period. Green Springs Medical had been charged with a series of rule violations, including inadequate labeling and improper signs. The board also decided Wednesday to reduce the facility’s fine from $7,025 to $1,000, noting that the dispensary’s owner has been cooperative with investigators and put in an effort to comply with regulations.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco:A winter with little precipitation has left most of California abnormally dry and officials are bracing for the possibility of an early and more intense wildfire season amid record-breaking temperatures. Drought has expanded to nearly a quarter of the state, mainly in central California, the heart of the state’s agricultural sector, according to a U.S. Drought Monitor map mad public Thursday. The map shows 70% of the state is abnormally dry. February is shaping up to be driest on record for much of the state, with chances of light showers on the horizon on March 1 and then not again until March 10. Sierra Littlefield, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Sacramento, said there is a strong chance the state’s capital will see a completely dry February – something that has never happened. Downtown San Francisco is on its way to its first rain-free February since 1864, said meteorologist Anna Schneider. The dry beginning of the year comes after a wet 2019 that capped mountains with snow, delivering water to reservoirs and helping to boost lush vegetation that can quickly turn into fuel for wildfires during dry, windy conditions. About 75% of California’s annual precipitation typically occurs from December through February, mostly from atmospheric rivers – long plumes of moisture originating far out in the Pacific Ocean. State officials were scheduled Thursday to conduct a survey of the Sierra Nevada snowpack, which supplies about 30% of California’s water. The first reading of the winter there, on Jan. 2, found a snowpack that was 97% of the January average. But that had changed by the end of a largely dry January when the amount of water in the snowpack dropped to 72% of the Jan. 30 average, state water officials said.\n\nColorado\n\nVail: An avalanche took the lives of two people who had turned back to avoid a dangerous area, a report said. The Feb. 15 avalanche north of Vail killed Dillon Block and Cesar Almanza Hernandez, The Vail Daily reported Tuesday. Block, Hernandez and a companion who was not identified were riding in the back country on low-angle slopes and in meadows and were avoiding steeper slopes, the Colorado Avalanche Information Center report said. They were operating snowbikes, which are off-road motorcycles modified for use in the snow. After riding into a creek bottom in the afternoon, the riders entered an open area and turned around to head back. An avalanche started and the third rider was able to ride into nearby trees, but Hernandez and Block were buried in the slide, the report said. Volunteers worked to free Block and Hernandez until responders with Vail Mountain Rescue Group arrived at the scene around 9 p.m. “Given the time elapsed, darkness, increasing snowfall, and no easy way to evaluate the avalanche danger above the site, the group left and returned to the Red Sandstone trailhead,” the report said. A Vail Mountain Rescue Group team returned the next morning to recover the bodies.\n\nConnecticut\n\nStamford: A man who got into a fight while leaving his son’s hockey game last month has asked for leniency. Matthey Zolin, 51, made a brief appearance before a judge at a Stamford courthouse where his attorney applied to a diversionary program for first-time offenders that will result in his charges being expunged, the Greenwich Time reported Wednesday. The Greenwich resident was arrested on Jan. 31, along with another father, after the two began fighting while exiting a game where their sons played against each other. Both men were charged with misdemeanor third-degree assault and interfering with police. Officials said the altercation became physical after one of the two said something denigrating about the abilities of the other’s son. Prosecutors have made no objection to Zolin’s application to enter the diversionary program. If he is granted acceptance and successfully completes the program, the charges against him will be expunged and his criminal record will remain clean.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover:Two more wells near a military base have elevated levels of chemical contaminants, according to state environmental officials. Delaware’s environmental protection department was recently notified by officials at Dover Air Force Base that the wells near the base might have levels of perfluorooctane sulfonate, or PFOS, and perfluorooctanoic acid, or PFOA, above federal advisory levels of 70 parts per trillion. The notifications come after high levels of PFOS and PFOA were found in four other wells near the base last summer. One of those wells had a PFOS level of 168,000 parts per trillion and a PFOA level of 2,460 parts per trillion, according to a document provided to The Associated Press. The Air Force is continuing to provide alternative water supply to those properties. The owners of the more recently tested wells, which provide water to a single commercial business, also are being provided bottled water. Officials said Tuesday that samples taken at 10 other wells indicated PFOS and PFOA levels below the EPA’s health advisory level. PFOA and PFOS are among a class of man-made compounds known as perfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS. The compounds have been used in a variety of consumer and industrial products, including nonstick cookware, stain- and water-resistant fabrics, food packaging and, notably, firefighting foam that has been used at military bases across the country.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:A landlord facing ongoing lawsuits with the district’s attorney general has been arrested for failing to pay for repairs, according to court documents. The documents said Mehrdad Valibeigi with the Bennington Corporation has been charged with contempt of court and is being held in the D.C. jail after Valibeigi failed to make a payment required by the judge’s order. A spokesperson for Attorney General Karl Racine said his office first filed a complaint against Valibeigi in October 2018 for allegedly collecting rent, but failing to maintain his apartment buildings and make necessary repairs. The AG requested a Receiver for the 35 units that comprise the Bennington Apartments, located at 4480 C Street, 4459 Benning Road SE and 4569 Benning Road SE in Ward 7. Court documents showed Racine also asked for restitution for those tenants, as well as penalties for the owner. Tenants quoted in the initial complaint said nails were coming out of their ceilings, roaches had consistently been a problem for decades and mice found their way into apartments through multiple holes in the walls and sinks. Documents state Valibeigi was supposed to deposit $25,000 into an account for the Receiver to fund repairs by November. He paid $5,000, but still has not paid the rest, according to the documents. The judge said in the most recent January hearing that if Valibeigi did not fulfill the court’s order to pay the remaining $20,000 by Feb. 24, he would be arrested. Racine’s office said Valibeigi failed to comply and was taken into custody on Monday, where documents stated he will be held until he has paid the outstanding amount. Court documents showed that a status hearing is scheduled for Feb. 28.\n\nFlorida\n\nKey West: The government of the United Arab Emirates has granted a $3.5 million gift to help kick off a major coral reef restoration program in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. The grant, announced Wednesday by officials of United Way of Collier and the Keys, is the first funding commitment of the $100 million Mission: Iconic Reefs program announced last December by The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and its Keys sanctuary. The program, to be funded by public and private resources, calls for restoring seven iconic coral reef sites off the Keys consisting of nearly 3 million square feet of the Florida Reef Tract, about the size of 52 football fields. The effort is likely to take two decades and is to be accomplished in two phases, Sanctuary officials said. Since the 1970s, tropical cyclones, heat-induced coral bleaching, cold snaps and disease events have reduced coral coverage in the Keys. Over the past 15 years, pioneering restoration efforts involving growing and transplanting corals have proved successful in the Keys, setting the stage for the large-scale restoration effort. Running from Key Largo to Key West, the Sanctuary includes Carysfort Reef, Horseshoe Reef, Cheeca Rocks, Sombrero Reef, Newfound Harbor, Looe Key Reef and Eastern Dry Rocks. The $3.5 million coral restoration gift is part of a $10 million pledge from the UAE to communities in Florida for recovery activities following Hurricane Irma. The United Way helped to secure the UAE financial gift for the Keys coral reef project.\n\nGeorgia\n\nJuliette: Officials in a Monroe County said they will pay to test water wells for coal ash contamination. County Manager Jim Hedges told WGXA-TV that the county will pay $10,000 to test about 55 private wells across the county. The tests come after environmental group Altamaha Riverkeeper tested wells of residents around Juliette and found chemicals they said indicate contamination from the coal ash pond at Georgia Power Co.’s Plant Scherer. Georgia Power, a unit of Atlanta-based Southern Co., said its own testing of wells around the coal-fired power plant showed no contamination above federal or state limits. The company plans to extract water from the coal ash, cap the pond in place and monitor it for future contamination. Juliette residents came to the state Capitol Monday to lobby for a bill that would require Georgia Power to dig up the coal ash and bury it in a lined landfill. Hedges said the results should come back within 7 to 10 days. Residents are also lobbying to be connected to a water system, but county officials said that could cost $20 million and take two years to complete. Beyond the county testing, Duke University Professor Avner Vengosh, who studies coal ash contamination, is scheduled to visit Monroe County to study 10 to 12 private wells within 2 miles of Plant Scherer. The county will pay travel costs for Vengosh and a student.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The U.S. military authorized the transport of World War II aircraft on government ships and planes for use in the 75th anniversary commemoration of the end of the war, officials said. Up to 24 privately owned aircraft will be transported to Oahu for the events between Aug. 29 and Sept. 2, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported Tuesday. The transport of the vintage planes will be conducted by Air Force cargo planes or ships including an aircraft carrier or other flattop vessel, officials said. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said in a Jan. 27 memo that he wants a coordinated effort for a “lift of opportunity” to bring the planes to the commemoration. “As we approach the 75th anniversary of V-J Day (Victory over Japan) on Sept. 2, 2020, I am encouraging all services to seek opportunities to honor this important milestone,” Esper said. Elissa Lines, executive director of the Pearl Harbor Aviation Museum, said 19 aircraft owners have applied to participate. The aircraft include a B-25 Mitchell bomber, A-26 Invader, SBD Dauntless dive bomber, P-40 Warhawk, TBF Avenger torpedo bomber, P-51 Mustang, F4F Wildcat, C-47 transport, PBY Catalina, F-8 Bearcat, and T-6 Texan, she said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Roughly a month after one of Idaho’s newest Fish and Game commissioners had to step down because of his political affiliation, a panel of lawmakers has approved a bill to remove the commission’s bipartisan membership requirements. The commissioners set hunting and fishing regulations, seasons and other wildlife policy. They’re appointed by the governor, and Republicans have held a majority on the commission for years. The remaining spots sometimes go to commissioners who are unaffiliated, rather than Democrats. The bill, which would end the current rule that no more than four members of the seven-member commission be from the same political party, was approved by the House Resources and Conservation Committee on Tuesday, The Times-News reported. Idaho Wildlife Federation executive director Brian Brooks opposed the bill, noting the commission was created by the state’s first voter initiative in 1938, which specifically called for a bipartisan approach to prevent undue political influence on resource issues. He said politicization is one of the biggest concerns for Idaho hunters. It passed 14-4, and now heads to the full House. Former commissioner Bradley Melton was appointed in September but stepped down in January after it was revealed that he had changed his political affiliation from Republican to unaffiliated shortly before he applied for the post. At the time, Gov. Brad Little thanked Melton for his candor and service, and said the next appointment would be made “in accordance with the spirit of the law.” Rep. Paul Shepherd, a Republican from Riggins – the same region that Melton represented on the commission – said Tuesday that the best candidates for the job shouldn’t be disqualified because of their party affiliation. Rep. Fred Wood, who previously served on the commission, said appointments are made based on experience with and views on the environment, and party affiliation doesn’t factor in.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A program that honors women veterans and their service wants to send those in Illinois to Washington, where they will tour war monuments for a day and be celebrated for their service upon their return home. Operation HerStory is seeking 100 women that served during World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and periods in between 1940 to 1975 to participate in the Honor Flight. The program has partnered with organizations, including Honor Flight Chicago, which is a nonprofit organization dedicated to providing veterans with honor and closure. It will be the first all female Honor Flight in the state, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. The trip was announced at the Pritzker Military Museum and Library on Tuesday. John Ptak, president of Honor Flight Chicago, said that although the nonprofit has brought more than 8,700 veterans to Washington, fewer than 200 of the participants have been women. Almost 40 have signed up already, said Ginny Narsete, the founder of Operation HerStory and a retired master sergeant in the Air Force. The flight departs the morning of Oct. 7, returning later that day. The women will tour the Women In Military Service for America Memorial and the Vietnam Women’s Memorial. Narsete said she doesn’t know what’s next for the program after the trip, but she hopes it will help the veterans to accept the honor and recognition they deserve.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis:The City-County Council forged ahead with its new tenant rights initiative on Monday night despite recent legislative effort at the Statehouse to undercut the effort, which seeks to protect residents from retaliatory landlords and educate tenants about rental rights. The first part of the proposal, which passed with an 18-5 vote, appropriates $250,000 to establish a tenant information hotline and provide legal assistance for renters in need. The council’s five Republicans voted against it. The second proposal strengthened protections for renters, requiring landlords to notify tenants of their rights and responsibilities and fining landlords who retaliate against tenants. That proposal passed 19-4, with Republican Michael Paul-Hart crossing party lines to vote in support. But the initiative might be partially moot if the state legislature approves new language added to a bill earlier on Monday, drawing scorn from Mayor Joe Hogsett’s office and Democratic councilors. The amendment to Senate Bill 340 prevents cities from regulating landlord-tenant relations without approval by the General Assembly. It would nullify the requirement to notify tenants of their rights and would also eliminate the fines for retaliation. The move came after concern from the Indiana Apartment Association and other groups, once again highlighting the contrast between a heavily Democratic state capital in a largely Republican state. Yet the public voiced strong support for the council’s efforts on Monday night to combat an issue they highlighted as a crisis.\n\nIowa\n\nSioux City:A mother has complained to the local school board after she said her sixth-grade daughter suffered a broken arm and elbow at the hands of two classmates carrying out a viral online prank. The woman said Monday night during a school board meeting that her daughter had been injured on Feb. 7, when two West Middle School classmates cajoled her into a jumping contest, then kicked the girl’s feet out from under her midjump, causing her to fall on her shoulder, the Sioux City Journal reported. Called the “skull breaker challenge,” the prank was made popular on the social media platform TikTok and has led to reports of children across the country suffering serious head and other injuries. The woman complained that a physical education teacher who was in charge was distracted by his cellphone when the incident happened and that school officials didn’t report the incident to the girl’s parents or seek immediate medical care. “She has no motion in her fingers, no motion in her wrist,” the mother said. “She may never play volleyball again.” School board members did not respond to the complaint during the meeting. Sioux City Community Schools Superintendent Paul Gausman did not immediately return a message left Wednesday seeking comment.\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: A mother is suing a suburban Kansas City school after a teacher was caught on surveillance video last year kicking her daughter, who was in kindergarten. The woman filed the lawsuit last month against the Shawnee Mission School District and the case was moved to federal court this week, the Kansas City Star reported. She contended that the district was negligent in its hiring, training and supervision of the first-year teacher, Crystal Smith, who was fired after the abuse came to light. The mother, who is identified only by her initials in the lawsuit, said her daughter got upset last February because she found some of her artwork crumpled on the floor at the Bluejacket-Flint Elementary School in Shawnee, and that her daughter approached the school librarian to show her the damage. When her daughter crawled into a bookshelf, Smith “yanked her out” and pinned her arms behind her back, causing her pain. Smith then asked the librarian to contact the principal for help, and when the librarian’s back was turned, Smith kicked the girl while she was lying on the floor, according to the suit. The mother said she learned about what happened when she picked up her daughter after school, and that she then confronted the teacher, who told her the girl wasn’t being truthful. She said she then spoke with the principal and requested that school surveillance video be reviewed. She says she received a letter from the principal nearly a week after the incident that said the teacher had admitted grabbing and kicking the girl. The girl’s mother says that if her daughter hadn’t told her what happened, it might never have come to light and her daughter could have suffered “more abuse at the hands” of the teacher. Her lawsuit seeks an unspecified amount in damages. A district spokesman said the school system doesn’t comment on pending litigation.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The Kentucky House voted Wednesday to create a tax on vaping products and increase taxes on snuff and chewing tobacco. The bill passed the House on a 75-17 vote and now goes to the Senate, media outlets reported. It’s estimated to raise $50 million of new tax revenue over the next two fiscal years. It aims to reduce vaping and smokeless tobacco use in a state with one of the nation’s highest cancer rates. The bill would add vaping products to the list of smokable tobacco products such as cigars that are subject to a wholesale tax, with that rate increasing under the measure. The legislation also doubles the per-unit tax on nonsmokable and chewable tobacco products, but does not affect the tax rate on packs of cigarettes. An organization representing 400 vape shop owners recently told legislators the bill would hurt their small businesses and discourage adults from vaping as a way to quit smoking cigarettes. The bill’s supporters, including organizations like the Foundation for a Healthy Kentucky, said the price increase on e-cigarettes will help curb the increased use of highly addictive vaping products by youth in the state.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge:Ronnie Anderson, the longest serving Farm Bureau state president in America, will retire this summer after 31 years of leading the largest agriculture network in Louisiana. Anderson won an astounding 31 straight elections before deciding he won’t seek reelection during the annual Louisiana Farm Bureau Convention in June. “It’s the right time for me,” Anderson said. The Louisiana Farm Bureau has been a powerful political force under Anderson, which elevated its influence in agriculture advocacy. Anderson has also served on the LSU Board of Supervisors in all but two years since former Gov. Mike Foster appointed him in 1997, hiring presidents and football coaches. He has engaged with governors, members of Congress and American presidents in his role as state president and as a member of the American Farm Bureau board in shaping agriculture policy. Anderson’s former first assistant, Jim Monroe, said Anderson has been able to maintain the confidence and support of Farm Bureau members for so long because of his ability to connect with them in a way the members trust. Monroe retired last year after serving 30 years as assistant to the president, the highest-ranking full-time staff position within the Farm Bureau Federation. The president serves as a full-time volunteer. Monroe was succeeded by Kyle McCann. The Louisiana Farm Bureau has grown from about 67,000 members in 1989 to more than 148,000 under Anderson’s watch. Anderson, 71, grew up on a dairy farm in East Feliciana Parish and returned to join the family business after graduating from LSU.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The rate of newborns in Maine who experience health problems because they’re exposed to opioids in the womb is nearly five times the national average, according to a report released by the state health department. Maine’s incidence of the health problems was a little more than 33 per 1,000 live births in 2018, according to the report, provided to the Maine Legislature by the Maine Department of Health and Human Services. The national rate was seven per 1,000 live births. The finding was one of many in the annual report from the Maine Maternal, Fetal and Infant Mortality Review Panel that spoke to health challenges for mothers and babies in the state. According to the report, the percentage of women who smoked during pregnancy in Maine was nearly 12%, almost twice the national average of 6.5%. Slightly more children were also born to women with diabetes, and the percent of births to women who were overweight or obese was also about 5 percentage points higher than the national average, the report stated. The high rate of babies exposed to opioids before birth is a function of the state’s crisis, Stephen Meister, president of the Maine chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said Wednesday. The rates of smoking and obesity reflect longstanding challenges in Maine, he said.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City:A statue of an infant Jesus stolen from St. Paul’s by-the-Sea Episcopal Church is again in the church’s possession after it was missing for nearly a year. “We were very grateful,” said Father Matthew D’Amario, who noted the statue was returned in mid-January “surprisingly undamaged.” D’Amario said the statue, part of the church’s Nativity scene, had been stolen once before ahead of his tenure at the church. That time, it was inexplicably recovered from the ocean near the Inlet. In the latest incident, church staff reported the statue missing on Jan. 4, 2019. Video footage showed it was stolen on Dec. 31, 2018, according to police. Police later identified 43-year-old Cameron Coke of Towson, Maryland, as a suspect. Coke’s trial, on fourth-degree burglary and theft, was set for Jan. 8 but was postponed. Patrol officers stopped Coke as he was driving to the Inlet parking lot because of erratic driving, according to police. During a search of his vehicle, the statue was found. Officers determined Coke was under the influence of a narcotic, found cocaine in his possession and arrested him on charges including drugs and possession of paraphernalia. Coke told officers that he was involved in the theft and that he intended to return the statue to either St. Paul’s or Ocean City police, according to OCPD. Coke is scheduled to appear in Ocean City District Court on April 17, where he will be tried for burglary and theft..\n\nMassachusetts\n\nPlymouth: A 17-year-old boy is responsible for recently spraying red paint all over Plymouth Rock and several other sites in the historic Massachusetts community, police said Thursday. The teen faces 11 felony counts of vandalism and one misdemeanor count of trespassing, Plymouth Police Chief Michael Botieri said in a statement. The suspect’s name was not released because he is a juvenile, but the chief did say he is a resident of the town, which this year is marking the 400th anniversary of the Pilgrims’ arrival. The rock symbolizes the spot where the Mayflower Pilgrims disembarked in December 1620. The suspect was identified by detectives who reviewed hours of surveillance video from the area, the chief said. In addition to Plymouth Rock, the National Monument to the Forefathers and the Plymouth Maiden statue were found defaced on Feb. 17. Most of the places were defaced with the number and letter combination 508 MOF. Botieri told The Patriot Ledger the boy offered no explanation for what was written. The vandalism has since been cleaned up. The Feb. 17 vandalism is not connected to vandalism to the town’s 9/11 Memorial discovered last Sunday, the chief said.\n\nMichigan\n\nCorunna:The former home of a man accused of murder and cannibalism sold at auction for more than $20,000 over the asking price. The home of Mark D. Latunski, located at 703 Tyrrell Road in Bennington Township, had four bidders come forward Feb. 26 in Shiawassee County Circuit Courthouse in Corunna to place offers on the house. Shiawassee County Sheriff’s Sergeant Douglas Chapman told MLive the highest bid came in at $101,733.28 – $21,001 over the minimum asking price. Property records showed the home has a market value of about $93,000 and was originally purchased in May 2001 for $80,000, according to MLive. The name of the highest bidder was not revealed because the deed is not yet registered, MLive reported. Latunski is facing murder charges for the alleged killing and cannibalizing of 25-year-old Kevin Bacon in Latunski’s basement around Christmas Eve. Bacon’s naked body was found hanging from the ceiling by his ankles on Dec. 28. acon’s reported roommate, Michelle Myers, told police he connected with Latunski on Grindr, a dating app for gay, bi, trans and queer people, and met up with him Dec. 24. He was officially reported missing Dec. 25 by his family after he did not show up to Christmas breakfast at his parents’ home. Latunski reportedly admitted to police he stabbed Bacon twice in the back of the neck before stringing him up and slicing his throat. He confessed he then castrated Bacon and took his testicles and cooked and ate them. Michigan’s Center for Forensic Psychiatry deemed Latunski incompetent for trial Feb. 24. He was found incompetent for trial Thursday by a judge. He was referred to the State of Michigan’s Forensic Center for treatment in the Saline.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSauk Rapids:The Sauk Rapids-Rice school board has decided to enter into negotiations with Thief River Falls public schools Superintendent Brad Bergstrom to become their superintendent in July. The board made the decision Wednesday night after the second of two daylong interviews with two finalists. Robbinsdale Area Schools Director of Community Education Kristine Wehrkamp toured the district Monday, and Bergstrom followed the same schedule on Wednesday. Following the interviews, the board unanimously decided to select Bergrstrom, citing his experience and collaborative approach to leadership. Both finalists answered similar questions, first at a public interview at the Sauk Rapids Government Center and then, after a break for dinner, at a special meeting of the school board. Board members had received feedback from students and staff members who had met with the finalists as they toured the district. Bergstrom is in his fourth year as superintendent at Thief River Falls. He was a director of human resources, a high school principal and an area learning center director in the Austin school district. Earlier in his career, he was a teacher and a dean of students in Fergus Falls and Birchdale. He also coached hockey. Bergstrom will start contract negotiations with the district, and, if approved, will start July 1. He will replace Aaron Sinclair, who announced his resignation in December.\n\nMississippi\n\nOxford:The University of Mississippi has apologized to dozens of African Americans who were arrested in 1970 for protesting racial inequality on the mostly white campus where Confederate images were a deeply ingrained part of campus culture. “I am sorry it took us 50 years to do this,” Provost Noel Wilkin said Tuesday during a conference called “Black Power at Ole Miss: Remembrance, Reckoning, and Repair at Fifty Years.” The university also awarded a diploma to one of the people who was arrested. Linnie Liggins – now married and known as Linnie Liggins Willis – had completed her coursework before her arrest but the university at the time refused to give her the diploma she had earned. She has worked as executive director at Lucas Metropolitan Housing Authority in Toledo, Ohio. On Feb. 24, 1970, 40 members of the Black Student Union presented a list of demands to the university’s chancellor, Porter L. Fortune Jr., The Daily Mississippian reported. They wanted the university to hire more black faculty members, begin a black studies program and eliminate Confederate imagery at a time when many white students still waved rebel flags at football games. Also in February 1970, a group of black students burned a Confederate flag and danced on tables in the cafeteria to the music of B.B. King. The next day, almost half of the black students at the university participated in a protest during a campus concert of Up With People, a international traveling group that sang upbeat songs, including at least one tune about racial inclusion. A photo published in the student newspaper at the time showed that some of the protesters stood on stage with their fists in the air – a symbol of the black power movement. During and after the concert, 89 people were arrested and sent to a local jail or to the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman. They were released the next day. Eight of the students were suspended from the university: Donald Ray Cole, John Donald, Theron Evans Jr., Paul D. Jackson, Linnie Liggins, Kenneth Mayfield, lva Ruth Peyton and Henriese Roberts. The arrests happened less than eight years after Ole Miss enrolled its first black student under a federal court order and with protection of U.S. marshals. Five of the eight suspended students returned to campus for the conference Tuesday.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Republican lawmakers on Wednesday took steps to resurrect a Missouri voter photo identification law that was gutted by the state Supreme Court. The court last month permanently blocked a central provision of the 2016 law that required voters who lacked a photo ID to make a sworn statement in order to cast a regular, nonprovisional ballot. In response, Republicans are trying to pass a new voter ID bill that is similar to the 2016 law but doesn’t include the sworn statement provision that the judges found objectionable. House members on Wednesday gave initial approval to the measure, which would give voters only two options, instead of three: either show a photo ID to cast a regular ballot or else cast a provisional ballot. Provisional ballots would be counted if voters return to their polling places on the same day with a valid photo ID or if their signatures match the ones on file with election authorities. To cast provisional ballots, voters would need to sign sworn affidavits that include their birth dates, addresses and the last four digits of their Social Security numbers, and that swear the information is correct. Missouri is one of several states where Republican-led legislatures have passed voter photo ID laws touted as a means of preventing in-person voter fraud, which studies have shown is rare. Democrats generally oppose such laws, arguing that they are really meant to disenfranchise voter groups that tend to support their party, including the poor, elderly and disabled as well as transient college students and minorities who are less likely to have photo IDs.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings:The Trump administration said Wednesday a resumption of coal sales from public lands that had been blocked under former President Barack Obama will result in a negligible increase in greenhouse gas emissions. Critics accused the administration of producing a flawed analysis of the federal coal program that ignores its broader impacts. A federal judge last year had faulted the administration for failing to consider potential damage to the environment when former U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke in 2017 lifted a moratorium on coal sales imposed by his predecessor. U.S. District Judge Brian Morris in Montana stopped short in his April 2019 ruling from halting coal sales but said the Department of Interior had to conduct an environmental review of its decision. The Trump administration review focused on potential emissions from only four coal leases in Utah and Oklahoma that were sold after the moratorium was lifted. That’s a small piece of a federal leasing program that accounts for about about 40% of U.S. coal production, primarily from Western states that also include Wyoming, Montana and Colorado. Burning that fuel accounts for about 11% of annual U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, according to previous studies. Interest in federal leases has slackened considerably over the past decade as many utilities switched to natural gas or renewables and demand for coal plummeted. In documents released Wednesday, administration officials acknowledged Zinke’s order had hastened the resumption of federal coal sales before a three-year review begun under Obama was complete. But they argued those sales would have resumed regardless. Companies have mined about 4 billion tons of coal from federal reserves in the past decade, contributing $10 billion to federal and state coffers through royalties and other payments.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The condition of two of the people who tested positive for COVID-19 in Omaha after being evacuated from a cruise ship in Japan has improved significantly, officials said Wednesday. Two of the 15 people being monitored at the University of Nebraska Medical Center were being cared for at the Nebraska Biocontainment Unit because of the severity of their symptoms. Health officials said Wednesday, those two people improved enough to be transferred to the National Quarantine Unit where the other 13 people are being treated. Two of the 15 have tested negative for the virus and could be released from quarantine March 2. The people who tested positive for COVID-19 will have to test negative for it twice before they can be released.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: There were more than 4.1 million passengers at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas last month, according to new numbers released by the airport Thursday. The airport reported that the number of arriving and departing passengers in January was a 6.6% increase over the same month in 2019. It’s the 11th moth in a row where more than 4 million people passed through the airport, and a record for January travel. Most of January’s passengers, or about 3.8 million, were flying on domestic trips. McCarran saw a 7% increase in arriving and departing passengers on domestic flights up from 2019.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Gov. Chris Sununu is ordering flags to be flown at half-staff on Saturday in memory of an Air Force pilot from Hudson who recently was killed in Afghanistan. Capt. Ryan Phaneuf and another airman died Jan. 27 in a plane crash. Phaneuf, who was 30, was a 2007 graduate of Alvirne High School. Sununu will present the New Hampshire Medal of Honor to Phaneuf’s parents and wife at his memorial services on Saturday.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nMargate:Lucy the Elephant, a six-story National Historic Landmark in Margate, is being offered up for overnight stays March 17-19 on the house-sharing website Airbnb. The one-night stays for two people are being offered for $138 – a price that pays homage to the number of years Lucy has been around – and booking is set to begin March 5 on a first-come basis. The pachyderm-shaped dwelling has an entrance in her back legs that takes guests to a remodeled living quarters. But, Lucy’s caretakers said she doesn’t have running water, so Airbnb is placing a heated bathroom trailer with a shower, sink and toilet for guests on the site. The promotion with Airbnb and the Save Lucy Committee is designed to encourage more visitors to the shore and to the elephant, which is one of the oldest surviving roadside attractions in America. Airbnb will make a donation to help support the committee, which has restored the wooden landmark and maintains her for the more than 130,000 visitors she receives in a year. The listing said Lucy has been a home before, as well as a tavern in a previous life.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A grandfather’s effort to euthanize the family duck drew police after residents reported multiple shots fired. Santa Fe police initially confiscated a handgun from Lorenzo Pacheco, who had fired four shots at the bird, the Santa Fe New Mexican reported. His granddaughter, Kaelyn Pacheco, said in a phone interview Wednesday that officers showed compassion toward the man after learning he had carried out the shooting in an act of mercy. Police arrived just before a burial for the bird was about to start. Kaelyn Pacheco said the duck, a family pet, had become paralyzed and couldn’t walk, and it also had an eye infection. A police report of the incident said Lorenzo Pacheco “felt bad and did not want to break the neck of the duck and thought using a firearm would be more humane.” He placed the duck in an enclosed area and fired four shots, the report said. Officers went to Lorenzo Pacheco’s home, where he showed them the pistol he had used to shoot the duck. According to the report, the officer “collected the weapon for safekeeping and placed it into safekeeping.” Lorenzo Pacheco said in an interview that police returned his gun to him Tuesday after determining there was no cause for a charge of negligent use of a firearm.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: Drivers who get five camera-issued red light tickets or 15 camera-issued speeding tickets in a 12-month period will have to take a traffic safety course or risk losing their vehicles under a bill signed by Mayor Bill de Blasio on Wednesday. The law will take effect on Feb. 26, 2021 and will apply to tickets incurred after Oct. 26 of this year. The vehicles of drivers who exceed the ticket limit can be impounded unless the drivers take a safe driving course overseen by the city Department of Transportation. City officials estimated that the new law will affect about 3,000 to 6,000 vehicles, a fraction of the nearly 2 million vehicles registered in the city. The mayor and City Council will decide after three years whether to renew the law. De Blasio, a Democrat has sought to reduce traffic fatalities through measures such as lowering speed limits and adding speed cameras. But at least 20 pedestrians have been killed by motor vehicles on city streets this year, including a 10-year-old girl who was struck by a school bus on Tuesday.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A female wrestler has made history by winning a state high school wrestling championship. The North Carolina High School Athletic Association said on its website that junior Heaven Fitch of Uwharrie Charter became the first female to win one of the association’s individual state wrestling championships. She won the 106-pound weight class in the 1A division on Saturday. A photo released on the association’s official Twitter account showed her beaming, standing next to three boys who finished behind her in the tournament. She had a 54-4 record for the season and won Most Outstanding Wrestler for the 1A division. Fitch beat Robbinsville’s Luke Wilson to win an eight-person bracket that included seven male wrestlers, said James Alverson, assistant commissioner for the high school association. Overall, she was one of three female wrestlers in the tournament, he said. Last year, she became the first female wrestler to place, coming in fourth in her division.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: The risk of spring flooding in the Red River Valley has been reduced slightly because of limited precipitation in the last few weeks, although National Weather Service forecasters said Thursday there’s still a lot of moisture in the system. The latest outlook showed a 50% chance that the Red River in the Fargo and Moorhead, Minnesota, area will reach just under 35 feet, or 17 feet above flood stage. That could lead to some road and bridge closures, but most structures would not be threatened. There’s a 5% chance the river could top 39 feet, down 5% from the last report. Fargo city leaders said earlier this week they would fill 250,000 sandbags in case that happens. The weather service said precipitation totals since Sept. 1 remain at record highs in many areas along the Red River and the snowpack is at or above normal and could lead to a high runoff. However, the forecast no longer indicates a cooler and wetter late winter and early spring period. Conditions could change quickly depending on the rate of thaw and spring rains, the report said.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Transgender females would be banned from competing in Ohio high school and college girls and women’s sports under a bill introduced Wednesday by House Republicans. The legislation would apply to all public schools and colleges and any private schools or colleges that are members of a state or national athletic association. The bill prohibits biological males from competing in girls or women’s sports. It comes as three high school girl runners in Connecticut are suing to block a policy that allows transgender athletes to compete in girls sports. Currently in Ohio, transgender girls can participate in sports after they have completed a minimum of one year of hormone treatment related to gender transition, under Ohio High School Athletic Association rules. Alternatively, transgender girls can compete if they demonstrate to OHSAA officials “by way of sound medical evidence” that they don’t possess physical advantages over girls of the same age. Similar bills have been introduced in Alabama, Arizona, Idaho and Mississippi. The Ohio bill sponsors are Rep. Jena Powell, of Arcanum in western Ohio, and Rep. Reggie Stoltzfus of Paris Township in northeastern Ohio.\n\nOklahoma\n\nNorman:Dozens of University of Oklahoma students staged a sit-in for a second day Thursday outside OU’s administrative offices following two instances of professors using racial slurs in the classroom. OU’s Black Emergency Response Team, known as BERT, gathered Wednesday morning in Evans Hall and called for the resignation of OU provost Kyle Harper, mandatory equity training for faculty, semester-long diversity training and a new multicultural center on campus. Some students spent the night in Evans Hall and the group said it would remain there “until these demands are met.” The sit-in comes days after interim OU President Joseph Harroz Jr. announced that a history professor read from a historical document in class that used the N-word repeatedly. Earlier this month, an OU journalism professor stepped down from teaching the course for the rest of the semester after telling students during class that the N-word is no more offensive than the term “boomer.” The university said in a statement late Wednesday that leaders had met with the students to discuss their concerns. “We identified areas of agreement that will move our university forward,” the OU statement said. “We have agreed to continue these discussions. We will also advance these conversations with other student, faculty, and staff leadership.”\n\nOregon\n\nNewport: A body found in Newport Bay has been identified as that of a fisherman who has been missing for nearly three weeks, the Newport Police Department said Thursday. Norman Grant was reported missing on Feb. 9 and hadn’t been seen since the evening of Feb. 8, Chief Jason Malloy said in a statement. Cellphone records and video from local surveillance cameras put Grant’s last known location near a fishing boat that he worked on called the F/V Prolifik. The boat was moored at Hallmark Fisheries. Grant’s body was discovered about 80 feet south of the Hallmark Fisheries dock when another boat ran into something under the water on Feb. 26. A subsequent inspection of the boat found clothing entangled in the vessel’s prop and a diver was called in. No cause of death or other details about the case have been released.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nWest Newton: A mother wearing a Cookie Monster costume apparently overdosed on heroin while sitting in her running car, shortly after she had dropped off her 9-year-old son at a babysitter’s home. Rachel Love Martin, 38, of Westmoreland County was charged Wednesday with child endangerment. It’s not known if she has retained an attorney. The babysitter called police to her home because she was concerned Martin might have been under the influence of drugs, authorities said. Police found Martin slumped over the steering wheel of her car, and emergency responders soon gave her Narcan, a drug used to revive people suffering from a drug overdose. Meanwhile, police found Martin’s son wasn’t wearing any shoes or socks when he was dropped off, just a pair of pants and a T-shirt at a time when temperatures were in the low 40s, authorities said. It’s not clear why Martin was wearing the Cookie Monster costume, authorities said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nWarwick: Firefighters are sharing nearly $500,000 in retroactive payments to end the last outstanding grievance stemming from recent contract negotiations. A panel of arbitrators ruled that the city should retroactively pay firefighters an extra 2.25% for work performed during the budget year that ended June 30, The Providence Journal reported. The decision will cost the city $478,456, according to Mayor Joseph J. Solomon. The firefighters union negotiated a new three-year agreement in January, partially retroactive, for the period from July 1, 2019, through June 30, 2022. That agreement had not resolved the firefighters’ wages for the fiscal year that ended on June 30. The union had previously sought a 4% raise for wages during that period, and later it sought 3%, according to Solomon. Solomon had hoped to settle the matter by giving the firefighters 1.5% but he said the arbitrators’ decision is “fair and reasonable.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A law banning sex education teachers from mentioning any relationships other than heterosexual – unless the talk involves sexually transmitted diseases – is fueling a climate of state-sanctioned discrimination, a federal lawsuit said. The National Center for Lesbian Rights and Lambda Legal said the lawsuit filed Wednesday seeks to overturn the Comprehensive Health Education Act of 1988 as an unconstitutional violation of the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution. The law, which mandates how sex education classes are taught, also subjects students to bullying and violence and stigmatizes a group that’s already at a heightened risk of suicide, the lawsuit contends. State Superintendent of Education Molly Spearman, named as a defendant in the lawsuit, agreed that the law is on shaky ground. She requested an opinion on its constitutionality from South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson. That opinion said “a court would likely conclude” that the law violates the equal protection clause requiring that people in similar circumstances be treated the same under the law. Parents can have their children opted out of the school sex education curriculum, said Ryan Brown, a spokesman for the state Department of Education.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: The state Senate on Wednesday unanimously approved a proposal to start four schools based around Native American language and culture.The House will next consider the proposal, which aims to address high drop-out rates in some Native American communities in the state. The schools would teach an Oceti Sakowin curriculum centered on Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota language and culture. It is pushed by a group of educators who are planning to open the schools in Native American communities. When Sen. Troy Heinert, a Democrat from Mission, introduced the bill, he had hefty opposition from Gov. Kristi Noem and education groups. But he was able to win the Republican governor’s support through a rewrite of the bill. He also won the support of the Republican-dominated Senate. Education groups oppose the proposal, saying that the current school system can accommodate innovative programs. The schools were originally called charter schools in the bill, but the term was switched to “community-based schools.” The schools would need to apply to school districts to start within the district, and they would receive funding based on the number of students enrolled in the schools. They would purchase or lease school facilities independently from the school districts.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Meharry Medical College and health care provider Remote Area Medical are offering free dental care at an event this week. They will provide free cleanings, fillings, extractions and dental X-rays on Saturday on Meharry’s campus in Nashville during Oral Health Day. Services will be provided to up to 600 uninsured or underinsured middle Tennessee residents, according to a news release from the school. There will also be free kidney screenings provided by the Tennessee Kidney Foundation, the release said. Remote Area Medical is a nonprofit provider of mobile medical clinics that delivers free dental, vision and medical care to people in need. To receive treatment, patients must be at least 18 years old. They will be seen on a first-come, first-served basis. Services are free, and no insurance or identification is required. Check-in is at Henry A. Moses Ph.D. Alumni Hall on Meharry’s campus. Tickets will be distributed beginning at 6 a.m. Services will be available at 7 a.m. No children will be permitted. Care will be provided by Meharry dental students, Meharry School of Dentistry alumni and volunteer dental students and providers.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Emergency crews rescued stranded drivers from the roofs of their vehicles on Thursday after a water main broke and flooded a Houston freeway. The flooding submerged vehicles on an eastern section of Loop 610, a highway that circles the city. Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez tweeted early Thursday afternoon that all occupants were out of flooded vehicles. There were no reports of injuries. Drivers in the low-lying city are used to navigating flooded roadways during storms, but the water main-caused flash flood caught many by surprise on a sunny day. The fire department said on Twitter that it had rescued three people and searched and cleared 12 vehicles. Houston officials said the 8-foot water main burst as a contractor doing exploratory work for a city water line project moved soil from the line. The city said contractors are in the area to isolate the break and make repairs. City officials said they had received reports about low water pressure across a large swath of the city but that once the valves are closed, pressure should be restored. Gonzalez said some nearby businesses were reporting that they had no water service.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Leaders of a new Salt Lake City Olympic bid committee vowed Wednesday to be transparent and frugal as they design a plan based around existing venues and experience from hosting the 2002 Winter Olympics but that will also include new, modern ideas. The committee held its first meeting as it sets out to assess whether Salt Lake City should bid for the 2030 or 2034 Winter Olympics. There’s no timeline for that decision. Committee chair Cindy Crane told board members that every conversation they have about the Olympics should be considered public as the part of a completely open process. Crane, a former CEO of a major utility company, said after the meeting that the remark was made to establish ground rules and was not a direct reference to a bribery scandal that nearly derailed the plans for the 2002 Winter Olympics hosted by Salt Lake City. But, she said, “The strength of our operating principles are to make it very, very clear that those days are well behind us and not in our path forward.” The bribery scandal broke in 1998, three years after Salt Lake City was chosen over cities in Canada, Sweden and Switzerland. Salt Lake’s bid committee doled out $1 million in cash, scholarships, medical care, gifts and other favors to International Olympic Committee members and their families. That included ski trips, NBA tickets, plastic surgery, knee replacements, violins and housing and salary for children of IOC members, according to report by an ethics panel. It led to the expulsion of six IOC members, the resignation of four others and severe warnings for several others, though none faced criminal charges. U.S. prosecutors brought criminal charges against two Salt Lake bid leaders, but both men were acquitted by a judge halfway through a federal trial.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier:The state House advanced a bill to tax and regulate marijuana sales in the state, after the Senate passed legislation last spring. Current Vermont law that went into effect in 2018 allows for the possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, but it does not include a mechanism to tax and sell marijuana. The House vote on the tax-and-regulate legislation late Wednesday was approved 90-54. Rep. John Gannon, a Democrat from Wilmington, called Vermont’s existing law “awkward” because it legalized recreational pot but did not create “safe and legal access to it.” He told lawmakers that the question before them was whether cannabis, which was already legalized in Vermont, should be regulated. A House amendment has proposed a 14% excise tax on retail sales of marijuana products and a 6% sales and use tax for a total rate of 20%. The bill establishes a license for current medical dispensaries to start selling marijuana in February 2022. Other retailers would need to apply for licenses and could start selling it in July 2022. Cultivators, wholesalers and product manufacturers would need to apply for other licenses available. The program for licensed cannabis establishments would be administered by an independent Cannabis Control Board within the executive branch, which would be responsible for establishing rules, compliance and enforcement. The use of cannabis in public places would be prohibited unless specifically authorized by law. Republican Gov. Phil Scott has said he was concerned about highway safety, and said he wanted to see an effective way to test for impairment.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: An animal control company said it removed an 8-foot-long beehive from someone’s apartment. Virginia Wildlife Management and Control said in a statement that it removed the hive from the ceiling of a living room in Richmond on Monday. The space was in between tenants at the time. The company said the hive produced about 80 to 100 pounds of honey, although only about 15 to 20 pounds was able to be salvaged. Rich Perry, owner of the wildlife control company, told The Charlotte Observer that the hive was large enough to support 100,000 to 150,000 bees. But he said it wasn’t fully occupied Perry said it was extremely unusual to find such a large hive inside a building. He said the hive of Italian bees was likely to be at least 2 years old. He said the bees probably got in through holes in the siding and found a home between rafters and sheet rock.The company said it has a “no kill” policy with bees. But he said the company could not find the queen after an extensive search and that the hive could not be saved.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: A measure prohibiting homicide defendants from claiming as a defense that panic brought on by a victim’s sexual orientation or gender identity has been passed by state lawmakers. Nine states – California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Nevada, New Jersey New York and Rhode Island – have legislatively banned the use of gay or transgender panic as a legal defense. The Washington measure, passed by the Senate on a bipartisan 46-3 vote Wednesday, is named after Nikki Kuhnhausen, a transgender teen who was killed last year, The Columbian reported. Kuhnhausen, 17, disappeared in early June and her remains were discovered Dec. 7, southeast of Battle Ground. A Vancouver man has been charged with second-degree murder and malicious harassment, which is a hate crime in Washington. Authorities said Kuhnhausen was strangled after her assailant learned she was transgender. He has pleaded not guilty. There was no immediate indication if he will attempt to use a “panic” defense. The bill, which passed the House earlier this month on a 90-5 vote, would block a defendant from using a defense based on discovery or disclosure of the victim’s actual or perceived gender identity or sexual orientation and would prevent a claim of “diminished capacity” because the defendant did not fully comprehend the nature and gravity of the alleged crime. The legislation now goes to Gov. Jay Inslee for his signature.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Investigators are seeking help from the public as they try to determine the cause of separate fires on the same day at adjacent businesses in southern West Virginia. A medical building under renovation and a gun shop were destroyed in the Feb. 10 fires in Williamson, the state fire marshal’s office said in a news release Thursday. Although firefighters battled a fire at the Williamson Health and Wellness Center, crews discovered the gun shop had been broken into and items had been removed. The second fire at the gun shop occurred about four hours later with flames shooting through the roof, the statement said. The state fire marshal’s office is working with Williamson police in the investigation. Although the statement said it’s not known how the fires started, it said a $5,000 reward is being offered for information leading to an arrest and conviction.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison:The number of abortions performed in Wisconsin increased for a second straight year in 2018 after eight years of declines, the latest report from the state Department of Health Services showed. Abortions increased 7% in 2018 over 2017, the report said. There were 6,042 abortions in Wisconsin in 2018, up from 5,640 the year before. That’s nearly double the rate of increase between 2016 and 2017 when abortions went up 3.7%. The growth is due to there being 539 more medication abortions in 2018 compared with 2017. Planned Parenthood opened a clinic in Sheboygan in May 2018 that offered medication abortions. The latest report showed that women ages 20 to 24 had 30% of the abortions in 2018, the most of any age group. The total number of abortions had dropped steadily from 2009 until 2017. Anti-abortion groups Pro-Life Wisconsin and Wisconsin Right to Life both decried the increase. Republicans who control the Legislature passed a number of bills restricting abortion access in recent years. Democratic Gov. Tony Evers last year vetoed for Republican-backed bills designed to limit the number of abortions.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Federal investigators want help from the public as they try to find out who poisoned a golden eagle and ravens in southwest Wyoming four years ago. They’re offering a reward of up to $2,000 for information leading to a conviction. The golden eagle and four ravens were found dead southwest of Wamsutter in 2016. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said Tuesday investigators also found poison-laced baits in the remote area of interspersed private and U.S. Bureau of Land Management lands. Investigators said the case is unrelated to the 2018 poisoning deaths of three dogs, a bald eagle and dozens of other birds in the Dubois area. The Fish and Wildlife Service and Wyoming Game and Fish Department are offering rewards up to $7,000 in that case. Golden eagles are federally protected under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act. A person who kills one illegally can get up to a year in prison and a $100,000 fine.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/02/28"}]}

Despite a historically divisive presidency and his own role in inciting an attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, Trump aimed to evoke nostalgia for his time in office, frequently contrasting his first-term accomplishments with the Biden administration’s policies and the current economic climate. Many of those perceived accomplishments – from strict immigration actions to corporate tax cuts and religious freedom initiatives – remain deeply polarizing to this day.\n\nAs Trump spoke to a roomful of Republicans who expect him to face primary challengers in the coming months, he also claimed the party cannot afford to nominate “a politician or conventional candidate” if it wants to win back the White House.\n\n“This will not be my campaign, this will be our campaign all together,” Trump said.\n\nTrump’s long-awaited campaign comes as he tries to reclaim the spotlight following the GOP’s underwhelming midterm elections performance – including the losses of several Trump-endorsed election deniers – and the subsequent blame game that has unfolded since Election Day. Republicans failed to gain a Senate majority, came up short in their efforts to fill several statewide seats, and have yet to secure a House majority, with only 215 races called in their favor so far out of the 218 needed, developments that have forced Trump and other party leaders into a defensive posture as they face reproval from within their ranks.\n\nTrump’s paperwork establishing his candidacy landed with the Federal Election Committee shortly before he delivered his announcement at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nTo the delight of aides and allies who have long advised him to mount a forward-looking campaign, he spent only a fraction of his remarks repeating his lies about the 2020 election. Though he advocated for the use of paper ballots and likened America’s election system to that of “third world countries,” Trump also tried at times to broaden his grievances – lamenting the “massive corruption” and “entrenched interests” that in his view have consumed Washington. Many of Trump’s top advisers have expressed concern that his fixation on promoting conspiracies about the last presidential election would make it harder for him to win a national election in 2024.\n\nThroughout the hour-long speech, Trump made clear that he wants his campaign to be seen by Republicans as a sacrificial undertaking.\n\n“Anyone who truly seeks to take on this rigged and corrupt system will be faced with a storm of fire that only a few could understand,” he said at one point, describing the legal and emotional toll his presidency and post-presidential period has taken on his family members.\n\nOn the heels of last week’s midterm elections, Trump has been blamed for elevating flawed candidates who spent too much time parroting his claims about election fraud, alienating key voters and ultimately leading to their defeats. He attempted to counter that criticism on Tuesday, noting that Republicans appear poised to retake the House majority and touting at least one Trump-endorsed candidate, Kevin Kiley of California. At one point, Trump appeared to blame his party’s midterm performance on voters not yet realizing “the total effect of the suffering” after two years of Democratic control in Washington.\n\n“I have no doubt that by 2024, it will sadly be much worse and they will see clearly what has happened and is happening to our country – and the voting will be much different,” he claimed.\n\nBeating others to the punch\n\nTrump is betting that his first-out-of-the gate strategy will fend off potential primary rivals and give him an early advantage with deep-pocketed donors, aides say. He is widely expected to be challenged by both conservative and moderate Republicans, though the calculus of some presidential hopefuls could change now that he is running. Others – like his former Vice President, Mike Pence – may proceed anyway.\n\nTrump’s third presidential bid also coincides with a period of heightened legal peril as Justice Department officials investigating him and his associates revisit the prospect of indictments in their Trump-related probes. The former president is currently being investigated for his activities before and during the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol and his retention of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate after he left office. While Trump is counting on an easy path to the GOP nomination with his sustained support among the party’s base, his announcement is likely to dash the hopes of party leaders who have longed for fresh talent. In particular, top Republicans have been paying close attention to the next moves of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who won his reelection contest with a 19-point margin of victory and considerable support from minority and independent voters. Some Republican leaders may try to scuttle Trump’s campaign by elevating or encouraging alternative candidates, including DeSantis, who has been quietly laying the groundwork for a possible White House bid of his own.\n\nOf course, any countereffort to inhibit Trump’s path to the nomination is likely to prove difficult. Despite his myriad legal entanglements and the stain of January 6, the twice-impeached 45th president remains immensely popular among most Republican voters and boasts a deep connection with his core backers that could prove difficult for other GOP hopefuls to replicate or weaken. Even leading conservatives who disliked Trump’s pugnacious politics and heterodox policies stuck with him as president because he helped solidify the rightward shift of the US Supreme Court with his nominations – one of the most far-reaching aspects of his legacy, which resulted in the conservative court majority’s deeply polarizing June decision to end federal abortion rights. In fact, while Trump ended his first term with the lowest approval rating of any president, Republicans viewed him favorably, according to a May NBC News poll. That alone could give Trump a significant edge over primary opponents whom voters are still familiarizing themselves with.\n\nAmong those potential competitors is Pence, who would likely benefit from high name recognition due to his role as vice president. Pence, who has been preparing for a possible White House run in 2024, is sure to face an uphill battle courting Trump’s most loyal supporters, many of whom soured on the former vice president after he declined to overstep his congressional authority and block certification of now-President Joe Biden’s 2020 victory. Trump could also find himself pitted against DeSantis, who has risen to hero status among cultural conservatives and who is widely considered a more polished version of Trump. Even some of the former president’s advisers have voiced similar observations to CNN, noting that DeSantis also made inroads with major Republican donors during his quest for reelection and built a mountain of goodwill with GOP leaders by campaigning for federal and statewide Republican candidates in the middle of his own race.\n\nBeyond his potential rivals, Trump has another roadblock in his path as the House select committee continues to investigate his role in January 6, 2021, and Justice Department officials weigh whether to issue criminal charges. The committee, which subpoenaed him for testimony and documents in October and which Trump is now battling in court, held public hearings throughout the summer and early fall featuring depositions from those in Trump’s inner circle at the White House – including members of his family – that detailed his public and private efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results through a sustained pressure campaign on numerous local, state and federal officials, and on his own vice president.\n\nBut Trump’s desire to announce his campaign early can be especially traced to the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, which advisers say further emboldened his decision to mount what he believes will be a triumphant political comeback. The day after the search, the former president fielded calls from allies advising him to accelerate his 2024 timeline. That night, he huddled with House lawmakers in the Republican Study Committee and told them he’d “made up his mind” about launching a bid, though some of those same House Republicans later convinced him to wait until after the midterm elections to announce his next move.\n\nFew of those lawmakers were present for Trump’s speech on Tuesday, choosing to remain in Washington as House Republicans conducted their leadership elections and the party continues to grapple with its failures in highly prized midterm races. Rather, the room was filled with prominent election deniers like MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, several of Trump’s attorneys, and past and present aides. Before he entered the room on Tuesday alongside former first lady Melania Trump, several members of the ex-president’s family were also seen filtering into the ballroom, including Eric and Lara Trump, his son Barron, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, and Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is engaged to Donald Trump Jr. His eldest son was notably missing, along with daughter Ivanka, , who has since said she will no longer be involved in the political arena. A source close to Donald Trump Jr. said he was stuck on a hunting trip in the mountain west and unable to catch a flight back to Florida in time for his father’s announcement. Other guests included longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone; outgoing North Carolina Rep. Madison Cawthorn; former congressman and the current CEO of Trump’s Truth Social app Devin Nunes; and his chief political adviser Susie Wiles.\n\nPreparing for 2024\n\nFrom the moment Trump left Washington, defeated and disgraced, in January 2021, he began plotting a return to power – devoting the bulk of his time to building a political operation intended for this moment. With assistance from numerous former aides and advisers, he continued the aggressive fundraising tactics that had become a marker of his 2020 campaign, amassing a colossal war chest ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, and worked diligently to elect steadfast allies in both Congress and state legislatures across the country.\n\nWhile maintaining a home base in Florida, he also regularly jet-setted across the country for campaign rallies that afforded him crucial face time with his base and with candidates he bet would become valuable allies in the US Senate and House.\n\nThrough it all, Trump continued to falsely insist that the 2020 election was stolen from him, indulging in far-flung conspiracy theories about voter fraud and pressuring Republican leaders across the party’s election apparatus to endorse changes that would curtail voting rights.\n\nTrump’s aides were pleased earlier this fall when his public appearances and rally speeches gradually became more focused on rising crime, immigration and economic woes – key themes throughout the midterm cycle and issues they hope will enable him to draw a compelling contrast with Biden as he begins this next chapter. Allies of the former president have long said that he views the 2024 contest as an opportunity to regain what he believes is his: another four years in the Oval Office.\n\nBut there is no guarantee that Trump will glide easily to a nonconsecutive second term. In fact, it could be quite difficult.\n\nNot only does history offer just one example of such a feat (defeated in 1888 after his first term, President Grover Cleveland was elected again in 1892), no previously impeached president has ever run again for office. Trump was first impeached in 2019 on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of justice, and then again in 2021 for inciting the riot at the US Capitol. Though he was acquitted by the Senate both times, 10 House Republicans broke with their party the second time around to join Democrats in a vote to impeach him. Seven Republican senators voted to convict him at his Senate trial.\n\nTrump has also been the subject of a bevy of lawsuits and investigations, including a New York state investigation and a separate Manhattan district attorney criminal probe into his company’s finances, a Georgia county probe into his efforts to overturn Biden’s election win in the state, and separate Justice Department probes into his campaign’s scheme to put forth fake electors in battleground states and his decision to bring classified materials with him to Mar-a-Lago upon leaving office.\n\nTrump’s actions since he left Washington have, for the most part, signaled his interest in an eventual return. While most former presidents go quietly into retirement – resurfacing to assist their parties during midterm cycles or for the opening of their presidential libraries – Trump bucked tradition to instead plot the comeback he now hopes to make. Despite its distance from Washington, Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club has transformed into a new hub for Republicans and a home base for his political machine. Assisted by a small group of paid staffers, he has hosted numerous candidate and committee fundraisers and seen a rotating cast of party leaders and congressional hopefuls filter through its gilded hallways in the hopes of nabbing his endorsement or reingratiating themselves with his base. Trump’s schedule has enabled him to build close relationships with party leaders and fringe figures – from House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy of California to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia – whose support in a contested primary could ultimately help him clear the field. Many of the aides who have been with him since he left the White House are expected to continue on as campaign hands, as the former president and his de facto chief of staff, longtime Florida GOP strategist Wiles, aim to maintain a lean operation much like the early days of his 2016 presidential campaign. Among those who are likely to be involved are Wiles, Taylor Budowich, Chris LaCivita, Steven Cheung, Justin Caporale and Brian Jack. Brad Parscale, who managed part of Trump’s failed 2020 campaign will not be part of his 2024 operation, nor will Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who was deeply involved in his quest for reelection.\n\nTime in office\n\nAs president, Trump faced criticism over several of his actions, especially his management of the worst public health crisis in nearly a century – the Covid-19 pandemic – though his administration helped facilitate the development of vaccines to treat the novel coronavirus in record time. He also was blasted by critics over his handling of Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico in 2017; the White nationalist rally, also in 2017, in Charlottesville, Virginia, where Heather Heyer was killed while walking with a group of counterprotesters; and Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nWhile in office, Trump signed sweeping tax cuts into law, enacted controversial hard-line immigration policies, including a policy that separated migrant children from their families and one known as “Remain in Mexico,” which the US Supreme Court ruled in June could be ended by his successor, and appointed hundreds of federal judges with deep conservative credentials. He also successfully nominated three Supreme Court justices, whose decisions this year as part of the court’s majority have shifted American society and laws rightward on issues such as abortion, guns, religious freedom and climate change.\n\nThe former real estate businessman and reality TV star was first elected to office in 2016, beating out a wide field of more than a dozen GOP candidates in an ugly primary, and then prevailing over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in a contentious general election, despite sexual misconduct allegations that would have typically been campaign-ending.\n\nAs president, Trump was an impulsive leader, who dispensed with long-standing norms, often announcing policy and Cabinet personnel changes on Twitter. (He was ultimately banned from the platform following the US Capitol riot and was later barred from Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube as well.)\n\nHe pushed an “America First” foreign policy approach, pulling the US out of international agreements such as the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal, a pair of controversial moves that were decried by many of America’s top European allies.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story mistakenly said who was likely to be involved in the Trump campaign. Brad Parscale will not be involved in the 2024 operation. It has also been updated to correctly characterize former President Donald Trump’s position on paper ballots, fix the spelling of Justin Caporale and reflect additional developments.", "authors": ["Gaborr Kristen Holmes Veronica Stracqualursi", "Kristen Holmes", "Veronica Stracqualursi"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/11/politics/tiffany-trump-wedding/index.html", "title": "Tiffany Trump's wedding assembles a family divided over its ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAfter three days on hurricane watch, Tiffany Trump breathed a sigh of relief.\n\nThe weather in Palm Beach, Florida, was finally easing and the forecast for Saturday, her wedding day, looked sunny and warm. Two people familiar with the bride-to-be’s mood tell CNN that Donald Trump’s younger daughter, his only child with second wife Marla Maples, had been “stressed” about the late-season storm and what it might mean for her Mar-a-Lago celebration with 25-year-old Michael Boulos, her boyfriend of four years.\n\nBut even though Tropical Storm Nicole is moving on, the Trumps may still be in for some tumult over the weekend. They’re gathering as their patriarch makes moves toward a 2024 presidential run, a prospect not everyone in the family is excited about. Some of them are signaling they don’t want to be involved much, if at all, sources close to the family tell CNN.\n\nThree people familiar with the former president’s activities say he is not in the best of spirits. Many of the high-profile candidates he endorsed in the midterms failed to secure a win, and now some Republicans are whispering about his dwindling influence over the party. Trump is “cranky,” says one of the people.\n\nAt present, say those who are familiar, Trump is more focused on his “special announcement” on Tuesday, when he may – or may not – announce his planned third run for the presidency. His mind is consumed with the 2024 political landscape and where and how he will fit into it.\n\nBut first he has to get through one other job: Father of the bride.\n\nTrump typically likes being the center of attention at his private club, which also serves as his home, but only if he’s being congratulated or in the mood for accolades. The run-up to Tiffany’s big day has been rough and, as the skies clear and her guests descend on Mar-a-Lago, sources say the former president is lying low.\n\nTwo of the people familiar with Trump’s mood say he has also been on the outs with his wife, Melania Trump, after a post-election day news report said she got the brunt of his ire after Dr. Mehmet Oz’s loss in his run for the US Senate. The New York Times reported that Donald Trump blamed Melania Trump for his endorsement of the TV doctor; during a rally this year, he mentioned his wife was a big Oz fan.\n\nShowing up in a news story is not something the ultra-private Melania Trump enjoys, and Trump was soon apologizing on Truth Social to her for what he called “made up” stories about her involvement. The damage, however, say the two people, was done. Plus, everyone steers clear of the former president when he’s in a bad mood, including his wife. CNN has reached out to a spokesperson for the former president.\n\nStill, it’s a wedding, and an entire family cannot completely avoid one another. Tiffany Trump has close relationships with all of her half-siblings, say those who know her. Though she was often referred to as Trump’s “forgotten daughter” during the White House years, when older sister Ivanka Trump was center stage, Tiffany – who graduated from Georgetown Law in 2020 – is tight with her older sister. Ivanka was on hand last weekend at Tiffany’s bridal shower, held at a friend’s home in Palm Beach, a celebration that included a tiered Tiffany-blue cake along with her mother, Marla Maples, and her stepmother, Melania Trump. CNN has reached out to a spokesperson for Tiffany Trump for comment on this story.\n\nIvanka and Tiffany Trump still have a strong relationship, but elsewhere the family dynamic has been shifting over the past two years. Ivanka’s interactions with her father have changed since both left the White House. Now living in Miami, Ivanka is not wistful for Washington – “far from it,” says one of several people who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity to preserve personal and professional relationships with the family. CNN reached out to a spokesperson for Ivanka Trump and did not receive a response.\n\nSenior adviser to the president is not a role Ivanka Trump wishes to resurrect.\n\n“(Ivanka) would never go back to that life,” says one of the people familiar with her thinking. “She knows it’s not something that would serve her or her family at this point.”\n\nAnother person says Ivanka has been “done” with Washington “since the day she left” and that “hasn’t changed.” A third person contends if Ivanka had any interest in taking part in politics again, people would have seen her on the campaign trail, pushing candidates for the midterms. Yet she made zero appearances or public endorsements, despite requests for participation by some of those in tight races, says a person with knowledge.\n\nAll of the people who spoke with CNN say Ivanka Trump’s life is centered around her three young children. Though she may not yet have had direct conversations with Donald Trump about her lack of interest in a second White House campaign, he is aware that any bid would not include the assistance of his daughter, says one of the people with knowledge of family discussions.\n\nTrump would also lack the presence of his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, once the gatekeeper for Trump in the White House and one of the most connected and influential voices of his administration.\n\n“Jared does not intend to join the campaign and get back involved,” says a source familiar with Kushner’s plans. CNN reached out to a spokesperson for Jared Kushner and did not receive a response.\n\nThe person maintains Kushner has a good relationship with his father-in-law and that he “makes an effort to be with (Trump),” but said he would do little more than offer the occasional piece of advice should Trump run again.\n\n“I’m sure (Jared will) be tested in numerous different ways, he’s his father-in-law, but that said, it would be a far cry from helping in the way he helped before,” said the person. Kushner, who now runs a private equity firm, has “moved on,” from the last several years in a way Trump has not.\n\nTrump is presumably aware of the lack of interest his wife, Ivanka and Jared have in campaigning. Melania Trump did little in the way of stumping for her husband during his first run for the White House and held only three solo campaign events on his behalf before the 2020 election.\n\nThere is no indication Melania Trump would change her habits and take an active part in any upcoming campaign. “Never say never” was all she would say when asked during a May interview if she could live in the White House again. In Ohio last week, during a rally for JD Vance, where it was rumored Trump might announce his latest presidential run, there were only four chairs set up for Trump family. They were designated for Eric and Lara Trump and for Donald Trump Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle.\n\nDonald Trump Jr. is sending different signals to his friends. “Of course!” is the answer from a person familiar with Don Jr.’s thinking when asked if Trump’s son will campaign on his behalf, should he announce his candidacy next week. Don Jr. has none of his stepmother, sister and brother-in-law’s hesitancy about another Trump presidency.\n\n“He’s going to be out there campaigning for his dad,” said the person. CNN reached out to a spokesperson for Donald Trump Jr. and did not receive a response.\n\nDon Jr. is right now the closest family adviser Trump has. Unlike his presidential years, when Ivanka and Jared were the inner circle, Don Jr. has emerged as a key figure in the future of Trumpian politics. But that’s not to say Don Jr. wants to fill the shoes of Jared and Ivanka.\n\n“He does not want the Jared behind-the-scenes role,” says the source, adding Don Jr. isn’t in to the micromanagement of Trump. “When (Don Jr.) has strong opinions about something involving his father, he does not have a problem saying them out loud,” says the person, giving as an example Don Jr.’s insistence Trump not announce his candidacy before the midterm elections. “He just didn’t think it made sense.”\n\nOpinions and appearances will be Don Jr.’s sweet spot should his dad run again, but the eldest Trump son will draw the line at a defined job description.\n\n“He’s not going to be the shadow campaign manager or anything,” says the source, who adds Don Jr. is also focused on his five children, his publishing company and “hunting.”\n\nEric Trump, and likely more so his wife, Lara Trump, a frequent guest on conservative news outlets, will fall more under the Don Jr. level of participation in a Trump second act, than that of Ivanka and Jared.\n\nMost of the people who spoke to CNN say family division over the political plans of their patriarch is not a concern – Tiffany Trump won’t be switching up seating arrangements to keep the pro-campaign faction away from the anti-campaign. Mar-a-Lago, closed for the storm until Friday at 6 p.m., will be back in full swing in time for Tiffany’s marriage to Boulos, the son of a wealthy businessman who owns several companies in Nigeria.\n\nThe wedding will not be a place for squabbles and power plays. “It’s going to be a day that is all about Tiffany,” says a person familiar with the event, rumored to be a $1 million affair.\n\n“They get along great,” says one of the people who spends time with the siblings, adding that politics and their dad are not always what they talk about when they get together. “Believe it or not, they’re a pretty normal family.”", "authors": ["Kate Bennett"], "publish_date": "2022/11/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/16/politics/trump-2024-announcement-timing/index.html", "title": "Trump is weighing whether to announce a 2024 bid before the ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe signs of Donald Trump’s next White House run are there. He has hosted wannabe campaign managers at Mar-a-Lago and quizzed golf partners between shots on who he should put in charge, though no formal interviews have been conducted.\n\nHis interest in 2024 polls – especially how he stacks up against Florida’s Ron DeSantis, his home-state governor – has piqued in recent months, but Trump has yet to formally launch an exploratory committee. And he’s made a series of midterm endorsements meant to impress Republican voters, proving that he has the magic touch – though recent losses in Idaho, Georgia and North Carolina have begun to tell a different story.\n\nWith virtually no formal campaign apparatus in place, mounting questions about the strength of his influence over GOP primary voters and high-profile congressional hearings that are reinjecting Trump’s 2020 election claims into the national conversation, sources close to the former President told CNN he is nevertheless closer than ever to announcing another run for office. As more and more Republicans add Iowa and New Hampshire to their schedules and work to gauge the party’s appetite for fresh leadership, Trump has been telling friends and advisers he wants to put his potential rivals on notice – and soon.\n\n“Announcing before the midterms allows him to clear the field, shore up the donor base and take a victory lap after the midterms,” one former Trump campaign official said.\n\nBut the prospect of Trump launching a third bid for the White House as an end-of-summer or October surprise has worried many of these allies, who think the timing is premature. More than 10 Trump confidants, advisers and aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity said they have personally advised the 45th President to hold off on a formal campaign launch until next year. They noted the careful planning it would take to pull off an announcement that commands deference from other Republican hopefuls and injects excitement into corners of the GOP that crave a new standard-bearer and have quietly debated whether someone like DeSantis, whom Republicans widely consider a new-dand-improved version of Trump, might be more competitive in a general election.\n\n“I don’t think the lack of planning means he’s not actually serious about running. It just means it’s going to be another fly-by-the-seat-of-his-pants sh– show if he does,” said one person close to Trump.\n\nTrump has, of course, taken some steps that are customary for would-be candidates. He has stuck his neck out with high-profile endorsements in key Senate and gubernatorial contests, winning some and losing others. He has built a thriving post-presidential fundraising operation with around $110 million currently in its war chest – topping what both national parties have in the bank. And he has worked to maintain a close relationship with key supporters through periodic campaign rallies and appearances at conservative events. Later this week, he will deliver remarks at the Faith & Freedom Coalition’s annual conference for religious conservatives in Nashville, Tennessee – joining other possible 2024 GOP hopefuls on the speaking roster.\n\nStill, those around Trump who say he is keen on announcing a campaign this year admit that his overall infrastructure is still lacking. One longtime Trump pal also said the former President needs to spend more time beta-testing different messages before throwing his hat in the ring because his false claim that the 2020 election was stolen “is not enough on its own to justify running again.”\n\n“A red wave in November would give him the perfect opportunity to adopt a forward-looking message. He can talk about what Republicans will do to turn the country around now that they have more control and what he would do in a second term to boost those efforts,” this person said.\n\nQuestions about staffing\n\nA key question for allies of the former President is who, exactly, would be involved in his campaign if he announces before the November midterms. That timing would come on the heels of public hearings by the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol that have featured damning testimony from both Trump’s family members and former aides and advisers.\n\nWhile Trump has yet to abandon his practice of consulting a rotating cast of friends, family members and advisers about his political decisions, it is unclear who among his kitchen cabinet would actually commit themselves to another presidential campaign. He has complained, both privately and publicly, about former aides such as Mark Meadows and Kellyanne Conway, who have detailed their experiences in the Trump White House with personal memoirs, and has an increasingly limited number of advisers who are neither profiting off their proximity to him or directly on his payroll – limiting his willingness to trust their intentions.\n\n“He won’t have trouble attracting people if he runs, the trouble will be in who he attracts,” said the former Trump campaign official, who wasn’t ready to commit to working on his 2024 campaign if he runs. “If it resembles anything like 2016 or 2020, there were days when we spent 18 or 19 hours at Trump Tower because of how short-staffed he was. That scares me off a little bit.”\n\nMeanwhile, other former members of Trump’s inner circle have voluntarily created distance.\n\nTrump’s daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner are no longer part of his everyday political operation, said multiple people familiar with the situation, noting that the couple has spent most of the past 18 months focused on their children, settling into the Miami area, and ensuring the success of Kushner’s new investment fund, Affinity Partners.\n\n“I don’t see them being all that involved strategically,” said a second person close to Trump. “Trump trusts [Ivanka] but she’s not knee deep in this like most of his advisers.”\n\nIn fact, in a post to his Truth Social website following the January 6 committee’s first public hearing last week, Trump rebuffed his daughter’s sworn testimony that she believed there was insufficient evidence of fraud in the 2020 election – claiming “she had long since checked out” during the final months of his presidency.\n\nIn the couple’s absence, the former President has been turning more frequently to his son, Donald Trump Jr., for advice on candidate endorsements and messaging.\n\n“Obviously, if he does make an announcement, the Democrat machine will be fully against him, and they will spend so much money trying to knock him out. Once he announces, the negativity will be ramped up, so that’s why it’s important to figure out in advance who is going to be responding to that stuff besides the candidate himself,” the former Trump campaign official said.\n\nBut one current Trump adviser disputed the idea that the former President could be in a precarious position if he launches another presidential campaign later this summer or in the early fall. This adviser pointed to recent campaign finance reports from Trump’s various fundraising committees showing the thousands of dollars he has been spending each month on payroll during his post-presidency.\n\n“In terms of a campaign manager,” the adviser added, “he really doesn’t need one right now.”\n\n“I think [2024] will be decent. Both 2016 and 2020 started very different but got to a place that was really well organized and highly functioning as a campaign operation. He has done this twice now and can put together a pretty good infrastructure” when he wants, the adviser said.\n\nTwo people familiar with the matter said Trump has rented out some off-site office space in Palm Beach, Florida, for those involved in his Save America PAC. And the expectation across his orbit is that any 2024 campaign will be headquartered in Florida, most likely at his current residence.\n\n“Mar-a-Lago will be the campaign HQ and he’ll rent space onsite to the campaign for an exorbitant rate,” said one of the people close to Trump in a nod to the former President’s practice of blurring the lines between his business ventures and political activities.\n\n‘The ball will start rolling’\n\nFor his part, Trump sees his travels for the 2022 midterms and existing fundraising machine as preparation enough for a third presidential run – two steps that leave him ready to announce at a moment’s notice.\n\nBut once the former President settles on an actual announcement date, allies expect he will want to go all in to attract the media attention and shock value his recent campaign rallies have been lacking. That, of course, will take time to plan out.\n\n“There hasn’t been a pick-up-the-phone, ‘We’re doing this by X date,’ conversation yet. Once that happens, the ball will start rolling,” said a third person close to Trump. “What I expect to happen is we will get to mid-summer, and he’ll let a very small group of people know he’s ready and to start organizing without causing too much noise.”\n\nIn the meantime, Trump has been tending to his relationships with top House Republicans – hoping to have an army of MAGA surrogates ready to support him from Capitol Hill if he runs – and working to remain relevant with appearances in 2022 battlegrounds and venues that guarantee him adoring crowds. He will do that Friday when he addresses the audience in Nashville, an appearance he will use to respond to this week’s public hearings by the congressional panel investigating January 6.\n\nThere is one additional consideration Trump has privately discussed with aides and allies as he weighs the timing of a 2024 announcement. The former President remains under investigation in Georgia, where Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has impaneled a special grand jury to determine whether Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in Georgia warrant criminal prosecution. When the grand jury finishes its work, which could take several months, it will issue a report detailing its findings. Two people close to Trump said he is closely monitoring that probe but isn’t treating it as a primary factor in his 2024 decision.\n\n“That is a storyline that could dominate the fall and first quarter of a presidential cycle, so there is a calculation of getting out in front of it,” said one of the people close to Trump.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/31/politics/trump-delaying-2024-decision/index.html", "title": "Trump weighs delaying 2024 decision as political and legal troubles ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nDonald Trump is considering waiting until after the November midterms to launch a third presidential campaign as he navigates a widening array of legal troubles and mounting concerns that some of his hand-picked Senate candidates may be weaker than he once thought, sources familiar with his thinking tell CNN.\n\nAfter months of eyeing Labor Day weekend as the target launch date for a 2024 campaign, Trump has spent the past few weeks backing away from that timeline following the FBI search of his Mar-a-Lago estate and an increased panic among Republicans that the party may not be in for the red wave it has long anticipated this November.\n\nWhile his timeline could shift again between now and November, the onslaught of political and legal concerns has the former President feeling nervous about prematurely diving into the 2024 primary, according to nine former and current Trump aides and allies who requested anonymity to discuss internal matters.\n\nThe arguments from advisers wanting him to take his time with a campaign announcement have varied. Believing he will be the undisputed front-runner regardless of when he announces, some have said that if he launches another White House bid too early, he will run out of money around the time Republicans host their nominating convention, leaving him cash-strapped and vulnerable during the general election.\n\nBetter to address the legal fallout from the FBI search first, other advisers have told Trump and his team.\n\n“Everyone was operating under the assumption that shortly after Labor Day would be the best possible time to launch, but that has changed and he’s being told to deal with the FBI stuff first,” said a Trump adviser.\n\nOtherwise, advisers say, the former President is more likely to be blamed for potential losses in the midterms if he becomes a candidate for president before November and his legal troubles distract from the bread-and-butter issues most Republicans – but especially those running in competitive races – would prefer to focus on.\n\nAs Trump-backed Senate candidates in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Arizona struggle to eclipse their opponents in fundraising and recent polls, a growing number of Trump confidants have shared concerns with him that a pre-midterm announcement would be weaponized by Democrats, who remain eager to distract from inflation and rising crime and are well-versed already in using Trump as a campaign foil.\n\n“There is a direct tie if Trump becomes a campaign ad in November and Republicans lose the Senate, and the last thing he wants is to be blamed,” said a former Trump campaign aide.\n\nTrump himself has started complaining in private about Mehmet Oz’s performance in the Pennsylvania Senate contest and a spate of bad press that Georgia Senate hopeful Herschel Walker generated earlier this summer when it became public that he had fathered several children out of wedlock despite routinely criticizing absentee fathers, this aide said.\n\nIn the days after federal investigators searched his waterfront residence in early August, Trump was inundated with calls from allies urging him to announce his bid for president immediately.\n\n“It was so hot,” said one Trump ally, describing the surging support Trump encountered among both grassroots supporters and top Republicans after he revealed the FBI had searched his home.\n\nBut as the legal battle over records seized during the search continues to play out and new details emerge about the sheer volume of classified records Trump was apparently storing haphazardly at Mar-a-Lago, others in Trump’s orbit have urged him to put any campaign announcement on hold until he addresses his legal woes. The FBI warrant unsealed earlier this month revealed three possible federal crimes as reason for the search: violations of the Espionage Act, obstruction of justice and criminal handling of government records. In a late Tuesday court filing, the Justice Department said documents were “likely concealed and removed” from a storage room at Mar-a-Lago as part of an effort to “obstruct” the FBI’s investigation. Trump, who has not been charged with a crime, has repeatedly denied wrongdoing while boasting that the FBI search has buoyed his 2024 prospects and sent a jolt of energy through his political base.\n\nAnother Trump adviser who had previously pushed for a pre-November campaign announcement has since recanted, joining those who believe that waiting until after the midterms is a more prudent approach.\n\n“There’s no urgency because he’s not going to be outshined by someone else,” said former Trump campaign aide Bryan Lanza, pointing to the crowd of potential 2024 rivals who rushed to Trump’s defense – or lobbed sharp criticism at the Justice Department – after learning that federal investigators had executed a search warrant at his home.\n\n“I personally feel like it’s a sign of weakness if he announces before the midterm,” said Matt Schlapp, a top Trump ally who chairs the American Conservative Union. Trump had previously considered a pre-midterm announcement as one way to clear the field of prospective challengers, something that Schlapp and others now say he no longer needs to worry about.\n\nSome in Trump world still want him to announce now\n\nDespite Trump being counseled by a growing number of advisers to delay his campaign announcement until later this fall or winter, not everyone in his inner circle has been convinced that that’s the right move.\n\nOne source close to Trump dismissed the escalating political and legal concerns as “excuses,” arguing that the former President is already being blamed for the shifting midterm forecast and putting off a presidential campaign launch is unlikely to inoculate him from further criticism among Republicans if the party either fails to win the Senate or disappoints in its overall gains.\n\n“They are going to blame him no matter what, so he should just announce,” this person said.\n\nPeople familiar with Trump’s thinking said he has been more receptive to postponing his campaign announcement until after the midterms in part because of the way Republicans rallied behind him following the FBI search. The former President has recently told allies he doesn’t think he will face a formidable challenger in the 2024 GOP primary, according to three people familiar with his comments, one of whom said Trump has been quick to point out how Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis compared the FBI search to “Banana Republic” tactics. DeSantis is widely expected to be a top primary rival if he runs for the nomination against Trump.\n\n“He’s up to his eyeballs in legal troubles but that hasn’t stopped him from totally relishing this,” said a second person close to the former President, who requested anonymity for fear of retribution.\n\nSo far, the consensus among Republican operatives two years out from the 2024 election is that Trump is unlikely to face a real primary threat even though he is widely expected to field challenges from a handful of GOP hopefuls. Former Vice President Mike Pence, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan are some of the likeliest rivals Trump could face if he does run again.\n\nSchlapp, who believes Trump will indeed attract primary competitors, said none would be “serious in terms of being able to win the nomination.” He added that Trump’s outrage over the FBI search will give him something to tap into if and when he does announce a third presidential campaign.\n\n“Sometimes I think he’s better the more acrimonious he gets,” Schlapp said, claiming that Trump’s early August appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Dallas was a turning point for some Republicans who were previously on the fence about his desire to mount a comeback bid after losing to Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nTwo days before federal investigators conducted their search of Mar-a-Lago, Trump used the speech to complain that he is “always being persecuted.”\n\nOne of the Trump advisers took it a step further, suggesting that an indictment of Trump by the Biden administration “would be beneficial” to the former President at this juncture.\n\n“It would just appear too partisan at this point,” this adviser said.\n\nBiden, who has insisted he had no advance warning of the search, has stressed the independence of the Justice Department. But Trump has frequently taken to his social media platform to blast what he’s called a politically motivated “witch hunt” and railed against the FBI and Biden, including in a frenzy of posts on Truth Social on Tuesday alone.\n\nPrioritizing his legal fights\n\nWhile Trump hasn’t made a firm timing decision yet as he mulls a 2024 bid, his lack of planning for a campaign rollout has signaled to those around him that he wants to bide his time.\n\nUntil adding former Florida Solicitor General Chris Kise to his legal defense team on Tuesday, Trump had been struggling to navigate the legal jeopardy he finds himself in as federal investigators sift through the classified documents they seized from his residence – possibly building a criminal case in the process.\n\nThose around him say Trump appears to be putting his political ambitions on the backburner – if only temporarily – to give his legal team space to operate and strategize without the time constraints that a presidential campaign would demand. The former President has spent the three weeks since the FBI conducted its search at Mar-a-Lago trying to capitalize on the moment politically, while his attorneys have meanwhile struggled to develop a clear strategy. His legal team waited until weeks after the search, for example, to file a so-called special master request for an independent review of the materials taken from his home, which is the subject of a hearing this week.\n\n“Right now, it’s a question of whether he wants to turn everything political or gain some legal stability to make sure everything turns out OK before taking that next step,” said one of the Trump advisers.", "authors": ["Gaborr Kristen Holmes", "Kristen Holmes"], "publish_date": "2022/08/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/politics/susie-wiles-donald-trump-2024-campaign/index.html", "title": "Susie Wiles helped Donald Trump win Florida twice. Now she could ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nSusie Wiles was searching for her next act when Donald Trump came knocking last spring.\n\nPlotting a comeback after his supporters violently stormed the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, was proving to be tougher than the former President had anticipated, and he needed someone to whip his disorderly political operation into shape. Surrounded by advisers who he suspected had only stuck around to make money, Trump began asking close friends who else could be trusted to take on the unenviable task.\n\n“After all the drama of his first term and the election, everyone was enriching themselves through Trump, and he f**king hates that. It became clear after several people mentioned her name that Susie wouldn’t be like that,” said a person close to Trump.\n\nWiles was an intriguing choice from the start. A veteran of Trump’s presidential campaigns, she had already proved her political worth twice over, helping him notch a win in Florida in 2016 and then growing his margin of victory there in 2020. Still, it was a curious move for the optics-obsessed former President to make his top lieutenant a 64-year-old bird-watching, pound cake-baking grandmother, who asked only that her travel expenses be covered when she accepted the position in March 2021.\n\nBut as Trump readies a widely expected 2024 campaign, people in every corner of his orbit – from ardent election deniers to fixtures of the Republican establishment – say Wiles may be the most sensible choice to helm it. CNN spoke with 16 former and current Trump aides and advisers and people close to Wiles for this story, many of whom described her as the consummate professional – someone who has adeptly navigated Trump world’s “Lord of the Flies” factionalism without making enemies, earning the respect of both his youngest aides at Mar-a-Lago and the domineering personalities in his kitchen cabinet.\n\n“Trump world is dynamic and volatile and innovative and ever-changing, and Susie is the rock,” said Florida GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz, who has known Wiles for years.\n\n“The people around him, whether they like Susie or not, all agree that she doesn’t stir up trouble,” said Michael Caputo, a former Trump administration official who is close to both Trump and Wiles.\n\nWiles’ command of Trump’s post-presidential activities – from his midterm travel and 2022 endorsements to fundraising through his various committees – has also landed her praise in Washington, where some Republicans are decidedly less enthusiastic about the prospect of another White House bid by the former President.\n\n“Susie is a supremely talented woman in a male-dominated arena,” said Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel. “Her ability to navigate tough political environments to execute campaign goals and deliver Republican victories is unmatched.”\n\nOf course, there is another theory for Wiles’ meteoric rise through the Trump world ranks. Her complicated history with Ron DeSantis has left some Trump allies with the impression that she could be an asset if Trump finds himself in an unexpectedly competitive 2024 primary against the popular Florida governor.\n\nWiles once served as a top adviser to DeSantis, but she was abruptly ousted from his inner circle in 2019 amid rising tensions between the duo and was then let go from Trump’s campaign operation at the governor’s behest. She was later reinstated.\n\n“I’ve never heard her bash on DeSantis in a ruthless way, but I think she is very aware that he was intimately involved in [her] getting bounced from the 2020 campaign,” said a current Trump adviser.\n\nAt the very least, it was enough to create a lasting fissure in their relationship, which several well-placed sources said is virtually nonexistent nowadays. But some believe Wiles’ familiarity with DeSantis – especially his potential weaknesses as a candidate – could also be useful in the future.\n\n“I don’t think President Trump would have won Florida in 2016 without Susie Wiles, and she was instrumental in Ron DeSantis’ victory [as governor] in 2018. They would both benefit from having Susie involved in a 2024 campaign,” said David Bossie, a longtime Trump friend and adviser.\n\n“No doubt” she would be more loyal to Trump in a primary, said Caputo. “She is as steadfast as they come, and I think the President understands that in Susie Wiles, he has competency and loyalty in levels that are very beneficial to him.”\n\nA Trump spokesman and Wiles separately declined to provide comment for this story.\n\nA longtime fixture in Trump world\n\nTo be widely respected in Trump’s orbit is no small feat. Before Wiles became the former President’s de facto chief of staff, four men held the title in some capacity during his presidency. One was fired via Twitter, two have become high-profile critics of their former boss and the last one may be in serious legal jeopardy amid revelations by the House panel investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection.\n\nWiles would never introduce herself as Trump’s chief of staff, preferring to think of herself as a trusted adviser, but nearly everyone in his inner circle sees her as such, including his adult children, according to people familiar with their thinking.\n\n“She’s probably his longest-serving adviser now. Anytime I’ve gone [to see Trump], she’s either there or she’s just left,” said Carlos Trujillo, a Florida-based lobbyist who served as ambassador to the Organization of American States during the Trump administration.\n\nNot a golfer herself, Wiles spends most of her time with Trump huddling in offices at his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf club or Mar-a-Lago resort. People who speak to Trump regularly said he will often pause phone conversations to loop in Wiles, that alone being a supreme testament to her value. Last week, Wiles was seated to the right of Trump during a meeting at Bedminster with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, according to a photo posted by Orban’s spokesman.\n\n“‘It’s always, ‘Let me get Susie in here’ or ‘Make sure you tell Susie about that,’” said Caputo.\n\nBut if she needs to get something to Trump without delay, she has been known to make an appearance on the green as well. “She’ll jump in a cart herself and drive down to Trump if she needs to get something in front of him,” said one of the Trump advisers.\n\nUnlike Trump’s previous gatekeepers, Wiles doesn’t closely monitor whom he speaks with, according to several people familiar with the matter. Nor does she actively try to prevent contact with figures on the fringe, these people said. That includes a rotating cast of characters who indulge Trump’s obsession with the 2020 election or periodically introduce him to far-fledged conspiracy theories of their own. Wiles’ own view of whether the election was stolen is less clear-cut than her boss’, according to multiple people familiar with her thinking.\n\n“I don’t think she believes the election was stolen,” said a person close to Wiles. “She thinks we got beat by … not doing a good enough job of stopping states in the regulatory aspects of the election and that Democrats were smart and ruthless in using the Covid-19 pandemic to their advantage.”\n\nWiles “carefully rides the tent,” said Caputo. “She has to interact with people who think [the election was stolen], and people who don’t.” Several Trump advisers who were directly involved in organizing the “Stop the Steal” rally on January 6 or who assisted in his efforts to overturn the 2020 election have drawn intense scrutiny from the House select committee investigating the riot at the US Capitol. Wiles has not been asked to testify before the panel, a source familiar with the matter told CNN, nor has she been subpoenaed to testify in other ongoing inquiries related to election interference.\n\nSome of those allies are on weekly calls that Wiles holds with Trump’s political team, when she and his coterie of paid advisers discuss primaries on the horizon and how Trump-backed candidates are faring. More recently, she has been involved in conversations about how Trump can best position himself for a third presidential campaign. Wiles “touches everything,” as one Trump adviser described her role.\n\nOver time, these calls have endeared Wiles to the rest of Trump’s team. She will take time to praise aides and advisers by name for contributing savvy ideas and ensures everyone stays up-to-date on Trump’s upcoming travel, said people familiar with the calls. But she will also confront failures head on.\n\n“Susie is so sweet that everybody wants to please her – and maybe that’s part of her shrewdness – but when she has to discipline the motley crew that is Trump world, she doesn’t think twice about it,” said one of the people close to Trump.\n\nAbove all, it is Wiles’ competency and the former President’s belief that she isn’t profiting off him that set her apart, according to some of the longest-lasting faces inside Trump’s circle.\n\nAs one Democratic strategist in Florida put it: “If I was running for president, I would want Susie Wiles.”\n\nMaking her mark in GOP politics\n\nWiles has built a reputation for delivering hard truths to powerful men. Some of the most difficult words she’s had to share were with her father, the late sportscaster Pat Summerall, during a 1992 intervention to confront his alcoholism.\n\n“Dad, the few times we’ve been out in public together recently, I’ve been ashamed we shared the same last name,” Wiles said in a letter that was read during the intervention, according to Summerall’s 2006 autobiography. The words made his knees buckle, Summerall wrote. Only after hearing from Wiles did the former NFL kicker and legendary broadcaster agree to enter the Betty Ford Center for treatment.\n\nBy then, Wiles had already kick-started a successful path into politics. It wasn’t campus activism, Ronald Reagan, or a seminal moment that drew her in. The hypercompetitive political arena had simply felt like a natural fit for Wiles, who had grown up with two brothers in addition to being the only daughter of a professional athlete. In 1979, she was hired as an assistant for US Rep. Jack Kemp, an ex-teammate of Summerall’s on the New York Giants. Next, she jumped aboard Reagan’s 1980 presidential campaign as a scheduler.\n\nAfter a few years in the Reagan administration, Wiles launched a consulting career in her native northeast Florida. She soon became a power player in Duval County, along with her then-husband Lanny Wiles, who was also active in Florida Republican politics (the two later divorced in 2017). There, she ran the district office for US Rep. Tillie Fowler, a Republican, before advising successive Jacksonville mayors, while raising two daughters.\n\n“I have rarely met someone with her instincts for politics and policy and where they intersect,” said John Delaney, the first of those mayors, who leaned on Wiles to sell voters on a multibillion-dollar tax increase to modernize the city. “She knows what to magnify that will resonate with the public.”\n\nAfter two decades in and around Jacksonville City Hall, Wiles in 2010 was asked to meet with a former health care executive named Rick Scott. A political novice and awkward public speaker, Scott had launched an eleventh-hour, self-funded GOP bid for Florida governor against state Attorney General Bill McCollum, a heavy favorite with support from most Republicans.\n\n“We told her, ‘Hey, we got a guy nobody knows, we’re behind by 50 points, come join us,’” said Curt Anderson, a top strategist on the Scott campaign. “She was able to immediately come in and bring a level of organization that kept people on task.”\n\nWith her candidate’s fortune at her disposal, Wiles engineered an upset over McCollum and the GOP establishment. Scott then managed a narrow victory in the general election. (He is now the state’s junior US senator.)\n\nAnderson recalled that before they pulled off Scott’s 2010 win, Republican operatives had warned Wiles and the campaign’s other advisers, “You’ll regret this, and you’ll never work in politics again.” So when Wiles later linked up with Trump – joining a campaign that her peers considered doomed – she was entering familiar territory.\n\nThe two first met during a Trump Tower rendezvous arranged by Wiles’ then-boss, lobbyist and fundraiser Brian Ballard. At the time, most of Florida’s political class had sided with native sons Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio in the GOP presidential primary. Wiles, herself, didn’t come across as a Trump-type. She had helmed the fleeting 2012 presidential campaign of Jon Huntsman, whose high-road approach to politics was antithetical to Trump, and then helped Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign in Florida that year.\n\nTim Miller, who advised Huntsman’s campaign, said it was “bizarre” to watch Wiles align with Trump.\n\n“We were running a campaign on modernizing the Republican Party, and running on climate change and being decent to immigrants,” said Miller, a vocal critic of the GOP’s embrace of Trump. “You can’t think of a campaign further from the Donald Trump campaign than the Huntsman campaign.”\n\nBut Wiles felt the party needed a jolt from the outside. The two clicked, though Trump at first was unconvinced his campaign needed a full-time person in Florida.\n\nThat changed after Trump secured the nomination. Dissatisfied with his top Florida strategist Karen Giorno, Trump was convinced by advisers in September 2016 to consider adding Wiles to his campaign instead.\n\n“Susie was brought in to run battleground communications for us in a new role as the campaign was expanding,” said Bossie, who was then serving as his deputy campaign manager.\n\nAt first, Wiles was not a good fit with Trump’s style. “He likes someone who can command a room and fit the role he sees in his mind, and here’s this gray-haired matronly figure,” a source told CNN. “She’s not the one who is plucked out of central casting.”\n\nThe tension erupted in the final weeks of the race after a fundraiser at his Doral golf course, when Trump, convinced he was going to lose Florida and blaming his campaign team on the ground, unloaded on Wiles during a late-night meeting, according to three sources with knowledge of the incident. Wiles wondered if she should quit, one source said, and he considered letting her go just 10 days before the election.\n\n“In her words, it was a way she had never been spoken to in her life,” said a person close to both Wiles and Trump.\n\nBut Trump’s eventual victory in Florida earned Wiles a reputation as a talented fixer and Sunshine State savant. So in 2018, when Trump’s hand-picked choice for Florida governor – DeSantis, then a former congressman – was struggling in the campaign home stretch, Wiles was once again asked to take charge. With her in command, DeSantis eked out a 32,000-vote victory, the closest election for governor in state history.\n\nNot long after, the problems started.\n\nA public fallout\n\nDeSantis entered office a relative stranger to Tallahassee and the insular world of Florida state government. To guide his transition, he tapped Wiles, who also ran his political operation, and Gaetz, a former state lawmaker before he was elected to Congress and whose father had reigned as a powerful state Senate president. Together, Wiles and Gaetz built DeSantis an administration, interviewing potential department heads from her home in Ponte Vedra Beach, where they killed time watching birds in the estuary off her backyard, Gaetz said.\n\nDeSantis jumped out to a fast start, gaining national attention for his governing style while raising money at an impressive clip. But behind the scenes, a gulf emerged between him and Wiles. A person close to DeSantis said the governor’s wife, Casey, an influential voice in his orbit, privately questioned whether Wiles was more loyal to Ballard’s lobbying clients, and the couple grew skeptical of the allegiances of people she had hired. They purged staffers they viewed as too close to Wiles and marginalized her role in his political operation.\n\nThen came a revelation, outlined in internal memos published by the Tampa Bay Times in September 2019, that DeSantis’ political committee had planned to sell access to the governor to donors, including $100,000 to privately golf with him or $250,000 for an intimate gathering. Wiles had authored one of the memos, which made clear DeSantis and his wife approved the fundraising plan. DeSantis placed the blame on Wiles and cut her out of his circle, though he never explained to her why, a source said.\n\nTrump then removed Wiles from his reelection team at DeSantis’ urging, multiple sources confirmed. She stepped away from Ballard Partners, citing health issues.\n\nIn a matter of days, the most successful political operative in Florida was out of work.\n\n“It was tough for her both personally and professionally,” Delaney said.\n\nCaputo, the Trump adviser, called it a “terrible mistake” by DeSantis to let Wiles go. A source who worked for the governor remarked in 2019 to a reporter now with CNN: “How do you kick Susie Wiles out of your inner circle if you want to become President of the US?\n\nWiles remained on the sidelines until the summer of 2020, when Trump saw polling that suggested he was in trouble of losing Florida to Joe Biden. Several people lobbied for Trump to bring back Wiles, and he began floating the idea in conversations. Bossie tried to get DeSantis onboard, but the governor loudly argued against her rehiring. Meanwhile, Ike Perlmutter, the billionaire Republican donor who owns a home near Mar-a-Lago, sided with DeSantis and strongly pushed Trump to reconsider multiple times, sources familiar with those conversations told CNN. But Trump had made up his mind.\n\n“Trump basically said Susie running his 2020 Florida operation was the right answer. He first asked, ‘What do you think if we do this?’ and then the conversation went to Trump basically saying, ‘We are doing this,’” recalled a source familiar with Trump and Perlmutter’s conversations.\n\nA spokesman for the DeSantis campaign did not respond to a request for comment about the governor’s relationship with Wiles. Several Florida political insiders declined to speak to CNN about the DeSantis-Wiles saga on the record, citing concerns that they or their clients could face retribution from the governor.\n\nWiles’ return to Florida was a “game-changer,” said one source familiar with operations there. Trump gave her tremendous latitude to run his Florida operation, including resources to target voters who were not traditionally Republican, such as Latinos, school choice parents in the Black community and Jewish residents in Democratic strongholds. In Florida, Democrats traditionally had an advantage during early voting on Sundays, when Black churches organized “Souls to the Polls” voter drives. Trump’s Florida team started “Believers and Ballots” to get White Christians from church to early voting sites and saw strong returns.\n\nOne GOP operative in Florida said, “We were the only state that got exactly what we asked for from Trump. And that was all [Wiles].”\n\nIn the end, while Trump narrowly lost most swing states, he won Florida by a healthy 4-point margin.\n\n“She’s like the political Muhammad Ali,” said state Sen. Joe Gruters, chairman of the Florida GOP. “That’s why the President trusts her and works with her on the basis that he has already and probably will in the future.”\n\nA ‘difficult campaign’ ahead\n\nWith Trump and DeSantis potentially headed for a 2024 collision, some Republicans close to both men believe Wiles could be an X factor for Trump. She knows better than most DeSantis’ strengths and where his vulnerabilities lie, and she has developed a deep loyalty to Trump, people close to her say.\n\nWiles also has a record of unexpected victories she will want to preserve if she accepts a senior role in another Trump campaign, which could be markedly difficult due to his age, mounting legal troubles, and an emerging push by prominent Republican leaders for a crowded GOP primary. Justice Department officials are currently investigating Trump’s actions leading up to January 6 as part of its criminal probe of efforts to subvert the 2020 election outcome, while there’s a separate investigation in Georgia into possible criminal meddling in the state’s election results by the former President.\n\n“This will probably be one of her final acts in the political world,” said one of Trump’s advisers.\n\n“It’s going to be a difficult campaign no matter what anybody says,” added Caputo. “[Trump] will need 25 Susie Wiles.”\n\nWhile some Trump allies fear DeSantis could become another roadblock to the former President’s quest for a second term, Wiles, in her conversations with people inside Trump’s orbit, has downplayed the role she could play. She is known to say, “You run your race” – a mantra for focusing on your own campaign and not the other team – and is dismissive when asked by allies about the status of her relationship with the Florida governor.\n\n“I’m sure she knows some things that Ron wouldn’t want to have to deal with, but she is smart and knows her credibility is on the line, so she won’t go out there peddling rumor and innuendo,” said one of the people close to Wiles.\n\nStill, Wiles and DeSantis are not on speaking terms. DeSantis will attempt to win reelection this fall without Wiles on his team, though few expect him to need her.\n\nAt Mar-a-Lago, however, Wiles is seen as indispensable. Even in the cutthroat environment Trump has cultivated around him, where unanimity is rare, his closest aides and advisers regard Wiles as a steady hand in one of the most tumultuous periods of his political career.\n\n“Out of all the people who have led his political operation, she has by far done the best job, and I don’t know that it’s particularly close in a lot of ways,” said one of the current Trump advisers.\n\nIt would seem, then, that Wiles would be an obvious choice to run Trump’s next campaign should he choose to pursue that path. But the most predictable thing about Trump is that he loves to be unpredictable.\n\n“Would I predict that she would run it? Yes,” said a source close to Trump. “Would it shock me if she got fired tomorrow? No. That’s just Trump world.”", "authors": ["Gaborr Steve Contorno", "Steve Contorno"], "publish_date": "2022/08/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/14/politics/katie-hobbs-arizona-governors-race/index.html", "title": "Katie Hobbs will win Arizona governor's race, CNN projects ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nDemocrat Katie Hobbs will win Arizona’s governor’s race, CNN projects, defeating one of the most prominent defenders of former President Donald Trump’s lies about the 2020 election.\n\nCalling the 2020 election rigged, Republican Kari Lake had repeatedly said she would not have certified Joe Biden’s win in Arizona in 2020. Hobbs, as Arizona’s secretary of state, had rejected GOP lies about the election.\n\nLake’s defeat follows the defeat of two other high-profile election deniers in the state – Republican Senate nominee Blake Masters and secretary of state nominee Mark Finchem.\n\n“Democracy is worth the wait,” Hobbs tweeted after the race was called Monday night. “Thank you, Arizona. I am so honored and so proud to be your next Governor.”\n\nLake did not acknowledge Hobbs’ victory, instead tweeting, “Arizonans know BS when they see it.”\n\nThe Republican nominee had already begun sowing doubts about the 2022 results. During an appearance on Fox News Monday before the race was called, Lake baselessly called the election “botched.”\n\n“I don’t believe that people of Arizona would vote for her and that she would win. But if that’s what happens at the end of the day, how could you certify an election that is this botched?” Lake said.\n\nDuring an appearance on right-wing activist Charlie Kirk’s talk show Thursday, she said, “I hate that they’re slow-rolling and dragging their feet and delaying the inevitable. They don’t want to put out the truth, which is that we won.”\n\nThere is no evidence that the election officials were delaying the reporting of results. At a news conference Thursday, Bill Gates, chairman of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, called out Lake’s comments. “It is offensive for Kari Lake to say that these people behind me are slow-rolling this when they are working 14-18 hours,” Gates, a Republican, said, gesturing to the election workers who were involved in tallying the ballots behind him through a glass window.\n\nLake had continued to stoke questions about the vote tabulation and Hobbs’ eventual role in certifying the vote as secretary of state hours before the race was projected for Hobbs. “Shouldn’t election officials be impartial,” Lake tweeted, a reference to the office that Hobbs holds. “The guys running the Election have made it their mission to defeat America First Republicans. Unbelievable.”\n\nArizona Assistant Secretary of State Allie Bones refuted Lake’s suggestion that Hobbs should recuse herself from overseeing the election. In an interview with CNN Monday night, she noted that Arizona elections are “highly decentralized” and the “counties are responsible for administering the elections and tabulating the votes.”\n\nWhen pressed by CNN’s John King about exactly what the Arizona secretary of state’s role is in certifying the election, Bones said the process has worked the same way for years: all 15 counties will report their results to the secretary of state’s office, then the secretary’s office compiles those results and puts together the state-wide canvass. At that point “the secretary does sign off on that,” Bones said, but the governor, the attorney general and the chief justice of the state Supreme Court will also sign off on those final results.\n\nLake, a former news anchor at Fox 10 in Phoenix, ascended quickly to become one of the most prominent Republicans in the 2022 cycle as she and Hobbs vied to replace term-limited Republican Gov. Doug Ducey. The outgoing governor had endorsed Lake’s primary opponent, but then backed Lake in the general election.\n\nHobbs, a former social worker who worked with victims of domestic violence before becoming a state lawmaker, ran a far more low-key and understated campaign, limiting her access to reporters and holding small, intimate events with supporters. She made democracy and abortion rights her central focus, portraying Lake as an “extreme” and “dangerous” figure who could jeopardize the sanctity of the 2024 presidential election by refusing to certify the results.\n\nShe had help in the latter effort from GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, whose political action committee put $500,000 behind an ad urging Arizona voters to reject Lake and Finchem. Lake subsequently posted a sarcastic letter on Twitter thanking Cheney for her “in-kind contribution” – claiming the ad was actually helping her campaign. On Monday night when the race was called for Hobbs, Cheney responded to Lake’s October 28 tweet with a simple retort: “You’re welcome.”\n\nBarrett Marson, an Arizona GOP consultant who worked for Masters during the Senate primary, spoke to the wisdom of following Trump Monday night. “It’s over. The only thing Kari Lake should do now is graciously concede. This election tells us one thing: following Trump over the cliff will not win elections.”\n\nLake hewed closely to the Trump playbook on more than just the 2020 election. She promised to declare an “invasion” at the border – in what she described as an effort to amass greater power for the governor’s office to address the migrant crisis – and she called for the arrest of both of Dr. Anthony Fauci and her Democratic opponent.\n\nBefore announcing her bid, Lake left her anchor job in 2021 – stating that she didn’t like the direction that journalism was going – after becoming a household name in Phoenix. In one of her campaign videos, she said she was taking a sledgehammer to “leftist lies and propaganda,” as she destroyed television sets with the tool in stiletto boots.\n\nShe dispatched her primary opponents with her forceful denunciations of Democratic leaders’ handling of the Covid-19 pandemic – blasting restrictions like masking as unnecessary and harmful to children. She welcomed comparisons to Trump all the way through the end of the campaign – professing at one event that she was delighted when one admirer called her “Trump in a dress.”\n\nLake had painted Hobbs as a coward after Hobbs refused to debate her opponent this fall. Hobbs’ campaign argued that a debate with Lake “would only lead to constant interruptions, pointless distractions, and childish name-calling.”\n\nHobbs noted in an interview with CNN that Lake had repeatedly called for her arrest and said that her rhetoric had led to “violent threats and harassment against me.” Lake, in turn, portrayed her opponent’s answers as weakness, arguing that if Hobbs wouldn’t agree to debate her, “she can’t stand up against the cartels.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Maeve Reston"], "publish_date": "2022/11/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/13/politics/cnn-poll-biden-trump-2024/index.html", "title": "CNN Poll: Neither Biden nor Trump has their party's full support for a ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA significant number of both Democrats and Republicans currently hope to see their parties find alternatives to President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump in the next presidential election, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS. But very few have specific candidates in mind, underscoring how distant – and potentially mutable – the 2024 race remains.\n\nThe survey, conducted in January and February, found that 45% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters wanted to see the party renominate Biden in 2024, while 51% preferred a different candidate. There’s more support in the party for Biden among voters 45 and older (52% of whom want to see him as the nominee again), voters of color (55%) and voters without a college degree (51%). There’s also a gap between the 48% of self-identified Democrats who want to see Biden renominated and the third of Democratic-leaning independents who felt the same. The 2024 support for Biden is concentrated among his most ardent backers in the party. While 70% of Democratic voters who strongly approve of the way he’s handling the job said they’d like to see him renominated, that drops to just 35% among Democrats who said they approve moderately.\n\nAcross the aisle, Republican and Republican-leaning voters are about evenly split between wanting their party to nominate Trump again (50%) or wanting a different candidate (49%). A majority of Republicans (54%) favored Trump, compared with 38% of Republican-leaning independents. Continued support for the former president within the GOP is also particularly strong among White voters without a college degree (60%) and those who falsely claim Biden’s 2020 victory was illegitimate (64%).\n\nThe next presidential primaries are, of course, almost two years away, and these poll findings are no prediction of what the nomination process will look like then. What they do provide is a glimpse of the current state of the parties: Both are divided over whether to rally behind their current flagbearers, but neither has anointed an alternative as yet.\n\nThe numbers for both Biden and Trump look tepid compared with past poll results on a similar question. In March 2010, nearly 8 in 10 Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters said they wanted the party to renominate Barack Obama (79%). And in March 2018, Republican and Republican-leaning voters were solidly behind Trump’s renomination (77%).\n\nBut the new poll also suggests that the hesitance over both Biden and Trump stems more from electability and other concerns than because their partisans don’t want them to be president.\n\nOf those Democratic-aligned voters hoping to see Biden replaced on the ticket, 31% said it was because they didn’t want him to be reelected. Thirty-five percent said it was mostly because they doubted Biden’s ability to win against a Republican candidate, and the rest offered up other reasons for wanting to switch up the ticket – the most common (19%) being concerns about Biden’s age. (Biden will turn 82 in November 2024.)\n\nDemocratic-aligned voters also aren’t yet gravitating en masse toward any specific alternatives: Only 12% of all Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters wanted to see a nominee who isn’t Biden and had a specific alternative in mind. No individual candidate was named by more than 5% of those who didn’t want Biden atop the ticket.\n\nOn the Republican side, only 39% of those hoping Trump isn’t on the ticket said it’s specifically because they don’t want to see him as president again. Twenty-two percent said they doubted Trump could win against the Democrats, while 38% had other reasons, including wanting a fresher candidate (9%) or someone less polarizing (7%), or due to concerns over Trump’s personality (6%).\n\nJust 19% of all Republican-aligned voters had a preferred alternative to Trump in mind, the CNN Poll found, while 29% picked “just someone besides Trump.” But among those looking for alternatives to Trump, one name stood out: 21% of those voters mentioned Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, with no other potential candidate getting more than 1%.\n\nEven this early, Americans were more likely to say they were looking forward to the next presidential election (58%) than dreading it (41%). But there’s a notable partisan divide: 81% of GOP-aligned respondents, but just 44% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, said they were looking forward to 2024.\n\nThe CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS January 10 through February 6 among a random national sample of 1,527 adults initially reached by mail, and is the second survey CNN has conducted using this methodology.

He said Republicans will likely win control of the U.S. House, but did not mention that their margin may be less than a half-dozen seats – much smaller that Trump and the Republican had hoped.\n\nHe acknowledged that the GOP lost ground in the Senate, but added that \"we cannot lose hope.\"\n\nWhat Trump did not mention: A rising number of party members have blamed those losses on him, and suggested that he step aside for 2024.\n\nTrump did not heed that advice.\n\n\"We will not stop,\" he said.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nDo Republicans have to nominate Trump in 2024? What to know\n\nPolitical parties often nominate the incumbent president for reelection if the leader is a member of their party. For example, after Trump won the 2016 presidential election, he was easily nominated by the Republican Party in 2020. And after former President Barack Obama won the 2008 race for the White House, he was nominated by the Democratic Party in the 2012 presidential election.\n\nBut does a political party have to nominate a person because they are currently serving as president – or because they previously served as president?

John Cornyn, R-Tex., told reporters that \"anybody can run\" and that the \"world has changed considerably\" in recent weeks. Cornyn said he doesn't think Trump will be \"the only one who will run for president in 2024 and I’ll support the Republican nominee. But I don't know that it will be him.\"\n\nSeveral Republicans, including long-time allies like former spokesperson Kayleigh McEnany, had urged Trump to delay his announcement, at least until after a Dec. 6 Senate runoff in Georgia. Trump refused.\n\n-- David Jackson\n\nTrump talk: Do Republicans think Donald Trump will just go quietly? HAH! Good luck with that.\n\nSpeaking right before Trump: Biden\n\nThe real word intruded on Trump's big announcement: Minutes before he took the stage at Mar-a-Lago, President Joe Biden spoke in Bali about a missile landing in Poland.\n\nSpeaking from the site of a G-20 economic conference, Biden said the U.S. will support Poland's investigation into the and suspicions that Russia is involved.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nThe push for DeSantis\n\nAn unprecedented race by nature is unpredictable, but one thing seems fairly certain: DeSantis will play a large role, one way or another.\n\nA number of Republicans are pushing DeSantis to run against Trump, citing his success winning reelection last week as opposed to Trump's failures.\n\nThe conservative Club For Growth, an anti-tax organization, put out polls showing DeSantis winning one-on-one contests against Trump in Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two states to hold Republican delegate contests in the 2024 nomination race. Club-sponsored polls also showed DeSantis ahead of Trump in Florida and Georgia.\n\nDavid McIntosh, president of the Club For Growth's political arm, said the polling shows that \"Republican primary voters recognize Trump’s insults against Republicans as hollow and counterproductive, and it’s taking a significant toll on his support.\"\n\nMcIntosh and Trump clashed over strategy and candidates at points during the 2022 midterm campaign.\n\n-- David Jackson\n\nTrump is still in a strong position\n\nDespite the recent negativity, some Republicans pointed out that Trump remains in a strong position for 2024; he still has a significant conservative base and would be hard to beat in a Republican primary.\n\nTrump has been down before – especially after the insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021 – and bounced back with the help of GOP acolytes.\n\nBrendan Buck, a former spokesperson for 2012 Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan, said he would love to see a \"new face\" for the party but is \"skeptical\" that a Trump challenger could prevail.\n\nEven if DeSantis or someone else could somehow topple Trump, the new GOP leader would still have to face a vindictive ex-president more than willing to tear down the party, or even run as an independent, Buck said.\n\n\"What then are the chances Trump wouldn’t entirely sabotage that person in the general election?\" Buck said.\n\n-- David Jackson\n\nWeekend presidential cattle call\n\nDeSantis is not the only potential Trump challenger, and an entire group will be on display this weekend in Las Vegas.\n\nTrump's own vice president, Mike Pence, is also thinking about taking the plunge.

That probe included a search of his Mar-a-Lago, the site of Tuesday's announcement.\n\nTrump has denied wrongdoing and has called the investigations politically motivated.\n\nSince 2021, Trump has faced legal scrutiny in at least six independent federal and state inquiries that are both criminal and civil in nature.

The Campaign Legal Center alleges that Trump’s financing is “well in excess” of this threshold.\n\n“He never stopped running in a sense because he never stopped raising money,” Saurav Ghosh, the Campaign Legal Center’s director for federal reform told USA TODAY. “It just became a legal problem when he thought up a way that he could use that war chest to give him a jump start on 2024. Unfortunately the law doesn’t allow that.”\n\nGhosh said it is not likely that the FEC — a commission of three Republicans and three Democrats that often deadlocks on contentious issues — is likely to penalize Trump.\n\n-- Erin Mansfield\n\nSen. Tuberville on Trump’s potential presidential bid\n\nWhen asked about former President Donald Trump’s planned announcement Tuesday evening, Republican Sen.

Don’t be fooled by @RonDeSantisFL, he is more extreme, radical and dangerous than the other Florida resident.\"\n\nFried also had a message for Trump, who has referred to the governor as 'Ron DeSanctimonious:' \"Oh & Donald, I had a better nickname for him 'tater'. He didn’t like that!\"\n\nBiden told reporters he looked forward to a Trump-DeSantis match-up – \"it'd be fun watching them take on each other\" – and long said he wouldn't mind a re-match with Trump.\n\nAs far back as March, Biden said: \"I'd be very fortunate if I had that same man running against me.\"\n\n-- David Jackson", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/21/politics/trump-kevin-mccarthy-mike-pence/index.html", "title": "Frustrated with January 6 hearings, Trump turns ire toward his allies", "text": "CNN —\n\nDonald Trump is growing increasingly irritated with the House panel investigating the January 6, 2021, riot as it lifts the curtain on some of its findings with public hearings that have garnered gavel-to-gavel cable coverage – much to the annoyance of the TV-obsessed former President.\n\nTucked away at his Bedminster golf club, Trump has spent the past week venting his frustrations ​to nearly anyone who will listen. He has also taken his complaints about the committee on the road, lashing out at the congressional panel during a speech to conservatives in Nashville last Friday.\n\n“I don’t understand why Kevin didn’t put anyone on the committee,” Trump ​has recently ​griped to those around him, according to a GOP source with direct knowledge of the comments – a reference to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s decision to boycott the select committee after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejected two ​Republican members he originally chose to sit on the panel.\n\nTrump’s growing frustration with the absence of any hard core supporters on the select committee – which has given the panel uninterrupted air time and deprived Republicans of the ability to cross-examine witnesses ​in real time – is just the latest example of how the public hearings have gotten under his skin.​ The former President has previously complained about his lack of allies on the committee, though he has become especially exasperated over the last week with his inability to preemptively respond to the committee’s findings without knowing what the panel plans to reveal during each hearing.\n\nTrump has also publicly and privately lashed out at former Vice President Mike Pence, whose chief of staff Marc Short and ​former top White House lawyer Greg Jacob have ​both been featured prominently in the select committee hearings, put​ting an unflattering spotlight on ​the pressure campaign ​Trump directed at Pence and others as he desperately attempted to stay in power.\n\nAnd while Trump has been pleased by the counter-programming effort being waged by his Capitol Hill allies in conservative media and on social media, he has still felt the need to take matters into his own hands​. He reacted to the committee’s first prime-time hearing earlier this month with a lengthy 12-page rebuttal bashing the probe into the deadly Capitol riot ​and devoted much of his 90-minute appearance at the Faith & Freedom Coalition’s Road to Majority conference last week to slamming Pence and the committee’s two Republican members – Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois.\n\nAs the former President contemplates launching another presidential bid – potentially before the midterm elections –​ ​he has also become hyper-sensitive to how the hearings are ​being received by viewers and voters alike, according to multiple Republicans close to Trump. The stakes are high: the investigation could not only cast Pence, one of his potential 2024 rivals, in a positive light as investigators underscore the former vice president’s role in preventing a constitutional crisis, but it could also foreshadow potential legal trouble for Trump, ​who is already grappling with multiple legal battles unrelated to his role in January 6. ​\n\nStuck in this high pressure atmosphere, Trump has started to direct his anger at people both inside and outside his orbit, from McCarthy ​and Pence to his former chief of staff Mark Meadows ​and Attorney General Bill Barr.\n\n‘We have no representation on this panel’\n\nOne of Trump’s chief complaints as of late has centered on the lack of Republican representation on the committee – Cheney and Kinzinger, who were both appointed by Pelosi, are ardent Trump critics. McCarthy chose five Republicans for the panel, but Pelosi, in an unprecedented move, vetoed Reps. Jim Banks of Indiana and Jim Jordan of Ohio from serving on the committee since they supported efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nNot only has Trump privately vented about McCarthy opting to withdraw his remaining picks for the panel, but Trump also took that grievance public in a recent radio interview, though he did not mention McCarthy by name.\n\n“Unfortunately, a bad decision was made,” Trump told conservative talk show host Wayne Allyn Root. “This committee was a bad decision, not to have representation on that committee. That was a very, very foolish decision because you know, they try and pretend like they’re legit, and only when you get into the inner workings you say, ‘what kind of a thing is this? it’s just a one-sided witch hunt.’”\n\n“We have no representation on this panel. We should certainly have some Republicans, real Republicans … We have nobody on that panel who can fight back,” Trump said earlier in the interview. “In a way, the Republicans should be ashamed of themselves.”\n\nThe thinking among some of Trump’s advisers – and even among a handful of far-right Republicans on Capitol Hill – is that it was a mistake to not have any GOP lawmakers inside the room pushing back in real time ​or providing insight to the former President and rest of the GOP conference as to what investigators planned to highlight in public hearings. Had Republicans been on the committee, they could have asked tough questions of witnesses, made procedural motions to disrupt the flow of the hearings, and would have had some advance knowledge of the subpoenas, taped depositions​ and other evidence collected by the panel.\n\nCNN previously reported that Trump was caught off guard by seeing his daughter, Ivanka Trump,​ and his son-in-law Jared Kushner appear in a video clip during the first televised hearing, even though he knew ​they had both spoken with the committee. ​The former President complained to aides at the time that his daughter’s testimony was taken out of context and deliberately included to embarrass him, according to a person close to Trump.\n\nSome Republicans have also questioned whether a bipartisan commission to investigate January 6 would have been a better outcome for Trump and the GOP. At McCarthy’s direction, GOP Rep. John Katko of New York hammered out a deal on a commission that would have required both parties to agree on subpoenas, forced the commission to finish up its work by the end of last year, and prevented any current politicians from serving on the investigative body.\n\nBut McCarthy and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell both opposed the commission, which ended up failing in the Senate and led Pelosi to establish a select committee instead.\n\nOne GOP source called the move a “tactical error.”\n\nJordan, however, defended McCarthy’s decision-making and said the GOP leader had no choice but to boycott the select committee after what Pelosi did. After McCarthy made the decision, Republicans on Capitol Hill were quick to rally around the move. And McCarthy used the moment as a political opportunity to paint the investigation as a one-sided witch hunt, which has become the GOP’s primary talking point.\n\n“Pelosi knew, when she wouldn’t let the selections of the leader on the committee, she knew Kevin had no other choice,” Jordan told CNN. “You’re doing something that hasn’t been done in the history of the country, and we’re just supposed to go along with it? No.”\n\nStill, even if most of the GOP has no regrets about McCarthy deciding to yank his remaining Republican picks from the committee, it could be problematic that Trump is second guessing McCarthy, who needs the former President’s support to become speaker one day.\n\nAnd in the conservative radio interview, Trump went out of his way to make clear that he has only endorsed McCarthy for reelection ​but not for speaker, a position McCarthy has long had his sights on and is expected to seek if Republicans retake the House this November. People close to Trump, who wants House Republicans to aggressively investigate President Joe Biden if they find themselves in power, say he has intentionally withheld a speakership endorsement to maintain leverage further down the road.\n\n“No, no, no. I haven’t,” Trump said, when the talk show host suggested he had endorsed McCarthy for speaker. “No, I endorsed him in his race. But I haven’t endorsed anybody for speaker.”\n\n‘I don’t see him letting up on Mike anytime soon’\n\nInside Trump’s orbit, his anger towards another top Republican – Pence – has sown tension between allies who share his frustration with the visible role Pence aides have played in the public hearings and those who believe his attacks are both unwarranted and unhelpful.\n\nIf Trump’s goal is to dissuade Pence from potentially challenging him in a 2024 presidential primary, allies of the former vice president say it won’t work, noting that Pence is going to make that decision for himself and apart from Trump’s criticism. Still, Trump is expected to continue his onslaught this weekend when he appears at a campaign rally in Illinois for Republican incumbent Rep. Mary Miller, according to a GOP source close to Trump.\n\n“I don’t see him letting up on Mike anytime soon and, frankly, the more Mike is out there doing things with clear 2024 undertones, the more he is going to make trouble for himself,” said a Trump adviser.\n\nAt the same time, some in Trump’s orbit still believe that Pence does not pose a legitimate threat in 2024, particularly if he runs against the former President.\n\n“He has no political window,” another Trump adviser told CNN, referring to Pence’s chances of a successful presidential bid.\n\nPence, however, continues to walk a political tightrope. While the former vice president has not stood in the way of his former advisers testifying before the committee, he has also made a point to distance himself from the ongoing hearings, instead making a series of public appearances where he has focused on other issues like the economy and border security.\n\nHe also rescheduled a long-planned visit to Capitol Hill to meet with the Republican Study Committee on Tuesday. The hearing would have not only been awkward timing for Pence, but also would have potentially put Republicans like Banks, the head of the RSC, in the crosshairs, which most Republicans are eager to avoid.\n\nWhile Pence declined an invitation to also appear in Nashville last week, he recently joined Gov. Mike DeWine in the critical battleground state of Ohio for a roundtable on oil and gas sectors and he delivered a policy-heavy speech at the University Club of Chicago on Monday, previewing his pitch to primary voters if he does seek the GOP presidential nomination. The former vice president has visited all three early voting states over the past year – some more than once – and is due to release a book about his time in the administration later this fall.\n\nDuring his appearance in Chicago on Monday, Pence repeatedly implored Republicans to keep the focus on the future – a stark contrast with Trump’s almost singular focus on the 2020 election in his own public appearances.\n\n“In the days between now and Election Day, we need you to say yes – yes to the future, yes to a future of freedom and our cherished values. And the Republican Party must be the party of the future,” Pence said.\n\nCommittee members have said they could still issue a subpoena to try to compel Pence’s cooperation with the ongoing investigation, but after last Thursday’s hearing, multiple sources familiar with the probe acknowledged that remains unlikely at this stage.\n\nPence, meanwhile, has offered little indication that he would testify voluntarily, either publicly or behind closed-doors, a move that would certainly escalate the currently one-sided confrontation with Trump with little political upside.\n\nBut Pence isn’t the only White House veteran caught in Trump’s line of fire.\n\nThe former President has also complained to allies about the content of text messages that Meadows provided to the committee before halting his cooperation. Messages to Trump’s then-chief of staff from his own adult children, on-air allies at Fox News, and some of his staunchest supporters on Capitol Hill have revealed just how desperate some were for Trump to condemn the violence at the US Capitol in a timely manner – and their absolute exasperation with his initial response.\n\nTestimony from at least two former Meadows aides, Cassidy Hutchison and Alyssa Farah, has also proved critical in the ongoing January 6 probe, with Hutchison reportedly revealing in her closed-door deposition that Meadows burned papers in his office following a meeting with Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania where the two men discussed efforts to reject the 2020 election results. Perry was the first person to connect the then-President with Justice Department attorney Jeffrey Clark, who Trump considered putting in charge of the top law enforcement agency to help implement plans to overturn his defeat.", "authors": ["Melanie Zanona Gaborr Zachary Cohen", "Melanie Zanona", "Zachary Cohen"], "publish_date": "2022/06/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/20/politics/mike-pence-washington-visit-capitol-hill/index.html", "title": "Pence signals a 2024 bid as he meets with lawmakers and delivers ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence is no longer keeping his cards close, telegraphing in several high-profile moves this week that he is actively exploring a 2024 presidential bid and working to gain a foothold in Trump-fatigued corners of the Republican Party.\n\nThese speeches and appearances undoubtedly reflect the former vice president’s towering political ambitions. While a person familiar with his thinking said Pence has not yet “firmly” decided on a presidential run, he is spending the bulk of his time laying the groundwork and strengthening his ties to key players inside the GOP to ensure he is well-positioned should he announce a bid later this year or next.\n\nOn Monday, Pence threw his weight behind Arizona GOP gubernatorial hopeful Karrin Taylor Robson, whom he will rally alongside on Friday. It was the latest move in a proxy war between Pence and former President Donald Trump, who is slated to hold his own campaign rally on Friday for rival candidate Kari Lake. Ahead of Friday’s split-screen between the two men, Pence aides have circulated a past Facebook post by Lake where she dismissed Trump as “not my president” just days before his 2017 inauguration.\n\nOn Wednesday, Pence returned to Capitol Hill for the first time since he left office to meet with conservative members of the Republican Study Committee, a group he once helmed as a congressman from Indiana and whose current leader, Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana, has previously identified himself as an early supporter of a potential Pence 2024 campaign. Pence’s visit came just a day after Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell seemed to encourage other Republicans to challenge Trump in a primary if the former President decides to launch another White House campaign, as is widely expected. Pence also introduced House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy at a “Young Guns” fundraising dinner on Tuesday night, per a source familiar, underscoring his efforts to maintain close ties to top Republican leaders.\n\n“I think we’re going to have a crowded field for president,” McConnell told reporters on Tuesday when asked how he might confront a third White House bid by Trump. “I assume that most of that will unfold later, and people will be picking their candidates during a crowded primary field.”\n\nLater Wednesday, Pence delivered remarks in South Carolina, an early presidential primary state, where he outlined a path forward for abortion opponents in “a post-Roe America” – urging Republicans to slash red tape for families looking to adopt and bar the US Postal Service from delivering mail-order abortion pills.\n\n“As we gather tonight, we must recognize that we’ve only come to the end of the beginning. Standing here in the first days of a post-Roe America, we must resolve that we will not rest, we will not relent until the sanctity of life is restored in the law of every state in the nation,” Pence told a crowd at the Florence Baptist Temple, stopping short of endorsing a national ban on elective abortions.\n\nThe former vice president has previously signaled interest in banning abortion in all 50 states, either through individual state measures or a national ban. Next week, Pence will outline his policy blueprint for Republicans, dubbed the “Freedom Agenda” by his group Advancing American Freedom, in a speech at the Heritage Foundation in Washington.\n\nEven as Pence lays the groundwork, all of these moves are happening against the backdrop of Trump’s own 2024 machinations and his public criticism of Pence both before he refused the then-President’s pressure campaign to block certification of the electoral votes on January 6, 2021, and in the year and a half since.\n\nPence works to keep Hill allies close\n\nDuring a private breakfast meeting near the US Capitol on Wednesday, RSC members thanked Pence for his actions on January 6 and encouraged him to run for President, according to multiple attendees.\n\nRep. Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican, said lawmakers offered Pence encouraging words about a potential presidential bid, saying they hope he plays a big role in 2024 and that they need more voices like his in the party.\n\nPence responded with a smile, according to Bacon, but did not tip his hand about his plans for his political future even as he prepared to fly to South Carolina later that afternoon.\n\n“People said they hope he’s going to be a big voice in 2024. … He was being encouraged: we need more of you in 2024,” Bacon said. “And I would agree.”\n\nRep. Dan Newhouse, a Washington Republican who voted to impeach then-President Donald Trump for inciting the deadly insurrection, confirmed to CNN there were multiple references to a potential Pence presidential bid during their closed-door meeting.\n\nPence, however, told lawmakers that he is focused right now on helping the House GOP win the 2022 midterms and offered to stump for members on the campaign trail, according to attendees. Pence also handed out a lengthy booklet detailing his agenda and policy vision for the country.\n\nPence’s visit with the RSC, the largest conservative caucus in Congress, represents an attempt to maintain key congressional alliances as he explores a potential White House run.\n\nThe meeting also comes on the eve of potentially the last prime-time hearing from the House select committee investigating the deadly riot at the US Capitol. The committee has revealed stunning details about Trump’s pressure campaign on Pence and others to overturn the 2020 election. The panel is still weighing whether to ask Pence to speak with the committee, according to members.\n\nBut despite a growing rift between Trump and Pence, Republicans on Capitol Hill had no qualms about heaping praise on Pence, a former member of the House who once chaired the RSC.\n\nRep. Andy Barr, a Kentucky Republican, confirmed that RSC members thanked Pence for his conduct on January 6, when he refused to give in to Trump’s demands to object to the certification of the 2020 election results.\n\n“Let me just say: the vice president is a real moral force in our party,” Barr said. “He’s a real true leader, and he’s earned the respect of Republicans and other Americans all over the country.”\n\nRep. Chip Roy of Texas, who also belongs to the hardline House Freedom Caucus and voted to certify the election results, is one of the members who stood up and thanked Pence, according to a source inside the room. The comments were met with loud applause, the source said.\n\nOne topic that did not explicitly come up during the meeting was Trump himself, according to attendees. But Pence did praise the Trump agenda and talked up some of the victories they scored under the Trump presidency. Pence also brought up the recent Supreme Court ruling that overturned the constitutional right to an abortion, attendees said.\n\nPrior to the meeting, Pence’s former chief of staff Marc Short, who has testified to the select committee, was standing outside with Pence’s brother Rep. Greg Pence of Indiana and RSC Chairman Jim Banks, also of Indiana, who hosted the gathering. After the former vice president arrived, he greeted the trio and they all walked inside.\n\nLeaving the meeting, Short did not answer questions about Pence’s remarks or the ongoing January 6 investigation.\n\nFinding a foothold in the GOP base\n\nAt the South Carolina church on Wednesday, Pence addressed an audience of grassroots and religious conservatives who, like him, have spent years working to return the question of abortion rights to individual states. It’s these types of voters who flocked to Trump’s 2016 campaign after he added Pence, the genteel former Indiana governor, to his ticket, and the former vice president is hoping he can regain their favor ahead of a possible White House run.\n\nPence previously spoke on the same topic last November at an event hosted by Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, a prominent anti-abortion group on the political right whose president, Marjorie Dannenfelser, is a longtime friend and ally of Pence and has privately counseled him on the issue as he considers his future. That appearance came on the eve of oral arguments in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the landmark case that eventually led the Supreme Court to overturn federal abortion rights this year.\n\nPence used his remarks to deliver a blueprint of sorts to his fellow Republicans to strengthen abortion restrictions and further limit the federal government’s involvement in the issue. From protecting the Hyde Amendment, which blocks federal funding for most abortions under Medicaid, to de-regulating the adoption industry, Pence said abortion opponents should continue to work toward such goals now that the Supreme Court has ended federal abortion rights.\n\n“It should not cost the average American worker more than a year’s worth of wages to adopt a child,” Pence said, adding that “if you’re going to be pro-life, you need to be pro-adoption.”\n\nUnlike other Republicans who have largely avoided the topic of abortion since the June decision – many of whom are running for reelection in 2022 – Pence has been working to underscore his socially conservative bona fides by leaning into the issue of abortion.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.", "authors": ["Gaborr Melanie Zanona", "Melanie Zanona"], "publish_date": "2022/07/20"}]}

Other foods spoil quickly, usually due to a high oil and/or moisture content, and will last a long time only if they’re dried, canned or otherwise preserved. There are numerous foods that spoil faster than you’d think.\n\nThere is great interest in long-lived foods among so-called preppers or survivalists, who anticipate having to live off the grid when widespread calamity strikes. Embracing the idea of lengthy self-sufficiency, they exchange tips on stockpiling particularly long-lasting foods.\n\nYou don’t have to be worried about doomsday, however, to see the advantages of stocking a pantry with things that will be good to eat for long periods of time. Unexpected guests, power failures and simply the kind of inertia that makes a trip to the market or going out to eat just too much of a project – these are all instances when anyone would be glad to have shelves stocked with the makings of a meal.\n\nFrom Charlottesville to Champaign:40 places young people are moving\n\nCurbing bad behavior, growing users:Why Twitter stock popped 20% in July\n\nMany kinds of food, including both fresh and dried produce, are known for their longevity. 24/7 Tempo has assembled a representative list of examples in many categories, including some that will last for weeks, and some that are virtually immortal.\n\nIn all cases, the estimated shelf life is for foods stored at room temperature or slightly cooler – not in the refrigerator or freezer, both of which will extend the lifespan of most items substantially. Evolving technology has brought many more options to the grocery store freezer, and there are a number of foods you couldn’t buy frozen 35 years ago.\n\nNote that moisture and high temperatures will shorten the lives of most foods, and that foods tend to change over time in color, texture, and/or flavor – so while they may last months or years, they may be at their prime somewhat earlier.\n\n1. Potatoes\n\n• Shelf life: 2 to 5 weeks\n\nIf stored in a cool, dry, dark place. Yukon Gold, red, and fingerling potatoes will last from two to three weeks. Larger white or russet potatoes can last for three to five weeks. Sweet potatoes have about the same shelf life. Don't store them next to onions, however: The two might go together well in cooking, but raw, each gives off gases and moisture that might cause the other to spoil faster.\n\n2. Onions\n\n• Shelf life: 1 to 2 months\n\nAs with potatoes, store these in a cool, dry, dark place for maximum longevity. And, as above, don't store them with potatoes; both will spoil faster.\n\n3. Peanuts\n\n• Shelf life: 1 to 2 months\n\nPeanuts in their shell, especially when kept cool and dry, are perfectly happy in the pantry for as long as two months.\n\n4. Winter squash\n\n• Shelf life: 1 to 3 months\n\nThe various kinds of thick-skinned winter squash – including butternut, spaghetti, acorn, kabocha, and hubbard, among others – are among the most durable of fresh vegetables.\n\n5. Apples\n\n• Shelf life: 5 days to 6 months\n\nApples kept in a fruit bowl at room temperature will generally last five to seven days. When stored in a humid place at a temperature of 30º to 40º F, however, they can stay crisp and fresh for as long as six months.\n\n6. Tea\n\n• Shelf life: 6 to 12 months past \"best by\" date\n\nDried tea leaves, whether loose (in a sealed container) or in teabags (in an unopened box) can easily last a year or more if they're not subjected to moisture or humidity. The tea does tend to lose flavor over time, though.\n\n7. Powdered milk\n\n• Shelf life: 1 to 1½ years\n\nThe color, texture, or flavor of powdered milk might change as it ages, but it will still be perfectly usable and safe for at least 18 months.\n\n8. Beef jerky\n\n• Shelf life: 1 to 2 years\n\nBeef jerky and its predecessors in various parts of the world were invented to last a long time as sustenance in the wilderness and on long journeys. It's lean, dry, and salted – all qualities that add to its ability to stay edible for a long time.\n\n9. Canned fruits and vegetables\n\n• Shelf life: 1 to 2 years past \"best by\" date\n\nCanning is an extremely efficient means of preserving food. Generally speaking, if canned foods aren't subjected to intense heat, their contents should stay good for two years or more. Beware, however, of dented cans or those with swollen tops, which may indicate the presence of bacteria inside.\n\n10. Dried pasta\n\n• Shelf life: 1 to 2 years past \"best by\" date\n\nMade with just semolina flour and water, then thoroughly dried, this pasta is fairly indestructible. Its richer counterpart, fresh pasta, usually made with eggs, is much more perishable and should always be kept refrigerated.\n\n11. Bouillon cubes\n\n• Shelf life: 2 years\n\nOxygen and moisture are the enemies of these useful little blocks of instant soup or stock. Keep them dry and well sealed, and 24 months is probably the minimum they'll last.\n\n12. Peanut butter\n\n• Shelf life: 2 years\n\nAn unopened jar of peanut butter should last longer than a couple of years at room temperature, but with time, the oil will separate, the peanut butter might dry out, and the flavor may fade. Two years is likely the maximum for the best quality.\n\n13. Dark chocolate\n\n• Shelf life: 2 to 5 years\n\nBecause milk chocolate contains dairy, it will go bad more quickly than chocolate with high cacao content and little or no milk. Warm temperatures are the enemy of dark chocolate, and while it should last for a couple of years at temperatures up to around 75º F, it will keep for as long as five years if the thermometer rests between 60º and 65º F. Chocolate exposed to high temperatures can develop white spots, but these are harmless and don't affect the flavor.\n\n14. Canned or vacuum-pouched tuna\n\n• Shelf life: 3 to 5 years after \"best by\" date\n\nTuna is a hardy fish and one that takes well to canning (and in more recent times, to vacuum-packing in pouches). For optimum flavor and texture, don't keep it longer than five years after the producer's \"best by\" date.\n\n15. Dried beans\n\n• Shelf life: Indefinite\n\nDried beans are pretty much indestructible if they're kept dry, though they begin to lose their moisture after a year or two. As they age, they will require longer pre-soaking and/or cooking times to become tender.\n\n16. Honey\n\n• Shelf life: Indefinite\n\nThough honey is often sold with a \"best by\" date (usually somewhere between two and five years from the time it's packaged), that's because over time it may darken and form sugar crystals – perfectly harmless, but off-putting to some consumers. Pure 100% undiluted honey in an unopened jar (stored away from heat) will still be edible years, decades, probably generations down the road.\n\n17. Liquor\n\n• Shelf life: Indefinite\n\nEverybody knows that wine can last a long time, sometimes greatly improving as it ages. But it can also go bad quickly through exposure to extreme heat or cold, oxidation through leaky corks, and just the natural evolution of its chemical constituents over time. Not so hard liquor. Unopened bottles of spirits are virtually unchanging. Their high alcohol content preserves them and they don't age. The only exception is with some sweet liqueurs, from which, as the years pass, some of the sugar content will precipitate out, forming crystals and leaving the liqueur slightly less sweet.\n\n18. White rice\n\n• Shelf life: Indefinite\n\nBrown rice might be healthier, but it has a high oil content and so can go bad in a few months' time, while white rice – if you keep it dry – will last forever. The only possible problem, other than moisture, is the sudden appearance of tiny black bugs among the rice grains. These are rice weevils or flour bugs, and they've either found their way into the package through microscopic openings or their eggs were harvested along with the rice itself. Storing rice in thoroughly dried airtight containers will stop them from getting in; if they're already there, though, the rice should be discarded.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

It was too bizarre to be believed. So as a kid just at an ordinary state school, trying to explain to my school friends, what my training life was like was difficult,” she said.\n\n\"It was too bizarre to be believed,\" Claire Heafford tells CNN's Amanda Davies. CNN\n\nIn the report, Whyte highlighted the “recruitment of a significant number of coaches” from the former Soviet Union and the Soviet bloc.\n\n“The technical skill and experience of these coaches, whilst formidable, was sometimes accompanied by an attitude to the gymnast which was autocratic and dismissive and left athletes feeling like commodities,” Whyte wrote, adding that the ability of these coaches to produce decorated gymnasts was admired and later emulated by coaches in the UK.\n\nHeafford says what she experienced in the 1990s mirrors incidents reported to Whyte, who was commissioned by UK Sport and Sport England to review allegations that British Gymnastics failed to address complaints for decades.\n\nWhyte received over 400 submissions and interviewed 190 people after her call for evidence in August 2020.\n\nIn response to the review, British Gymnastics chief executive Sarah Powell admitted Thursday that the organization failed the sport of gymnastics and apologized on behalf of the sporting body.\n\n“I wish to accept all of the recommendations and the key findings, and we will work hard to ensure that these are acted upon quickly and robustly,” stated Powell.\n\n“But most importantly, I want to wholeheartedly apologize on behalf of the leadership and the board for those gymnasts who have suffered because we have not met the standards that are expected for our sport.”\n\nProtecting the next generation\n\n“When you do try to raise the alarm as a child and you’re shut down, it makes you think that if you do speak out, you’re not going to be believed,” Heafford, who left the sport in 1995, told CNN.\n\n“From that point on, I never watched gymnastics. I got the hell away from it. And I went into athletics, which is where I had wonderful experiences, and I loved every minute of being a track and field athlete. So it was only when I stopped competing that I started to get PTSD symptoms showing up from my time in gymnastics,” she added.\n\nAfter distancing herself from the sport for years, Heafford now coaches adults in gymnastics, runs body positive gymnastics classes and campaigns for change in the sport – particularly for the recognition of historic abuse.\n\nOther gymnasts have been vocal in their support of the report’s release. Two-time Olympian Becky Downie, who competed for Great Britain in the 2008 and 2016 Olympic Games, said the report “feels like a vindication for myself and so many who have known for so long of the serious cultural problems within the sport. A sport I love more than anything.”\n\n“Finally everyone knows the truth and while it won’t directly benefit those who have experienced it, it’s encouraging to know that if the recommendations are implemented, it’ll protect and enhance the next generation of gymnasts,” she wrote on Instagram and Twitter.\n\nBecky Downie, who competed for Great Britain in the 2008 and 2016 Olympic Games, said the report was like a \"vindication.\" Naomi Baker/Getty Images\n\nWhyte recommended systemic changes in her review, including calling on British Gymnastics to improve its complaints system by offering better guidance on how concerns should be investigated and strengthening how complaints are monitored so that patterns of abuse can be better recognized.\n\nWhyte also recommended that British Gymnastics reassess the level of responsibility delegated to volunteers and employ trained, expert staff, as well as introducing mandatory safeguarding training for all club owners and managers.\n\nShe added that British Gymnastics must appoint board members with expertise in promoting the welfare of children and protecting them from harm, as well as a director of education with responsibility for the education of coaches and welfare officers.\n\nDownie added: “While it’ll never make what has been allowed to happen to myself and so many others ok, it has been made clear us athletes have been heard, and I’m overwhelmingly encouraged for the future of young gymnasts in this country.”\n\nUK Sport and Sport England said they accepted and endorsed the review’s recommendations, and that they would continue to support British Gymnastics.\n\n“At this time, our intention is to continue to fund British Gymnastics, as we believe that withdrawing funding would not only prevent them from implementing the vital changes outlined in the report but also negatively impact on the support to and wellbeing of gymnasts now,” the joint UK Sport and Sport England statement reads.\n\n“However, we are clear that continued funding for British Gymnastics will depend on its new leadership team making significant changes to the sport, to the timelines set out in the report’s recommendations.”\n\nFirst civil case won\n\nThis week, 18-year-old former elite acrobatic gymnast Eloise Jotischky won the first civil case against British Gymnastics for the abuse she said she experienced at the hands of a coach.\n\nShe and Heafford are among a group of 39 plaintiffs involved in civil cases focusing on historic abuse by coaches who fell under the auspices of British Gymnastics, according to a representative for Gymnastics for Change.\n\nBritish Gymnastics admitted full liability in Jotischky’s case and reached a settlement with the former gymnast, whom the BBC reported also received an apology from the chief executive of the organization.\n\nJotischky, who said her coach subjected her to inappropriate weight management techniques and verbal harassment, told CNN Sport in an email she was glad the report had “finally exposed the catastrophic safeguarding failures that led to the abuse of hundreds of gymnasts.”\n\nIn the report, Whyte highlighted submissions detailing how “some coaches went to damaging lengths to control what gymnasts ate and weighed, to the extent of searching luggage and rooms for food. As a result, some gymnasts suffered from (and still suffer from) eating disorders and associated mental health issues.”\n\nWhyte's 300-plus page review concluded that British Gymnastics should have been aware of the \"bullying, harassment and excessive control\" that occurred in training clubs between 2008 and 2020. buenafoto/Adobe Stock\n\nJotischky, who competed in the sport between the ages of eight and 14, told CNN Sport she was encouraged that British Gymnastics intended to implement the report’s recommendations.\n\nBut she expressed concern, saying that “more needs to be done to address and reform the endemic culture of abuse that has been so deeply ingrained within the sport.”\n\nIn particular, Jotischky said she believes a register of coaches is critical: “Without a register of coaches, parents will never know when their child is being coached by someone who has had allegations of abuse against them. The failures of the past have proved that parents should not be shut out, especially in a sport where the coaches are being entrusted with the welfare of young children.”\n\nWhen approached for a comment on Jotischky’s remarks, British Gymnastics declined to comment further.\n\nJotischky said that, since becoming the first gymnast to win her legal case against British Gymnastics, she has been overwhelmed by the number of gymnasts who have contacted her to share their experiences.\n\n“It shows there are so many gymnasts who are afraid to speak out publicly and that must change,” she said.\n\nHeafford agreed.\n\n“The reality is that national governing bodies operate within a vacuum from a legal point of view. And the only thing that will bring actual cultural change to sport generally and specifically to the sport of gymnastics is legislative change,” she said, adding that she is calling for mandatory reporting whereby parents, gymnasts and coaches within training facilities would legally be required to report any abuse they observed.\n\nHeafford said that it was difficult for survivors to speak up, adding “there is such defensiveness within the culture of gymnastics.”\n\n“You know that as a gymnast, if you speak out about culture, there will be repercussions. You’ll be ostracized from the community, so it’s not an easy thing to do,” she said.\n\nUK Sport and Sport England referred CNN to last week’s joint statement when approached for further comment.\n\nA global reckoning\n\nThe report comes as gymnastics institutions worldwide have been forced to reckon with claims of abuse and safeguarding failures following an outpouring of survivor testimony.\n\nIn March, more than 70 former and current gymnasts in Canada called for an investigation into “ongoing toxic and abusive practices” gymnasts are allegedly subject to in the country.\n\nIn an open letter addressed to Sport Canada, the athletes have called for the governing body to conduct an “independent, third-party investigation.”\n\nAt the time, GymCan said it was aware of the letter being circulated and agreed that an external and independent organization must be established to oversee complaints.\n\nIn May, GymCan and its Provincial Member Organizations said they had been informed by the media of a proposed class action lawsuit, filed with the Supreme Court of British Columbia, in which they are named as defendants.\n\n“Although we have not been served, the allegations we have been made aware of in the claim describe behaviour that is unacceptable in any sport environment, and we take them very seriously,” GymCan said in a statement, adding they are committed to addressing all allegations with “diligence and due process.”\n\nThis comes four years after disgraced former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar was sentenced to up to 175 years in Michigan state prison after pleading guilty to seven counts of criminal sexual conduct.\n\nAt the sentencing, 156 victims, including Olympic gold medalists Aly Raisman and McKayla Maroney, recounted stories of how they went to Nassar to receive treatment for sports injuries, only to be sexually assaulted and told it was a form of treatment.\n\nAttorneys for more than 90 women and girls who were sexually abused by Nassar this month submitted claims for over $1 billion to the FBI, saying investigators could have ended Nassar’s predation and protected other victims had they not mishandled the case.\n\nThe claimants include Olympic gymnasts Simone Biles, Raisman and Maroney and world championship medalist Maggie Nichols. Each has asked for $50 million, according to the law firm that represents them.\n\nCNN this month contacted the Department of Justice, which oversees the FBI, and officials there declined to comment.", "authors": ["Amy Woodyatt Amanda Davies", "Amy Woodyatt", "Amanda Davies"], "publish_date": "2022/06/21"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/956607/ten-things-you-need-to-know-today-1-may-2020", "title": "Ten Things You Need to Know Today: 1 May 2022 | The Week UK", "text": "Biden jokes about Trump\n\nJoe Biden has resumed the tradition of speaking at the annual White House Correspondents’ Dinner.

It is also the result of high and persistent levels of fertility in some countries,” the UN statement read.\n\nMiddle-income countries, mostly in Asia, accounted for most of the growth over the past decade, gaining some 700 million people since 2011. India added about 180 million people, and is set to surpass China as the world’s most populous nation next year.\n\nBut even while the global population reaches new highs, demographers note the growth rate has fallen steadily to less than 1% per year. This should keep the world from reaching 9 billion people until 2037. The UN projects the global population will peak at around 10.4 billion people in the 2080s and remain at that level until 2100.\n\nMost of the 2.4 billion people to be added before the global population peaks will be born in sub-Saharan Africa, according to the UN, marking a shift away from China and India.\n\nNigera's most populated city, Lagos (pictured), is among African metropolises poised to become the globe's new megacities.

Meanwhile, rapid population growth combined with climate change is also likely to cause mass migration and conflict in coming decades, experts say.\n\nAnd whether it’s food or water, batteries or gasoline, there will be less to go around as the global population grows. But how much they consume is equally important, suggesting policymakers can make a big difference by mandating a shift in consumption patterns.\n\nCarbon emissions of the richest 1%, or about 63 million people, were more than double the emissions of the poorest half of humanity between 1990 and 2015, according to a 2020 analysis by the Stockholm Environment Institute and non-profit Oxfam International.\n\nResource pressure will be especially daunting in African nations, where populations are expected to boom, experts say.

And it took just a little more than a decade for the planet to add its latest billion in population after it reached 7 billion in 2011.\n\nLower-middle income and low-income countries contributed the most to the milestone, officials said. Asia and Africa contributed the most to the growth, and Europe's population was expected to decline.\n\nHelping drive the growth in Asia was India, which is set to overtake China as the most populated country in the world within the next year. China is projected to see a population decrease in the next few decades.\n\nOpinion:What 8 billion means for the family of humanity\n\nBut it may take a little longer for us to reach another billion people on the planet: The U.N. said in 2020 that the global population growth rate fell below 1% for the first time since 1950. Currently, fertility rate is at 2.3 births per woman, down from the average five births in 1950. By 2050, it's expected to slightly fall to 2.1 births.\n\nThe global population is projected to reach 9 billion in 2037 and 10 billion in 2058, signaling population growth is slowly declining.\n\nThe U.N. estimates the global population will reach 10.4 billion people in the 2080s, but it will stay at that level through the end of the century.\n\nDespite the positive trends in life expectancy hailed in the U.N. report, Guterres said in an opinion piece for USA TODAY that billions of people continue to struggle and gaps must be closed to end inequalities.

Demographers say it's ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nBillionaire Elon Musk tweeted, not for the first time, that “population collapse due to low birth rates is a much bigger risk to civilization than global warming.” Climate change is a serious problem facing the planet and experts say it’s difficult to compare problems.\n\nWhat is clear, demographers say, is that the global population is growing, despite declines in some parts of the world, and it shouldn’t be collapsing any time soon – even with birth rates at lower levels than in the past.\n\n“He’s better off making cars and engineering than at predicting the trajectory of the population,” said Joseph Chamie, a consulting demographer and a former director of the United Nations Population Division, who has written several books about population issues.\n\n“Yes, some countries, their population is declining, but for the world, that’s just not the case.”\n\nPopulation projections by the numbers\n\nThe world’s population is projected to reach 8 billion by mid-November of this year, according to the United Nations. The UN predicts the global population could grow to around 8.5 billion in just 8 years.\n\nBy 2080, the world’s population is expected to peak at 10.4 billion. Then there’s a 50% chance that the population will plateau or begin to decrease by 2100. More conservative models like the one published in 2020 in the Lancet anticipate the global population would be about 8.8 billion people by 2100.\n\nIt’s true that what’s driving current population growth is not a higher birth rate. What drives global population growth is that fewer people are dying young. Global life expectancy was 72.8 years in 2019, an increase of nine years since 1990. That is expected to increase to 77.2 years by 2050.\n\nGlobally, the fertility rate has not “collapsed,” nor should it, according to the UN, but it has dropped significantly.\n\nIn 1950, women typically had five births each; globally, last year, it was 2.3 births. By 2050, the UN projects a further global decline to 2.1 births per woman.\n\nIn some countries, it is lower. In the US the 1950s, it was 3.6 births per woman, it slipped to 1.6 in 2020, according to the World Bank. In Italy, it was 1.2; in Japan, it was 1.3; in China, 1.2. In January 2022, the country announced the birth rate fell for the fifth year in a row, even with the repeal of the one child policy, allowing couples to have up to three children as of 2021.\n\n“Virtually every developed country is below two, and it’s been that way for 20 or 30 years,” Chamie said. Most countries have gone through what’s called a demographic transition.\n\nThe only continent that hasn’t finished this transition, he said, is parts of Africa, where there are 15 to 20 countries where the average number of children couples have is five. But in those countries, children still face high death rates. The infant mortality rate for kids under 5 is 8 to 10 times higher than in developed regions, and maternal mortality is more than double, Chamie said.\n\nIf women in these African regions had more access to contraception, education, and health care, these problems could be addressed and the global population could decline further – but people would be better off in terms of individual health.\n\nThe ‘gold medal’ century\n\nIn terms of population growth, the 20th century was an anomaly.\n\n“That century was the most impressive demographic century ever. It had more gold medals than all the other centuries,” Charmie said.\n\nThe human population nearly quadrupled, something that had never happened before in recorded history. That’s largely because of improvements in public health.\n\nThe world has antibiotics, vaccines, public health programs and improved sanitation to thank for people living longer and more mothers and children surviving birth.\n\nWith contraception, especially in 1964, when the oral pill was widely introduced in the US, couples were now better able to determine when and how many children they had.\n\n“Contraception, the oral pill had a much more significant effect on the world than the car,” Charmie said.\n\nAs more women got an education, worked outside the home and got a later start on children in many countries with access to contraception, couples had fewer children and the population started to decline.\n\nIn 2020, the global population growth rate fell under 1% for the first time since 1950.\n\nThe picture in the US\n\nIn the US, the fertility rate is down in part due to what Ken Johnson, a senior demographer at the Casey School of Public Poilcy and a professor of sociology at the University of New Hampshire, characterized as a “significant” decline in teen births.\n\n“Most demographers would see that as a good thing,” he said.\n\nHe said the other driver was a decline in the number of births to women in their 20s. That trend has been around since 2008. People put off or decided not to have babies in part because of the recession, he said. Covid then exacerbated this trend.\n\nBetween July of 2020 and 2021, the growth rate of the US population was the lowest it’s been in probably 100 years he said.\n\n“Is it a collapse of the number of births? No, I wouldn’t say that,” Johnson said.\n\nHe said there are a few factors at play in the low US growth rate: fewer births, fewer immigrants due to Trump-era policies, and more deaths as the US population is ages. Covid-19 contributed to higher deaths, too.\n\n“It’s almost like a perfect storm if you will,” Johnson said. “Births are way down, Covid pushes deaths way up, and then immigration is quite slow, too, so it is no wonder that the population growth rate is so low when you bring all those factors together at the same time.”\n\nPreventing population problems down the road\n\nAs the population ages and birth rates decline in some areas of the globe, that could put strain on social systems.\n\nThe share of the population over age 65 will rise from 10% in 2022 to 16% in 2050. That’s twice the number of kids under age 5.\n\nGlobally, the trick to make such a population age imbalance work, is that governments will need to be proactive, the UN says. Countries with aging populations need to adapt public programs that will support this growing population of older people. That means shoring up programs like social security, pensions and establishing universal access to health care and long-term care.\n\nIn the US, William Frey, a demographer and senior fellow with Brookings Metro, said he doesn’t see the need for more couples to have more babies to address the age imbalance in the United States. Policies that would support couples that want children – affordable daycare and family leave policies, for example – could help, but that that hasn’t made a big difference in terms of fertility rates.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nFertility is below the replacement rate in the US, meaning couples are having fewer than two children each, but the rate is not as low as it is in most of Europe, he said.\n\n“I don’t think in the US it’s an issue of collapse, because we can certainly open the faucet for more immigrants anytime we want to,” Frey said. “We’ll have no paucity of people who want to come through the door to immigrate here in the future. Immigrants and their children are younger than the population as a whole and so that will help to keep the population from aging as well.”", "authors": ["Jen Christensen"], "publish_date": "2022/08/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2022/11/11/world-population-2022-reaches-8-billion/8323453001/", "title": "World population reaching 8 billion: What this means for the family of ...", "text": "António Guterres\n\nU.N. secretary-general\n\nThe world’s population will reach 8 billion in the middle of November – a testament to scientific breakthroughs and improvements in nutrition, public health and sanitation. But as our human family grows larger, it is also growing more divided.\n\nBillions of people are struggling; hundreds of millions are facing hunger and even famine. Record numbers are on the move seeking opportunities and relief from debt and hardship, wars and climate disasters.\n\nUnless we bridge the yawning chasm between the global haves and have-nots, we are setting ourselves up for an 8-billion-strong world filled with tensions and mistrust, crisis and conflict.\n\nThe facts speak for themselves. A handful of billionaires control as much wealth as the poorest half of the world. The top 1% globally pocket a fifth of the world’s income, while people in the richest countries can expect to live up to 30 years longer than those in the poorest. As the world has grown richer and healthier in recent decades, these inequalities have grown, too.\n\nOn top of these long-term trends, the accelerating climate crisis and the unequal recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic are turbocharging inequalities. We are heading straight for climate catastrophe, while emissions and temperatures continue to rise. Floods, storms and droughts are devastating countries that contributed almost nothing to global heating.\n\nThe war in Ukraine is adding to ongoing food, energy and finance crises, hitting developing economies hardest. These inequalities take their greatest toll on women and girls, and on marginalized groups that already suffer discrimination.\n\nMany countries in the Global South face huge debts, increasing poverty and hunger, and the growing impacts of the climate crisis. They have little chance of investing in a sustainable recovery from the pandemic, the transition to renewable energy, or education and training for the digital age.\n\nAnger and resentment against developed countries are reaching breaking points.\n\nAcknowledge that runaway inequality is a choice\n\nToxic divisions and lack of trust are causing delays and deadlock on a host of issues, from nuclear disarmament to terrorism to global health. We must curb these damaging trends, repair relationships and find joint solutions to our common challenges.\n\nWe meet weekly for lunch and talk politics. We don't always agree. But we're always civil.\n\nThe first step is acknowledging that this runaway inequality is a choice, and one that developed countries have the responsibility to reverse – starting this month at the United Nations climate conference in Egypt and the Group of 20 industrial and emerging-market nations summit in Bali.\n\nI hope COP27 – the 27th Conference of the Parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change – will see a historic Climate Solidarity Pact under which developed and emerging economies unite around a common strategy and combine their capacities and resources for the benefit of humankind. Wealthier countries must provide key emerging economies with financial and technical support to transition away from fossil fuels. That is our only hope of meeting our climate goals.\n\nClimate realism, not doom:The spread of 'climate doom' on TikTok is hurting the climate justice movement – and Gen Z\n\nI also urge leaders at COP27 to agree on a road map and institutional framework to compensate countries in the Global South for climate-related loss and damage that is already causing enormous suffering.\n\nThe G-20 summit in Bali will be an opportunity to address the plight of developing countries. I have urged G-20 economies to adopt a stimulus package that will provide governments of the Global South with investments and liquidity, and address debt relief and restructuring.\n\nAs we push for action on these medium-term measures, we are working nonstop with all stakeholders to ease the global food crisis.\n\nThe Black Sea Grain Initiative is an essential part of those efforts. It has helped to stabilize markets and bring food prices down. Every fraction of a percent has the potential to ease hunger and save lives.\n\nWe are also working to ensure Russian fertilizers can flow into global markets, which have been severely disrupted by the war. Fertilizer prices are up to three times higher than before the pandemic. Rice, the most widely consumed staple in the world, is the crop that will suffer most.\n\nRemoving the remaining obstacles to the exports of Russian fertilizers is an essential step towards global food security.\n\nInvest to create a virtuous circle of development and growth\n\nNonetheless, among all these serious challenges, there is some good news. Our 8-billion-strong world could yield enormous opportunities for some of the poorest countries, where population growth is highest. Relatively small investments in health care, education, gender equality and sustainable economic development could create a virtuous circle of development and growth, transforming economies and lives.\n\nWithin a few decades, today’s poorest countries could become engines of sustainable, green growth and prosperity across entire regions.\n\nI never bet against human ingenuity, and I have enormous faith in human solidarity. In these difficult times, we would do well to remember the words of one of humanity’s wisest observers, Mahatma Gandhi: “The world has enough for everyone's need – but not everyone's greed.”\n\nThis month’s big global meetups must be an opportunity to start bridging divides and restoring trust, based on the equal rights and freedoms of every single member of humanity’s 8-billion-strong family.\n\nAntónio Guterres is the ninth secretary-general of the United Nations.\n\nMore from U.N.

Rather, he said, the worry is for countries on opposite sides of two extremes: Countries, mostly poor ones, whose populations are growing too quickly, and wealthier ones where the populations is aging and decreasing.\n\n\"The world has had a great experience of dealing with rapid population growth,\" Wilmoth said at a news conference. \"World population doubled between 1960 and 2000, roughly. World food supply more than doubled over that time period.\"\n\n\"The problem is more one of extremes,\" he added. \"The main story is to avoid the extreme of either rapid growth due to high fertility or rapid population aging and potential decline due to very low fertility.\"\n\nAmong the fastest-growing countries is Nigeria, whose population is expected to surpass the U.S. population before the middle of the century and could start to rival China as the second-most populous country in the world by the end of the century, according to the report. By 2050, Nigeria's population is expected to reach more than 440 million people, compared to about 400 million for the U.S. The oil-rich African country's population is forecast to be nearly 914 million by 2100.\n\nThe report found that most countries with very high levels of fertility — more than 5 children per women — are on the U.N. list of least-developed countries. Most are in Africa, but they also include Afghanistan and East Timor.\n\nBut the average number of children per woman has swiftly declined in several large countries, including China, India, Indonesia, Iran, Brazil and South Africa, leading to a reduction in population growth rates in much of the developing world.\n\nIn contrast, many European and eastern Asia countries have very low fertility levels.\n\n\"As a result, these populations are aging rapidly and face challenges in providing care and support to their growing ranks of older persons,\" Wilmoth said.\n\nWilmoth cautioned that \"there is a great deal of uncertainty about population trends.\" He said projections could change based on the trajectories of three major components — fertility, mortality and migration.\n\nStill, population growth until 2050 is all but inevitable.\n\nThe U.N. uses the \"medium-variant\" projection, which assumes a substantial reduction in the fertility levels of intermediate- and high-fertility countries in the coming years. In the \"high-variant\" — if women on average had an extra half of a child — the world population would reach 10.9 billion in 2050. In the \"low-variant\" — if women on average had half a child fewer — the population would be 8.3 billion in 2050.\n\nAmong the notable findings in the report:\n\n• The population in developing regions is projected to increase from 5.9 billion in 2013 to 8.2 billion in 2050. In contrast, the population of developed countries is expected to remain largely unchanged during that period, at around 1.3 billion people.\n\n• Africa's population could increase from 1.1 billion today to 2.4 billion in 2050, and potentially to 4.2 billion by 2100.\n\n• The number of children in less-developed regions is at all time high at 1.7 billion. In those regions, children under age 15 account for 26% of the population. In the poorest countries, children constitute 40% of their populations, posing huge challenges for providing education and employment.\n\n• In wealthier regions, by contrast, children account for 16% of the population. In developed countries as a whole, the number of older people has already surpassed the number of children, and by 2050 the number of older people will be nearly twice the number of children.\n\n• Low-fertility countries now include all of Europe except Iceland plus 19 countries in Asia, 17 in the Americas, two in Africa and one in Oceania.\n\n• The populations of several countries are expected to decline by more than 15% by 2050, including Belarus, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cuba, Georgia, Latvia, Lithuania, Republic of Moldova, Romania, Russia Serbia, and Ukraine.\n\n• Life expectancy at birth for the world as a whole rose from 47 years in 1950-55 to 69 years in 2005-2010 and is projected to reach 76 years in 2045-2050 and 82 years in 2095-2100.\n\n____\n\nAssociated Press writer Alexandra Olson contributed to this report\n\n____\n\nOn the Internet:\n\nhttp://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/06/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2022/07/11/un-world-population-8-billion-people/10029285002/", "title": "UN: World population to hit 8 billion people in November", "text": "The world is continuing to grow.\n\nThe latest report from the United Nations projects the global population will reach 8 billion people later this year and continue to rise for the next eight decades.\n\nThe World Population Prospects 2022 report, released on Monday by the U.N.'s Department of Economic and Social Affairs Population Division, outlined what countries around the world should expect in the coming years.\n\nThe global population is expected to reach 8 billion by Nov. 15, the U.N. predicts, but it won't stop there. The population could be around 8.5 billion by 2030, 9.7 billion in 2050 and 10.4 billion in 2100, meaning Earth could have a 31% increase in human population by the end of the century.\n\nThe estimated population growth comes as the world's average fertility rate continues to decline. In 2020, the global population growth rate fell below 1% for the first time since 1950. Currently, it's at 2.3 births per woman, down from the average five births per woman in 1950. By 2050, it's expected to slightly fall to 2.1 births per woman.\n\nStill, factors such as the rise of life expectancy are reasons why the global population continues to rise.\n\n\"Globally, life expectancy reached 72.8 years in 2019, an increase of almost 9 years since 1990. Further reductions in mortality are projected to result in an average longevity of around 77.2 years globally in 2050,\" the report reads.\n\n\"Two-thirds of the projected increase in global population through 2050 will be driven by the momentum of past growth that is embedded in the youthful age structure of the current population. Such growth would occur even if childbearing in today's high-fertility countries were to fall immediately to around two births per woman.\"\n\nPeople ages 65 and older are expected to account for 16% of the human population by 2050, up from 10% in 2022. Men currently make up 50.3% of the population, but by 2050, there are expected to be just as many women as men.\n\nHow many people are in the world?: A look at the population in 2022\n\nGlobal population: Elon Musk says there aren't 'enough people,' birthrate could threaten human civilization\n\nWorld's most populated country soon won't be China\n\nChina has long been the most populous country, but that isn't expected to last long, with India projected to be the world's most populous country in 2023. Each country currently has a population over 1.4 billion people, accounting for over 35% of the global population, but China's population is expected to start declining as early as next year.\n\nBy 2050, India is projected to have 1.6 billion people, while China is projected to have 1.3 billion people.\n\nIndia is just one of eight countries – including the Philippines, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Pakistan and the United Republic of Tanzania – expected to see major population growth by 2050. The increase in several sub-Saharan countries is expected to result in the population doubling in the area.\n\nOn the other side of the population spectrum, 61 countries are expected to have a population decrease of at least 1%. Of that list, Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Serbia and Ukraine are projected to lose at least 20% of their population.\n\nWhat about the United States' population?\n\nNorth America is projected by the U.N. to reach its peak population in the late-2030s and then start declining \"due to sustained low levels of fertility.\" But that won't affect the population of the U.S.\n\nThe U.S. population is currently 337 million people and it is projected to be at 375 million people in 2050, still making it the third most populous country in the world, behind India and China.\n\nFollow Jordan Mendoza on Twitter: @jordan_mendoza5.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/28/world/un-ipcc-climate-report-adaptation-impacts/index.html", "title": "Climate change: We're running out of ways to adapt to the crisis ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nClimate change is on course to transform life on Earth as we know it, and unless global warming is dramatically slowed, billions of people and other species will reach points where they can no longer adapt to the new normal, according to a major report published Monday.\n\nThe UN-backed report, based on years of research from hundreds of scientists, found that the impacts from human-caused climate change were larger than previously thought. The report’s authors say these impacts are happening much faster and are more disruptive and widespread than scientists expected 20 years ago.\n\nThe authors point to enormous inequities in the climate crisis, finding that those who contribute the least to the problem are the worst affected, and warn of irreversible impacts if the world exceeds 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming.\n\nUN Secretary-General António Guterres called the report “an atlas of human suffering and a damning indictment of failed climate leadership,” and he warned that “delay means death.”\n\n“The facts are undeniable. This abdication of leadership is criminal,” Guterres said in a statement. “The world’s biggest polluters are guilty of arson of our only home.”\n\nHe also said that “current events” showed the world was too reliant of fossil fuels, calling them “a dead end,” in an apparent reference to the Ukraine conflict and energy crisis.\n\nHere are the report’s key takeaways:\n\nWarming beyond 1.5 degrees could have irreversible consequences\n\nBleaching of the coral reefs around French Polynesia in 2019. Alexis Rosenfeld/Getty Images\n\nScientists have warned for decades warming needs to stay below 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels.\n\nMonday’s report, from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), showed if that limit is breached, some changes will be irreversible for hundreds — if not thousands — of years. And some changes may be permanent, even if the planet cools back down.\n\nThe world is already 1.1 degrees Celsius warmer than before industrialization, according to the IPCC’s estimate, which is considered conservative. We are now rapidly barreling toward 1.5 degrees.\n\nWith every extreme event, ecosystems are being pushed more toward so-called tipping points beyond which irreversible changes can happen, according to the report.\n\nAt warming of 2 degrees, for example, as many as 18% of all land species will be at high risk of extinction, according to the report. At 4 degrees, 50% of species are threatened.\n\n“There are many challenges already with 1.5 degrees for several systems that we know about,” said Hans-Otto Pörtner, a co-chair on the report and a scientist at the Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research.\n\n“Clearly for coral reefs, we must say that in many locations, they are already beyond tipping points. They are on the downslide.”\n\nA man works in the Swiss Alps at the Rhone Glacier in October 2021, which is partially covered with insulating foam to prevent it from melting due to global warming. Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHighly vulnerable ecosystems in the Arctic, mountains and on the coasts are at the greatest risk to these changes, the authors say. Ice sheet and glacier melt will cause accelerated sea level rise, irreversible for centuries.\n\nForests, peatlands and permafrost — places where greenhouse gas is naturally stored — risk being pushed into a situation where they are emitting those gases into the atmosphere, causing even more warming.\n\nWe’re running out of ways to adapt\n\n“Adaptation” is finding ways to live with the change — like putting up walls to ward off sea level rise or implementing new building codes to ensure homes can withstand more extreme weather.\n\nScientists note some of our adaptations have blunted the impact of the climate crisis so far, but they are not adequate in the long-term. Our options to adapt will become even more limited at 1.5 degrees.\n\nA flood defense wall being constructed on the east side of Manhattan in New York City on December 11, 2021. Ed Jones/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAnd although the natural world has adapted to changing climates over millions of years, the pace of human-caused global warming is pushing many of the planet’s most critical systems — like rainforests, coral reefs and the Arctic — to the brink. More extreme weather doesn’t just affect humans, it is causing mass die-offs in plants and animals.\n\nPopulation growth and development, which has not been carried out with long-term adaptation in mind, are also luring people into harm’s way. As many as 3.6 billion people live in places already highly vulnerable to climate hazards, some of which will increase beyond the ability to adapt once the planet hits the 1.5-degree mark.\n\nA lot of the world’s resources, particularly international finance, goes toward reducing greenhouse emissions, which is known as mitigation. At the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow, Scotland, last year, developing nations complained that the rich world was failing to help adequately fund adaptation in their countries.\n\n“We have seen that the vast majority of climate finance goes towards mitigation rather than adaptation,” said Adelle Thomas, an author on the report and a climate scientist at the University of the Bahamas. “So although adaptation is taking place, there is not enough funding, and it is not a high priority, which are then leading to these limits.”\n\nUp to 3 billion people will experience ‘chronic water scarcity’\n\nResidents fill water containers during a shortage in Nairobi, Kenya, in January. Donwilson Odhiambo/SOPA/LightRocket/Getty Images\n\nAround half of the world’s population experiences severe water scarcity each year in part due to climate-related factors, the report showed. Water will become even more scarce at higher global temperatures.\n\nAt 2 degrees of warming — which scientists predict the planet will reach by midcentury — as many as three billion people around the world will experience “chronic water scarcity,” according to the report. It increases to four billion people at 4 degrees.\n\nWater shortages will put enormous pressure on food production and increase the world’s already dire food-security challenges.\n\nA water crisis is already brewing in the Western United States. Multiyear drought has drained reservoirs and triggered unprecedented water cuts for the region. Lake Mead, the country’s largest reservoir, plunged to record lows in recent months, threatening water supply for tens of millions of people.\n\nDead almond trees lie in an open field after they were removed by a farmer because of a lack of water to irrigate them, in Huron, California, in July 2021.

Vast swaths of Africa have also struggled in recent years with prolonged drought.\n\nThe report focuses on the interconnectedness between the Earth’s ecosystems and humans, including how the climate crisis is altering water resources.\n\n“What we really wanted to show is that ecosystems and all sectors of human society and human well-being fundamentally depends on water,” Tabea Lissner, a scientist at Climate Analytics and an author on the report, told CNN. “And it’s not just the water resource itself that plays an important role in water security, but also what form and in what quality we can access it, and really showing how many different ways climate change really affects humans and ecosystems through various channels.”\n\nThe people who are least responsible are the most affected\n\nFlooding in the Sudanese capital of Khartoum on September 7, 2021. Abdulmonam Eassa/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe countries that emit the least planet-warming gases, mainly those in the Global South and island territories, tend to be the ones disproportionately harmed by climate hazards, the report showed.\n\n“We live in an unequal world,” Eric Chu, an author of the report and scientist at University of California, Davis, told CNN. “The losses are inequitably distributed among communities, especially those communities that have historically been disadvantaged from decision-making, and now we’re seeing some of that inequality manifest as well in the choices we make to adapt.”\n\nCamille Parmesan, an ecologist at CNRS Ecology Station and an author of the report, said as climate change worsens, more Indigenous people will lose the land, water and biodiversity they depend on.\n\nAn overhead view of Ejit in the Marshall Islands, which are being increasingly overwhelmed by sea level rise. Josh Haner/The New York Times/Redux\n\n“There’s increasing evidence that many Indigenous communities that do rely a lot more on the natural systems for their food and their livelihoods are not only the most exposed, because those natural systems are being very heavily impacted, but they’re the most vulnerable because often they’re there in areas with high poverty or poor access to health care,” Parmesan said.\n\nAs the climate crisis advances, more people will be forced to relocate, adding stress and vulnerability to other regions.\n\n“When the Earth doesn’t become farmable, the dependence in the livelihood that communities have on farming and on production of food, not only will the incomes be lost, but that food security will be lost,” said Vivek Shandas, a professor of climate adaptation and urban policy at Portland State University, who was not involved with the report. “That ability to survive every day is lost. As humans, throughout history, we moved from places that are less habitable to places that are more attainable and habitable.”\n\nWe can still avoid the worst\n\nEmployees from Akfen Renewable Energy Group's Canakkale Wind Power Plant in Turkey do a routine maintenance check of equipment on the top of a wind turbine in December 2021. Chris McGrath/Getty Images\n\nWhile many regions in the developing world are unable to adapt because of a lack of finance and capacity, the IPCC singles out North America as a region where misinformation and politicization are a barrier.\n\nThat’s led to a misunderstanding of how great the risk is, and has polarized the response to the crisis, ultimately “delaying urgent adaptation planning and implementation,” the report’s authors say.\n\nIn Europe, they note a lack of political leadership and a low sense of urgency are among the hurdles to overcome.\n\nBut these are barriers that can be overcome, and the authors say there is still a window of opportunity to implement meaningful action — though it’s closing, fast.\n\n“There are opportunities to adapt between now and 1.5 [degrees],” in addition to making deep cuts to heat-trapping fossil fuel emissions, Chu said. “But as we go beyond 1.5, the opportunity space becomes much more constrained and reduces the effectiveness.”\n\nLissner said the report is “an urgent call for action” for world leaders to move toward climate-resilient development: reducing emissions as low as possible while also investing in adaptation to cope with the changes we already see.\n\nDecision makers also need to be intentional in helping the most disadvantaged communities and countries, so no one gets left behind in the process.\n\n“It’s important for this to also be done in an inclusive or equitable manner,” Lissner said, “looking into how the most vulnerable regions can really be supported in adaptation.”", "authors": ["Rachel Ramirez"], "publish_date": "2022/02/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/27/weather/extreme-heat-wave-india-pakistan-monsoon-climate-change/index.html", "title": "India has seen months of extreme heat and this week it will only get ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nLife-threatening heat waves arrived in India a month earlier than normal, shattering temperature records, with highs reaching over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) – and it will only get hotter.\n\nThe worst of the heat wave is expected late this week into this weekend with high temperatures approaching 10-15 degrees Fahrenheit (5-8 degrees Celsius) above normal across northern and northwestern India as well as parts of Pakistan.\n\nOver one billion people will be subjected to excessive heat – 10% of the world’s population, according to Scott Duncan, an extreme climate expert.\n\nExtremely high temperatures are forecast for India Thursday, with above 90 degrees Fahrenheit temperatures shown in orange, and above 100 degrees Fahrenheit temperatures shown in dark red.

If United Kingdom voters support a British exit, or Brexit, Germany could face higher EU costs, lose an important ally on many issues and a suffer a blow to its post-World War II quest for European unity and prosperity.\n\nThat's why many Germans are watching the British debate with a mixture of fear and fascination.\n\n\"Again and again I hear from my friends and colleagues, 'Why does Britain want to take this risk? Aren't they scared or worried about the impact?'\" said Jon Worth, a Berlin-based British blogger and political analyst who has organized events around Germany for people to learn and share views about the vote. \"They just don't get it. Germans don't like to rock the boat in geopolitical terms,\" said Worth, who wants Britain to remain in the EU.\n\nBritish Prime Minister David Cameron, who also favors remaining in the EU, agreed to hold the referendum in response to complaints by members of his Conservative Party. They gripe that the EU is letting too many migrants into Europe, imposing regulations that hurt British business, charging billions of pounds in membership fees better spent elsewhere and imposing laws made in Brussels without giving Britons a say. Cameron negotiated some concessions but not enough to satisfy the Brexit camp.\n\n\"Britain is the second-largest net contributor to the EU budget. If it leaves, Germany would have to pay more,\" said Michael Wohlgemuth, who directs the Berlin office of the Open Europe think tank. \"From a German perspective Brexit would mean power inside the organization would shift to a more southern Mediterranean axis.\"\n\n\"The London-Paris-Berlin triangle would no longer be there, and more pro-market EU countries like Germany could be systemically outvoted in the European Council (comprised of member states' leaders). People might say, 'Well, with the Brits gone we have gotten rid of the troublemakers and the EU can now take a great leap forward toward a European federal state,' but the reality is Germans and EU citizens do not want to see more integration,\" Wohlgemuth added.\n\nMichael Heise, chief economist at Allianz, a Munich-based insurance company, said that while the economic impact of a British exit on Germany is difficult to quantify, it is also difficult to see any outright advantages. One upside for Germany, although not necessarily something \"to cheer about,\" he said, is that Frankfurt might absorb some of the financial services business that many experts expect would flee London in the event of Brexit.\n\nA May 31 survey by YouGov, an online market research firm, showed that if faced with a referendum on EU membership, 54% of Germans would opt to remain, while 29% would chose to leave. The same poll found British voters evenly split. YouGov also found that most voters in Britain, France, Sweden, Germany, Denmark and Finland would expect other EU members to try to leave if Britain does.\n\nThat is a major source of concern for Germany, which has long viewed the EU as the foundation for security and political moderation for 500 million people in the world's largest common market. The idea that the EU brings \"peace, stability and collaboration runs deeps in Germany,\" said Worth, the blogger.\n\n\"Imagine if Donald Trump wins the U.S. presidential election, if (Norbert Hofer of the far-right Freedom Party) had won in Austria's presidential election, if (populist, far-right politician) Marine Le Pen wins in France's next general elections — it would be a very different world,\" said Katarina Barley, the general secretary of Germany's opposition Social Democratic Party, at a Berlin event launching the YouGov poll. \"The EU is the only way we can stand close together\" and ensure peace.\n\nAlexander Graf Lambsdorff, the German vice president of the European Parliament, told the same gathering: \"The EU without the U.K. is imaginable.

The start-up claims to have held the first such survey on the topic since the lawmaker's slaying. Most of Qriously’s surveys are done for corporate brands and it has not been previously conducted an EU referendum poll.\n\nRespondents were asked: \"Imagine the EU referendum were held today.

The weakening support for remaining in the EU coincided with a large move toward \"Don't know,\" which leaped to 16% from 9% before Cox's assassination.\n\nBritons are split over whether to leave the political bloc, but a series of recent polls — all conducted prior to Cox's death — have shown the Leave campaign gaining ground in the closing stages of the race.

He also said that the candidate list would close on Monday, before a first round of voting on Wednesday. The list will then be whittled down to two, and the party’s grassroot members will be given the final say.\n\nJohnson announced on Thursday he would step down, after nearly 60 lawmakers and government officials resigned over his handling of a series of scandals, including illegal gatherings held at his Downing Street office in defiance of coronavirus lockdown rules and his failure to act on sexual misconduct allegations against his deputy chief whip.\n\nNow, with the government in tatters, bookmakers and much of Britain are speculating about his likely successor. A slew of contenders have thrown their hat into the ring – from household names to lesser-known Conservative members of parliament.\n\nAmong those to announce their candidacy are an Iraqi Kurdish refugee, the children of Indian and Pakistani immigrants and several women – reflecting efforts by the Conservative Party to field more ethnically diverse candidates for Parliament in recent years.\n\nAny candidates who run for the leadership will go through rounds of voting by Conservative lawmakers until only two remain – at which point Conservative Party members nationwide will vote. The winner will be the new party leader – and prime minister.\n\nHere’s a look at the possible contenders.\n\nShow More - (Show Less)\n\nRishi Sunak\n\nBritain's former Chancellor Rishi Sunak. Jessica Taylor/UK Parliament/Reuters\n\nThe former chancellor formally announced he was standing to succeed Johnson in a campaign video on Friday, which began with the story of his Indian parents, who both emigrated to the UK from East Africa. “It was Britain, our country, that gave them and millions like them the chance of a better future,” he said. “I want to lead this country in the right direction.”\n\nSunak was Johnson’s presumed successor for several months after he won praise for overseeing Britain’s initial financial response to the Covid-19 pandemic. But he has suffered several of his own scandals while in government.\n\nHis stock sank earlier this year after revelations that he broke Covid regulations to attend the prime minister’s birthday party on June 19, 2020, for which he later apologized “unreservedly.”\n\nHis financial and legal affairs came under scrutiny this spring following reports his wife had non-domicile status in the UK – meaning she was not liable to pay tax on overseas income – and that he held a US green card while serving as minister.\n\nHis popularity has also taken a beating in recent weeks as Britain has suffered the worst cost-of-living crisis in decades. Sunak has struggled to keep down spiraling inflation and has been criticized by opposition parties for what they call a slow and inadequate series of financial measures. Among the economic woes facing Britons after Sunak’s time as the UK’s chief financial minister: real wages dropping to their lowest levels in more than 21 years and inflation hitting a 40-year high of 9.1% in May.\n\nBut he is still among the bookmakers’ odds-on favorites to take Johnson’s job.\n\nSajid Javid\n\nFormer Health Secretary Sajid Javid. Leon Neal/Getty Images\n\nThe former health secretary, whose resignation set off a wave of departures from Johnson’s government, officially announced his candidacy on Sunday.\n\n“Whether it’s the cost of living or it’s low levels of growth, for me, that’s our most immediate challenge… You need someone with an economic plan from day one,” he said, adding that his economic plan would have two prongs: short-term measures to help people meet cost-of-living challenges and a longer-term plan for tax reform.\n\nPosting on Twitter on Sunday, Javid said: “The next Prime Minister needs integrity, experience, and a tax-cutting plan for economic growth. That’s why I’m standing.”\n\nThe statement echoed Javid’s resignation speech in the House of Commons in which he said that something was “fundamentally wrong” with government.\n\nThose who support Javid’s candidacy hope that he will be credited for triggering Johnson’s ultimate ouster, having been the first cabinet minister to resign – though Sunak followed him minutes later.\n\nThe MP has twice run for party leadership in the past – in 2016, after the Brexit referendum, and in 2019, when Johnson was ultimately elected. He served as chancellor from 2019 to 2020.\n\nHis family immigrated from Pakistan to the UK in the 1960s, and his father worked as a bus driver.\n\nLiz Truss\n\nUK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss. Tolga Akmen/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe foreign secretary made her leadership ambitions known in The Telegraph on Sunday. At the heart of her leadership bid is a pledge to cut taxes “from day one,” to tackle the cost-of-living crisis.\n\nLiz Truss became the chief negotiator with the European Union on the UK’s Brexit deal in December 2021 and has held multiple cabinet positions. Since voting Remain in 2016, she has since become one of the loudest Euroskeptic voices in the government, which many have chalked up to her desire for the top job.\n\nShe has a formidable and dedicated team around her – some of whom previously worked in Number 10 – which has been producing slick videos and photos of her looking thoroughly statesmanlike. She has apparently attempted to channel former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, wearing a headscarf while driving a tank, and her role in fronting the response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has also heightened her public profile.\n\nIn her comment piece in The Telegraph, she highlighted her foreign policy expertise, writing: “As Foreign Secretary, I have helped to lead the international response to Putin’s war in Ukraine and delivered a tough sanctions package that has led the world, by imposing real pain on Putin and the Kremlin.”\n\nTruss is popular among Conservative members, who would pick the eventual winner of a contest. But Johnson’s downfall could simultaneously tarnish anyone in his cabinet, meaning Conservative voters could turn to a backbencher to take the mantle.\n\nPenny Mordaunt\n\nBritain's Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt. Aaron Chown/PA Images/Getty Images\n\nThe trade minister, one of the bookmakers’ favorites to replace Johnson, announced her bid for the leadership on Sunday. A poll of party members published July 4 by website Conservative Home put her as the second favorite choice, behind the current defense secretary Ben Wallace, who has ruled himself out of the race.\n\nPenny Mordaunt first entered parliament in 2010 and later joined the cabinet under Theresa May, serving as international development and defense secretary.\n\nAfter last month’s confidence vote, Mordaunt declined to comment on whether she backed Johnson, raising eyebrows among Westminster observers when she said: “I didn’t choose this prime minister.”\n\nAnnouncing her interest in the top job, she said the party “leadership needs to become a little less about the leader and a lot more about the ship.”\n\nMordaunt, who in 2019 became the first woman to serve as defense minister, invoked Thatcher in her statement, saying the former Conservative leader “was remarkable for not just what she did but the speed she did it.”\n\n“She had a vision and a plan. So do I,” she added.\n\nTom Tugendhat\n\nCommittee chairman Tom Tugendhat. Niall Carson/PA Images/Getty Images\n\nA former British military officer who chairs the Foreign Affairs Committee, Tom Tugendhat has been one of Johnson’s most robust critics and has called for the Conservative Party to drop its focus on “divisive politics.”\n\nLaunching his leadership bid on Thursday in The Telegraph newspaper, Tugendhat wrote: “I have served before – in the military, and now in Parliament. Now I hope to answer the call once again as prime minister. It’s time for a clean start. It’s time for renewal.”\n\nHe outlined his vision for tackling the cost of living crisis, reducing taxes and investing in neglected regions of the UK.\n\nDespite not having any cabinet or shadow cabinet experience, Tugendhat has impressed colleagues with his oratory skills and seriousness, most notably when he spoke about the fall of Afghanistan. He entered parliament in 2015 after serving in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.\n\nSome key centrist Conservatives have already been throwing their support behind the relative wildcard, but some worry that his experience is too focused on foreign affairs.\n\nNadhim Zahawi\n\nBritain's newly appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer Nadhim Zahawi. Daniel Leal/AFP/Getty Images\n\nLess than two days after he was appointed by Johnson to the role of chancellor, replacing Sunak, Nadhim Zahawi publicly called on the prime minister to resign and later launched his bid to replace him.\n\nUntil his promotion, Zahawi, who joined the cabinet less than a year ago, was considered an unlikely choice as the next leader of the Conservative Party. But his rise under Johnson has been rapid, making his mark with early success as vaccines minister amid the coronavirus pandemic and then as education secretary.\n\nIn his pitch for leadership, previewed in The Spectator magazine, he promised to lower taxes for individuals, families and business, boost defense spending, and continue with education reforms he started in his previous role.\n\nDespite voting to leave the European Union in 2016, Zahawi is widely admired among the moderates in the party. Crucially, as one Conservative source put it, “he’s not been in government long enough to have any obvious defects and, despite supporting Boris even after the confidence vote, is not too tainted by association.”\n\nZahawi was born in Iraq to Kurdish parents and came to the UK as a child, when his family fled Saddam Hussein’s regime. He is believed to be one of the richest politicians in the House of Commons, and helped found the polling company YouGov.\n\n“If a young boy who came here aged 11 without a word of English, can serve at the highest levels of Her Majesty’s Government and run to be the next Prime Minister, anything is possible,” Zahawi is set to say in a speech Monday, an excerpt of which was published by The Spectator.\n\nJeremy Hunt\n\nConservative MP Jeremy Hunt. Chris J Ratcliffe/Getty Images\n\nA former health and foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt lost the 2019 leadership vote to Johnson. He has since styled himself as an antidote to Johnson and is without question the highest profile contender on the moderate, ex-Remain side of the party.\n\nHunt announced his bid to become the next Conservative leader in an interview with British newspaper The Sunday Telegraph, pitching himself as “the only major candidate who has not served in Boris Johnson’s government.”\n\nIn a statement on Twitter ahead of the confidence vote in June, Hunt said: “Anyone who believes our country is stronger, fairer & more prosperous when led by Conservatives should reflect that the consequence of not changing will be to hand the country to others who do not share those values. Today’s decision is change or lose. I will be voting for change.”\n\nTellingly, Hunt’s statement focused mainly on the Conservatives’ chances of electoral success under Johnson, rather than his policies or the partygate scandal – a decision that could be read as a pitch to the Conservative MPs and members who would decide a leadership election. However, he comes with baggage, and sources from the opposition Labour Party have told CNN they are already writing attack lines.\n\n“It can’t be Jeremy. Labour can say he was running healthcare for six years and failed to prepare for a pandemic. They can say when he was culture secretary he chummed up to the Murdochs during the phone hacking scandal. He will get crushed,” a senior Conservative source told CNN.\n\nGrant Shapps\n\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps. Phil Noble/Reuters\n\nThe transport secretary launched his bid for prime minister this weekend, describing himself as a “problem solver, with a proven record of delivery” in a post on Twitter.\n\nOutlining his vision for the UK in an interview with The Sunday Times newspaper, Grant Shapps said that within his first 100 days in office he would produce an emergency budget to lower tax for “the most vulnerable” and give state support to firms with high levels of energy consumption.\n\n“We have had two-and-a-half years of tactical government by an often distracted centre. This must end. We must be a strategic government, sober in its analysis, and not chasing the next headline,” the paper quoted Shapps as saying.\n\nThe MP for Welwyn Hatfield was elected in 2005 and has held several ministerial posts. He is also a former co-chair of the Conservative party.\n\nKemi Badenoch\n\nConservative MP Kemi Badenoch. Ben Cawthra/Shutterstock\n\nThe former equalities minister launched her leadership bid in an op-ed published by the Times of London newspaper, saying she wants a “strong but limited government focused on the essentials.”\n\nKemi Badenoch resigned from the government on Wednesday citing “issues” that had “come to light” and the way they had been handled.\n\n“I’m putting myself forward in this leadership election because I want to tell the truth. It’s the truth that will set us free,” she wrote Saturday. Badenoch, who voted in favor of Brexit in 2016, added she would run on a “smart and nimble centre-right vision.”\n\nSuella Braverman\n\nAttorney General Suella Braverman. Wiktor Szymanowicz/Future Publishing/Getty Images\n\nLast week, the attorney general called for Johnson to quit and said that she would join a leadership race to replace him, telling ITV “it would be the greatest honor.”\n\nLaunching her bid a few days later, Suella Braverman wrote in The Daily Telegraph: “I saw Brexit as the most important political decision of my life. My views are not triangulated or calibrated. They are as much a part of me as my DNA. I now realise that I cannot rely on others to take Conservatism forward.”\n\nBraverman was elected as MP for Fareham in 2015.\n\nRehman Chishti\n\nConservative MP Rehman Chishti. rehmanchishti.com\n\nAmong the biggest outsiders in the race, the newly appointed Foreign Office minister threw his hat into the ring on Sunday.\n\nBorn in Pakistan, Rehman Chishti moved to the UK at the age of six, learning English at school in Gillingham, Kent, the area of southeastern England that he has represented as an MP since 2010. He went on to become the first in his family to go to university and received his law degree.\n\n“It’s important to ensure that everyone who works hard, who’s determined, who perseveres, that they have a government that is on their side,” he said in a Facebook video announcing his candidacy, adding that he would ensure lower taxes and fresh ideas to improve people’s lives.", "authors": ["Eliza Mackintosh Luke Mcgee", "Eliza Mackintosh", "Luke Mcgee"], "publish_date": "2022/07/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/08/opinions/changing-britain-queen-elizabeth-beers/index.html", "title": "Opinion: For Britain, Queen Elizabeth left nothing undone", "text": "Editor’s Note: Laura Beers is a professor of history at American University.

Read more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nBritain has lost its most cherished symbol of continuity. Queen Elizabeth II, Britain’s longest reigning monarch, has died. She succeeded to that title in 2015, when she displaced Queen Victoria, Britain’s monarch from 1837 to 1901. The Queen celebrated her Platinum Jubilee this past February, marking 70 years on the throne.\n\nLaura Beers Laura Beers\n\nShe rose to leadership in the aftermath of the Second World War, at a time of rapid social and geostrategic change for Britain. Her coronation on June 2, 1953, was one of the first major televised events in Britain, and, in many ways heralded a new age of mass affluence in post-war Britain, with not only TVs, but cars, refrigerators and indoor plumbing becoming standard in British homes.\n\nHer Platinum Jubilee was a welcome excuse for Britons and Commonwealth subjects around the globe to come out in the streets and celebrate after harsh restrictions of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThose twin bookends of national crisis – world war and global pandemic – speak to the scope and meaning of the Queen’s longevity.\n\nThe past half century of British politics has witnessed a shift away from the national tendency to define historical epochs by monarchs – the Plantagenets, the Elizabethan era, the Georgian Era, the Regency, the long Victorian Era, the Edwardians – toward a more American tendency to cast history in terms of those elected representatives whose policies shaped the socio-economic and political landscape. And so, historians talk about the Thatcher era and the Blair Years, emphasizing the radical changes between the 1980s and the early millennium.\n\nIn part, this reflects the pace and extent of change that took place on the Queen’s watch. In part, it reflects the declining political significance of the monarch, who remains the ceremonial head of state but has long ago ceased to function as a head of government.\n\nBut, if we step back and survey the seven decades of the second Elizabethan era, there is a coherence to her time as Queen which future historians will almost certainly appreciate. Queen Elizabeth II oversaw the transformation of the British empire into a commonwealth of nations, and the United Kingdom into a devolved but unified confederacy of nation states.\n\nDuring her long reign, the shadow of past imperial misgovernance threatened to undermine the transition from empire to commonwealth abroad and poison efforts to foster a multiethnic British identity at home. Scottish nationalism and conflict in Northern Ireland risked the breakup of the United Kingdom.\n\nBut Britain, the commonwealth and the monarchy held together, in part owing to the stabilizing influence of the Queen. On Queen Elizabeth II’s watch, post-war Britain rebuilt itself in the wake of two devastating world wars, and became the modern nation celebrated to such fanfare in the London 2012 Olympic opening ceremonies – an international spectacle in which the Queen gamely played a starring role, alongside Daniel Craig’s James Bond.\n\nAnd in a country whose recent politics have been defined by increasing polarization and disunity dating back to the Brexit referendum in 2016, if not before, Queen Elizabeth has been one of the few figures capable of uniting the country. As an American expatriate living in Britain, I harbored an inherent skepticism of monarchy as an institution, but the Queen – so ubiquitous a national figure that my nursery-school aged son learned to celebrate her two birthdays before he could even remember his own – was a hard woman to dislike.\n\nHer father, George VI had reigned during the Second World War, when the British empire was one of the “Big Three” allied powers, alongside the United States and the Soviet Union, that defeated the Axis. In the decades after the war, Britain’s hard power declined considerably, as the bipolar politics of the USA v. the USSR came to dominated global politics.\n\nBut, as Britain’s hard power declined, its soft power soared. In the 1960s, Beatlemania swept first Britain and then the globe, and not only the Beatles, but the Rolling Stones, The Who, David Bowie, Queen and Elton John set the tempo for rock music for much of the next two decades. Over the years, the Queen would grant royal honors to Sir Paul McCartney, Sir Elton John and Sir Michael Jagger – although both David Bowie and John Lennon refused the royal honor, with Lennon explicitly citing the damage that the British empire had done in Africa.\n\nIn the 1990s, Britpop again put the country on the musical map, as the Spice Girls – whose 1997 photo ops with the Prince Charles and the Queen helped to cement the relationship between the monarchy and “Cool Britannia.”\n\nIn 1997, the Queen met girlband the Spice Girls after a variety performance in London. Here, she shakes hands with Geri 'Ginger Spice' Halliwell as the rest of the group look on. AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe decline of Britain’s imperial power during the Queen’s reign was coupled with new roles for Britain shaped by her membership in the Commonwealth of Nations, Europe and the Anglo-American special relationship.\n\nNot long after her coronation, Queen Elizabeth II began to witness the rising tide of colonial independence movements and the shift from a British empire defined by a metropolitan center and imperial dependencies to a commonwealth of 56 sovereign and equal nations united by a shared monarch. While based in Britain, the Queen was deeply committed to her role as head of the Commonwealth and spent much of her time on the throne traveling to other Commonwealth nations.\n\nShe was Britain’s head of state when the country entered the European Community (as the European Union was then known) in 1973 and when it voted to leave the EU in the 2016 Brexit referendum.\n\nShe has met personally with 13 of the last 14 US presidents, more recently when President Joe Biden visited her for tea at Balmoral in June 2021. (Lyndon Johnson was the only president not to meet the Queen during his time in office). Her statesmanship helped to cement the “special relationship” between Britain and the United States that became a pilar of British foreign policy after the Second World War.\n\nShe has formally appointed 15 prime ministers, including Prime Minister Liz Truss, who took office on Tuesday after traveling to Balmoral Castle in Scotland to meet with the ailing queen.\n\nOver the past several days, videos have surfaced of Truss as a teenage university student denouncing the institution of the monarchy, and asserting that, “I’m not against any of them personally, I’m against the idea that people can be born to rule. That people – because of the family they’re born into – should be able to be the head of state of our country: I think that’s disgraceful.” Last year, similar video footage surfaced of the Labour leader Keir Starmer joking that he “used to propose the abolition of the monarchy.”\n\nThe youthful comments of both party leaders were in contrast to their dignified statements of concern and condolence on Thursday. While some might suspect the sincerity of party leaders’ sentiments, in light of their professed republicanism, they are perhaps better taken as evidence of the affection and respect that the Queen has inspired even amongst those not predisposed to support the institution of monarchy.\n\nJust over 60% of Britons profess to support the British monarchy. Yet, a recent YouGov poll found that 75% percent of Britons liked the Queen, while only 8% disliked her. She had much higher approval ratings than her eldest son who will succeed her on the throne. Only 42% of Britons professed to like Charles, while 24% disliked him.\n\nEven self-professed republicans (anti-monarchists, not conservatives), are willing to acknowledge that the Queen lived up to the obligations conferred by her hereditary privilege and served honorably as head of state. And they like her for it.\n\nThe affinity between the Queen and her subjects was strengthened this past year when her husband Prince Philip passed away and she was seen sitting in isolation in St. George’s Chapel during his funeral, mourning her partner of 73 years. Images of the event sparked immense sympathy for the Queen, in particular amongst the thousands of Britons who had similarly lost loved ones during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe contrast between the Queen’s stoic observation of pandemic isolation requirements and the news that broke earlier this summer that members of former Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s office had thrown illegal “lockdown parties” at Downing Street on the eve of the funeral ignited national outrage at the now former prime minister and contributed directly to the calls for his removal.\n\nThe message was straight forward: the Queen had played by the law that governed herself as well as her subjects. The former prime minister had disrespected the British people and broken the bonds of trust between leaders and governed by behaving as if he were above the law.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nAs Britons and Commonwealth subjects around the globe mourn the loss of the Queen, there are important questions about what lies ahead for the country and the Commonwealth. While a majority of Britons still support the institution of the monarchy, there is little enthusiasm in Britain for the prospective King Charles III.\n\nIn other Commonwealth countries, such as Australia and Canada, polls have shown much less support for the monarchy’s continuation, despite strong affection of Queen Elizabeth. Jamaica recently announced plans to leave the commonwealth and become a republic by 2025.\n\nThe weeks and months to come will reveal whether or not the Commonwealth can outlast its longest serving monarch.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this piece misnamed the place of Prince Philip's funeral last year.", "authors": ["Laura Beers"], "publish_date": "2022/09/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/07/12/president-donald-trump-uk-visit-london/778124002/", "title": "President Donald Trump arrives to Britain in 'turmoil'", "text": "LONDON — President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump arrived at the opulent Blenheim Palace — the birthplace of wartime leader Winston Churchill — for a black-tie business dinner on Thursday, the evening of Trump's first visit to the United Kingdom as president.\n\nThe couple were welcomed at the palace in Oxfordshire — about 60 miles outside of London — by Prime Minister Theresa May and her husband Philip, before witnessing a performance by the Scots, Irish and Welsh Guards military bands. Anti-Trump protesters lined the road up to the building, but it is unlikely the Trumps — who arrived via helicopter — saw them.\n\n\"Time and again, the common threads that hold us together — our shared history, our shared values, our shared language and culture — conspire to inspire mutual respect, and to make the United States and the United Kingdom not just the closest of allies, but the dearest of friends,\" May said at the dinner, according to excerpts from her speech released before the event. She added that more than a million Americans work for British firms.\n\n\"Now, as we prepare to leave the European Union, we have an unprecedented opportunity to do more,\" she said. \"It’s an opportunity to reach a free trade agreement that creates jobs and growth here in the U.K. and right across the United States.\"\n\nMay is eager to secure a trade deal with the U.S. after the U.K. departs the EU next year.\n\nWoody Johnson, the U.S. ambassador to the U.K., said last week that Trump \"knows how important the special relationship (with the U.K.) is firsthand and that's why the bust of Churchill is actually in the Oval Office as we speak. This is not an accident.\"\n\nTrump's working visit comes days after he said the nation was “in somewhat turmoil\" following the resignations of two senior government figures over Brexit.\n\nThe Trumps landed Thursday afternoon local time at Stansted Airport, 40 miles northeast of the British capital. The couple took a 16-minute helicopter ride on Marine One to Winfield House, the U.S. ambassador’s residence in Regent’s Park, central London. Beatles music was playing in the background with a large group of people waiting in front of the house for what looked like a garden party to welcome Trump.\n\nHolding hands, the Trumps walked past the pool, together with Ambassador Johnson. Trump smiled but did not say a word. White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and National Security Adviser John Bolton followed close behind.\n\nThe Trumps participated in a meet and greet at the new $1 billion U.S. Embassy on the banks of the River Thames on Thursday. Trump has previously described the high-tech embassy as a “bad deal.”\n\nLarge scale protests expected here and across Britain prompted authorities to add extra security.

Another YouGov poll released shortly before Trump's arrival said half of Britons thought the visit should go ahead, and 37% thought it should be cancelled.\n\nTrump said at a news conference at the NATO summit in Brussels shortly before he left for Britain that he had no problem with the protests.\n\n“I think it’s fine, I think they like me a lot in the U.K., I think they agree with me on immigration,” he told reporters. “That’s why you have Brexit in the first place, because of immigration.”\n\nHigh levels of immigration and a desire for sovereignty were some of the reasons that Britons voted 52% to 48% to leave the 28-member European Union in a historic referendum in 2016.\n\nTrump questioned May's plans for leaving the EU. “The people voted to break it up, so I imagine that’s what they’ll do. But maybe they’re taking a little bit of a different route, so I don’t know if that’s what they voted for,” he said.\n\nWhen asked for his views on Brexit, which he has previously backed, Trump said “it’s not for me to say what they should be doing in the UK. I would say Brexit is Brexit. The people vote to break it up so I would imagine that’s what they’d do. I just want the people to be happy. They’re great people.”\n\nMay published a white paper of her Brexit plan Thursday, days after the resignations of Boris Johnson as foreign secretary and David Davis as Brexit secretary. The pair quit over May’s proposals to retain close trade ties with the EU after the U.K. leaves the alliance in March 2019 . Trump told reporters ahead of his Europe trip that he got along \"very well\" with May and that Johnson is a \"friend of mine.\"\n\nJohnson and Davis' resignations have added pressure for May to step down over her handling of Brexit as prime minister.\n\nMore: Diaper-clad 'Trump Baby' blimp to fly over London during president's visit\n\nRelated: Where Trump's going on his 7-day visit with NATO allies and Putin\n\nMore: What to expect when the Trumps meet Queen Elizabeth II\n\nAmnesty International hung a 50 foot-long banner emblazoned with the words “Human Rights Nightmare” and a large image of Trump on a bridge close to the new U.S. embassy.\n\nThe Bow Group, a conservative British think tank, said it would host a rally in parliament to back Trump. The organization said speakers will include pro-Brexit politician Nigel Farage — an associate of Trump’s.\n\nTrump on Friday holds talks on foreign policy with May at Chequers, the prime minister’s country home in Buckinghamshire – 47 miles outside London – before meeting the queen at Windsor Castle – 26 miles from the capital.\n\nTrump and the first lady then spend the weekend in Scotland, where Trump said he will visit his Turnberry golf course.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/07/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/05/24/trump-friend-boris-johnson-leading-race-replace-theresa-may/1202769001/", "title": "Trump 'friend' Boris Johnson leading race to replace Theresa May", "text": "LONDON – A U.S.-born British politician who once told USA TODAY in an interview that the chance of him becoming prime minister was about as likely as finding Elvis on Mars or being reincarnated as an olive, is the frontrunner to take over for outgoing British leader Theresa May, according to betting markets and opinion polls.\n\nBoris Johnson was born in New York City to British parents, but renounced his U.S. citizenship in 2016 amid a taxes crackdown by the Internal Revenue Service on the global earnings of dual nationals. He last lived in the United States as a 5-year-old.\n\n\"Boris Johnson is a friend of mine. He has been very, very nice to me, very supportive,\" President Donald Trump said in July last year after Johnson resigned as May's foreign secretary over her handling of Britain's attempt to leave the European Union – Brexit.\n\nLike Trump, Johnson appears to enjoy the limelight and attracts controversy. He was once forced into an apology to the nation of Papua New Guinea for comparing infighting in his Conservative Party to \"Papua New Guinea-style orgies of cannibalism and chief-killing.\" He was fired as a journalist for making up a quote.\n\nMay's fraught three-year tenure in office will officially end June 7, she announced Friday. The 62-year-old Conservative Party leader was forced from power, but she will remain as a caretaker prime minister until party lawmakers and members vote to elect a successor. In Britain, the public elects a party, not a candidate, meaning the government stays the same for now, until there is an election. The process is expected to take about six weeks. First, Conservative Party lawmakers hold a series of votes to whittle the field to two candidates. Then, those candidates are voted on by party members across the country.\n\nTheresa May:Britain's embattled leader resigns premiership amid Brexit deadlock\n\nExperts say that whoever ends up as Britain's next leader won't dramatically rewrite one of the closest diplomatic, economic and military alliances in history: The \"special relationship\" between the U.S. and Britain, a phrase and diplomatic modus operandi coined by former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill in 1946.\n\nBritish-American goodwill has accrued through two world wars, the Cold War, several conflicts in the Middle East and close cooperation in fighting international terrorism. Often, it's said, the two nations are divided only by a common language.\n\nTrump has described his relationship with May as the \"highest level of special,\" but the two leaders did clash on the substance of policy – his Muslim travel ban, in particular –and the new partnership is not expected to be all plain sailing and photo ops, either.\n\n\"The special relationship hasn't been so special recently,\" said Tim Bale, a politics professor at Queen Mary, University of London.\n\n\"Partly because the president couldn't stop himself criticizing the way May had gone about Brexit, and partly because she and other British politicians have been a little wary about associating themselves too closely with a guy who most Brits (rightly or wrongly) treat as either downright dangerous or a laughingstock, or both. Whoever takes over won't be looking for a full-on (b)romance.\"\n\nRichard Whitman, a professor of politics at the University of Kent, said the \"chemistry between May and Trump was awkward.\" But he said Johnson-Trump would be different, calling it a \"clash for the title of the greatest showman.\"\n\nMeet the main contenders\n\nBoris Johnson\n\nJohnson, 54, is the bookmakers' favorite to succeed May. He is a direct descendant of King George II — his full name is Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson — and he has passed through many hallowed corridors of the British establishment. There was Eton College and the University of Oxford, where he was in the same classes as former British Prime Minister David Cameron. In addition to foreign secretary, Johnson has been London's mayor. He also was a journalist, editing The Spectator, a longstanding political magazine. Johnson is a leading supporter of Brexit. He has spoken of his admiration for Trump on several occasions, although when mayor he also said the U.S. president was \"clearly out of his mind.\" Johnson is well-known in Britain for his tussled blonde hair and frequent classical allusions in speeches. One in four Britons think he would make a good prime minister, according to a survey by YouGov, a research firm.\n\nMichael Gove\n\nAnother prominent supporter of Britain leaving the EU, Gove, 51, is currently minister for the environment. He had a cabinet-level role in Cameron's government and he is viewed as a seasoned operator with extremely good debating skills. (While at Oxford, Gove was president of the debating society.) Like Johnson, Gove is also a former journalist and he made headlines in Britain when he secured the first interview with Trump for a British publication after his election in 2016. Gove boasted in that interview for the Times of London that he spent an hour with the president-elect in his \"glitzy, golden man cave\" in Trump Tower, in New York City. Trump told Gove that Britain was \"smart to leave the EU.\" Gove predicted Trump would resign or lose the 2020 election. If he ends up as Trump's new British counterpart, some of his comments out of the interview may come back to haunt him: \"He is someone who is clearly narcissistic or egotistical enough to want to be seen as a success,\" Gove said of Trump.\n\nSajid Javid\n\nJavid, 49, has held various cabinet-level positions in Conservative Party governments, most recently as home secretary, or interior minister. He is the son of a former bus driver from Pakistan and represents the relatively new face of British conservatism. Javid voted to stay in the EU in the referendum but has since campaigned aggressively for Britain to abide by the vote's outcome, and leave. He is known for taking a hard line on immigration and has been a fiercely vocal opponent of letting the wives and children of former Islamic State group fighters return to Britain. In one example, that of Shamima Begun, who fled to Syria's battlefields at 15, Javid is trying to revoke her citizenship in a case that mirrors that of New Jersey-born Hoda Muthana. The Trump administration is trying to block Muthana's return in a Washington court.\n\nAndrea Leadsom\n\nLeadsom, 56, was the last candidate standing against May in the 2016 race to succeed Cameron. She resigned Wednesday as leader of the House of Commons – a job responsible for arranging the order of government business in Britain's Parliament – in protest at May's then-refusal to step aside over Brexit. Leadsom is an ardent backer of Brexit but she stumbled during the leadership contest with May three years ago after she implied in an interview with a British newspaper that she thought she would make a better prime minister than May because being a mother gave her an \"advantage\" over the childless May. \"I have children who are going to have children who will directly be part of what happens next,\" Leadsom said in the BBC interview. Leadsom also appeared to inflate her experience working in financial services.\n\nDominic Raab\n\nRaab, 45, worked for an international law firm that litigated against war criminals before joining Britain's foreign diplomatic corp as an adviser in 2000. He has a black belt in karate and boxes regularly. Raab resigned as Brexit secretary in May's government so that he could vote against her EU withdrawal deal. He served only five months in the role. In interviews with the British press, Raab has spoken of wanting to get a \"fairer deal for working Britain.\" He would do this, he said, by cutting taxes.\n\nWho else could become Britain's next prime minister?", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/24"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/politics/956279/local-elections-polls-who-will-win-on-thursday", "title": "Local elections polls: who will win on Thursday? | The Week UK", "text": "We will use the details you have shared to manage your registration.
