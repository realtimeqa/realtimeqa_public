New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said Saturday that almost every firetruck in the city was stranded.\n\nThe National Weather Service said the snow total at the Buffalo Niagara International Airport stood at 43 inches Sunday. At least seven people have died in the area, some in their homes when responders couldn't reach them, officials said.\n\nIn Ohio, about 50 vehicles were involved in a pileup that killed at least four. An 82-year-old woman was found dead outside of her assisted care facility in Michigan on Friday.\n\nGLOBAL WARMING:Tempted to joke about global warming amid the freezing cold? Here's what experts say about that.\n\nThe system intensified Friday into a bomb cyclone, a weather phenomenon known for its powerful winds, heavy blizzards and subzero temperatures that are created through a process known as bombogenesis.\n\n'A welcome change': Warmer temperatures expected later this week\n\nTom Kines, a senior meteorologist at Accuweather, told USA TODAY that the snow band that hit Buffalo is pushing south of the city. Residents in the area, and swaths of the country, can expect warmer weather in the coming days.\n\n\"In general, the weather in Buffalo, and not only in Buffalo but across a large portion of the country, the trend is going to be for warmer weather for the upcoming week. In fact, Buffalo could easily get up in the 40s at some point during the second half of the week,\" Kines said.\n\nHe said residents of Chicago, Detroit, New York City, Washington D.C. and even Florida have seen \"unusually cold\" temperatures, but \"they’re also going to get much warmer.\"\n\n“It’ll be a welcome change coming up, the second half of the week,” Kines said.\n\nFamily braves storm to seek shelter\n\nDitjak Ilunga, of Gaithersburg, Maryland, was traveling with his daughters to visit family in Hamilton, Ontario, on Friday. The family’s SUV became trapped in Buffalo, and they spent hours in the car nearly buried in snow as wind whipped outside.\n\nAt 4 a.m. on Saturday, the family decided to try to reach a nearby shelter. Ilunga carried his 6-year-old daughter on his back, while his 16-year-old daughter carried their Pomeranian puppy. Ilunga said he cried when they finally reached the shelter.\n\n“If I stay in this car I’m going to die here with my kids,” he told the Associated Press he was thinking at the time. “It’s something I will never forget in my life.\"\n\nJackson, Mississippi residents must boil drinking water after lines burst\n\nCity officials announced on Christmas Day that residents of the Mississippi capital must boil their drinking water after water lines burst in cold temperatures.\n\n“Please check your businesses and churches for leaks and broken pipes, as these add up tremendously and only worsen the problem,” the city said in a statement. Officials also confirmed that crews were actively working to make repairs, though they did not confirm how long residents should expect to boil their drinking water.\n\nSome residents also reported low or no water pressure. Neighborhoods in the Mississippi city saw fluctuating water pressure on Saturday, with officials saying they believed the pressure drop was caused by leaks and water line breaks.\n\nCity spokesperson Melissa Payne said frigid temperatures were contributing to the breaks.\n\nThe disruption comes after the city lost water in late August, and ten of thousands of residents did not have running water during a 2021 cold snap.\n\nMigrants bused to vice president’s residence on freezing Christmas Eve\n\nA group of migrants was dropped off at Vice President Kamala Harris’ home in Washington, D.C., on Saturday night, when temperatures were below freezing.\n\nThe migrants were taken to local churches. Some of the migrants were seen without winter clothes, including some who were wearing T-shirts in on the frigid Christmas Eve.\n\nThe Migrant Solidarity Mutual Aid Network, which has been helping receive migrants in the nation's capital since the spring, said it was prepared for the arrivals on Saturday, CNN reported.\n\nThe buses were carrying 110 to 130 people, according to Tatiana Laborde, managing director of SAMU First Response, which has also served migrants in the city.\n\nThe move is not the first time a group of migrants has been transported to cities across the U.S. Multiple Republican governors have orchestrated the rides. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott sent two buses of Central and South American asylum seekers to the vice president’s Washington residence earlier this year.\n\nTexas authorities have not responded to USA TODAY's request for comment.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Abdullah Hasan in a statement to USA TODAY called the incident a \"cruel, dangerous and shameful stunt.\"\n\n“As we have repeatedly said, we are willing to work with anyone – Republican or Democrat alike – on real solutions, like the comprehensive immigration reform and border security measures President Biden sent to Congress on his first day in office, but these political games accomplish nothing and only put lives in danger,” Hasan said.\n\nBlizzard keeps going in Great Lakes, hard-hit Buffalo\n\nForecasters said snow would keep falling around the Great Lakes – up to 3 more feet through Monday in some areas of western New York.\n\nHigh winds, freezing temperatures and heavy snow have been plaguing the region for days, leading to whiteout conditions.\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul described the snowstorm hitting western parts of the state as \"one of the worst in history\" at a press briefing Saturday morning.\n\nA combination of snow, bitter cold and power outages prompted some Buffalo residents to leave their homes to seek heat. Hochul said the Buffalo Niagara International Airport will be closed through Monday morning.\n\nWhat is wind chill?\n\nMany of the temperatures with the winter storm were made more brutal by the wind chill factor. Meteorologists define wind chill as how cold it feels while outdoors, and it’s based on the rate of heat loss from exposed skin caused by the wind-and-cold combination, according to the National Weather Service. Increased wind draws heat from the body, which then lowers the temperature of the skin and internal body.\n\n“Frostbite may develop on exposed skin in as few as 10-20 mins, and hypothermia can quickly develop if you're not dressed for the cold,” weather service experts in Chicago warned Thursday.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/12/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/27/weather/arctic-winter-storm-new-york-blizzard-tuesday/index.html", "title": "Snow-inundated Buffalo faces more challenges in the aftermath of ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nDays into the deadly winter storm that bedeviled much of the country, the challenges are far from over for residents and authorities in Buffalo, New York.\n\nThe death toll continues to climb as authorities check on homes and cars for anyone who was stranded in the storm. At least 31 people died in New York’s Erie County as the storm buried Buffalo in up to 50.3 inches of snow. At least 25 others across 11 US states have been reported dead in the storm.\n\n“We’re, unfortunately, finding bodies on the street and in snow banks,” Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday evening.\n\n>> GET LIVE UPDATES\n\nMore than 7,000 utility workers were working around the clock to restore power in the area, navigating through broken trees and poles, according to Twitter posts from Poloncarz and National Grid US.\n\nLocal health officials were urgently responding to medical requests, including arranging transportation for people who need dialysis treatments – many of which were disrupted or delayed because of the storm. “Dialysis isn’t an optional or elective treatment. It has to be done regularly – several times a week – or that person dies,” the Erie County health department said.\n\nBuffalo police, meanwhile, arrested at least eight people by Tuesday afternoon in connection with business break-ins during the storm.\n\nAnd efforts of firefighters and other emergency vehicles working in the area were hampered by the hundreds of vehicles abandoned in the snow across Buffalo after fierce blizzard conditions made for blinding drives over the Christmas weekend, officials said.\n\nA driving ban remained in effect in Buffalo amid a two-day effort to clear at least one lane on every street to accommodate emergency responders, Poloncarz said at a news conference.\n\n“There’s a lot of roads that are completely blocked right now, that have no access whatsoever. And people are trying to drive on these roads or trying to get into these neighborhoods, and they can’t,” Poloncarz said.\n\n“Please, please,” he said. “I’m begging: Stay home. If it’s an emergency situation, call 911.”\n\nA weary Buffalo on Tuesday after days of winter weather that left parts of the city impassable. Joed Viera/AFP/Getty Images\n\nDriving ban in effect; flood mitigation\n\nBuffalo could see up to another half an inch of snow into Tuesday night and a daytime high of 30 degrees falling to 27 at night in New York’s second-most populous city.\n\nBut temperatures are expected to rise throughout the rest of the week, and local officials are worried that may cause flooding.\n\nThe flood risk is small, according to the National Weather Service, which said that snow melting alone “rarely causes flooding.” And even though there’s light rain forecast for the region, “it should take around an inch of rain from this system before flooding becomes a concern,” the weather service said.\n\nStill, the leader of Erie County’s Department of Homeland Security & Emergency Services said crews were working to prevent any possibility of floods.\n\nAs temperatures warm, authorities wanted “to make sure that we are cleared from curb to curb and as in many areas as possible so that when it melts it can run off and it can find its appropriate drainage,” commissioner Daniel Neaverth said.\n\nOther steps toward recovery include:\n\n• President Joe Biden on Monday approved an emergency declaration for New York, freeing up federal resources to help disaster relief efforts in Erie and Genesee counties.\n\n• One hundred military police from the New York National Guard are heading to Erie County, along with state police from other parts of New York, Poloncarz said. New Jersey state police will fill in for New York officers diverted to Buffalo, he said.\n\n• Buffalo Niagara International Airport is expected to stay closed until late Wednesday morning, the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority said, after snow equipment was brought in from Pittsburgh to help it reopen.\n\n• More supermarkets in western New York were expected to reopen after road conditions had paralyzed earlier efforts to distribute stockpiled ready-to-eat meals to food banks, officials said.\n\n• Major highways – including the New York State Thruway, Interstates 20 and 990, and Routes 400 and 219 – have reopened, the state Transportation Department’s Rochester office announced.\n\nIt was a signal, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a tweet, “that we are finally turning the corner on this once-in-a-generation storm.”\n\n‘Gut-wrenching’ effort to check on residents plods on\n\nThe storm in Buffalo has been deemed more ferocious than the blizzard of 1977, which left 23 people there dead. The weekend weather “was just horrendous,” Poloncarz said earlier. “And it was horrendous for 24 hours in a row.”\n\nIndeed, blizzard conditions were recorded for 37.5 hours, CNN meteorologist Tom Sater said, noting, “That just doesn’t happen.”\n\nEven emergency and recovery vehicles were at times stuck in snow. “We had rescuers rescuing the rescuers,” Buffalo Deputy Mayor Crystal Rodriguez-Dabney told “CNN This Morning” on Tuesday, adding those problems have been resolved.\n\nHundreds of vehicles were abandoned in the snow in Buffalo, New York State Police Acting Superintendent Steven Nigrelli said, adding authorities were going door-to-door, car-to-car, checking for people.\n\nA utility worker straps a rope to a truck in an attempt to tow another in Buffalo, New York, on Monday. Joed Viera/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOne reported death in Erie County was attributed to an EMS delay, while others involved people who were outside, in cars, had no heating or suffered cardiac arrest.\n\nThe death toll is expected to rise, officials have said. Once roads are cleared, law enforcement planned to prioritize welfare checks, Erie County Sheriff John Garcia said Monday.\n\n“I have a bad feeling about that. I think the death toll is going to go up. When you have 420 EMS calls that are unanswered, it’s just gut-wrenching,” the sheriff said as his team planned to help get “people to doctors, nurses, to hospitals and … dialysis.”\n\nBy Tuesday evening, there were “just under 2,000” residents without power across Buffalo, Mayor Byron W. Brown said on Twitter, adding officials were still working to restore power to everyone.\n\nGetting the lights back on has been no easy task as utility crews have faced dangerous weather conditions, Hochul said.\n\nPeople and vehicles move about Monday on Main Street in Buffalo. Craig Ruttle/AP\n\nMore than 50 have died nationwide in storm\n\nAt least 56 storm-related deaths have been reported across several states:\n\n• New York: In addition to the 31 deaths in Erie County, one fatal carbon monoxide poisoning has been reported in Niagara County.\n\n• Colorado: Police in Colorado Springs reported two deaths related to the cold since Thursday, with one man found near a power transformer of a building, possibly seeking warmth, and another in a camp in an alleyway.\n\n• Kansas: Three people have died in weather-related traffic accidents, the Highway Patrol said Friday.\n\n• Kentucky: Three people have died, officials have said, including one involving a vehicle crash in Montgomery County.\n\n• Missouri: One person died after a van slid off an icy road and into a frozen creek, Kansas City police said\n\n• New Hampshire: A hiker was found dead in Franconia on Christmas morning, Lt.

Blizzard or winter storm warnings were in effect for parts of Oregon, Nevada, Idaho, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, Colorado, and Nebraska.\n\n\"This system will then stall across the central Plains into Thursday, producing several days of heavy snow and blowing snow, including blizzard conditions, and freezing rain extending into the Upper Midwest,\" the National Weather Service Storm Prediction Center said in its advisory. \"Severe thunderstorms, tornadoes, and flooding will be possible in the South.\"\n\nPockets of those states could see 2 feet of snow, the center said. The weather service in Colorado said the storm would arrive late Monday and last through Tuesday, likely bringing \"whiteout conditions\" and road closures.\n\nBy Monday night, snow had started to fall over the northern mountains in Colorado causing roadways to be icy and snow packed, the weather service in Colorado said.\n\n\"Heavy snow will likely accumulate to more than 1 foot in some areas, which combined with strong winds will produce nearly impossible travel,\" the prediction center warned.\n\nThe storm was taking aim for the nation's heartland after smashing parts of Southern California with more than 7 inches of rain and blasting the Golden State's mountains with up to 5 feet of snow.

Across parts of Kansas, Oklahoma and northern Texas a \"significant risk\" to lives and property is expected to unfold late Monday and Tuesday, AccuWeather said.\n\nThe dangerous system could then target cities from Springfield, Missouri, and Little Rock, Arkansas, south to Houston and New Orleans. Some of the same cities and towns at risk for the severe thunderstorms were recently hit by a deadly tornado outbreak at the end of November.\n\n\"The drastic contrast of the warm, humid air ahead of the storm and the cold, dry air following the storm will create the right atmospheric conditions for an eruption of severe weather,\" said AccuWeather meteorologist Renee Duff.\n\nThe weather service said the south-central can also expect heavy snow and blizzard conditions and \"a wintry mix\" is likely in the north-central Plains and Upper Midwest on Tuesday.\n\nAs severe weather develops in the south-central, a tornado warning was issued in northern Texas and southern Oklahoma on Monday night, the weather service reported.

In fact, over the past 60 years, only two of the 33 worst Northeast snowstorms on record have hit in March, the National Weather Service said.\n\nHowever, both of those March storms were among the nation's top three most potent winter storms on record. Records for winter storms go back to 1956.\n\nMonday was the 24th anniversary of the so-called \"Storm of the Century\" (aka the \"Superstorm\") that walloped the eastern portion of the U.S. on March 14, 1993, and is regarded as the worst winter storm on record. That storm killed more than 270 Americans as it pounded 26 states and much of eastern Canada with heavy snow and howling winds.\n\nSnow fell all the way from Alabama to Maine, the Weather Channel reported, and caused a whopping $5 billion in damage, which is more than many hurricanes.\n\nWinter storms are rated by the Northeast Snowfall Impact Scale, which was developed by the weather service on a 1-5 scale similar to hurricanes. The March 1993 Superstorm is only one of two Category 5 winter storms on record.\n\nAnother disastrous March winter storm — the third-worst on that scale — was from March 2-5, 1960. That storm buried areas from western North Carolina to New England in at least 10 inches of snow and crushed the northern suburbs of the New York Tri-State and eastern New England with more than 20 inches, the Weather Channel said. The storm was rated a Category 4 storm.\n\nStorms are ranked about 1-2 days after the storm is over, the weather service said.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nIs Stella a weather bomb?\n\nStella forecast grows more ominous; millions under blizzard warning\n\nWinter Storm Stella is bearing down: What you need to know\n\nGoing back even further, the catastrophic \"Blizzard of 1888\" hammered the East Coast on March 12 of that year, and literally buried hundreds of cities, towns and villages from Maryland to Maine.

Travel was paralyzed for days.\n\nThe storm killed 400 people, 200 in New York City alone, according to the book American Weather Stories. \"Men, women and children died in city streets, in country fields, and on ice-choked ships and boats,\" the book said.

At least 1 in 5 Americans live with chronic pain. Some experts put the figure at 100 million. And nearly 1 in 10 are disabled by it. To better understand it, USA TODAY spoke with 50 pain experts and people who experience chronic pain for a five-part series of stories. Chronic pain – pain that lasts longer than 3 months – is inseparable from the opioid crisis, as nothing else is as effective at treating excruciating pain. And efforts to keep opioids off the street have often gone overboard, experts say, depriving those in real need.

And with the highest inflation in a generation, people are finding that switching to cheaper brands just isn't enough to lower the tab. Many shoppers are turning to something unconventional – expired food. Even if eating outdated or short-dated food sounds unappetizing, it's actually safe and a way to save money and cut food waste. Nearly 40%, or 108 billion pounds, of food is wasted in the United States each year, according to ReFED, a nonprofit dedicated to ending food loss and waste. So is it safe? Most of the time – though the food might not taste as good as if you had eaten it earlier. And experts say about 80% of Americans throw food away too early because of confusion over date labels.

By Monday, air travel was more or less back to normal – unless you booked your holiday travel with Southwest Airlines.\n\nMore than 90% of Wednesday’s US flight cancellations were Southwest flights, according to flight tracking website FlightAware. Southwest canceled more than 2,500 flights. The next highest: SkyWest, with 77.\n\nSouthwest warned that it would continue canceling flights until it could get its operations back on track. The company’s CEO said this has been the biggest disruption he’s seen in his career. The Biden administration is investigating.\n\nWhat gives? Southwest had a combination of bad luck and bad planning.\n\nThe storm hit Chicago and Denver hard, where Southwest has two of its biggest hubs – Chicago Midway airport and Denver International airport.\n\nMore bad luck: The storm hit just as the so-called tripledemic surged across America, leaving people and their families sick with Covid, the flu and RSV. Although Southwest says it was fully staffed for the holiday weekend, illness makes adjusting to increased system stress difficult. Many airlines still lack sufficient staff to recover when events like bad weather cause delays or flight crews max out the hours they’re allowed to work under federal safety regulations.\n\nUnderinvestment\n\nBut Southwest (LUV) also hurt itself with an aggressive schedule and by underinvesting in its operations.\n\nSouthwest’s schedule includes shorter flights with tighter turnaround times, which are causing some of the problems, Kathleen Bangs, a FlightAware spokesperson, told CNN.\n\n“Those turnaround times bog things down,” Bangs said.\n\nStranded customers have been unable to get through to Southwest’s customer service lines to rebook flights or find lost baggage.\n\nEmployees also said they have not been able to communicate with the airline, the president of the union that represents Southwest’s flight attendants told CNN Monday.\n\n“The phone system the company uses is just not working,” Lyn Montgomery, President of TWU Local 556, told CNN’s Pamela Brown. “They’re just not manned with enough manpower in order to give the scheduling changes to flight attendants, and that’s created a ripple effect that is creating chaos throughout the nation.”\n\nOn a call with employees Monday, Southwest Chief Operating Officer Andrew Watterson explained that the company’s outdated scheduling software quickly became the main culprit of the cancellations once the storm cleared, according to a transcript of the call that was obtained by CNN from an aviation source.\n\nThe extreme cold, ice and snow grounded planes and left some crew members stranded, so Southwest’s crew schedulers worked furiously to put a new schedule together, matching available crew with aircraft that were ready to fly. But the Federal Aviation Administration strictly regulates when flight crews can work, complicating Southwest’s scheduling efforts.\n\n“The process of matching up those crew members with the aircraft could not be handled by our technology,” Watterson said.\n\nSouthwest ended up with planes that were ready to take off with available crew, but the company’s scheduling software wasn’t able to match them quickly and accurately, Watterson added.\n\n“As a result, we had to ask our crew schedulers to do this manually, and it’s extraordinarily difficult,” he said. “That is a tedious, long process.”\n\nWatterson noted that manual scheduling left Southwest building an incredibly delicate house of cards that could quickly tumble when the company encountered a problem.\n\n“They would make great progress, and then some other disruption would happen, and it would unravel their work,” Watterson said. “So, we spent multiple days where we kind of got close to finishing the problem, and then it had to be reset.”\n\nIn reducing the company’s flights by two thirds, Southwest should have “more than ample crew resources to handle that amount of activity,” Watterson said.\n\nA lack of tools\n\nThe problems Southwest faces have been brewing for a long time, said Captain Casey Murray, the president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association.\n\n“We’ve been having these issues for the past 20 months,” he told CNN. “We’ve seen these sorts of meltdowns occur on a much more regular basis and it really just has to do with outdated processes and outdated IT.”\n\nHe said the airline’s operations haven’t changed much since the 1990s.\n\n“It’s phones, it’s computers, it’s processing power, it’s the programs used to connect us to airplanes – that’s where the problem lies, and it’s systemic throughout the whole airline,” he said.\n\nSouthwest CEO Bob Jordan, in a message to employees obtained by CNN, acknowledged many of Murray’s concerns, and promised the company will invest in better systems.\n\n“Part of what we’re suffering is a lack of tools,” Jordan told employees. “We’ve talked an awful lot about modernizing the operation, and the need to do that.”\n\nHe said the airline is “committed to and invested in” improving its systems, but “we need to be able to produce solutions faster.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Tuesday urged consumers to check if they’re eligible for compensation as cascading airline delays have disrupted holiday travel across the country.\n\n“Our Administration is working to ensure airlines are held accountable,” Biden tweeted.\n\nThe US Department of Transportation said it is investigating.\n\n“USDOT is concerned by Southwest’s unacceptable rate of cancellations and delays & reports of lack of prompt customer service,” the agency tweeted. “The Department will examine whether cancellations were controllable and if Southwest is complying with its customer service plan.”\n\nTo recover, Jordan told the Wall Street Journal the company plans to operate just over a third of its schedule in upcoming days to give itself the ability for crews to get into the right positions.\n\nNot Southwest’s first rodeo\n\nIf this is all ringing a bell, that’s because this isn’t the first time Southwest’s service melted down in epic fashion. In October 2021, Southwest canceled more than 2,000 flights over a four-day period, costing the airline $75 million.\n\nSouthwest blamed that service meltdown on a combination of bad weather in Florida, a brief problem with air traffic control in the area and a lack of available staff to adjust to those problems. It has admitted it was having service problems caused by short staffing even before the thousands of canceled flights stranded hundreds of thousands of passengers.\n\nSimilar to this month’s service mayhem, Southwest fared far worse than its competitors last October. While Southwest canceled hundreds of flights in the days following the peak of October’s disruption, competitors quickly returned to normal service.\n\nLater that month, on a call with Wall Street analysts, then-CEO Gary Kelly said the company had made adjustments to prevent a similar meltdown in the future.\n\n“We have reined in our capacity plans to adjust to the current staffing environment, and our ontime performance has improved, accordingly,” said Kelly on October 21. “We are aggressively hiring to a goal of approximately 5,000 new employees by the end of this year, and we are currently more than halfway toward that goal.”\n\nAnd, just like the latest disruption, the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association claimed the cancellations were due to “management’s poor planning.”\n\n– CNN’s Ross Levitt contributed to this report", "authors": ["David Goldman"], "publish_date": "2022/12/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/flights/todayinthesky/2018/06/19/american-airlines-psa-airlines-regional-flights-still-snarled-glitch/713653002/", "title": "Thousands of American Airlines fliers stranded after partner's ...", "text": "LATEST UPDATE: American Airlines said on Wednesday that it's close to returning to normal operations after a week of heavy cancellations at one of its regional affiliates.

American’s hub in Charlotte has shouldered the bulk of the disruption, though the carrier’s hubs at Philadelphia and Washington Reagan National also have been hit with glitch-related cancellations.\n\nThe issue is specific to American’s PSA regional carrier, which flies 50- to 76-seat regional jets that feed passengers to American’s hubs. The glitch is not affecting any of American’s “mainline” flights or flights on other partners, but passengers scheduled to connect to or from those flights via PSA might be affected if their connecting flights are canceled.\n\nSocial media feeds have lit up with complaints, with some American customers saying they’ve been stuck for days waiting for open seats after cancellations to their originally scheduled PSA fights.\n\n\"We do not know when this is going to be fixed,\" American spokeswoman Katie Cody told The Charlotte Observer, which covers American’s hardest-hit hub in Charlotte. \"We're incredibly sorry.\"\n\n“This could not happen at a worse possible time,” Henry Harteveldt, a San Francisco-based travel analyst at Atmosphere Research Group, added to the Observer, noting the disruption comes at the beginning of the peak summer travel season.\n\nLines ballooned at the Charlotte airport's car rental agencies as fliers looked for other ways to get to their destinations, according to the Observer. The newspaper added that American picked up the tab for about 800 hotel rooms for stranded passengers.\n\nIt was not clear exactly when things might return to normal for American customers whose itineraries include flights on PSA.\n\nPSA's technical issue involved problems with its crew scheduling and tracking system, according to the Dallas Business Journal.\n\n\"We're having issues getting the crews assigned to the planes correctly,\" Cody said to the Observer on Monday.\n\nAmerican posted a formal statement to its website on Tuesday, saying the computer issue had been “stabilized” but that PSA schedules would be reduced this week to give more slack to the recovery effort.\n\nPSA flies about 800 flights a day under American’s regional American Eagle brand, accounting for about 12% of American’s entire daily schedule.\n\nThe lingering problems forced PSA to cancel all of its flights Tuesday (June 19) morning “as it works through schedules, getting aircraft and crews where they need to be to resume operations,” American said in its statement.\n\n“PSA will operate a reduced scheduled over the next few days as it restores full service,” American added.\n\nThe company also offered a formal apology to affected customers.\n\n“We understand that these cancellations have been frustrating for our customers, and teams from PSA and American have been working around the clock to get things back to normal as quickly as possible,” American said in its statement, “We are rebooking passengers and American's Customer Relations department continues to reach out all affected customers.

This includes the contents of the bags, up to $3,800 (although the airline can choose to pay more.)\n\nSevere bad weather over Christmas week forced the airline to make operational changes and while other airlines bounced back quickly, Buttigieg told CNN that Southwest's \"system has really completely melted down.\"\n\nThe airline told USA TODAY that \"baggage is difficult to recover\" following the large disruption of their operation schedule this week and that its customer service lines are experiencing \"abnormally high call volumes.\"\n\nTravelers can file a baggage report online or in-person at the airport to get reunited with their luggage, a Southwest Airlines spokesperson said.\n\nSouthwest Airlines said they \"will make every attempt to reconnect customers with their baggage at no cost to the customer.\"\n\nHow are people finding their lost bags?\n\nEvery day since Saturday, Sarah Farrell has been going to Denver International Airport in hopes that her checked luggage – packed with gear for her toddler and Christmas presents for the family – will show up.\n\nHer family's Saturday flight to Florida to spend Christmas with her husband's family was canceled and they were unable to rebook another affordable flight. This trip was going to be the first time her kids would meet their cousins, a meeting delayed because of the pandemic, she said.\n\nFarrell said she was told by baggage agents for the airline that \"they may or may not ever go to your destination ... there's nothing we can do.\" On Christmas Day, she said she spent seven hours on hold with the airline's customer service only to have the call dropped.\n\nShe's worried that her bags do end up in Florida.\n\nPeople like Farrell have taken to social media to crowdsource and locate each other's items out of the collective frustration. Farrell has helped owners find musical instruments, strollers and car seats by texting the phone numbers on luggage tags.\n\nTaira Meadowcroft is one of the lucky people who learned where her bag was from someone like Farrell. On Christmas Day, Meadowcroft's flight from St. Louis to Tampa, Florida, changed its destination to Orlando after she waited approximately 11 hours at the airport. Once at Orlando International Airport, she spent two hours trying to find out if her bags arrived with her.\n\n\"(Southwest) couldn’t 100% say where it would end up but that they’d make a note to send it to Tampa and call me when it arrived,\" she said. So she drove more than two hours home to Tampa.\n\nOn Monday evening, Meadowcroft got a text from a random number saying her bag was at Tampa International Airport.\n\n\"I definitely count myself lucky because I was without my bag a short time compared to others,\" she said. \"But I'm so glad that kind person texted me because I had medicine in there I forgot to put in my carry-on.\" She said Southwest has never notified her about her suitcase.\n\nWhat happens if your checked bag is lost? What if it's delayed? Here's what you're owed, what to do.\n\nWill people get reimbursed for extra expenses while stranded?\n\nFederally, airlines are not required to reimburse people for hotel rooms, cabs or other nonairline ticket costs because of cancellations, so it's up to the airline to decide. Southwest has said, \"We will honor reasonable requests for reimbursement for meals, hotel, and alternate transportation.\"\n\nStuck in Austin, Texas, Smriti Singh has spent four hours almost every day since Sunday trying to find her luggage.\n\nSingh had just finished school at Texas A&M University and packed all her belongings in suitcases, ready to hop on a flight to San Jose on Christmas Day via Southwest Airlines.

Monday flights better, but some delays", "text": "Ben Mutzabaugh\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nDelta Air Lines’ flight operation appears to be running near normal Monday morning, ending a five-day run of extreme disruptions to the carrier’s schedules.\n\nThe airline had canceled only four flights as of 2 p.m. ET, though its delay count had been creeping up since morning, according to flight-tracking service FlightStats.\n\nDelta spokesman Michael Thomas said in a statement to Today in the Sky that the airline “expects to operate more than 99% of its scheduled operations Monday,” though he warned “a small number of residual cancellations may be possible.”\n\nFlightStats showed that about 250 of Delta's \"mainline\" flights were running late, representing roughly 10% of the carrier's daily schedule. And that figure didn't count flights on regional affiliates like SkyWest and ExpressJet, which combined for more than 270 delayed flights of their own.\n\nStill, it appears that Delta has finally come close to resetting its operations after an extended round of severe weather sent its schedules into a tailspin last Wednesday. The carrier has canceled more than 3,000 flights and delayed thousands more during the five-day stretch.\n\nDelta’s problems were exacerbated Thursday when storms slowed Thursday flights Delta’s hubs in New York and Detroit. Those problems were less severe than the ones that slammed into Georgia and the Southeast on Wednesday, but they only seemed to knock Delta’s operation further off track.\n\nFLIGHT TRACKER: Is your flight on time?\n\nThe 'boneyard': Where airlines send old planes to be scrapped\n\nThe carrier canceled hundreds of more flights into the weekend and delayed thousands of others, forcing tens of thousands of customers to scramble for new plans right as the busy spring break travel season picked up steam.\n\nDelta apologized to customers and was waiving change fees for many customers looking for new flight options following the operational meltdown. But the company also warned fliers that finding empty seats in the coming weeks could be challenging because “heavy spring break travel means open seats are very limited for rebooking.”\n\nThe scope of the disruption to Delta’s network that began with the Wednesday storms has been surprisingly large. It marks the airline’s worst operational run since a computer outage in August 2016 plunged the airline into crisis mode. And it was just this past January that another computer issue caused a disruption that spanned two days and caused the cancellation of nearly 300 flights and delays to many others.\n\nARCHIVES (2016): Delta lost $100M on computer outage | Delta outage a hard hit to reliable brand: Column | Q&A: Delta CEO on outage, efforts to 'win back' passengers |\n\nIN PICTURES: Delta customers tough out reservations glitch in 2016 (story continues below)\n\nDelta has blamed Wednesday’s “unprecedented” storms and the ensuing stormy weather later in the week for keeping its crews and aircraft off schedule. More than half the carrier’s planes fly through the airline’s busy Atlanta hub on a typical day, so a severe shutdown there could indeed wreak havoc on the company’s nationwide flight schedule.\n\nFederal regulations setting rest rules and limits on flight time also made it difficult to find crews able to fill in for off-schedule flights, Delta has added.\n\nBut at least some pilots complained to CNN that kinks in Delta’s employee communication channels also have hindered the carrier’s recovery.\n\nFor now, even with its schedules apparently on the mend, Delta faces the unenviable task of getting thousands of stranded passengers on to their final destinations. That will be no small challenge with flights already packed with spring break fliers.\n\nTODAY IN THE SKY: Bad news for fliers? American, Delta to end 'interline' pact (2015)\n\nFurther complicating Delta’s ability to help fliers affected by the operational woes is the 2015 termination of an “interline” agreement with American that allowed the airlines to easily put passengers on each other's flights.\n\nThat ended when Delta hiked the pre-negotiated rates it would have charged American to put passengers on its flights. At the time, Delta said that the number of passengers American was sending to Delta during “irregular operations” – such as weather – far outstripped the number Delta was sending to American.\n\nBut, American balked at the terms and the deal was terminated. Now, Delta agents can only transfer stranded fliers (and their bags) to American -- the USA's largest carrier -- by buying full-fare tickets, which is uncommon in the industry.\n\nTWITTER: You can follow Today in the Sky editor Ben Mutzabaugh at twitter.com/TodayInTheSky\n\nTODAY IN THE SKY: World's strangest-looking airplane?

Despite clear and relatively calm conditions, more than 5% of the entire day’s schedule was canceled at the airport and about one out of every four flights that did operate did so with a delay. Delta operates more than half of the flights at MSP, while flights on operated by its regional affiliates account for even more there.\n\nNationally, the carrier was waiving change fees for customers looking to change their travel plans after the week's disruptions.

Delta operates its busiest hub in Atlanta, and the disruption quickly led to a wave of delays and cancellations that cascaded across the carrier's network.\n\n\n\nBy Thursday, storms in the Northeast and Great Lakes hit more Delta hubs.

But delays remained a major issue, affecting several of airline's hubs across the nation.\n\nIn Atlanta, about 90 flights were canceled but more than 640 were delayed. Those totals account for more than 25% of the day’s schedule at the world’s busiest airport, where Delta is by far the dominant carrier.\n\nAt Salt Lake City International Airport, another hub where Delta accounts for the majority of flights, more than 15% of Sunday’s flights were running late as of 7:30 p.m. ET, according to FlightAware. It was a similar story at Detroit and Minneapolis/St. Paul – also Delta hubs – with FlightAware showing delays to 10% of the day’s schedules at those airports.\n\nWhile the delays affecting Delta’s hubs Sunday were a significant nuisance for fliers, flight operations were trending in the right direction for Delta. The number of canceled flights had fallen dramatically since the end of the week, raising hope -- however faint -- that Delta could see close-to-normal operations by the start of the workweek on Monday.\n\nHowever, that likely won’t be the end of the story for Delta, which prides itself on being the most punctual and reliable of the USA’s “big four” airlines. Once schedules return to normal, expect Delta to face scrutiny about how one day of thunderstorms cascaded into five days of delays and cancellations.\n\nStay tuned …\n\nTODAY IN THE SKY: The 'boneyard': Where airlines send old planes to be scrapped\n\nIN PICTURES: 30 cool aviation photos", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/04/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2021/08/11/fact-check-false-claim-vaccine-rules-caused-flight-cancellations/5553567001/", "title": "Fact check: False claim that vaccine rules caused flight cancellations", "text": "The claim: U.S. flights are backed up because pilots and crew members are refusing vaccine mandates\n\nWith a surge in summer domestic air travel and passenger volumes at pre-pandemic levels, some U.S. airlines have struggled to meet the demand, resulting in a wave of flight cancellations and delays.\n\nAirlines say the disrupted flights are due to bad weather, staffing issues and operational challenges, among other factors. But, of course, some social media users see something more nefarious at play.\n\n“BREAKING! FLIGHTS ACROSS AMERICA ALL BACKED UP BC PILOTS/CREW ARE WALKING OFF BOARDED FLIGHTS!” reads an Aug. 9 Facebook post, which gained more than 2,000 shares within a few days. “THEY ARE REFUSING THE MANDATED JAB.”\n\nAccompanying the text is an image of a flight information display board on Aug. 1 at Fort Lauderdale Hollywood International Airport. The screens show delayed or canceled flights by Spirit Airlines.\n\nThis claim is wrong on several fronts. The flight cancellations and delays have nothing to do with vaccine mandates, and a majority of major U.S. airlines do not have vaccine requirements in place.\n\nFact check:Workers fired for refusing a vaccine are unlikely to qualify for unemployment\n\nThe Facebook user who shared the post did not return a request for comment.\n\nAirlines cite weather, operational challenges\n\nSpirit, American and other airlines have been canceling hundreds of flights a day, but it has nothing to do with vaccine mandates.\n\nAmerican spokeswoman Sarah Jantz said the airline experienced prolonged weather issues on the weekend the Facebook photo was captured.\n\n\"The nine-hour weather event resulted in flight delays, cancellations and almost 100 diversions,\" Jantz said via email.\n\nSpirit CEO Ted Christie told USA TODAY weather, technology issues and crew shortages have caused disrupted flights. Similarly, American spokesman Curtis Blessing told USA TODAY the airline's cancellations are due to \"prolonged and severe\" weather that started on Aug. 1, which temporarily delayed flights and closed two ramps at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, its home base.\n\nMeanwhile, Dennis Tajer, spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association, said a majority of flight cancellations that took place on Aug. 2 were due to a pilot shortage and scheduling issues.\n\nAt the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many airlines let go of pilots and flight attendants. Bloomberg reported in July 2020 that about 400,000 airline workers were fired, furloughed or told they may lose their job.\n\nAs a result, airlines are scrambling to hire back workers, who are required to undergo extensive training and security clearances.\n\nAdditionally, a majority of airline carriers retired older planes from their fleets in an effort to save cash, but the travel demand returned sooner than airlines expected.\n\nData from the Transportation Security Administration shows 10.1 million people were screened nationwide between July 1 and July 5, setting a new pandemic-era record.\n\nOn top of weather and labor shortages, some U.S. airports are running into fuel shortages, which are expected to last through mid-August, the Associated Press reported.\n\nFact check: Pfizer CEO fully vaccinated, canceled Israel trip in March\n\nMany US airlines don't have vaccine mandates\n\nThe post claims pilots are refusing vaccine mandates, but only a few major airlines have implemented policies requiring all employees get vaccinated. And some of those have not yet taken effect.\n\nUnited Airlines recently announced that employees in the U.S. must be vaccinated against COVID-19 by Oct. 25. United spokeswoman Leslie Scott said more than 90% of its pilots and 80% of flight attendants are already vaccinated.\n\n\"We’ve received overwhelmingly supportive feedback from other workgroups across the company since announcing the vaccine requirement last week,\" Scott said via email.\n\nHawaiian Airlines has said it will also require vaccination, while Frontier Airlines said all employees must be vaccinated by Oct. 1 or provide proof of a negative test on a regular basis.\n\nOther U.S. airlines have encouraged that their staff get vaccinated, however, they have not mandated it.\n\nAmerican CEO Doug Parker told The New York Times he would not be imposing a vaccine mandate for staff or passengers, saying it \"wouldn’t be physically possible to do without enormous delays in the airline system.\"\n\nIn May, Delta announced new hires in the U.S. would be required to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and that current employees are strongly encouraged to get vaccinated. Southwest and Spirit have announced they are encouraging employees to get vaccinated but not requiring it.\n\nClaims that British Airways was concerned about the risk posed by vaccinated pilots, along with claims that airlines are banning vaccinated people from flying, have been previously debunked.\n\nFact check: COVID-19 vaccine mandates don't violate Nuremberg Code\n\nOur rating: False\n\nBased on our research, we rate FALSE the claim that flights in the U.S. are being canceled because airline employees are refusing the COVID-19 vaccine. Airlines say the recent flight cancellations are due to labor shortages, bad weather, fuel shortages, operational issues and scheduling troubles. United and Hawaiian are the only major U.S. airlines so far to implement a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for all employees.\n\nOur fact-check sources:\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

Snowstorm\n\nDays into a deadly winter storm that disrupted travel nationwide, officials in Buffalo, New York, are plowing roads to get to stranded drivers and make way for emergency services. At least 27 people have died as a result of the storm in New York’s Erie County, many of them in Buffalo, which was buried under 43 inches of snow and slammed with severe blizzard conditions. Last week’s winter weather travel mess continues to linger into this week, with more than 3,900 flights within, into or out of the US canceled as of Monday night – a majority of them operated by Southwest Airlines, according to flight tracking website FlightAware. Frustrated travelers complained about long wait times to speak with representatives and problems with lost bags. One passenger told CNN her family was on the phone for 10 hours with Southwest.\n\n2. Ukraine\n\nRepeated attacks by Russia on Ukraine’s power grid have left the capital of Kyiv in the dark, a potentially deadly risk to people who use lifesaving medical devices. Russia’s persistent assault on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure has, at least temporarily, left millions of civilians without electricity, heat, water and other critical services in the freezing winter months. Russian President Vladimir Putin is now calling for negotiations in his war – even as his own foreign minister gave Ukraine an ultimatum over four occupied regions, according to Russian state media. A Ukrainian presidential adviser fired back in a tweet, saying, “Putin needs to come back to reality.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said Russia will try to make the last few days of the year “dark and difficult.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 12-year-old boy needs breathing treatments to survive.

China\n\nChina will drop Covid-19 quarantine requirements for international arrivals beginning on January 8 – a major step toward reopening its borders that have shut off the country from the rest of the world for nearly three years. Inbound travelers will only be required to show a negative Covid test result obtained within 48 hours before departure, China’s National Health Commission announced late Monday. Currently, travelers are subject to five days of hotel quarantine and three days of self-isolation at home. Restrictions on airlines over the number of international flights and passenger capacity will also be removed, according to the announcement. China has sealed its borders since March 2020 to prevent the spread of the virus, keeping itself in global isolation even as the rest of the world reopened and moved on from the pandemic.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Scenes in major Beijing crematorium tell a different story from official Covid death numbers 03:15 - Source: CNN\n\n4. Extreme weather\n\nWeather-related tragedies have not been limited to the US. In northern Japan and in other parts of the country, heavy snow has left at least 17 people dead and more than 90 others injured over the Christmas weekend, authorities said. Japan has seen increasingly adverse weather conditions in recent years, including a heat wave this summer. And in the Philippines, floods triggered by heavy rains killed at least eight people in the southern provinces and forced thousands of residents to evacuate, disrupting Christmas celebrations. Nearly 46,000 people sought shelter in evacuation centers, according to data from the Social Welfare Ministry.\n\n5. Immigration\n\nThere are nearly 1.6 million asylum applications pending in US immigration courts and at US Citizenship and Immigration Services – the largest number of pending cases on record, according to a recent analysis of federal data. Immigration courts have seen a massive increase in asylum cases from fiscal year 2012, when there were 100,000 pending cases. The asylum seekers are from 219 countries and speak 418 different languages, according to the group that conducted the analysis. About three out of 10 are minors and the leading countries of origin include Guatemala, Venezuela, Cuba and Brazil. Meanwhile, some state officials remain at odds with President Joe Biden’s administration over the country’s immigration policy. In the latest sign of the dispute, several busloads of migrants were dropped off outside of the residence of Vice President Kamala Harris in Washington, DC, in freezing weather on Christmas Eve.\n\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\n\n2022 left some of our favorite foods in the garbage heap of history\n\nFrom the McRib to the Choco Taco, here are six foods we lost this year.\n\nLizzo broke down in tears after flutist James Galway sent her a message\n\nCelebrities, they’re just like us.\n\nA meteorite that crashed in Somalia had two new minerals in it\n\nMeet scientists’ latest discoveries, elaliite and elkinstantonite.\n\nBuccal fat removal is taking over social media\n\nHere’s what you need to know about the controversial cosmetic surgery.\n\nA cryptocurrency scam is costing Americans millions of dollars\n\nIt’s called “pig butchering,” and it has nothing to do with farm animals.\n\nIN MEMORIAM\n\nKathy Whitworth, the winningest golfer in history, died at age 83 while celebrating Christmas Eve with family and friends, her longtime partner said.

Individuals may coerce victims into providing sexually explicit images or videos of themselves, often in compliance with offenders’ threats to post the images publicly or send the images to victims’ friends and family.\n\nOther offenders may make casual contact with children online, gain their trust, and introduce sexual conversation that increases in egregiousness over time. Ultimately this activity may result in maintaining an online relationship that includes sexual conversation and the exchange of illicit images, to eventually physically meeting the child in-person.\n\nIn order for the victimization to stop, children typically have to come forward to someone they trust — typically a parent, teacher, caregiver or law enforcement, the agency stated. The embarrassment of being enticed and/or coerced to engage in unwanted behavior is what often prevents children from coming forward. Offenders may have hundreds of victims around the world, so coming forward to help law enforcement identify offenders may prevent countless other incidents of sexual exploitation.\n\nAbuse can occur offline through direct contact with another individual. During these uncertain conditions, where time with other adults and caregivers has increased immensely, parents/guardians should communicate with their children about appropriate contact with adults and watch for any changes in behavior, including an increase in nightmares, withdrawn behavior, angry outbursts, anxiety, depression, not wanting to be left alone with an individual, and sexual knowledge.\n\nParents and guardians are urged to take the following measures to help educate and prevent children from becoming victims of child predators and sexual exploitation during this time of national emergency:\n\nDiscuss Internet safety with children of all ages when they engage in online activity.\n\nReview and approve games and apps before they are downloaded.\n\nMake sure privacy settings are set to the strictest level possible for online gaming systems and electronic devices.\n\nMonitor your children’s use of the Internet; keep electronic devices in an open, common room of the house.\n\nCheck your children’s profiles and what they post online.\n\nExplain to your children that images posted online will be permanently on the Internet.\n\nMake sure children know that anyone who asks a child to engage in sexually explicit activity online should be reported to a parent, guardian, or other trusted adult and law enforcement.\n\nCrime:Sunland Park mother charged after 4 children, including newborn, test positive for drugs\n\nMore information about the FBI’s guidance on protecting children from sexual exploitation is available at https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/protecting-your-kids.\n\n1:40 PM: MountainView Regional Medical Center tightens restrictions on visitors\n\nMountainView Regional Medical Center on Tuesday announced tighter restrictions on all visitors in response to the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak in New Mexico, and continuing efforts to slow community spread of the disease.\n\nBeginning Wednesday morning, the private hospital said it will bar all visitors, vendors and contractors with a few, specific exceptions.

Gov. Will Ainsworth said he returned to work Wednesday after being diagnosed with COVID-19 last week. Ainsworth said he completed a quarantine after a positive test last Wednesday for the coronavirus. He said experienced few symptoms and was able to work from home. “While many have battled with coronavirus, my symptoms never progressed beyond some mild congestion that I usually experience with seasonal allergies,” Ainsworth said. Some members of the lieutenant governor’s staff who were in close contact with Ainsworth will remain in quarantine for 14 days as a precautionary measure, his office said. No staffers have tested positive. Ainsworth said he remains opposed to mandatory mask orders despite being diagnosed with COVID-19, even though he encourages people to wear a face covering.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The city is on a “dangerous path” as coronavirus cases rise, its health director said Wednesday as officials implored people to avoid gatherings and follow orders to wear masks in public. Acting Mayor Austin Quinn-Davidson told reporters she has been meeting with business leaders, health officials and others to make decisions that protect health but also impose minimal restrictions on businesses so they can stay open. “None of us wants another hunker-down” order, she said, adding that it’s people’s actions “that set us up for success or not.” Statewide, virus transmission has accelerated over the past month, according to the state health department, which says most residents known to have COVID-19 are getting it from family or someone with whom they work or socialize. State officials on Wednesday announced plans to bolster testing and expand contact tracing efforts, using the National Guard as a resource.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: State health officials on Thursday reported more than 1,300 additional known COVID-19 cases as seven-day rolling averages for new cases, new deaths and testing positivity in the state all rose over the past two weeks. The Department of Health Services reported 1,315 additional coronavirus cases and 13 additional deaths, increasing the state’s totals to 242,480 cases and 5,918 deaths. According to Johns Hopkins University data analyzed by the Associated Press, Arizona’s seven-day rolling average of daily new cases rose from 728 per day Oct. 14 to 1,036 on Wednesday, while the average for daily deaths increased from 6 to 7.3, and the positivity average went from 7.2% to 9.8%. Arizona was a national hot spot in June and July, but COVID-19 cases and related hospitalizations then fell off before starting to gradually increase again in September. Cases and hospitalization rates remain far below summer highs.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A tenth state lawmaker tested positive for the coronavirus Wednesday in what has become the second largest outbreak of the virus in a state legislature. Rep. Marcus Richmond said he tested positive for the virus. He’s the latest in an outbreak that prompted legislative leaders to halt budget hearings last week. Hearings resumed Tuesday but with new social distancing measures. Richmond, who said he had minor symptoms and was tested Monday, said he believed he had likely caught the virus at the hearings. “I wore my mask and hid behind my plexiglass,” he said, referring to the partitions between lawmakers’ desks. “I just think I probably walked through somebody’s air.” Arkansas’ outbreak is second only to one in Mississippi’s legislature this summer, when dozens of lawmakers tested positive for the virus. At least 162 state legislators nationwide have tested positive for the virus, and three have died.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The city is again considering a proposal to greatly restrict where homeless people may camp in public places around the city – rules that opponents say would criminalize homelessness. The City Council on Wednesday spent four hours debating changes to the city’s code before President Nury Martinez decided to delay a vote to Nov. 24. The anti-camping proposal would bar people from sitting, lying down or bunking down near schools, parks or day care centers. Tents couldn’t be set up near shelters or other facilities serving homeless people that have opened in recent years. Those sleeping on the streets would have to keep clear from right of ways such as driveways and loading docks and leave enough room for wheelchair users to pass under the Americans With Disabilities Act.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state attorney general’s office has issued a cease-and-desist letter to the co-owner of a mobile home park who distributed a notice to tenants saying their rent could double if Democrat Joe Biden wins the presidential election. The office issued the letter Friday to Bernie Pagel, co-owner of a mobile park in Fort Morgan, saying the notice constituted voter intimidation by using “economic coercion” against the tenants. According to the office, the notice from Pagel states: “Please understand if Joe Biden is elected as our next President, everything you do and have to pay for will change completely. Everything will be increased. Like paying a lot more in taxes, utilities, gasoline, new permits, fees and regulations…everything! This also means your rent will be increased to cover these expenses. Most likely, rent would double in price! ... If the current President is re-elected, we will not raise the rent for at least 2 years!”\n\nConnecticut\n\nStorrs: The University of Connecticut is suspending a new free-tuition program for lower-income students as it struggles to raise private funds during the pandemic. The university is halting scholarships through its Connecticut Commitment program, meant for students from families who make less than $50,000 a year, University President Thomas Katsouleas told the UConn Board of Trustees on Wednesday. It will honor commitments to the 260 students currently receiving aid. “Pausing the program is the hardest decision I’ve had to make since arriving here,” said Katsouleas, who announced the Connecticut Commitment program at his inauguration in 2019. “While unfortunate and regrettable, I believe that this is a prudent and necessary choice to make at this time.” The program makes up the difference between the cost of tuition and other aid that students receive, including federal Pell Grants.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The state attorney general’s office has backed away from a suggestion that anyone handing out literature at polling places that accurately cites state law regarding voter fraud could be charged with voter intimidation and has confirmed that Delawareans are not prohibited by state law from carrying firearms while voting. The state Department of Justice issued a release Tuesday reminding voters of their rights and responsibilities and advising that law enforcement and elections officials will strictly enforce Delaware’s voter intimidation laws. Examples of voter intimidation cited in the release include exhibiting menacing or threatening behavior, questioning voters about their credentials, obstructing access and disrupting the voting process. They also include “distributing literature at the polls outlining the fact that voter fraud is a crime and/or detailing the legal penalties for impermissibly casting ballots.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Capital One Arena, Nationals Park, and the Wizards Sports and Entertainment Arena are among the D.C. sports venues that have been turned into voting centers amid efforts to keep people socially distant during the COVID-19 pandemic, WUSA-TV reports. The district has named these sporting venue sites and others “Super Vote Centers,” saying they will help create distance for voters due to the size and capacity of the venues. D.C.’s six such sites can be used by any voter in the city, according to D.C.’s Board of Elections website. “Our constant mission is creating the best opportunity for voter participation,” said Michael Bennett, chair of the DCBOE.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Gov. Ron DeSantis couldn’t initially cast his ballot this week because someone illegally changed his address online, a complication that resulted in a suspect’s arrest on felony charges and raised questions about the security of the state’s online registration system. DeSantis went to an early voting site Monday to cast his ballot but was told his address had been changed from the governor’s mansion to a small apartment complex in West Palm Beach, 420 miles away. The problem was quickly fixed, and the Republican and close ally of President Donald Trump was allowed to vote. He then contacted the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, which determined the record had been changed online from a house in Naples, Florida. The FDLE says agents went to the house Tuesday, where Anthony Guevara, 20, admitted changing DeSantis’ address through the elections website. He told agents he gained access by using the governor’s birth date, which he got from Wikipedia.\n\nGeorgia\n\nRome: A northwest Georgia school system sent all its students home to take classes virtually for 10 days because of coronavirus infections and quarantines. The Rome school system said Tuesday that with more than 600 students, faculty and staff members isolated with infections or quarantined because of exposure, the district of 6,400 students would switch to all-online instruction Wednesday through Nov. 6, assuming cases have declined by then. Rome and surrounding Floyd County are among Georgia’s high-transmission areas as infections and hospitalizations for COVID-19 rise for a third time. Athletics and extracurricular activities will continue. Students are being sent home with three days’ worth of meals, and parents can pick up meals for next week. Officials say they will clean affected areas in the meantime.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Oahu’s short-term vacation rental industry can operate again after the lifting of coronavirus restrictions that hammered business. The island’s vacation rental occupancy for September fell to 14.5%, a 59% decrease from September 2019, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The Hawaii Tourism Authority released the figures in a report last week. Rentals were sidelined by Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell’s pandemic restrictions beginning April 7. Oahu moved into the next phase of its economic reopening Oct. 22, allowing about 800 short-term rental properties to resume business along with those on neighboring islands. Rentals offering stays of 30 days or fewer that were not used to quarantine guests were allowed to operate on the Big Island, Kauai and Maui beginning in June when the state’s first interisland quarantine was lifted.\n\nIdaho\n\nCoeur d’Alene: It is legal to wear T-shirts or buttons supporting candidates or issues to the polls, as long there is no overt politicking done by that person, a new opinion from the Idaho attorney general’s office states. The opinion published Tuesday said the state law that determines electioneering guidelines most likely prohibits active campaign measures rather than passive ones. The attorney general office’s opinion said passive electioneering includes wearing a T-shirt or button that supports candidates or policies. The opinion stems from Kootenai County, where the elections office had prohibited voters from wearing political apparel at polling places. Officials cited a state law which bans electioneering at the polls, which is punishable by fines of up to $1,000 and possible arrest. The attorney general office’s opinion said the law can be defended as constitutional if only active electioneering methods are banned.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Gov. J.B. Pritzker said Wednesday that his administration is collecting and will make public the data to justify his COVID-19 restrictions on indoor dining after Senate Republicans urged him to release the numbers. Illinois reported 6,110 new coronavirus infections, its second-highest single-day total, and Pritzker imposed social restrictions on a fourth region this week: counties in Chicago’s northwest suburbs. Eight of 11 COVID-19 monitoring regions are now under “resurgence mitigations” because of rising numbers. The region that includes Chicago was added Tuesday. With the Democratic governor’s decision to ban indoor dining and drinking and limit the size of gatherings in the nation’s third-largest city, restaurateurs and bar owners made a more strident demand that Pritzker, in the words of Senate Republican Leader Bill Brady, “show us the data.” Brady wants the Senate to convene a public hearing where Pritzker can lay out his case.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The Democratic candidate for state attorney general is calling on Indiana to legalize marijuana, saying that doing so would reduce the state’s prison and jail populations and generate millions of dollars for public education. Jonathan Weinzapfel said Monday in a statement that he believes if state lawmakers approved regulated marijuana sales to adults, it would help Indiana recover economically from the coronavirus pandemic, relieve burdens on police and the court system, and reduce “jail overcrowding across the state.” The former Evansville mayor said legalized marijuana would also generate funding for public education and allow patients to use marijuana for medical purposes. Weinzapfel noted that neighboring Illinois and Michigan have already legalized recreational use of marijuana, while neighboring Ohio permits medical marijuana.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state’s numbers of coronavirus cases, deaths and hospitalizations continued to surge higher Wednesday as medical professionals have begun to express concern that hospitals could be overwhelmed with patients if no action is taken to slow the virus’s spread. Iowa hospitals had 596 coronavirus patients Wednesday, by far the highest number so far in Iowa. The 113 patients admitted in the prior 24 hours also were the most seen since the virus surfaced in Iowa in March. The number of patients needing intensive care unit services has also trended upward in the past month. Iowa doctors and hospital officials are preparing for a system overrun by COVID-19 patients by talking about how to transfer patients between hospitals and enacting surge plans that could turn non-hospital facilities into spots to handle any overflow.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: A retired firefighter who is charged with threatening to kidnap and kill the mayor because he was upset about the city’s mask ordinance had been texting an acquaintance on the City Council for more than a month before his arrest, newly released court records show. The document were released Tuesday in the case against 59-year-old Meredith Dowty, who was charged last week with three counts of criminal threat. They say Wichita City Council member James Clendenin started receiving texts from Dowty on Sept. 9, when Dowty wrote that he wanted to know where the mayor eats, sleeps, and buys food and gas, The Wichita Eagle reports. Clendenin, who voted against the mask mandate, said Dowty might have felt they were “kindred spirits” because of his stance. Court documents say Dowty also texted about people needing to be “hung by their necks” on Sept. 24 and then described the mayor as “traitorous” in a Sept. 25 message.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Facing its worst coronavirus outbreak since the pandemic began, the state surged past 100,000 total COVID-19 cases Wednesday as Gov. Andy Beshear bluntly warned that people are putting themselves at risk if they fail to wear masks in public. The governor reported 1,864 new confirmed cases, pushing the statewide total past 101,000. He announced 14 more virus-related deaths, raising Kentucky’s death count to at least 1,442. Reflecting the virus’s rapid spread, 64 counties – more than half of Kentucky’s counties – are listed in the highest category for COVID-19 incidence rates, Beshear said at a press conference. The state’s positivity rate reached 6.07%, the first time it surpassed 6% since Aug. 8. The current escalation is the worst to hit Kentucky, and its reach is statewide, the governor said. “When you look at the incident map, it also shows you that this is not localized,” he said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state’s chief elections officer said he is assessing how Hurricane Zeta may affect voters’ ability to cast ballots in Tuesday’s election after the storm has caused widespread power and structure damage. Almost 500,000 locations in southeastern Louisiana remained without electricity Thursday after the powerful Category 2 storm sprinted through the state’s bayou region and New Orleans. Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin said the state will stand up emergency polling stations if necessary. “The secretary of state’s office is working in close coordination with local officials to assess the damage sustained by our election partners and infrastructure, including registrar of voters offices, clerk of court offices, warehouses and polling locations,” Ardoin said in a statement. “Power outages remain the most widespread challenge and we are working with Entergy and other utility companies to assess and restore power to our election infrastructure.”\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Absentee ballots continue to flood into clerk’s offices in Maine, and the processing has started. Clerks normally cannot begin processing absentee ballots until the Friday before Election Day, but an executive order by Gov. Janet Mills allowed local election officials to begin processing the ballots Tuesday, seven days before the election, if they choose. The goal is to help clerks deal with a flood of absentee ballots. Clerks are allowed open the envelopes, remove the ballots and check names off the voting list. The actual ballots can be fed into an optical scanning machine, with the results stored until the polls close on Election Day. More than 400,000 already have been cast. That breaks Maine’s all-time record of 258,000 absentee ballots cast in the general election in 2016. Concerns about coronavirus are motivating more voters to use absentee ballots this election cycle.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: As health officials face skepticism about rushed COVID-19 vaccines, the state will conduct outreach efforts to promote trust in a vaccine when a safe one becomes available, the deputy health secretary said Wednesday. Dr. Jinlene Chan told a panel of state lawmakers that the health department recognizes historically there are groups that may be more hesitant to accept a vaccination than others. “Our outreach efforts, we absolutely recognize, will need to be culturally competent and reach minority populations and take into account those different populations throughout the state in terms of communication, in terms of education and not just language appropriate, but also culturally appropriate,” Chan said. She said the health department will have two advisory groups. One will examine vaccine data as it is released. Another will include input from representatives from minority and faith-based community groups.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The first coronavirus testing site at Logan International Airport opened Wednesday. The site, located in Terminal E and operated by health and wellness company XpresSpa Group, will be for airport and airline employees at first but will start testing travelers as well in mid-November, the company said. “It helps create a safer environment and reduces risk,” company CEO Doug Satzman told WBUR News on Tuesday. “Testing is not the only answer. It’s just one of the important pieces of the puzzle.” The facility at the airport – the largest in New England and among the busiest in the United States – will offer three tests: a quick test that returns results within 15 minutes; a nasal swab test; and a blood antibody test. The facility will be able to process about 400 tests a day, the company said.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The Democratic governor and top state elections official on Wednesday defended the integrity of the election amid continued attacks from President Donald Trump, saying that results may take longer in close contests because of the surge in absentee voting in the battleground state but that every valid ballot would be counted. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer encouraged people to take advantage of their right to cast an absentee ballot for any reason, including in person at their clerk’s office, to reduce the risk of exposure to the coronavirus at a polling place on Election Day. She echoed calls for anyone who still has a ballot to either hand-deliver it to a clerk or put it in a secure drop box instead of using the mail. Ballots must be received by 8 p.m. on election night to be counted. Trump, who is facing Democrat Joe Biden, has baselessly suggested there is “massive fraud” in mail-in voting, saying the election is “rigged.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: State health officials warned Wednesday against traditional Halloween festivities as warmer weather is expected to coincide with the holiday this weekend amid an increase in virus cases statewide in recent weeks. Instead of high-risk activities like traditional door-to-door trick-or-treating and attending indoor haunted houses, the Minnesota Department of Health, along with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is providing guidance on its website describing how to celebrate Halloween amid the pandemic. The guidance describes lower-risk activities as carving pumpkins and decorating homes, virtual gatherings, and in-home activities with household members like watching a movie. Individually wrapped bags of candy may substitute for traditional trick-or-treating to avoid close contact as children go door-to-door.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Having enough poll workers, securing ballots, and ensuring election workers and voters are safe from COVID-19 are challenges local election officials say they have to face for Tuesday’s election. Officials say they’re using plexiglass barriers, recruiting poll workers through a Mississippi Secretary of State portal and supplying personal protection equipment at precincts, and voters in some counties will be given disposable pens to sign poll books and mark ballots. Social distancing will be mandated at precincts. Masks are encouraged but won’t be mandatory for voters. Madison County Election Commission Chair Julia Hodges said poll workers will wear masks. There will be constant cleaning of items and materials inside precincts on Election Day, she said. Also, to ensure ballots are secure, Hodges said Madison County has new ballot bags that can be locked and sealed by poll managers.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: A federal judge refused to intervene Wednesday to keep open a lab that handled coronavirus tests for about 2,500 nursing homes in 11 states after the federal government suspended the lab for what it alleged were serious violations that put patients’ health at risk. U.S. District Judge Douglas Harpool said that the lab, Gamma Healthcare, was in effect asking him to step into a role that belongs to federal health and safety regulators. Missouri nursing homes are worried that loss of the lab’s services will slow down testing for their elderly and frail patients. Gamma Healthcare’s Poplar Bluff lab handled COVID-19 testing for thousands of long-term care centers. Attorneys for the Medicare agency, or CMS, in court documents wrote that two testing machines at the lab operated for months producing false negatives on over a quarter of known-positive coronavirus samples.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A staff member in Gov. Steve Bullock’s office tested positive for the coronavirus, a spokesperson for the governor said Wednesday, but Bullock and Lt. Gov. Mike Cooney have tested negative for the virus. Bullock and Cooney were not considered close contacts of the infected staffer, who has not been in the office this week, spokesperson Erin Loranger said. Bullock, a Democrat running to unseat Republican U.S. Sen. Steve Daines in a hotly contested race, will not quarantine under advice from the state’s chief medical officer Dr. Greg Holzman. He will continue to be regularly tested over the next few days, Loranger said. Cooney is the Democrat running for governor against Republican U.S. Rep. Greg Gianforte. The staff member tested positive for the coronavirus after experiencing symptoms, Loranger said. Four additional staff members in the governor’s office are considered close contacts and will quarantine for 14 days.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A former TV weatherman and spokesman for a former mayor has been sentenced to two years of probation for emailing death threats to a local health department director over her handling of the coronavirus outbreak. Ronald Penzkowski, 58, was sentenced Tuesday, the Omaha World-Herald reports. Penzkowski pleaded no contest earlier this year to two misdemeanor counts of third-degree assault. He initially had been charged with a felony count of making terroristic threats. Penzkowski was arrested March 31 after investigators said he sent more than a dozen emails to Dr. Adi Pour, director of the Douglas County Health Department. The emails threatening to “lynch” Pour and slit her throat cited Pour’s public health measures and recommendations for residents to stay home to help slow the spread of the virus, investigators said.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Businesses may close, and hospitals may need to adopt “crisis standards” that include care rationing, if the coronavirus continues to spread at current rates in Nevada, state leaders said Wednesday. “I don’t care who says it: We are not rounding the corner,” Gov. Steve Sisolak said at a news conference. “Anyone who says to the contrary is lying. They’re trying to intentionally deceive people and have them let their guard down. We cannot let that happen.” As the pandemic surges, Sisolak said more painstaking choices are likely unless Nevada commits to steps like mask-wearing and social distancing. After business closures and decreased activity on the Las Vegas Strip cut deeply into the tax revenue base used to fund schools and health care services in Nevada – an effect he called “devastating” – Sisolak said he hoped to prevent rolling back policies that have allowed the majority of businesses and schools to reopen.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: An attorney arguing against allowing the 400-member state House to hold remote sessions during the coronavirus pandemic falsely claimed Thursday that the flu usually kills more people than COVID-19. “We call this pandemic unprecedented. I respectfully say that that word does not apply here,” Penny Dean told the state Supreme Court. “We have flu to a greater or lesser degree every year. Usually, depending on the year, more people die from the flu than have died from COVID.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that the flu has killed between 12,000 and 61,000 people in the U.S. annually since 2010, while more than 200,000 have died this year of COVID-19. In New Hampshire, there were 33 flu deaths for the 2019-2020 season, which was in line with the previous five years, compared to 478 COVID-19 deaths since March.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state’s ballot question on legalizing recreational marijuana has led to more than $2 million in campaign fundraising, mostly by groups in favor of cannabis, the state’s Election Law Enforcement Commission said Thursday. The campaign already ranks in the top 10 costliest ballot questions in state history, according to the commission. By far, most of the fundraising is benefitting groups that support legalization. The two groups that have raised the most are NJ Can 2020 and Building Stronger Communities Action Fund. NJ Can 2020 is a social welfare group consisting of a coalition of organizations, including the ACLU of New Jersey, the Latino Action Network, Drug Police Action and the New Jersey CannaBusiness Association among others. The action fund’s main donor is the Scotts Company, which makes Miracle-Gro.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: As many as 4 in 5 public school students are failing at least one class in some of the state’s school districts, according to data made public Wednesday by legislative analysts. They delivered their report as state lawmakers consider the impact of school closures, educational challenges posed by remote learning and learning losses attributed to far less in-person schooling because of the pandemic. The school closures have disproportionately affected low-income students who are less likely to have access to the internet to participate in online learning and more likely to live in districts with little or no in-person learning options, the report said. In the rural southern community of Hatch, nearly 80% of middle and high school students are failing at least one class, the report said. The report included data from 29 of the state’s 89 school districts mostly in smaller and rural areas. The average failing rate was 42%.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The U.S. Justice Department vastly expanded an inquiry Wednesday that could determine whether the state is undercounting coronavirus deaths among nursing home residents, demanding detailed data from hundreds of private facilities. The demand ratchets up pressure on Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo after months of bipartisan criticism that the state’s official tally of 6,722 dead at long-term care facilities is probably off by thousands. That’s because New York, unlike nearly every other state, counts only residents who died on a nursing home’s property and not those who died after being taken to a hospital. Cuomo’s administration has repeatedly refused to release such nursing home data to lawmakers and the media, including a public-records request from the Associated Press dating back to May.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nDurham: Two restaurant owners have won a lawsuit they filed accusing their insurance company of not honoring its contract when they had to close their businesses due to the coronavirus, according to a spokesperson for a company run by one of the owners. A Durham County Superior Court judge ruled in favor of Matt Kelly and Giorgios Bakatsias earlier this month regarding the lawsuit that was filed against Cincinnati Insurance Company in May, Jennifer Noble Kelly, spokesperson for Giorgios Hospitality Group, told WRAL-TV on Wednesday. They both own restaurants in Durham. Kelly and Bakatsias’ lawsuit had asked the insurance company to require “payment for lost business income, extra expenses, and other business related losses” because of the pandemic and “related actions by governmental authorities requiring closure.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state’s death toll from COVID-19 neared 500 on Thursday, with health officials reporting an additional 11 deaths. The North Dakota Department of Health also reported six hospitalizations in the prior day due to the coronavirus, increasing the total number of patients in medical facilities to a record 184. October has been the deadliest month to date from the coronavirus, accounting for 228 of the 499 deaths recorded since the pandemic began. Health officials reported a record 1,222 new infections from the virus Thursday and a daily positivity rate of 15.6%. The COVID Tracking Project reported that North Dakota has had more than 1,442 new cases per 100,000 people over the past two weeks, which leads the nation. The rolling average number of daily new cases has increased by more than 40% in the past two weeks, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Employers will receive a record $5 billion in repayments from the state insurance fund for injured workers to help with the financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic, Gov. Mike DeWine and the fund’s administrator announced Wednesday. The return of the dividends marks the third such payment this year to help struggling businesses. The Ohio Bureau of Workers’ Compensation sent $1.54 billion to employers in April and announced an additional $1.34 billion earlier this month. “Our economy is coming back,” DeWine said. “But many of our businesses, businessmen and women, continue to struggle.” The average restaurant could see a check of about $13,000 and the average farmer a check of about $9,500, the governor said. The city of Columbus – the biggest public Ohio employer that receives worker unemployment compensation through the state – will receive the largest check at $64 million.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Early in-person voting began Thursday across the state for an election that has already seen record turnout throughout the U.S. Polls are open from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. at most of the 77 county election board offices Thursday and Friday and from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday. In Tulsa, early voting was taking place at the minor league baseball stadium, ONEOK Field, to accommodate more voters and allow for better social distancing as the coronavirus continues to surge. Besides president, Oklahoma voters will cast ballots for a U.S. Senate race, five U.S. House seats, corporation commissioner and two state questions, along with legislative and county seats and appellate judges. Even before early in-person voting began, more than 234,000 Oklahomans had already cast absentee ballots by mail, more than twice as many who voted by mail during the last presidential election in 2016.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: With less than a week to go until Election Day, more than half of the registered voters in the state have already cast their ballots. At this point during the past three presidential elections, fewer than 44% of Oregonians had returned their ballots. As of Wednesday, more than 57% of registered voters in the state had done so, according to the Elections Division of the Secretary of State. Nearly 3 million people are registered to vote in Oregon. During the last two presidential elections, between 80% and 82% of registered voters in Oregon returned their ballots. In addition to president, Oregonians are voting on U.S. and state Senate and House races as well as decide on ballot measures that could decriminalize possession of small amounts of heroin and cocaine, legalize the therapeutic use of psilocybin mushrooms and increase the tax on cigarettes.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: State liquor regulators on Wednesday waived nearly $28 million in 2021 fees for bars, restaurants, hotels and other retail licensees that have been hit hard by the pandemic and state-imposed restrictions. The Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board approved the relief measure less than a week after Gov. Tom Wolf announced it. Trade groups have said the fee waiver, while a start, would barely make a dent in their members’ staggering financial losses. A range of fees will be waived, varying from $30 to $700, the liquor board said. Another type of fee that allows for the preservation of an inactive license, which starts at $5,000 to $10,000 per year, will also be waived. The board voted 2-1 to waive the fees. The dissenting member, Mike Negra, said that while he supports financial relief for bars and restaurants, the board was “legislating, rather than administering current law.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state attorney general’s office on Thursday issued a warning to landlords to remind them that evicting a tenant without a court order is illegal and may result in prosecution. The office has in recent weeks received reports of an increasing number of so-called self-help evictions, or evictions carried out without the required court order. “The pandemic has resulted in tremendous financial hardship for landlords and tenants alike,” Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement. Actions like illegally changing locks, cutting off electricity, or otherwise trying to strong-arm a tenant out of a property are all examples of self-help evictions, the office said. The laws apply to both residential and commercial landlords, Attorney General Peter Neronha’s office said. Tenants who are being evicted without a valid court order should continue making rent payments to the extent possible and seek legal guidance, Neronha said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: More than 1 million votes have already been cast in November’s election in the state. The millionth vote – all by absentee ballot so far – was recorded sometime Wednesday, according to data from the South Carolina Election Commission. About two-thirds of the absentee ballots have been cast in person. The General Assembly allowed absentee voting for anyone without an excuse this year because of the COVID-19 pandemic. About 371,000 absentee ballots have been mailed in, with 100,000 ballots being issued as of Wednesday morning but not returned, the Election Commission said. Absentee voting in 2020 has obliterated records from the 2016 general election, in which more than 500,000 people voted absentee. All polling places in South Carolina will be open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Tuesday. The record for turnout in the state is 2.1 million voters in 2016.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The state reported a record number of daily COVID-19 deaths Thursday, with 19. The number of hospitalizations also inched up to 413, marking the fifth day in a row that it has hit a new high. The state is experiencing one of the nation’s worst waves of the virus, posting the second-highest number of new cases over the past two weeks, according to Johns Hopkins researchers. There were about 1,336 new cases per 100,000 people. That means that 1 out of roughly every 75 people in the state has tested positive for the virus in the past two weeks. Virus infections have shown little sign of slowing down, with the rolling average number of daily new cases increasing as well. The Department of Health reported 1,000 new cases Thursday, pushing the state past 12,000 active infections. Gov. Kristi Noem has downplayed the severity of the virus in recent days while highlighting the state’s economic outloook.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state is considering independently reviewing the safety and efficacy of a coronavirus vaccine once it is eventually approved by the federal government before distributing it to the public, Health Commissioner Lisa Piercey said Wednesday. “It’s not off the table,” Piercey told reporters during the state’s weekly COVID-19 briefing. Last week, Piercey announced the state had submitted its draft distribution plan for a coronavirus vaccine to the federal government. However, she has since warned that the plan will likely be amended as state officials learn more about when the state will start receiving the vaccine and how many doses are initially provided. California was the first state to announce that it would hold off on distributing any COVID-19 vaccines until it had independently reviewed them. A handful of other states have since joined in that pact.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The state’s surge in coronavirus cases has raised COVID-19 hospitalizations by almost 2,500 since Oct. 1. The 5,650 hospitalizations reported Wednesday were also the most since Aug. 19. About 16% of the hospitalizations were in El Paso County, the state’s worst COVID-19 hot spot. Of the 5,175 new cases state health officials reported Wednesday of the virus that causes COVID-19, 16.5% came from El Paso County, which also accounted for 14.1% of the 96,528 active cases the state estimated statewide. There have been more than 879,994 Texas cases reported since the pandemic’s start, including more than 41,000 cases added in the past seven days. The state has already provided more than 900 medical personnel to El Paso, some of whom will be staffing a temporary hospital set up in the city’s convention center. The 105 COVID-19 fatalities reported statewide Wednesday brought the toll since March to 17,700.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Republican Burgess Owens is refunding and reallocating illegal campaign donations that went above contribution limits. The former football player challenging first-term U.S. Rep. Ben McAdams collected about $135,000 in excess contributions, the New York Times reports. The news comes shortly after he raised a large $2.5 million haul between July and October. Owens has had more than 50,000 donors, many of whom donated electronically, so excess contributions can happen “without the campaign’s knowledge,” said spokesman Jesse Ranney. “This isn’t unusual and is common practice,” he said. The Federal Election Commission ’s legal limit on campaign contributions is $2,800 per individual. McAdams’ campaign, though, said it was part of “a pattern of financial mismanagement.”\n\nVermont\n\nThetford: Two state lawmakers from districts near the New Hampshire border are asking Vermont officials for some flexibility after new virus rules restrict nonessential travel between the two states. In a Tuesday email, Vermont State Rep. Jim Masland, a Democrat from Thetford, highlighted how intertwined the communities are in the two states in the upper Connecticut River valley. Masland told the Valley News that both he and fellow state Rep. Tim Briglin have heard from constituents concerned about their children’s ability to participate in a ski program in New Hampshire, even when those same children attend the same schools. There are also soccer programs involving young people from both states. On Tuesday, Vermont updated its travel map and noted the levels of the virus infection in the New Hampshire counties were too high to allow nonessential travel unless people quarantine for two weeks upon arrival in Vermont.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Southwest Virginia is seeing a sustained, troubling increase in cases of COVID-19 driven partly by small family gatherings, the governor and top health officials said Wednesday, as one area health system issued a stark warning that its resources were being stretched thin. “To be quite frank, today our region is in a really bad place in this pandemic,” said Jamie Swift, the chief infection prevention officer for Ballad Health, which serves southwest Virginia. Gov. Ralph Northam said at a news conference in Richmond that Virginia overall is among just a handful of U.S. states not reporting large increases in COVID-19 cases. But the seven-day testing percent positivity rate in the region’s westernmost localities is about twice the rate of the rest of the state’s 5.1% and has been increasing for 15 days, Northam said.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: State health officials say a new COVID-19 report shows an increase in cases and hospitalizations throughout Washington. If not brought under control, officials said the spike could jeopardize progress toward reopening schools, strain the health care system and increase risks during the holiday season. In an updated situation report released Wednesday, the state Department of Health said the virus is spreading faster in Western Washington than Eastern Washington but is rising on both sides of the Cascades. Estimates show each new COVID-19 patient is infecting 1.34 others, on average, in Western Washington. In Eastern Washington the average infection rate is 1.12. The goal is a number well below one, which would mean COVID-19 transmission is declining, officials said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: Marshall University plans to continue a combination of in-person, virtual and online classes for the spring semester due to the coronavirus pandemic. President Jerome Gilbert said in an email to the Marshall community that while pandemic adjustments are necessary, “the success of the fall semester indicates we are on the right track.” The university said in a statement that freshmen, some graduate and most professional students can still expect a combination of face-to-face and virtual courses with live meetings. The number of in-person offerings for freshmen is expected to increase in the spring semester. Mostly virtual courses will be offered to sophomores, juniors and seniors, the statement said. Hands-on courses with a student’s major may be offered face-to-face by each academic program. The university said there have been 143 positive tests among the nearly 13,000 tests administered on campus.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The University of Wisconsin-Madison will resume enrolling patients for a coronavirus vaccine trial next week. Thirty-six people had received the first of two shots before the study at the School of Medicine and Public Health was paused in September. The study is for a coronavirus vaccine produced by Oxford University and the British pharmaceutical manufacturer AstraZeneca, which announced last Friday that testing would resume after it got clearance from the Food and Drug Administration. Testing of AstraZeneca’s vaccine candidate was paused after a study volunteer developed a serious health issue. Such temporary halts of drug and vaccine testing are relatively common. The participants in the UW-Madison study will now have the option to receive their second dose of the vaccine, and the school will resume enrolling volunteers, Wisconsin Public Radio News reports.\n\nWyoming\n\nLaramie: Nearly 80 positions will be eliminated, the operations budget will be cut, and the athletic department will cut travel costs and reduce salaries as the University of Wyoming addresses a $42 million budget deficit exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. The proposal comes after Gov. Mark Gordon imposed the 10% cuts on the university as a result of a substantial decrease in state revenue, the Laramie Boomerang reports. The university cuts would eliminate at least 78 academic and nonacademic positions. Most of the positions are currently unfilled. The university would reduce its support budget, which includes travel and professional development, and its operations budgets. About 35 graduate teaching assistant positions would be eliminated, and spending would decrease on global engagement. The proposal would eliminate 50 currently budgeted positions.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/10/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/06/24/most-important-event-the-year-you-were-born/37164307/", "title": "The most important events from 1917 to 2017: WWI to Trump's election", "text": "Angelo Young and John Harrington\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nOver the past 100 years we’ve witnessed some of the most profound changes in human history.\n\nBetween wars, technological developments, progress in civil rights and breakthroughs in science and medicine, the old order that held back hundreds of millions of people has been swept away.\n\nCenturies-old empires crumbled as new ideologies – from communism to fascism – for better or worse found roots in many places of the world. Progressive human rights ideas also emerged and changed the world as women, blacks, and the LGBT community demanded, and often won, equal rights. Technology evolved, modifying and innovating our lives in ways never dreamed of.\n\nThe world certainly has progressed, but wars have raged on, and climate change has picked up speed, endangering the ecosystems of our planet.\n\nTo put this in perspective, 24/7 Wall St. has compiled a list of the most important event in each of the past 100 years. We drew on research material and news reports to determine what event had the biggest impact in a particular year.\n\n1919: National booze ban\n\n• Date: Oct. 28\n\n• Location: Washington D.C.\n\nCongress passes the 18th Amendment that bans the production, transport or sale of alcoholic beverages in the United States. The legislation opens the way for Prohibition, which lasts from 1920 to 1933. The public flouts the law, which succeeds in enriching gangsters and contributing to the rise of organized crime.\n\n1920: Women's suffrage\n\n• Date: Aug. 26\n\n• Location: Washington, D.C.\n\nThough the United States was founded under democratic principles, only a minority of its population (starting with white landowning males over the age of 21) could actually vote. But after the 19th Amendment of the Constitution is passed, women finally gain a voice and the right to cast their ballots.\n\nSports gambling:Why sports betting hasn't gone nationwide yet after Supreme Court ruling\n\n1921: Chinese Communists rise\n\n• Date: July 1\n\n• Location: Beijing\n\nIn a prequel to the rise of Mao Zedong and Red China, the Chinese Communist Party is founded, and three weeks later it convenes its first National Congress that is attended by Mao. It would take another 28 years before the Republic of China becomes the People's Republic of China.\n\n1922: British Empire shrinks\n\n• Date: Feb. 28\n\n• Location: London\n\nThe British Empire was at its peak toward the end of World War I, commanding a global population estimated to be as many as 570 million people, or about a fourth of the world's population at the time. The empire's size began to shrink in 1920, when Britain declared limited independence for Egypt, which leads to full independence two years later.\n\n1923: Great Kanto earthquake\n\n• Date: Sept. 1\n\n• Location: Tokyo, Yokohama, Japan\n\nThe Great Kanto earthquake, also known as the Tokyo-Yokohama earthquake, strikes the Japanese mainland at noon on Sept. 1, 1923, with a magnitude of 7.9 on the Richter scale. The death toll is estimated at 140,000 people. The force of the temblor destroys hundreds of thousands of homes that either collapse or are engulfed in fire. The quake sets off a tsunami that reaches a height of almost 40 feet at Atami in the Sagami Gulf, killing 60 people there. The most significant outcome of the catastrophe is the rebuilt Tokyo that would become a modern metropolis.\n\n1924: From Lenin to Stalin\n\n• Date: Jan. 21\n\n• Location: Moscow\n\nFollowing the death of Vladimir Lenin on Jan. 21, the new leader of the Soviet Union, Joseph Stalin, immediately begins a purge of political rivals. Some are simply moved to different positions, while others, like Leon Trotsky, the presumed successor to Lenin, are exiled. Stalin's paranoia grows as he takes control of the nation, and with it the level of violence and killing of anyone perceived to be a threat to his power and control.\n\n1925: Scopes monkey trial\n\n• Date: July 10\n\n• Location: Dayton, Tennessee\n\nAfter teaching the theory of evolution in a Tennessee high school, the state prosecutes science teacher John Thomas Scopes because state law prohibits such teaching as it runs counter to Biblical beliefs. The trial pits well-known Christian fundamentalist William Jennings Bryan against renowned attorney Clarence Darrow. The jury rules against Scopes, forcing him to pay a fine of $100 (about $1,460 in 2017 dollars). It would take another 43 years before the U.S. Supreme Court rules that laws punishing people for teaching evolution violate the First Amendment.\n\n1926: U.S. starts numbered highway system\n\n• Date: Nov. 11\n\n• Location: U.S.\n\nIn a precursor to the modern interstate highway system, the federal government introduces a national highway numbering system in an effort to standardize roadways, especially local roads and trails with names unfamiliar to outsiders. The U.S. Numbered Highway System makes it easier for the growing number of car owners to figure out how to get from one city or town to the next and opens the way for the great American road-trip tradition.\n\n1927: Lindbergh nonstop to Paris\n\n• Date: May 21\n\n• Location: New York to Paris\n\nWhen the monoplane The Spirit of St. Louis touches down at Le Bourget Field in Paris on the evening of May 21, Charles Lindbergh becomes the person to fly over the Atlantic Ocean nonstop. Lindbergh would become one of the heroes of the age. His feat fires the imagination of aspiring aviators about the commercial possibilities of flight. Lindbergh would stay in the news, but for regrettable reasons. A strong advocate for American isolationism in the 1930s, he is criticized for his admiration of Nazi Germany's aircraft industry. Also, his son would be killed during a bungled kidnapping attempt in 1932.\n\n1928: Earhart crosses Atlantic\n\n• Date: June 17-18\n\n• Location: Wales\n\nAmelia Earhart becomes the first woman to pilot a plane across the Atlantic, from Newfoundland to Wales, making her an American national heroine and feminist icon who would go on to set numerous aviation records. She would later set another record as the first person – man or woman – to fly solo from Hawaii to the U.S. mainland.

This was the first LSD trip, a quarter-century before the counterculture endorses the hallucinogenic compound. Hoffman describes the \"not unpleasant\" experience as \"uninterrupted stream of fantastic pictures, extraordinary shapes with intense, kaleidoscopic play of colors.\" Hoffman takes a second dose and writes a paper about his discovery. The U.S. Army tests the drug on soldiers numerous times from 1955 to 1967, briefly toying with the idea of using LSD as a weapon to disorient enemy soldiers during combat.\n\n1944: D-Day\n\n• Date: June 6\n\n• Location: Normandy France\n\nThe plan for the biggest one-day military campaign in history, the invasion of Normandy by Allied forces to push the Nazis out of France, is hatched in extreme secrecy a year earlier.

The failure is later identified as a problem with the so-called O-rings used to form a seal in the seams of the shuttle's external fuel tanks.\n\n1987: Stock market tanks\n\n• Date: Oct. 19\n\n• Location: Worldwide\n\nOct. 19, 1987, is called Black Monday because on that day the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunges 508 points, or more than 22%. The drop is worse than the crash in 1929. It is also worse than the market plunge after the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the 2008 financial crisis. Among the reasons cited for the drop are rising tensions in the Persian Gulf, concern over higher interest rates and the belief that the bull market is ending. Computerized trading, relatively new at the time, accelerates trade orders, which speeds up the market drop. As a result of the collapse, exchanges put in place so-called circuit breakers intended to halt trading when stocks fall too fast. This measure is designed to provide investors a cooling off period and avoid a panic.\n\nThe 50 hottest cities in America:Phoenix tops the list\n\n1988: When the U.S. armed Iran\n\n• Date: March 16\n\n• Location: Washington, D.C.\n\nLt. Col. Oliver North and Vice Adm. John Poindexter are indicted on charges of conspiracy to defraud the United States for their involvement in the so-called Iran-Contra affair. The scandal involved members of the Reagan administration who illegally sold arms to Iran to help facilitate the release of American hostages, and then transfer the proceeds of the sale to fund the Nicaraguan contras, a loose affiliation of right-wing militias. North is convicted, but his conviction is vacated and reversed, while Poindexter's convictions are also reversed on appeal.\n\n1989: The Berlin Wall falls\n\n• Date: Nov. 9\n\n• Location: Berlin, East and West Germany\n\nCracks in the monolithic Soviet bloc are starting to appear in the 1980s, and the very symbol of communist repression comes crashing down in November, when the Berlin Wall is breached, ending a 28-year division of the city. During the day on Nov. 9, a spokesman for East Berlin's Communist Party says starting at midnight that day, citizens of East Germany are free to cross the country's borders. Almost immediately Berliners start slamming the wall with axes and sledgehammers. By nightfall, the celebration turns into what one observer calls \"the greatest street party in the history of the world\" and the city is reunited. East and West Germany would reunite one year later.\n\n1990: Democracy in Poland\n\n• Date: Jan. 28\n\n• Location: Poland\n\nWith the hold of the Soviet Union and communism on East Europe loosening, Poland's ruling communist party votes to dissolve and become more moderate.

Amazon.com, meanwhile is racing with Apple to become the world's first trillion-dollar American company.\n\n1995: Domestic terror strikes Oklahoma\n\n• Date: April 19\n\n• Location: Oklahoma City\n\nIn the deadliest domestic terrorist attack in U.S. history, anti-government radicals Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols bomb the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. They time the truck-bomb attack for a weekday morning in order to maximize casualties. For the murder of at least 168 people, including 19 children who were in a child care center in the building, and the injury of hundreds of others, an unremorseful McVeigh is executed by lethal injection on June 11, 2001. Nichols is serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole.\n\n1996: The dawn of cloning\n\n• Date: July 5\n\n• Location: Midlothian, Scotland, U.K.\n\nDolly the Sheep enters the annals of bioengineering when scientists at Scotland's Roslin Institute become the first to not only successfully clone a mammal, but also the first to do so using an adult cell rather than an embryonic one. After 277 so-called cell fusions that created 29 embryos, the teams managed to turn an udder cell into a nearly complete biological carbon copy of the sheep from which it came.\n\n1997: Machine tops chess champ\n\n• Date: May 11\n\n• Location: New York City\n\nArtificial intelligence and machine learning have been serious areas of study (and hype) for over 60 years. In 1997, one of the most significant victories for silicon logic came when IBM's Deep Blue became the first machine to beat a world chess champion. The the refrigerator-sized computer beat Garry Kasparov twice and tied him three times in a six-game match.\n\n1998: The age of Google begins\n\n• Date: Sept. 4\n\n• Location: Menlo Park, California\n\nWith seed money from Sun Microsystems co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, among others, Stanford University Ph.D. students Larry Page and Sergey Brin launch the search engine Google.

A fourth plane, United Airlines Flight 93, crashes in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, after passengers and crew attempt to regain control of the plane headed toward Washington, D.C.\n\n2002: Homeland Security\n\n• Date: Nov. 25\n\n• Location: Washington, D.C.\n\nFollowing the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Congress and President George W. Bush enact the Homeland Security Act, the biggest government reorganization of national security efforts since the Department of Defense was created in 1947. The sweeping legislation creates the massive Department of Homeland Security, which is responsible for everything from protecting infrastructure from cyberattacks to managing the new U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency.\n\n2003: U.S. crushes Iraq\n\n• Date: March 19\n\n• Location: Iraq\n\nWith the help of British and other allied forces, the United States begins its invasion of Iraq with a rapid bombing \"Shock and Awe\" campaign with the intention of destroying Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction; the weapons are never found. Coalition forces manage to quickly topple the Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussein, but have to fight insurgent forces for years afterward.\n\n2004: Facebook founded\n\n• Date: Feb. 4\n\n• Location: Cambridge, Massachusetts\n\nMark Zuckerberg, a 23-year-old Harvard University student, creates \"The facebook,\" a local social networking site named after the orientation materials that profiles students and faculty and given to incoming college freshmen. Fourteen years later, Facebook has become a $510 billion digital advertising behemoth so integral to many people's lives that it has been criticized for helping foreign powers and propagandists influence the U.S. political system.\n\n2005: Katrina overwhelms New Orleans\n\n• Date: Aug. 29\n\n• Location: U.S. Gulf Coast\n\nAfter spending four days in the Gulf of Mexico bulking up to a Category 5 hurricane, Katrina slams into New Orleans, inundating the city and creating a humanitarian crisis that lasts for weeks. The catastrophe underscores the precarious situation not only in the Big Easy but also the surrounding area of the Gulf Coast. At least 1,833 people in the storm's path are killed, and the storm inflicts $161 billion in damages to the region, the costliest storm in U.S. history.\n\n2006: Hussein executed\n\n• Date: Dec. 30\n\n• Location: Baghdad\n\nThree years after U.S. soldiers pulled him from a hole in the ground where he had been hiding, Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein is hanged after he was convicted for crimes against humanity, specifically for ordering the massacre of 148 Shiites in 1982 following a failed assassination attempt against him.\n\n2007: The iPhone\n\n• Date: Jan. 9\n\n• Location: San Francisco\n\nApple CEO Steve Jobs, who died in October 2011, first shows the world one of the most popular branded consumer electronic devices in history, the iPhone. Since the first-generation phone that Jobs introduced at the Consumer Electronics Show that year, there have been 18 versions of the mobile device, and more than 1.2 billion units have been sold globally through 2017. Only Samsung's Galaxy smartphone comes close to that volume.\n\n2008: Dow plunges\n\n• Date: Sept. 29\n\n• Location: New York City\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average records the largest-ever intraday drop, 777.68 points, after Congress rejects a massive $700 billion bailout of U.S. banks. The bill would pass days later. The market reacts also to months of global market turmoil amid the 2008 global financial crisis spurred by the U.S. subprime mortgage market crash. The Dow fell by more than half during the 2007-09 Great Recession, tumbling from 14,164 on Oct. 9, 2007, to 6,594 on March 5, 2009.\n\n2009: America's first African-American president\n\n• Date: Jan. 20\n\n• Location: Washington, D.C.\n\nAfter winning in a landslide against Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, amassing in 365 electoral votes and 53% of the popular vote, Barack Obama is sworn in as the first African-American president of the United States. Obama inherits the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, but with his party holding majorities in both houses of Congress at the time, the president is able to pass a stimulus package and his signature Affordable Care Act in March 2010.\n\nCalifornia home to 17 of them:America’s 25 least affordable housing markets\n\n2010: Catastrophic oil spill\n\n• Date: April 20\n\n• Location: Gulf of Mexico, Louisiana\n\nEleven workers die and 17 are injured after an explosion and fire erupts on the Deepwater Horizon offshore drilling rig 40 miles from the Louisiana coast. The explosion causes the largest environmental disaster in U.S. history, spewing 3 million barrels of crude over the three months it takes to stop the leak. British oil company BP says costs climbed to $65 billion in claims for the accident, including a $1.7 billion charge it took as recently as the fourth quarter of 2017.\n\n2011: Bin Laden killed\n\n• Date: May 2\n\n• Location: Abbottabad, Pakistan\n\nIn an intense 40-minute nighttime firefight, 25 U.S. Navy SEALs hunt down and kill al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden, mastermind of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, in a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan.

Higgs boson has been an important element of particle physics theory for decades, but until 2012 there had been no physical evidence to support its existence.\n\n2013: Snowden reveals secrets\n\n• Date: June 6\n\n• Location: Hong Kong\n\nAfter surreptitiously leaving his job at U.S. National Security Agency contractor Booz Allen Hamilton, computer security consultant Edward Snowden meets secretly in Hong Kong with journalists Glenn Greenwald and Laura Poitras. He reveals the first of a series of secrets about numerous U.S. and European government surveillance operations. Hailed as a courageous whistleblower and privacy champion by some, and a traitor that compromised counterterrorism efforts by others, the American now resides in exile in Moscow.\n\n2014: Russian bear bites Ukraine\n\n• Date: March 16\n\n• Location: Crimea\n\nExploiting political unrest in Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin orchestrates the annexation of the Crimean Peninsula. The action incites peals of condemnation from world leaders and a raft of economic sanctions against Moscow. This strategically important and predominantly Russian-speaking region on the Black Sea has been coveted by the Russians as part of their strategic efforts to check NATO expansion along Russia's western border.\n\n2015: NASA flies by Pluto\n\n• Date: July 14\n\n• Location: 3 billion miles from Earth\n\nNASA spacecraft New Horizons becomes the first human-made object to fly past and observe the dwarf planet Pluto. New Horizons sends back stunning photographs of this enigmatic and distant member of the solar system, including images of a mountain range and massive icebergs floating in frozen nitrogen. New Horizons is now en route to the Kuiper Belt, a massive asteroid belt at the far reaches of the solar system.\n\n2016: Trump elected\n\n• Date: Nov. 8\n\n• Location: U.S.\n\nRunning on a populist agenda, Donald Trump is elected the 45th president of the United States and the fifth president in U.S. history (the second since the 2000) to win despite losing the popular vote. The real estate developer and television personality ran on a platform of putting \"America First\" in global trade and foreign policy negotiations and cracking down on undocumented immigrants.\n\n2017: Hurricane triple-whammy\n\n• Date: August-September\n\n• Location: Multiple\n\nWithin just four weeks, three massive hurricanes – Harvey, Irma and Maria – strike Texas, Florida and the Caribbean, killing 228 people, inflicting a combined $265 billion in damages and displacing millions of homeowners. Hurricane Maria inflicts immense damage to the U.S. commonwealth of Puerto Rico, which was already struggling from economic insolvency.\n\nDetailed findings & methodology\n\nThere is little doubt that in the last 100 years, mankind has progressed dramatically. People live longer, eat better, have greater access to improved medical care and are freer to express their opinions and associate with whomever they want.\n\nThat optimism can be seen in population growth. Despite the two most devastating wars in human history, the world population has nearly tripled, from 1.9 billion to 7.5 billion, since 1917.\n\nOne hundred years is an eye blink in history, yet 100 years ago, women did not have the right to vote in the United States. African-Americans were prevented from voting in the American South. Labor unions were in their infancy and were weak, and laws reforming child labor had yet to be passed by Congress. All that changed because of women’s suffrage, the inexorable march of civil rights and the strengthening labor unions.\n\nOne hundred years ago, a person anywhere in the world was more likely than not to be illiterate. And there was a good chance he or she was the subject of colonial rulers in South America, Africa and Asia. Two world wars would spell the end of imperial houses in Austria-Hungary, Germany and Russia, and weaken the grip of another, Great Britain. Independence movements sprouted in Europe, Africa and Asia, yearning for freedom and expressing national pride.\n\nNationalism had its dark side, though, with fascist governments ruling Italy and Germany. It would take a world war to remove their scourge. Another form of totalitarianism, communism, would dominate the USSR and Eastern Europe for several generations, as well as China and other countries in Asia, before the West would triumph over the Soviet Union and its allies in the Cold War.\n\nSpeaking of the Cold War, that conflict launched the space race and accelerated technological progress, hastening the use of personal computers and cell phones. These inventions have fundamentally changed our lives – from the way we communicate to the way we shop and socialize – and made billions of dollars for the companies that make them and their founders. These products and innovations are a major part of the culture today.\n\nTo determine the most important event the year you were born, 24/7 Wall St. drew on research materials and media sources to compile its list.

U.S. District Judge Keith Watkins on Tuesday refused to grant the temporary restraining order requested by plaintiffs represented by former Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore. Watkins said there is no urgency because the health orders were first issued this spring, and the mask order followed in July. “So, at least, Plaintiffs delayed more than two months in filing their motion; at most, they delayed more than five months. Either way, plaintiffs waited an impermissible amount of time to seek the ‘extraordinary and drastic remedy’ of a temporary retraining order,” Watkins said. He asked the two sides to file briefs on whether the case should be dismissed. Gov. Kay Ivey last week extended the state mask order through Nov. 8, saying it has proven effective even if some people do not like it.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The state has released a plan to divide $50 million in federal coronavirus relief funding payments among fishing industry workers affected by the pandemic. The state Department of Fish and Game proposed a split among charter guides, the commercial fleet and seafood processors of 32% each in a draft proposal released Monday, CoastAlaska reports. Federal guidance suggests the state set aside more than half of its relief funds for processors, about a third for commercial fishermen, and 5% for sport fishing guides and lodges. The state also proposed setting aside portions of the funds for subsistence and aquaculture at 3% and 1% respectively. The two groups were not included in the federal guidance. Relief applicants will be required to document significant losses over the course of the pandemic compared to previous years.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A state lawmaker ill with COVID-19 who is on a ventilator at a Maryland hospital’s intensive care unit is showing some signs of improvement, his wife announced Wednesday. Democratic Rep. Lorenzo Sierra of Avondale was visiting family in Washington when he fell ill. He went to a hospital Sunday and was transferred to Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore on Monday. His wife, Rhonda Cagle, tweeted Wednesday that Sierra was “taking small but mighty steps.” “Ventilator usage reduced from 100% to 40%. Slowly reducing sedation; he is following basic commands,” she wrote. “He opened his eyes for me. When I told him I love him, he nodded. It is the best gift. Pls keep praying,” she wrote. Cagle also was infected and is recovering in isolation with relatives, according to House Democratic caucus officials. Cagle and Sierra tested negative before leaving for Washington and took extensive precautions but still got sick, Cagle wrote on Facebook.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The number of people in the state’s hospitals because of the illness caused by the coronavirus rose to a new high Wednesday. The Department of Health reported the number of people hospitalized because of COVID-19 rose by nine to 538 – a record high for Arkansas, a day after the state hit its highest point since early August. About 27% of the state’s 9,112 hospital beds and 10% of its 1,002 intensive care unit beds are available, according to the state Department of Health. Sixty-five percent of ventilators in the state remain available. The state reported 242 COVID-19 patients are in ICUs. Gov. Asa Hutchinson said, based on a pattern the state has seen recently, cases may rise further at the end of the week following people going in for testing after a weekend. “If the trend holds, cases may go up again toward the end of the week and then decline from there,” Hutchinson said in a statement.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state’s embattled unemployment benefits agency said Wednesday that it has cleared about 246,000 of its more than 1.6 million backlogged claims following a two-week “reset” in which it stopped taking new applications so it could improve its technology. But the agency said it would be January before it clears the backlog, frustrating state lawmakers who questioned the agency’s director during a legislative hearing Wednesday. Sharon Hilliard, executive director of the Employment Development Department, said some people have been waiting as long as five months to get benefits. “To be honest, it’s very hard for us to tell our constituents that we have 100% certainty that this will be resolved in the next couple of months given the track record,” said Assemblyman David Chiu, a Democrat from San Francisco.\n\nColorado\n\nGreeley: Two women who were hired to screen employees after a coronavirus outbreak at a beef plant say the owners did not take screening protocols seriously and were negligent. The two say in affidavits that JBS USA Holdings provided screening equipment that did not function properly, forced employees to pay for coronavirus tests and encouraged noticeably sick employees to continue working. Hundreds of workers at the JBS plant in Greeley were infected with the coronavirus, and at least six died, officials have said. One of the women who signed the affidavit, Sarah-Jean Buck, alleged JBS was negligent even as case numbers continued to rise. Buck said she quit her job after she was told she should have cleared an employee for work whom she sent home for having symptoms consistent with the coronavirus. Buck said supervisors told her she should have cleared the woman because the worker could not afford a $100 coronavirus test.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state’s third reopening phase was set to begin Thursday, a milestone during the coronavirus pandemic that is getting a lukewarm reception from some business owners and arts aficionados. A number of restaurant owners say they won’t be able to reach the new 75% capacity limit for indoor dining because they don’t have the space, primarily due to the requirement that tables be at least 6 feet apart. The indoor capacity maximum is being increased from 50%. Indoor performing arts venues will be allowed to open at 50% capacity, while outdoor event venues will be allowed to increase their capacity from 25% to 50%, with required masks and social distancing at all locations. But many theaters and concert venues have decided not to open this week, as shows already have been canceled, and many say they can’t make money with half-full facilities.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: More than a month into Wesley College’s school year, COVID-19 testing is still not available on campus. The school, which has about 1,600 students, is primarily teaching courses in person. There is one school nurse. The University of Delaware and Delaware State University – which are both using remote learning – are providing regular, aggressive on-campus testing for students, staff and faculty. If a Wesley student or staff member feels they need a COVID-19 test, they must go to a community testing site about a mile and a half away. The college says it provides a free taxi service for students who don’t have cars. In Delaware, people ages 18 to 34 continue to see the highest rate of infection. Wesley President Robert Clark said he believes on-campus testing could occur in the next month. The state health department is providing at-home testing kits, he said, which should be available to students in the next week.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Mayor Muriel Bowser announced Wednesday that the district’s public health emergency order has been extended until Dec. 31, WUSA-TV reports. The previous emergency order was set to expire Oct. 9 but was extended as D.C. remains in Phase 2 of reopening. Telework is still encouraged within the district, and mass gatherings are permitted up to 50 people. Certain activities, such as those at churches, are allowed to increase that number if requested and approved from a waiver. A number of restrictions still remain in place in order to slow the spread of the virus. D.C health officials reported 45 cases of coronavirus Wednesday, closer to the district’s average number, following Tuesday’s report of more than 100 cases. D.C. is now averaging 53 cases of the virus per day, up from 43 cases two weeks ago.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: After Gov. Ron DeSantis lifted nearly all COVID-19 restrictions on businesses, restaurants and bars across the state, students didn’t hesitate to take full advantage of the city’s resurrected nightlife. Bajas Beachclub, which was closed by the state in late June for violating closure orders, held its grand reopening Saturday, and students arrived in droves, eagerly standing shoulder-to-shoulder in the parking lot. “I’m here tonight because I want to hang out with my friends and get absolutely [expletive]-faced,” said Chase Rodriguez, a junior at Florida State University. Consensus from the crowd suggested many students don’t see COVID-19 as an immediate threat. In fact, every student who spoke with the Tallahassee Democrat claimed to have already had the virus. Despite the lack of definitive information about the effectiveness of antibodies once recovery, many students say it’s why they feel they can hit the clubs without worry.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: White House chief of staff Mark Meadows hosted a large wedding for his daughter that appeared to violate a state order and city guidelines aimed at stopping the spread of COVID-19, a newspaper reports. Photos of the event show that social distancing guidelines were not followed during the May 31 nuptials at the Biltmore Ballrooms Atlanta, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. About 70 guests wore tuxedos and ball gowns but no masks at the indoor wedding, and photographs show groups of people clustered closely together in the same room throughout the evening, the newspaper says. Gov. Brian Kemp’s orders at the time banned gatherings of more than 10 people. The governor later loosened some coronavirus restrictions. The Biltmore Hotel was one of Atlanta’s most lavish gathering places for many years after it opened in 1924.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Despite increasing coronavirus cases across the U.S., state officials hope to reboot tourism next week by loosening months of economically crippling pandemic restrictions, including a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all arriving travelers. The plan, which was postponed after the virus surged in the summer, will allow travelers who provide negative virus test results within 72 hours of arrival to sidestep two weeks of quarantine. But the Oct. 15 launch of the pre-travel testing program is causing concern for some who say gaps in the plan could further endanger a community still reeling from summer infection rates that spiked to 10% after local restrictions eased. State Sen. Glenn Wakai, chair of the Committee on Economic Development, Tourism and Technology, said one problem is that travelers can choose not to get tested and instead quarantine for two weeks upon arrival, which means those with a negative test could get infected on the plane.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The way the state’s residents live and work is being changed forever by the coronavirus pandemic, Gov. Brad Little said Wednesday. The Republican governor said in a speech about the future of work that it’s important for employers and workers to be flexible and innovative and to “respond to challenges thoughtfully as they arise.” Little also announced the creation of the Youth Apprenticeship Program funded by a $2.5 million grant from the U.S. Department of Labor. It pairs young people, mainly juniors and seniors in high school but also workers up to 24 years old, with businesses to give them workforce experience. “It might sound a little strange to be starting this new initiative during a pandemic, but the realities are that Idaho employers desperately need skilled employees across the board,” Little said. The program is part of a statewide effort to have 60% of 25- to 34-year-old workers obtain a postsecondary credential.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Gov. J.B. Pritzker expressed confidence Wednesday that Congress will put together another coronavirus pandemic relief package despite President Donald Trump’s instructions to shut down talks until after the election. The budget the Democratic governor signed last spring left a $5 billion gap for what lawmakers hoped by late summer would be a second federal stimulus grant. But Congress has been unable to agree on a package for states to relieve the economic damage done by the highly contagious coronavirus, which has slowed or shut down commerce nationally. Pritzker said the need is too great for Congress to disregard it. “Every state is going to need support from the federal government even though the president has apparently thrown the talks into disarray now that he’s on a cocktail of steroids coming out of the hospital,” Pritzker said.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Local health officials warned Wednesday about a growing number of COVID-19 illnesses in the Evansville and South Bend areas as the state health department reported rates of new infections and hospitalizations across Indiana much higher than two weeks ago, when Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb decided to lift most statewide precaution rules. Democratic gubernatorial candidate Woody Myers, a physician and former state health commissioner, lambasted Holcomb’s move as putting lives as risk, while Holcomb’s top health adviser defended the step by pointing out that nearly half of the state’s counties are at the lowest risk of infection spread under statewide tracking guidelines. The hospital beds designated for COVID-19 patients were nearly full in Elkhart County, just east of South Bend, said county Health Department spokeswoman Melanie Sizemore.\n\nIowa\n\nJohnston: Gov. Kim Reynolds on Wednesday evoked President Donald Trump in saying, “We can’t let COVID-19 dominate our lives,” even as cases surge in the state. She acknowledged Iowa is seeing a spike in coronavirus cases and record hospitalizations but said the health care system could handle the increase, and no further action was needed to reduce infections. While Reynolds said the state has taken action to slow the spread of the virus, she argued it must balance safety precautions against moves to open businesses and schools and return to normal life. There were 444 people being treated for the coronavirus in hospitals as of Wednesday, a record number. In the past 24 hours, the state had 919 new confirmed cases and 15 more deaths. The White House Coronavirus Task force told Iowa officials Thursday that many virus-related deaths in the state were preventable.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Top Republican legislators signed off Wednesday on Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s request to extend a state of emergency for the coronavirus pandemic as the state set another record for COVID-19-related hospitalizations. Eight leaders of the GOP-controlled Legislature, six of them Republicans, quickly and unanimously approved Kelly’s plan to extend the state of emergency until Nov. 15. Under a law enacted in June, top lawmakers must consider an extension once a month, and without their approval, the state of emergency would have expired Oct. 15, possibly hindering the ability of the state to move supplies and personnel around. Wednesday’s meeting was in sharp contrast to a contentious one last month, when top Republicans extracted a public promise from Kelly not to try to close businesses statewide again as she did in the spring. GOP leaders and the governor have been at odds for months over her handling of the pandemic.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Day care facilities will receive a one-time grant of $130 per child from federal coronavirus funds to help pay wages and other expenses, a state official said Wednesday. “It’s been a difficult year for child care,” Kentucky Health and Family Services Secretary Eric Friedlander said. “The coronavirus closed all licensed, certified and registered facilities and impacted children, families and employees of these facilities as well as the owners of these businesses.” The funds will go to licensed day cares and certified homes to help pay wages; mortgage or rent, utilities and insurance payments for the facility; and other costs. The announcement came as Gov. Andy Beshear said there were 2,398 newly reported cases, although 1,472 were from a backlog of data from Fayette County. There were five new deaths, Beshear said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Service workers who were laid off because of the coronavirus’ impact on the economy are earning a living again by helping others survive during the pandemic. Unemployed bartenders, musicians and casino employees who were among the thousands of service industry workers left without jobs when the city closed its bars and nightclubs in late March have been recruited to train and work with Resilience Force. The national nonprofit puts people to work in disaster recovery programs that focus on Black and other minority communities. As a member of the New Orleans Resilience Corps pilot program, former French Quarter bar manager Dazmine “Daz” Allen spends his days handing out COVID-19-safety flyers and personal protective equipment to residents and Hurricane Laura evacuees sheltering in the city. Allen said he filed for unemployment and food stamps and was “barely getting by” when he was recruited. “I feel like I can provide for myself, help my family … and working for an organization that has the primary goal to provide health care, health services to the community, to me is everything right now,” Allen said.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state is moving to the next stage of reopening from closures caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Gov. Janet Mills announced this week. Beginning next Tuesday, indoor limits for indoor seated activity will increase to half of capacity or 100 people. For nonseated indoor activities, such as gyms, the limit remains 50. The order Mills signed Tuesday also expands statewide a mask requirement that currently applies only to coastal communities and bigger cities. “With winter weather approaching, we must support businesses across the state as outdoor service becomes less viable and people move inside,” Mills said in a statement. The expansion of the mask requirement makes clear that it includes locations such as private schools and local government buildings, as well as employees and customers in restaurants, lodging and retail establishments. Businesses that violate the orderscould face fines and the loss of licenses.\n\nMaryland\n\nWestminster: The coronavirus pandemic is contributing to more people choosing to have cremations instead of funerals. The Carroll County Times reports Maryland’s cremation rate has gone from about 35% in 2010 to more than 50% in 2020. Jack Mitchell, a spokesman for the National Funeral Directors Association, said the nation’s turn away from religion has helped fuel the number of cremations over the years. But he said COVID-19 restrictions on funeral size and fear of the virus have also prompted many to opt for it. Tom Fletcher, funeral director of Fletcher Funeral & Cremation Services in Westminster, said cremation can also be more flexible than an immediate burial with a viewing. At the same time, he said, more people are starting to come out for funerals, but people are still cautious. “It’s a very tough situation for families, especially those that have lost someone to COVID,” Fletcher said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Brigham and Women’s Hospital and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard are teaming up for a six-month study of 10,000 people to help them better understand the prevalance of COVID-19 in the area and identify potential surges in the fall and winter, they said in a joint statement. The TestBoston study will provide monthly at-home kits for the virus and antibodies against it. Participants, selected from Brigham and Women’s patients and reflecting the demographics of greater Boston, will also complete routine symptom surveys and be able to seek extra testing if they develop symptoms. Study results may reveal critical clues and warning signs about how COVID-19 cases are changing in the area, while helping investigators establish a model for at-home sample collection, the statement said. The study will also help clinicians learn more about whether prior infection provides any protection against subsequent reinfection.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II called Wednesday for Republican legislative leaders to enact and enforce a mask requirement inside the House and Senate chambers at all times, saying he fears for the safety of his family and others when lawmakers do not wear a face covering. The Democrat presides over session in the Senate, which returned Thursday to start passing bills following a state Supreme Court ruling that invalidated Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s coronavirus orders. The state health department requires masks at indoor nonresidential gatherings, but the Legislature is seen as exempt from that order because it is a separate branch of government. Though legislators have been encouraged to wear masks, many Republicans either do not wear them at all or remove them to speak or while seated alone at their desk. Democrats are more vigilant about using masks, though some remove them to give formal remarks during session.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Republican U.S. Senate candidate Jason Lewis left the campaign trail for the second time in less than a week Wednesday after learning he had been in contact with a person who tested positive for the coronavirus. The Lewis campaign issued a statement saying the person, who was not identified for privacy reasons, tested positive Wednesday morning. So the former congressman began self-quarantining and making plans to get tested again, in keeping with federal guidelines. The statement said Lewis was feeling fine and displaying no symptoms. One campaign staffer who had been in contact with Lewis since Monday was also self-quarantining and getting tested, the campaign said. Lewis had just returned to the campaign trail Monday. He went into self-quarantine and stuck to virtual events Friday when it was announced President Donald Trump had tested positive for COVID-19. Lewis greeted Trump on his arrival in Minneapolis last Wednesday.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Those entering a school, a Wendy’s or a Walmart in the state must wear masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19, but those entering packed polling places don’t have to don one. “This is absolute insanity,” said Dr. Claude Earl Fox III, a Mississippi native and former head of public health in Alabama. Mississippi Secretary of State Michael Watson says masks can’t be mandated at the polls because it’s a federal election. Some governors in other states have stepped in anyway and received the backing of federal judges in enacting the requirement. Hinds County is requiring voters to wear masks on Election Day. People can’t be denied the right to vote, Hinds County Circuit Clerk Zack Wallace said, but when it comes to masks, they have to wear them as a matter of public health and safety. Failing to do so, he said, “is not taking care of people.” Last week Gov. Tate Reeves became the first governor to rescind a mask mandate.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: The state on Thursday reported an increase of more than 1,500 confirmed COVID-19 cases and the highest number of hospitalizations for confirmed or suspected cases since the pandemic began. Data from the Missouri Department of Health and Human Services showed a total of 137,156 confirmed cases and 2,259 deaths since March. That was 1,505 more cases and 23 more deaths than reported Wednesday. The department also reported 1,344 Missourians were hospitalized with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases Wednesday – up from 1,241 the previous day. Also Thursday, the state labor department reported initial unemployment claims rose last week, after falling steadily in the previous three weeks. The department said 8,797 Missourians applied for unemployment assistance, up more than 1,400 from the week before.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: Yellowstone National Park officials say 16 employees tested positive for COVID-19 in September, marking a significant uptick in cases. The Bozeman Daily Chronicle reports the number of positive cases in September quadrupled from the number reported between May 18 and Aug. 30. During that time, four park employees and one contractor tested positive for the virus and have since recovered. Seven of the employees who tested positive in September work for the National Park Service, and nine work for concessions. Eight of the 16 employees have recovered. Park officials say all employees who have tested positive have been isolated according to guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Out of the estimated 2,000 Yellowstone employees, a total of 0.08% have tested positive for the virus. Testing also ramped up significantly in September.\n\nNebraska\n\nGrand Island: Public schools in the city report they’re having a hard time finding substitute teachers to fill vacancies in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Grand Island Public Schools is experiencing a rapid rise in teachers and staff having to quarantine after testing positive or being exposed to the virus, television station KSNB reports. District personnel chief Wayne Stelk said about a quarter of the district’s certified teaching staff have been sidelined “due to COVID-related situations.” Many substitutes are retired educators who are in a high-risk category, leading a number of them to decline requests to teach in schools where exposure is an issue, Stelk said. The district could have to move some schools to remote learning if the staffing shortage worsens, he said. Officials with Northwest Public Schools in Grand Island also report having trouble finding substitute teachers this year.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Gov. Steve Sisolak has tested negative for the coronavirus a day after a positive COVID-19 test came back for one of his staff members working at his office in the state Capitol in Carson City, his spokeswoman said Wednesday. Sisolak has not had in-person contact with the staffer since mid-September but was tested Tuesday “out of an abundance of caution,” communications director Meghin Delaney said in a statement. Sisolak departed northern Nevada on Sept. 17 and has been working from Las Vegas since then, she said. He had planned to return to Carson City next week, “but travel is on hold for the time being,” Delaney said. The unidentified staffer received a positive result Tuesday after developing symptoms over the weekend. The staffer was last in the Capitol office Friday, she said. Contact tracing is underway, Delaney said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nNashua: Seven people connected to a church have been diagnosed with COVID-19, and health officials are asking anyone who attended a multiday prayer session and other events to get tested. The Department of Health and Human Services said Wednesday that it is investigating a potential outbreak associated with events hosted by Gate City Church, including a Sept. 19-28 prayer session. Health officials said anyone who attended events associated with the church since Sept. 19 should seek testing. According to a notice on the church’s website, services will be online for the next few weeks. “We have had a few of our members test positive for COVID-19 and while we do not operate in fear, we want to take every step necessary to mitigate your exposure and to be safe. Please know that these are not large numbers and understand that these are not Gate City Church Staff,” the website says.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state added 1,300 new coronavirus cases overnight, more than 1.5 times more than the previous day’s figure and the highest level since late May, Gov. Phil Murphy said Thursday. The biggest increases are in Ocean and Monmouth counties, the Democratic governor said during a news conference. Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli said most of the positive cases in Ocean County stem from Lakewood, predominantly among white men ages 19-49 and possibly related to religious services or celebrations in late September. Hospitalizations also climbed to 652, the highest level since early August, Murphy said. Eleven people were reported to have died overnight, bringing the statewide total to 14,373. The positivity rate for testing stood at 3.69%, while the rate of transmission fell to 1.22, down from 1.27. “We are anticipating a second wave, and we are preparing based on our prior experiences,” Persichilli said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Newly confirmed cases of COVID-19 jumped to 426 statewide in the second-highest single-day tally of the pandemic, state health officials said Wednesday. Two fatalities were announced as virus-related deaths approach the 900 mark. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham is showing no signs of infection as she self-quarantines in response to one positive test result by a custodian at the governor’s mansion in Santa Fe. The seven-day rolling average of daily deaths in New Mexico decreased over the past two weeks, going from four deaths per day Sept. 22 to three deaths per day Tuesday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering. At the same time, the average positivity rate has climbed over the past two weeks from 2.1% to 3.65%, and daily positive tests have nearly doubled from 120 on Sept. 22 to 235 on Tuesday.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Hundreds of businesses in neighborhoods where COVID-19 cases have spiked were supposed to be closed Thursday by order of the governor, but questions remained about how effectively officials would be able to enforce shutdown rules in areas where they’ve been met with resentment. In Brooklyn’s Borough Park section, the scene of two nights of protests against the restrictions, some merchants subject to the shutdown order appeared to be operating as usual at midday, including a barbershop, cellphone stores and a toy store. Mayor Bill de Blasio said 1,200 city workers would be out on the streets Thursday doing enforcement, though some of those efforts involved trying to educate businesses about rules imposed with little warning in hastily drawn zones with confusing borders. The restrictions involve parts of Brooklyn and Queens, sections of Orange and Rockland counties in the Hudson Valley and an area in Binghamton.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper tested negative for the coronavirus last month and has never had a positive result, his office confirmed Wednesday. The governor’s Republican challenger, Lt. Gov. Dan Forest, said Monday on Twitter that he “tested negative a few days ago ahead of my mother visiting.” Forest said he wanted to spend time with his family over the past weekend ahead of a final 30-day push to the Nov. 3 general election. He also urged reporters to question Cooper’s health, claiming the governor has spent “the past 207 days in hiding” at the Governor’s Mansion in Raleigh. Cooper went 16 days without a news conference in September – the longest gap between press conferences since the start of the pandemic. The confirmation of a negative test result comes as Cooper sharpens his criticism of President Donald Trump’s handling of the coronavirus and his decision to return to the White House shortly after testing positive.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A state legislative candidate who won the June primary over the longtime incumbent and who was a target of Gov. Doug Burgum has died due to complications from COVID-19, his mother said Tuesday. David Andahl, 55, died Monday. His mother, Pat Andahl, told The Bismarck Tribune her son had been hospitalized and died after being sick for about four days. Pat Andahl said her son had been “very careful” about the pandemic and was passionate about the idea of serving in government. “He had a lot of feelings for his county … and wanting to make things better, and his heart was in farming. He wanted things better for farmers and the coal industry,” she said. Andahl and fellow District 8 House candidate Dave Nehring won the Republicans’ endorsements and voters’ nominations to defeat one of North Dakota’s most powerful lawmakers, Rep. Jeff Delzer, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A voting rights group keen on expanding access to ballot drop boxes in November’s election is getting a second chance to make its case, after a federal judge agreed Thursday to reconsider his earlier ruling. U.S. District Court Judge Dan Polster had dismissed the A. Philip Randolph Institute’s case Tuesday because he said Secretary of State Frank LaRose had issued a new order a day earlier that permitted ballot drop boxes at multiple locations within a county, as the institute’s lawsuit sought. But LaRose’s office said by allowing drop boxes “outside” boards of elections, his new directive was meant to restrict them to board property just outside the building – not to allow them off-site. The dispute comes as ballot drop boxes have become an appealing option for voters seeking to address worries about voting in person due to the pandemic and worries that voting by mail may not be reliable, a misstaken idea promoted by President Donald Trump.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The number of hospitalizations in the state due to the illness caused by the coronavirus surged above 700 on Wednesday to a new record one-day high. The number of people hospitalized, either confirmed with COVID-19 or under investigation for infection, reached 738, according to Oklahoma State Department of Health, an increase of 39 from Tuesday. While Oklahoma has seen a slight decrease in both new cases and test positivity over the past week, the state still far exceeds the national average in both categories and remains in the red zone with high levels of community transmission and “many preventable deaths,” according to the White House Coronavirus Task Force Report released Wednesday. State officials are working with hospitals to move patients to facilities with more bed capacity, said Oklahoma National Guard Lt. Col. Matt Stacy, who has coordinated the state’s surge plan.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Several workplace outbreaks have contributed to Marion County’s rise in COVID-19 cases, according to the Oregon Health Authority. The OHA identified new workplace outbreaks at Oregon State Hospital and Oregon State Correctional Institution in Salem on Wednesday. The outbreak at Oregon State Correctional Institution was identified as having 41 new cases dating back to Sept. 28, and the outbreak at Oregon State Hospital was identified as having 20 cases, dating back to July 13. Workplace outbreaks were also identified with 20 cases at New Season Foods Company in Washington County, though it didn’t specify which location, and McDonald’s in Medford with 21 cases. The OHA said the outbreaks may include family members or other close contacts with employees.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nWest Manchester Township: It was a long, boring spring and summer for the four-footed members of the Alliance of Therapy Dogs, who couldn’t visit nursing homes and hospitals. The coronavirus paused the professional canine therapeutic interactions with patients and hospital workers. “You could actually see him falling into a depression at home,” said Wendy Kadish of York Township, describing her 8-year-old Rottweiler, Roman, who was unable to do his “job” as the pandemic wore on. On Tuesday, Roman stood at the end of a long-stretched leash, absorbing delighted squeals and scratches from several hospital workers. The Alliance of Therapy Dogs was visiting UPMC Memorial for a pet parade on the sidewalks. Pet therapy has been suspended at the campus during the pandemic. The parade offered a chance for hospital workers to take a break with 12 furry visitors.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Some Providence College students resumed in-person classes Thursday for the first time since the school switched to a remote-only plan because of a coronavirus outbreak that affected more than 200 people. Only students who live on campus will be allowed to return to in-person classes at first, Interim Vice President for Student Affairs Steven Sears said in a letter to the campus community. Students who live off campus will be allowed to resume in-person classes Monday, he said. The school’s stay-at-home order remains in effect. The school was given the go-ahead by the state Department of Health on Wednesday after there were no positives out of 293 student tests. The private Roman Catholic school moved to remote learning late last month after a surge in cases that affected mostly off-campus students who had been gathering in small groups. Gov. Gina Raimondo called the students selfish.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that a program created by Gov. Henry McMaster to allocate $32 million in federal pandemic aid to private and religious schools is unconstitutional because the public money would directly benefit the schools. In the court’s opinion, Chief Justice Don Beatty acknowledged the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on the lives of South Carolinians and the state’s education system, as well as the “unprecedented challenges” faced by state leaders including McMaster. But the difficulties of the pandemic could not dictate the court’s decision, Beatty wrote. The ruling comes days after congressional leaders called on the U.S. Department of Education to review the program, which they labeled “a voucher scheme,” arguing it violated “the plain text” of the coronavirus aid package and guidance provided by the federal department.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A small hospital serving the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe has sent two coronavirus patients to an out-of-state hospital in recent days, the tribe’s health department said Wednesday, even as South Dakota’s top health officials insist the state has plenty of hospital capacity for COVID-19 patients. The Cheyenne River Sioux Health Department reported it tried to find better-equipped hospitals to transfer coronavirus patients, but 14 facilities said they were also diverting COVID-19 patients. Eventually, the tribal health department found a hospital in Burnsville, Minnesota, that would accept patients. Gov. Kristi Noem has made the state’s hospital capacity the bottom line of her coronavirus response strategy. But as hospitals feel the squeeze of a rising number of cases and hospitalizations, the state’s hospital systems have seen ripple effects. South Dakota experienced all-time highs for active coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths Thursday.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The University of Memphis will begin staff reductions to offset a loss of $50million due to the COVID-19 pandemic, President M. David Rudd told faculty and staff in an email Wednesday. The reductions will affect facilities management and support services along with the following auxiliary groups: housing, the Holiday Inn, parking and transportation services, Tiger Copy and Graphics, mail services, dining services, conference and event services, and other “smaller units,” Rudd said. Colleges, academics and research groups are not affected by the reductions. Some administrative positions had already been consolidated and reorganized, while some vacant administrative positions are also being eliminated. The core leadership team, such as the President’s Council members, are taking a 10% salary reduction through the end of the fiscal year. Rudd is taking a 20% reduction through the end of the year.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Republican Gov. Greg Abbott on Wednesday allowed bars to begin reopening for the first time since June, ending a lockdown that began during a massive coronavirus outbreak that became one of the deadliest in the nation. However, the move doesn’t allow bars to fully reopen, nor everywhere in the state. Dallas and Houston leaders quickly made clear they would still keep bars sidelined, pointing to recent upticks in cases and hospitalizations. And bars that are given local permission to open starting next week can only do so at 50% capacity. Texas this week surpassed 16,000 virus deaths and is closing in on 800,000 confirmed cases. New cases in Texas have dramatically fallen since summer, and the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations has leveled off around 3,200 – three times lower than July’s grim peak, but also a patient load that has stopped falling in the past two weeks.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state surpassed the grim milestone Thursday of 500 deaths from the coronavirus as the numbers of new cases and hospitalizations continued to break records. Utah has been in the midst of a record-setting surge in reported coronavirus cases over the past month. The state now ranks fifth in the country for newly confirmed infections per capita, according to data from Johns Hopkins. Utah set a daily case count record with 1,501 new cases reported Thursday, as well as a record 237 patients who are currently hospitalized. Dr. Emily Spivak, an infectious diseases physician at University of Utah Health, said the intensive care unit at her hospital had reached 95% capacity. She issued a plea to residents during the governor’s weekly briefing to follow medical recommendations and wear masks so the state’s hospital systems don’t become overwhelmed.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: A low number of cases of the virus that causes COVID-19 means students in the city will be able to spend more time in class rather than study online. WCAX-VT reports Burlington officials say starting Oct. 19, students in kindergarten through second grade will transition from two days of in-person learning to four days. On Oct. 26, student in third through fifth grades will make the same transition. In a virtual meeting Wednesday, Mayor Miro Weinberger said the low number of virus cases in the city in September was better than officials could have expected. “The numbers in our schools, in the city and the state are suggesting that it’s time to move back to more in-person instruction,” Burlington School Superintendent Tom Flanagan said during the meeting with the mayor. Since August, the University of Vermont and Champlain College have conducted nearly 70,000 virus tests with 27 students testing positive.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Ralph Northam announced Thursday that he’s putting an additional $220 million in federal COVID-19 relief funds toward the state’s public schools. Northam said in a statement that the extra money would be used to help schools pay for testing supplies, personal protective equipment and technology needed for virtual learning. Virginia schools are currently operating in a mishmash fashion, with some districts offering in-person instruction while others are mostly virtual. The governor said the money would be distributed to all 135 school districts at a rate of $175 per pupil. He said every district would get a minimum of $100,000. The extra money comes on top of about $300 million in federal funds the governor has directed toward public schools during the pandemic. The state received $3.1 billion in federal coronavirus relief funds and has roughly $1.3 billion still unallotted.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: COVID-19 cases among students in more than a dozen sororities and fraternities at the University of Washington have topped 200. As of Thursday morning, 215 positive cases have been confirmed among 15 fraternities and sororities, spokesperson Victor Balta said on the school’s website. That’s up from 179 cases as of Tuesday and 131 cases Friday. According to the UW’s case tracking system, as of Oct. 6, 476 students, 63 staff and 10 faculty have tested positive since Feb. 27. Students who have tested positive or have COVID-19-like symptoms are being told to isolate in their current place of residence, according to the university. The university is not aware of any students who have been hospitalized or reported severe symptoms of the virus. An outbreak in June infected 154 students in 15 fraternity houses at the university.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Two hospital nurses in the state have died from the coronavirus, officials said. West Virginia University Health System President and CEO Albert Wright said Jeannette Williams Parker was a nurse at Ruby Memorial Hospital in Morgantown, news outlets report. According to her obituary, Parker, 48, of Rivesville, died Sept. 30. “Jeannette’s passing is also an unwelcome reminder that COVID-19 remains with us,” Wright said. Department of Health and Human Resources Secretary Bill Crouch said Wednesday that a nurse at Mildred-Mitchell Bateman Hospital, a state-run facility in Huntington, also died from COVID-19. “This was one of ours, and we are just deeply saddened,” Crouch said. Gov. Jim Justice said during a news conference Wednesday that “we should continue to remember all of these first-line responders. These are the real heroes. Now we have lost two nurses within our state.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: Health officials say the city will enforce its own coronavirus orders for bars and restaurants, which doesn’t necessarily limit the businesses to 25% capacity imposed under Gov. Tony Evers’ new restrictions. The Milwaukee Health Department said in a statement that Evers’ order permits local municipalities to have more restrictive orders in place, and the city determined its plan fits that criteria. Even though the city’s current order “permits a larger threshold of individuals in certain places than (Evers’ order) allows, the additional restrictions listed under the local order do more to prevent COVID-19 transmission than Governor Evers’ Emergency Order #3,” health officials said in a statement. The local order requires restaurants and bars to submit an 80-point COVID-19 checklist to the health department in order to operate. Under the order, capacity limits are waived if a bar or restaurant has an approved COVID-19 safety plan.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Coronavirus hospitalizations in the state reached a new high Wednesday as a fall surge in infections continued unabated, raising concern that small hospitals could run out of room to treat intensive-care patients. Forty-seven people were hospitalized with the COVID-19 illness, up from 24 a week ago, which at the time was the most since hospitalizations peaked at 23 in April. The 47 patients were at 14 hospitals around the state. Wyoming health officials aren’t worried that COVID-19 patients are about to overwhelm any specific hospital, department spokeswoman Kim Deti said. The small intensive-care capacities at most Wyoming hospitals were a general concern, however. “Any of the small ones would be of concern because with their capacity, it just doesn’t take much,” Deti said Wednesday. ”None of our hospitals are terribly large.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/10/09"}]}
{"question_id": "20221230_3", "search_time": "2023/01/01/07:22", "search_result": [{"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/27/us/california-rural-wildfire-risk-climate/index.html", "title": "85% of rural areas in California is in 'high' or 'very high' risk for wildfires", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe climate crisis is among the key factors in a new assessment that shows more than 85% of California’s rural and unincorporated land is now in “high” or “very high” severity zones for wildfire danger, the state’s Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) recently announced.\n\nCalifornia’s new proposed Fire Hazard Severity Zone map, which analyzes only the land that Cal Fire is responsible for and is used for things like building standards, real-estate disclosures and future planning, is based on long-term data and created to last a decade or more. The previous version, which was done in 2007, was considered out of date.\n\nThe amount of land in “very high” severity zones saw a significant jump, increasing by 14.6% in the fresh analysis. If the proposed map is approved, nearly 17 million acres – an area larger than the state of West Virginia – will be in Cal Fire’s worst designation.\n\n“A lot has happened since 2007,” Cal Fire said in a release announcing the update. “Using the best available science with academic researchers and others, this updated map reflects the impacts of a changing climate and includes a variety of other key factors.”\n\nAround 98% of California was in drought conditions this week, according to the US Drought Monitor, as the state remains in the grips of a multiyear megadrought fueled by warmer temperatures and drier conditions.\n\nAs recently as 2018, California saw the largest, deadliest and most destructive wildfires in state history. In the past five years, California has seen an average of more than 7,000 wildfires each year, consuming an average of over 2 million acres, according to data from the governor’s office.\n\nThe proposed map includes only rural and unincorporated areas – cities and large urban areas are excluded, but are expected to be added in an updated version next year.\n\nDozens of meetings to discuss the findings are scheduled over the next several weeks to allow for public comment before the map is officially adopted.\n\n“CAL FIRE’s fire scientists and wildfire mitigation experts developed the map using a science-based and field-tested model that assigns a hazard score based on the factors that influence fire likelihood and fire behavior. Many factors are considered, such as fire history, existing and potential fuel (natural vegetation), predicted flame length, blowing embers, terrain, and typical fire weather for an area.

They live in more than 1.1 million housing units, or in about one in 12 of the state’s homes.\n\nThat’s right. One in 12 homes in California are at high risk of burning in a wildfire.\n\nThis is a wicked problem with no easy answers. And the more information we can share about where and how we’re falling short, the quicker we can come together on potential solutions.\n\nThat was the spirit in which journalists from USA TODAY Network-California, McClatchy, Media News and the Associated Press came together in late 2018 after November’s Camp Fire in Paradise that took 85 lives.\n\n'There's a lot of Paradises out there': Over 75 California towns are at-risk of burning\n\nWe asked this question: If California is destined to burn, how can we have a sophisticated conversation about how to lessen the impacts on people who live here?\n\nOver five months we analyzed state hazard assessments, wind models and the age of our housing stock to identify the 15 places most likely to burn. We evaluated evacuation plans for the 187 cities and towns designated as high risk, as Paradise was.\n\nWe used demographic and socioeconomic data, road patterns and other materials to determine which of these communities’ residents would have the most trouble evacuating.\n\nWhat we found is deeply troubling. And yet there are actionable steps we can take today that will help tomorrow and in the years to come.\n\nWe interviewed residents whose homes survived to learn about what they did and what others can do. We detail how many homes are built to fire-resistant standards and how to tell if yours is not.\n\nOur goal with this collaboration is to put a spotlight on policy issues that can and should be raised in the halls of the state Capitol and by local communities that set defensible space standards and evacuation routes.\n\nWildfires: Millions bracing for wildfire season wonder if their homes are safe\n\nWe hope you read and share these powerful, revelatory stories and videos as we look to bend the trajectory of wildfire’s impact.\n\nWe begin with today’s Sacramento Bee, Chico Enterprise-Record and Paradise Post stories.

Immigration\n\nA controversial Trump-era border restriction will remain in effect while legal challenges play out, the Supreme Court said Tuesday, a decision that ensures federal officials will continue to swiftly expel migrants at US borders at least for the next several months. Since March 2020, the measure – known as Title 42 – has allowed border agents to immediately turn away migrants who have crossed the southern border in the name of Covid-19 prevention. The order is a win for Republican-led states that urged the Supreme Court to step in and block a lower court opinion that ordered the termination of the authority. Immigration advocates have denounced the use of the public health authority, arguing it was a pretext to stop migrants from entering the US. In its order, the high court said it would hear arguments in the case in February. Meanwhile, the Texas National Guard installed two miles of border fencing in the El Paso, Texas, area as a surging number of migrants face uncertainty.\n\n2. Snowstorm\n\nDays into the deadly winter storm that pummeled much of the country, the challenges are far from over in Buffalo, New York. At least 31 people died in New York’s Erie County, and the number continues to rise as authorities check on homes and cars for anyone who was stranded in the snow. “We’re, unfortunately, finding bodies on the street and in snow banks,” Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz said. “There’s a lot of roads that are completely blocked right now, that have no access whatsoever.” Military police are helping enforce a driving ban in Buffalo as more than 7,000 utility workers navigate through broken trees and poles around the clock to restore power. In one heartwarming story, a Buffalo woman answered a stranger’s cry for help and rescued a man with severe frostbite stuck in a snowbank outside her house. Nationwide, another 25 people have been reported dead in the storm across 11 states.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback She heard cries for help during deadly winter storm.

Southwest Airlines\n\nSouthwest Airlines’ operational meltdown has put the Dallas-based carrier under serious scrutiny – not only from stranded passengers and the media but from Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg as well. Buttigieg spoke directly to Southwest CEO Bob Jordan about the thousands of flights that have been canceled this week with no immediate indication of when passengers can rebook. “Their system really has completely melted down,” Buttigieg told CNN. “I made clear that our department will be holding them accountable for their responsibilities to customers, both to get them through this situation and to make sure that this can’t happen again.” Passengers who booked with Southwest have been hoping for some much-needed relief on cancellations and delays. But those hopes are so far being dashed.

Trump’s taxes\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s tax returns will be released Friday morning, a source told CNN. The returns will be placed into the congressional record that day during a House pro forma session.

The committee released a report that detailed six years’ worth of his tax returns, including his claims of massive annual losses that significantly reduced his tax burden. Chairman Richard Neal and fellow Democrats have said that the records they obtained showed that the presidential audit program failed to work as intended. Neal charged Trump’s returns were only subjected to the mandatory audit once, in 2019, after Democrats inquired.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback What we know about Trump's tax returns 02:26 - Source: CNN\n\n5. Gas prices\n\nGas prices will likely be significantly cheaper next year – but the national average could still climb back above the $4-a-gallon threshold as soon as May, according to GasBuddy projections shared exclusively with CNN. The good news is that the price-tracking website doesn’t expect a repeat of this year’s wild swings that at one point sent gas prices above $5 a gallon for the first time. That spike set off recession alarm bells, worsened inflation and crushed consumer confidence. The national average for regular gas is expected to drop to $3.49 a gallon in 2023, down roughly 50 cents from the average this year, according to GasBuddy.\n\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\n\nHugh Jackman’s frenemy dynamic with Ryan Reynolds is going big screen in ‘Deadpool 3’\n\nThey “hate” each other, and we love it.\n\nBeef burger or plant-based meat substitutes?\n\nThese labels encourage people to pick meals with a smaller climate footprint.\n\nVandals destroyed 22,000-year-old sacred cave art\n\nAn indigenous group is devastated and police are searching for the culprits.\n\nA curious black bear in Connecticut got more than it bargained for\n\nIt wasn’t ready for an ambush by two pigs after it climbed into their pen.\n\nReturning that ugly Christmas sweater could cost you\n\nSome chains are slapping on extra fees of up to $7 for online returns.\n\nTHIS JUST IN\n\nPope Francis says Former Pope Benedict is ‘very sick’\n\nPope Francis said that his predecessor, Pope Benedict – the 95-year-old former pontiff who resigned from the post nine years ago – is “very sick.” “I want to ask you all for a special prayer for Pope Emeritus Benedict who sustains the Church in his silence,” Francis said during his general audience at the Vatican earlier today.\n\nTODAY’S NUMBER\n\n85%\n\nThat’s the percentage of rural land in California that’s at “high” or “very high” risk for wildfires, according to a new analysis.\n\nTODAY’S QUOTE\n\n“Fentanyl is so potent that teens, particularly teens who have never used an opioid before and have no tolerance to them, can die really quickly.

And it isn’t the mega drought. It’s actually the exact opposite.\n\nA megaflood.\n\nA new study by Science Advances shows climate change has already doubled the chances of a disastrous flood happening in California in the next four decades. And experts say it would be unlike anything anyone alive today has ever experienced.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN reporter shows impact drought has had on California river 02:37 - Source: CNN\n\nDaniel Swain, a climate scientist with UCLA and a researcher involved in the study, describes a megaflood as, “a very severe flood event across a broad region that has the potential to bring catastrophic impacts to society in the areas affected.” He said a megaflood is similar to the 1,000-year flash flood events seen this summer in the St. Louis area and Kentucky, but across a much wider area, such as the entire state of California.\n\nThese massive floods, which experts say would turn California’s lowlands into a “vast inland sea,” might have previously happened once in a lifetime in the state. But experts say climate change is increasing the likelihood of these catastrophic disasters, causing them to occur more like every 25 to 50 years.\n\nClimate change supercharges heavy rain events, making flash floods occur more regularly, as has been noted several times this summer in Eastern Kentucky, St. Louis, and even in California’s Death Valley National Park.\n\nCalifornia is prone to these floods from atmospheric rivers naturally, and major floods from them have happened before – but climate change is upping the ante, and millions of people could be impacted.\n\nThe study said atmospheric rivers could become consecutive for weeks on end, like seen in this animation. Xingying Huang, one of the authors of the study, made this loop, which illustrates the water vapor transportation and potential precipitation accumulation at selected time slices during the 30-day scenario.\n\nThe area with the most destruction would be the Central Valley of California, including Sacramento, Fresno and Bakersfield, the study’s authors project. The Central Valley, roughly the size of Vermont and Massachusetts combined, produces a quarter of the nation’s food supply, according to the US Geological Survey.\n\nA flood with the size to fill this valley has the potential to be the most expensive geophysical disaster to date, costing upwards of $1 trillion in losses and devastating the state’s lowland areas, including Los Angeles and Orange counties, according to the study.\n\nThat would be more 5 times the cost of Hurricane Katrina, the current costliest disaster in US history.\n\n“Such a flood event in modern California would likely exceed the damages from a large magnitude earthquake by a considerable margin,” the study showed.\n\nIn this photo provided by the National Park Service, Mud Canyon Road is closed due to flash flooding in Death Valley, California. National Park Service/AP\n\nThis study is the first phase of a three-part series studying the effects of a future megaflood event in California. The next two phases are expected to be released in two to three years.\n\n“Ultimately, one of our goals is not just to understand these events scientifically, but it’s also to help California prepare for them,” Swain said. “It’s a question of when rather than if (the megaflood) occurs.”\n\nIt’s happened before. It will happen again, but worse, warns scientists\n\nOver 150 years ago, a strong series of atmospheric rivers drenched the Golden State, causing one of the most exceptional floods in history following a dry spell that had left the West parched for decades.\n\nCommunities were demolished in minutes.\n\nThis 1861 photograph shows flooding in Sacramento. Sacramento Public Library\n\nIt was the winter of 1861-1862 and a historic megaflood transformed the San Joaquin and Sacramento valleys into a “temporary but vast inland sea,” according to the study. Some areas had up to 30 feet of water for weeks, obliterating infrastructure, farmland, and towns.\n\nSacramento, the new state capital at the time, was under ten feet of debris-filled water for months.\n\nThe catastrophe began in December 1861, when nearly 15 feet of snow fell in the Sierra Nevada. Repetitive atmospheric rivers dropped warm rain for 43 days thereafter, dumping water down the mountainous slopes and into the valleys.\n\nFour thousand people lost their lives, one-third of the state’s property was destroyed, a quarter of California’s cattle population drowned or starved, and one in eight homes were a complete loss by floodwaters.\n\nIn addition, one-fourth of California’s economy was obliterated, resulting in a state-wide bankruptcy.\n\nSwain warns a megaflood like this will happen again, but worse and more frequent.\n\nDowntown Sacramento today, which was raised 10-15 feet after the historic floods. Melina Mara/The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\n“We find that climate change has already increased the risk of a (1862) megaflood scenario in California, but that future climate warming will likely bring about even sharper risk increases,” the study warns.\n\nMany of today’s major cities with millions of residents are built directly on top of the ancient flood deposits, Swain added, putting far more people in harm’s way.\n\nAbout 500,000 people lived in California in 1862. Now, the state’s population is over 39 million.\n\n“When this (flood) occurs again, the consequences would be wildly different than they were back in the 1860s,” Swain said.\n\nClimate change increases the amount of rain the atmosphere can hold and causes more water in the air to fall as rain, which can lead to immediate flooding. Both are and will continue to occur in California.\n\nThe new study shows a rapid increase in the likelihood of week-long, recurring strong-to-extreme atmospheric rivers during the cool season. An atmospheric river is a long, narrow region of heavy moisture in the atmosphere that can transport moisture thousands of miles, like a fire hose in the sky. They usually bring beneficial rainfall to drought-prone regions like California but could quickly become hazardous with a warming climate.\n\nHistorically these winter atmospheric rivers dump feet of snow in the Sierra Nevada, but as climate warms, more of the snow will fall as rain. Instead of melting slowly over time, it all runs off, piles up, and floods immediately.\n\nCalifornia's Central Valley, which produces one-fourth of the nation's food, will be ravaged by a megaflood. Citizen of the Planet/UCG/Universal Images Group/Getty Images\n\nWith a neighbor like the Pacific Ocean, California has “an infinite reservoir of water vapor offshore,” Swain added.\n\nCalifornia’s mountainous terrain and wildfire risk make it especially vulnerable to flooding. Lingering burn scars from wildfires can create a steep, slick surface for water and debris to flow off. With wildfires becoming larger and burning more area thanks to climate change, more areas are susceptible to these debris flows.\n\nAlthough models show this megaflood is inevitable, experts say there are ways to mitigate excessive loss.\n\n“I think the extent of (megaflood) losses can be significantly reduced by doing certain sorts of things to revamp our flood management and our water management systems and our disaster preparedness,” Swain said.\n\nHuang, a project scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research and a researcher involved in the study, said everyone can make a small effort in combating climate change.\n\n“If we work together to decrease future emissions, we can also reduce the risk of extreme events,” Huang said.", "authors": ["Payton Major Judson Jones", "Payton Major", "Judson Jones"], "publish_date": "2022/08/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/05/16/first-street-foundation-new-tool-assesses-property-wildfire-risk/9763136002/", "title": "First Street Foundation: New tool assesses a property's wildfire risk", "text": "New model lets homeowners see their fire risk\n\nWildfires burning more acres across the U.S. each year\n\nTaking steps to try to lower fire risk is do-it-yourself friendly\n\nTeresa Burgess woke up in the middle of the night to her neighbor’s son shouting and pounding on the windows and doors of her home in Ventura, California. Through the windows she could see an eerie orange glow.\n\nA raging inferno that became known as the Thomas Fire, one of California’s most devastating wildfires, threatened their community after racing 10 miles in just a few hours on Dec. 4, 2017.\n\n“It was pretty frightening,” Burgess said. “We could see emergency vehicles. The winds were howling.”\n\nAfter grabbing just a few things, she and her husband could feel the heat as they loaded their three dogs into vehicles and drove away from their home of 25 years. It would be one of more than 500 homes torched that night by flames and glowing embers the size of basketballs.\n\nFires like these have put California in the news countless times in recent years, but it’s one of many states where residents face a growing wildfire threat, and that risk is forecast to increase exponentially in the years ahead, concludes a new report released Monday by the First Street Foundation.\n\nThe report analyzes the results of a first-of-its-kind wildfire risk model, developed by the nonprofit foundation and its partners in a public-private collaboration. The model assesses each property’s risk based on a broad array of data and information, including property type, building materials, terrain and proximity to historic fires.\n\nProperty owners across the country can type in their address at Riskfactor.com or at Realtor.com and learn more about their risk, then scroll through and see how that threat changes over time and what they might consider doing to make their properties safer.\n\nAbout 80 million homes and other structures across the country are threatened by wildfire risk, said Matthew Eby, the foundation’s founder and executive director. Of those, more than 10% face a risk considered major, severe or extreme, with anywhere from a 6% to 26% chance of a wildfire over a 30-year period.\n\nThe First Street Foundation, based in New York, has modeled flood risk from rising sea levels and extreme rainfall, launching a tool for homeowners in 2020 on Realtor.com called Flood Factor. The results of its latest work, Fire Factor, launched Monday.\n\nMillions of people each year make decisions on the biggest investment of their lives – buying a home – without the right information at their fingertips, Eby said. He hopes to change that.\n\nAlthough the annual number of wildfires has decreased slightly in the U.S. over the past 30 years, the number of acres burned each year is increasing, more than double what it was in the 1990s, according to a report by the Congressional Research Service. Fires burned 7.1 million acres in 2021 and 10.12 million acres in 2020, just below a record high set in 2015, based on statistics from the National Interagency Fire Center.\n\nThe fires burn in conflagrations that give people little time to prepare or react. Rising temperatures and lengthy droughts make conditions worse and put more people are in harm’s way. More than 3,500 homes burned last year.\n\nNot only is the wildfire risk expected to increase over the next 30 years, but many properties with moderate levels of risk now will move into higher levels, the report said.\n\n“Fire is driven by heat, and heat is the No. 1 thing we see changing in climate models,” Eby told USA TODAY.\n\nOver the next 30 years, the states with the biggest increase in the number of properties that meet the foundation’s threshold for risk are Colorado, Alabama, Mississippi, Texas and Montana. Also in the top 10 with the biggest increases are Oklahoma, Arkansas, Wyoming, Kansas and South Carolina.\n\nSeeing those Southeastern states in the list was the biggest surprise after hundreds of millions of model runs, said Ed Kearns, the foundation’s chief data officer.\n\nIn Appalachia and along the East Coast, it's going to get drier and more combustible, said Kearns, a former chief data officer at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \"It kind of reaffirmed a fear that I had, but it's even more widespread than I thought.\"\n\nBut states in the Northeast have a low fire risk, the study found.\n\nAmong the list of counties with the most properties at risk are three in California – Riverside, Los Angeles and San Bernardino – along with Maricopa County, Arizona, and Polk County, Florida.\n\nThe counties with the largest percentage of properties at risk are Los Alamos, Harding and Colfax in New Mexico and Mason and Gillespie in Texas. In each of those counties, more than 97.9% of the structures in the county are at risk, according to the foundation’s modeling.\n\nFire Factor includes a graphic on the possible height of flames that could reach a home, how likely a home might be to combust, and the most recent wildfire larger than 100 acres within 20 miles. Eby said people will be able to use the tool to understand their risk at a property level and also how that risk is going to evolve over the next 30 years.\n\nMost encouraging to Kearns are model results that show efforts to reduce fuels and use fire breaks do make a difference. “It’s a really good sign there are some big steps we can take on a large scale to protect communities,\" he said.\n\nJim Karels, fire director for the National Association of State Foresters and retired director of the Florida Forest Service, isn’t aware of any other nationwide program that allows property owners to examine their risk.\n\n“The more tools the better,” Karels said. For him, the big question is how to persuade people to take action once they learn about their risk and to get them past the point of thinking a wildfire won’t happen to them.\n\nIn states like California, where people see recent or regular damage to neighbors' homes, people take wildfires more seriously, he said. To his dismay, the same doesn’t appear to be true in Florida.\n\n“Convincing homeowners to take steps to reduce their threats is probably the biggest hurdle we’ve got,” he said. He was Florida’s assistant chief for fire control during the “summer of fire” in 1998, when 500,000 acres and 150 structures burned.\n\nAt the time, it seemed those were lessons Floridians would never forget. But since then, Karels said, “with a whole bunch of people moving in every day from places where they don’t have fires, it’s hard to convince them there’s a threat until it happens.”\n\nSecuring a home against wildfire threats is probably the most affordable and do-it-yourself kind of disaster prevention, said Leslie Chapman-Henderson, president and chief executive officer of the Federal Alliance for Safe Homes, or FLASH. “It’s pretty achievable.”\n\nProperty owners can put wire mesh over soffit and vents and other openings to prevent flying embers from invading, she said. They can also add spark arresters in chimneys and fireproof decks, and they can create three zones of defensible space around their homes.\n\nWildfire prep:Wildfires near you? Follow these safety tips for homeowners\n\nThe safe homes alliance, a Florida-based nonprofit, educates homeowners about disasters and how to be resilient, especially when it comes to local building codes.\n\n“We have to give them the tools to do it, and they need information,” she said. \"This type of custom risk information is excellent because it helps motivate people to take meaningful action that will save lives and homes in the future.\"\n\nFor Burgess, the flames left heartache in their wake. The couple learned their home burned about 24 hours later when their son, across the country, saw TV video of their house on fire.\n\nEven though they had good insurance, the fire left gaping wounds in their lives. After the fire, they sat down with an adjuster and went through room by room everything they lost and put a value on it. It took several visits.\n\n“We already had bleeding wounds. They’d started to scab over and it was like getting the scab ripped off every time,” she said. “We couldn’t take it. We would just break down remembering everything we lost.”\n\nLife goes on, Burgess said, but she still regrets leaving behind the 50 photo albums of their travels around the world. She and her husband divorced and never rebuilt their home. She sold the still-vacant lot this year.\n\n“It was an incredibly emotional, tumultuous time,” she said. “Based on my experience, I would say pretty much everybody is at risk.\"\n\nDinah Voyles Pulver covers climate and environmental issues for USA TODAY.

More info on the series and other coverage can be found below.\n\nHow many roads are enough to get out?\n\nThat's the question we wondered after watching tragedy unfold in Paradise, Calif., last year during the Camp Fire.\n\nParadise had five two-lane roads and one four-lane road leading out of town. But the fire forced officials to close three of those routes, further clogging the remaining roads.\n\nDid Paradise have an unusually high ratio of residents to escape routes? Or were other California communities in a similar situation?\n\nA USA Today-California Network analysis of California communities and evacuation routes shows that some areas in the state are far outside the norm when it comes to the number of lanes of roadway available for the size of the population.\n\nThis is a shorthand method of evaluating the efficacy of egress routes, according to emergency planning experts.\n\nTo evaluate exit routes for Californians living in areas at risk of a fire-related evacuation, we combined and analyzed data from the U.S. Census Bureau, Cal Fire and OpenStreetMap.\n\nWe took 2010 census block-level populations, combined with Cal Fire's \"Fire Hazard Severity Zone\" maps, and aggregated those to ZIP codes, then applied more current population estimates. Next, we spatially joined those areas with the fire risk map. That provided a current population risk breakdown for each ZIP code, based on area and estimated population.\n\nWe added OpenStreetMap data to each ZIP code, so we could see which roads cross into or out of the area. Combining the ZIP code population and fire risk data with the standard number of lanes for every major roadway allowed us to come up with a set of ZIP codes that have the greatest number of people living in the highest-risk areas and hypothetically trying to use the fewest number of lanes to leave in any direction or to areas at less risk for fire.\n\nWhat does this tell us?\n\nIn short, the analysis gives an estimate of how many people there are for every lane of major road leaving an area.\n\nWhen we looked at all ZIP codes in California that have people living in a very high fire risk zone, we found, on average, 134 residents living in the riskiest areas for each lane of traffic going either direction.\n\nOnly one out of 20 ZIP codes has more than 313 people living in the riskiest areas for each lane of traffic. Paradise had more than 1,000, putting it in the worst 1%. But some areas, such as Oak Park in Ventura County, South Lake Tahoe in El Dorado County or the Palos Verdes Peninsula in Los Angeles County, have two, three or even five times the number of people living in the highest-risk zones, per lane of major roadway out, compared to Paradise.\n\nHere are the ZIP codes the analysis identified as being roughly within the worst 1% in the state when it comes to population-to-evacuation-route ratios:\n\nSouthern California:\n\n90042: Highland Park and Eagle Rock in Los Angeles County\n\n90272: Pacific Palisades in Los Angeles County\n\n90274: Rolling Hills in Los Angeles County\n\n90275: Rancho Palos Verdes in Los Angeles County\n\n\n\n91935: Jamul and surrounding areas in San Diego County\n\n92065: Ramona and surrounding areas in San Diego County\n\n92131: Scripps Ranch in San Diego County\n\n\n\n91320: From Newbury Park to Dos Vientos Ranch in western Thousand Oaks in Ventura County\n\n91377: Oak Park, an unincorporated community in Ventura County\n\n93021: Moorpark in Ventura County\n\n\n\n92548: Homeland and areas northwest of Homeland in Riverside County\n\n92584: Menifee in Riverside County\n\n\n\n92314: Big Bear, Minnelusa and Sugarloaf (92386) in San Bernardino County\n\nCentral California:\n\n93924: Carmel Valley and Jamesburg in Monterey County\n\nNorthern California:\n\n95954: Magalia in Butte County\n\n95969: Paradise in Butte County\n\n\n\n96150: South Lake Tahoe and surrounding areas in El Dorado County\n\n95634: Georgetown and surrounding areas in El Dorado County\n\n\n\n94508: Angwin in Napa County\n\n\n\n94708: Cragmont, Kensington and La Loma Park in northeastern Berkeley in Alameda County\n\n\n\n95422: Clearlake in Lake County\n\n95451: Kelseyville in Lake County\n\n\n\n95631: Foresthill and surrounding areas in Placer County\n\n\n\n95666: Pioneer, Barton and Buckhorn in Amador County\n\nMore from Destined to Burn\n\nMillions bracing for wildfire season wonder if their homes are safe\n\n'There’s a lot of Paradises out there:' Over 75 California towns are at-risk of burning\n\nHow California's forest management may help reduce the risk of wildfires\n\nWATCH: A California reporter returns to his old neighborhood after the Carr Fire\n\nIgnoring high risks of natural disasters is part of the California dream | Column\n\nWATCH: California wildfire: 'I don't think I'll ever unpack'\n\nWhy spotlight California wildfires?\n\nTahoe already has an evacuation problem.

Here's what's to ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPower outages in the US are climbing, researchers reported Wednesday, as extreme weather gets worse due to the climate crisis, the demand for electricity climbs and the country’s energy infrastructure gets older and more vulnerable.\n\nThe analysis from Climate Central, a nonprofit research group, revealed that from 2000 to 2021, 83% of all reported power outages were caused by a weather-related event, from drought-fueled wildfires to damaging storms such as tornadoes and hurricanes – many of which will only intensify as the climate warms.\n\nAnd those numbers are on an upward trend. Researchers reported that outages in the past 10 years had increased by 64% compared with the previous decade.\n\n“This is really something that we should be concerned about because this is affecting all of us and we’re seeing more of them,” Kaitlyn Trudeau, data analyst with Climate Central who worked on the report, told CNN.\n\n“The system we have right now was not built in a time and climate we’re experiencing now,” she added. “It is not prepared for the climate that we have now, and the climate we’re going to see in the future.”\n\nUsing federal data provided by utility companies and the North American Electric Reliability Corp., researchers found more than 1,500 cases of extreme weather-related power outages since 2000, including those caused by high wind; heavy rain and thunderstorms; winter weather, including snow, ice and freezing rain; hurricanes; extreme heat and wildfires. Climate researchers have noted many of these phenomena are becoming more intense and more frequent as global temperatures rise.\n\nClimate Central\n\nClimate Central found that Texas reported the largest number of weather-related outages since 2000, followed by Michigan, California, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania.\n\nThe winter storm and cold snap of February 2021, for example, was the costliest winter weather event on record, resulting in multiple days with below-freezing temperatures that led to several days of power outages for millions of customers in Texas. Nearly 10 million people across the South did not have power at the peak of the outages, according to government figures.\n\nThen in May, a heatwave knocked six natural-gas power plants offline in Texas. The state’s grid operator asked residents to limit electricity use, keeping thermostats at 78 degrees or higher and avoid using large, power-sucking appliances during peak times.\n\nTexas utilities reported around 80 weather-related outages between 2019 and 2021 alone – about 44% of Texas’s total since 2000. Severe weather, winter storms and hurricanes caused a majority of the outages. The report also noted that the state operates its own grid independently from the countries two main grids, which makes it challenging to draw power from elsewhere during disaster events.\n\nIn California, researchers documented 44 weather-related outages between 2019 and 2021 – more than a third of the state’s total since 2000. And, they said, wildfires are a growing threat to stable electricity there. Utilities in California are required to implement public safety power shutoffs to reduce risks of equipment flaring during extreme wildfire days. At least 14 of the state’s 44 outages during that time were due to these preemptive shutdowns.\n\nClimate Central\n\nRomany Webb, a researcher at Columbia University’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, said US utility companies need to account for the changing climate — evaluating whether existing stations are located in areas at risk of flooding, how severe droughts may affect the power plant operations, or how power lines might be impacted by increasing temperatures.\n\n“For many, the findings won’t come as a surprise because, all across the United States, people are already directly experiencing climate change-related disruptions to electricity and other services,” said Webb, who was not involved with the report. “As we’ve seen in recent years, those disruptions can have deadly consequences. Things will only get worse if we don’t take action.”\n\nSteven Weissman, an emeritus lecturer at the University of California at Berkeley who specializes in energy law and policy, said that he would like to see the analysis expand to focus on all aspects of grid operation — and not just the transmission system — as the world looks into cleaner energy sources.\n\n“As we move more toward these intermittent sources of energy like solar and wind, we need to shift to an era where we predict supply and then manage demand, sort of flip it upside down,” Weissman, who was not involved in the report, told CNN. “And how do you manage demand? Well, you set prices that are going to encourage people to use power off-peak. You can also encourage people to have smart appliances that would not have to take power from the grid when demand is highest.”\n\nFirefighters spray water on trees during the Dixie Fire, which was caused by damage to power lines, in August 2021 near Janesville, California. Patrick T. Fallon/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTrudeau said the US needs to create a more resilient and reliable power system to prevent power outages as climate change advances. Building microgrids — small, renewable-powered networks that act as backups for the primary electricity grid, in the event of a major power outage — for example, can help residents weather power outages while also reducing emissions from power generation.\n\nWhen Hurricane Sandy brought heavy rain, strong winds and flooding to Northeast in 2012 and caused significant damage to electrical infrastructure, for instance, microgrids helped residents weather the storm. At the time, 21 states along the East Coast experienced widespread power outages.\n\nShe also said states must invest in smart grid technologies as well as harden the grid to withstand severe storm damages, while also providing customers incentives to reduce energy overuse during peak times.\n\nDespite the uptick in extreme weather, Webb said utilities still haven’t thought ahead.\n\n“Unfortunately, many electric utilities and system operators still aren’t engaging in this sort of planning, and have instead chosen to ignore the reality of climate change,” Webb said. “It is, though, quickly becoming impossible to ignore. The sooner action is taken, the better off we will all be.”\n\nUntil the US makes large-scale investments and pushes to create a more reliable and resilient power grid, the climate crisis will likely lead to more outages and force grid operators to encourage the public to cut electricity use when supply is unable to meet demand, according to Trudeau.\n\n“There is no magic wand that we can wave right now,” Trudeau said. “But ultimately the things that we can focus on are things like cutting our emissions, because it’s the most meaningful action to slow down the rate of warming and the mounting stress on our power grid and really allow us more time to adapt to our changing climate.”", "authors": ["Rachel Ramirez"], "publish_date": "2022/09/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/29/weather/wildfires-texas-colorado-drought-climate/index.html", "title": "As drought pushes east, more intense wildfires are sparking in new ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nOnly a few months into 2022 and it’s already a dreadful year for wildfires. More than 14,781 separate wildfires have scorched over half a million acres as of this week, according to the National Interagency Fire Center, the largest number of fires year-to-date the agency has recorded in the past decade.\n\nBut many of these recent fires haven’t been igniting in California or the Pacific Northwest – which have endured several devastating fire seasons in a row – they’ve been popping up in places like Colorado and Texas, and have burned hundreds of thousands of acres in the past few weeks alone.\n\nEarlier in March, scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted drought conditions would expand eastward this spring and worsen in some locations – conditions that are now priming the landscape in the Southern Plains for dangerous, fast-moving fires.\n\n“So while the spring outlook for this year from NOAA looks quite similar to last year, there is a key difference about this spring, which is that the drought has expanded eastward, pushing 70% of Texas – which was less impacted over the last two years – into severe drought,” Justin Mankin, assistant professor of geography at Dartmouth College and co-lead of NOAA’s Drought Task Force, told CNN.\n\nTexas has been besieged by wildfires over the past few weeks as severe drought took hold. More than 700 fires scorched around 164,000 acres in the state this month, according to the Texas A&M Forest Service. A new blaze erupted near Fort Hood on Sunday that has since burned more than 33,000 acres, the forest service said.\n\nIn Colorado, around 19,000 residents were allowed to return to their homes Tuesday after a wildfire broke out near the Boulder area. The fire ignited on Saturday afternoon and burned out of control Saturday evening, which prompted the evacuation orders.\n\nAnd nearly 10 million people in the Plains were under red flag warnings on Tuesday as forecasters warned a significant wildfire outbreak was possible, with the most dangerous conditions in the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles and southwest Kansas.\n\nPeople watch as the NCAR Fire near Boulder burns in the foothills south of the National Center for Atmospheric Research on Saturday. Helen H. Richardson/Denver Post/AP\n\nDaniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California at Los Angeles, said the transition period between winter and spring is usually when the Plains states tend to experience their wildfire season. But there have been some unusual trends in recent fire activity there, Swain told CNN.\n\n“Even if there is still a relative lull in the winter, it’s not as deep a lull as used to be,” Swain said, noting that scientists are “seeing periods in the winter which used to have virtually zero fire risk, in some places now having appreciable fire risk, in some cases.”\n\nOn December 30, a violent wildfire tore through the western suburbs of Denver and Boulder during an extreme windstorm. The Marshall Fire burned down more than 1,000 homes in a matter of hours, officials said. NOAA attributed the severity of the fire in part to the extremely dry conditions Colorado experienced in the second half of 2021.\n\nClimate researchers have said two major factors have contributed to the West’s multiyear drought: the lack of precipitation and an increase in evaporative demand, also known as the “thirst of the atmosphere.” Warmer temperatures increase the amount of water the atmosphere can absorb, which then dries out the landscape.\n\nThat’s also true for places like Colorado and interior Texas, away from the Gulf Coast, Swain said. When the atmosphere extracts moisture from the soil without returning that water in the form of precipitation, there’s going to be less water available to those plants.\n\n“And that’s the main climate change connection – the effect that the warming and drying is having on the vegetation aridity itself,” Swain said. “In most cases, the drier vegetation becomes, the more flammable it becomes. In some cases, it’s an exponential relationship where each additional increment of drying makes it increasingly more flammable at an increasing rate.”\n\n“That’s why even a few degrees of warming can make a big difference,” he added.\n\nThe UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reported in August that because of the climate crisis, droughts that may have occurred only once every decade or so now happen 70% more frequently. Since the 1970s, parts of Texas and the West have seen a doubling or tripling of the number of fire weather days, according to an analysis by Climate Central.\n\n“The commonality that we’re seeing across most fire-prone regions on Earth is an increase in the number of extreme fire weather days, and also an increase in the magnitude of the very worst severe fire weather days,” Swain said. “And that is linked to human-caused climate change.”", "authors": ["Rachel Ramirez"], "publish_date": "2022/03/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/23/world/wildfire-increase-climate-change-unep-report/index.html", "title": "Wildfires are getting more extreme and burning more land. The UN ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWildfires have intensified around the globe, providing a stark reminder of how the climate crisis is upending lives and inflicting billions of dollars a year in damage. And it will only get worse, according to dozens of global fire experts.\n\nA report released Wednesday by the UN Environment Programme suggests it’s time we “learn to live with fire” and adapt to the uptick in the frequency and severity of wildfires that will inevitably put more lives and economies in harm’s way.\n\nThe number of extreme wildfire events will increase up to 14% by 2030, according to the report’s analysis. By 2050, the increase will climb to 30%.\n\nEven with the most ambitious efforts to slash heat-trapping emissions, the report shows that those near-term consequences are locked in.\n\nAlthough the situation is dire and that eliminating wildfire risks is impossible, communities can still reduce their risk and exposure, said Andrew Sullivan, principal research officer with Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization and editor of the report.\n\n“Uncontrollable and devastating wildfires are becoming an expected part of the seasonal calendars in many parts of the world,” Sullivan said at a Monday news conference. “Where wildfires have historically occurred, they may increase; however, where wildfires have not historically occurred, they may become more common.”\n\nA large bushfire is seen from Bargo, Australia, southwest of Sydney in December 2019.

UNEP researchers, including over 50 experts from universities, government agencies and international organizations around the world, say the report serves as a “roadmap” for adapting to a burning world.\n\nThe changing pattern of wildfires\n\nFires have always served a vital ecological purpose on Earth, essential for many ecosystems. They restore the soil’s nutrients, helping germinate plants and remove decaying matter. Without fires, overgrown foliage like grasses and shrubs can prime the landscape for worse flare-ups, particularly during extreme drought and heat waves.\n\nBurning parts of the land on purpose has historically prevented larger, more destructive fires. Indigenous people have been applying this preventative method, known as controlled or prescribed burns, for thousands of years.\n\nA firefighter battles flames during the Creek fire in the Cascadel Woods area of unincorporated Madera County, California, in September 2020. Josh Edelson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBut as humans warmed the planet, developed more land and created fire suppression policies while neglecting forest management, wildfires have become more deadly and destructive than ever before.\n\nThese factors, according to the UNEP report, drastically changed the fire regime.\n\nWildfires now burn longer and are becoming hotter in places where they have always occurred; meanwhile, fires are also igniting and spreading in unexpected places, including wetlands, drying peatlands and on thawing permafrost in the Arctic.\n\n“What is eye catching is that there are ecosystems now that start to burn that we did not expect in that intensity,” Tim Christophersen, head of the Nature for Climate Branch at UNEP, told CNN. “For example, there’s a lot more wetlands which, as they’re called, you would think that they don’t catch fire easily. We see more and more fires also in the Arctic Circle, where fires are naturally rare.”\n\nWildfires, which are often ignited by lightning strikes or human activity, are becoming more frequent because of human-caused climate change. Scientists found, for instance, that climate change made the extreme weather conditions that fueled the 2019-2020 destructive fire seasons in Australia 30% more likely to occur.\n\nAdditionally, a recent study found that high-elevation forests in the Rocky Mountains are burning more now than any time in the past 2,000 years. In the last two years, wildfires in the US West were exhibiting extreme fire behavior and wafting smoke across the country while also creating their own weather.\n\nA hazy San Francisco skyline is seen from Dolores Park in September 2020 as more than 300,000 acres burned across the state. Brittany Hosea-Small/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFires are also increasingly harming public health. A recent study found that the annual exposure to wildfire smoke results in more than 30,000 deaths across the 43 countries analyzed in the study. Another study found that increases in fine particulate matter from wildfire smoke in 2020 led to a surge in Covid-19 cases and deaths in California, Oregon and Washington.\n\nWildfires have also become more costly. In the US, the UNEP report noted data from the National Interagency Fire Center that shows that average annual federal firefighting costs have skyrocketed to $1.9 billion as of 2020 – a rise of more than 170% in a decade.\n\nResearchers say governments aren’t learning from the past, and they are perpetuating conditions that are not environmentally and economically beneficial for the future.\n\n“The world needs to change its stance towards wildfires – from reactive to proactive – because wildfires are going to increase in frequency and intensity due to climate change,” Christophersen said. “That means we all have to be better prepared.”\n\nA shift in thinking\n\nThe report predicts that the likelihood of intense events, similar to those seen in Australia’s so-called Black Summer wildfires in 2019 and 2020 or the record-setting Arctic fires in 2020, will increase by up to 57% by the end of the century.\n\nAnd because of the ever-shifting conditions in which wildfires now occur, researchers say authorities and policy-makers need to work in tandem with local communities, bring back Indigenous knowledge and invest money to prevent wildfires from igniting in the first place to reduce the damage and loss that comes after.\n\nA forest fire in central Yakutia, Russia, in June 2020. Yevgeny Sofroneyev/TASS/Getty Images\n\nUNEP researchers suggest that governments adopt a “fire ready formula,” which commits two-thirds of spending to planning, prevention, preparedness and recovery, with only a smaller percentage put toward response to damages and losses.\n\n“This formula needs to be fine-tuned to each regional and national context,” Christophersen said. “But in general, it’s a shift away from investing only in the response and more into prevention, planning and recovery.”\n\nChristophersen added that building stronger regional and international cooperation to help other countries is crucial as well.\n\n“Some countries are more advanced in this than others and they can share their knowledge with other countries,” he said. “At the moment, what keeps me up at night is that there’s no real global response yet, so we need more investments also in that kind of a global platform.”\n\nThe report acknowledges that the UN system itself “lacks robust wildfire expertise dedicated to this challenge,” which they plan to change through a series of initiatives that would help countries.", "authors": ["Rachel Ramirez"], "publish_date": "2022/02/23"}]}

But this spring is different. Not only are the nine judges reshaping contours of social issues that drive the public debate, but they are also working to salvage the institutional legitimacy of their own branch of government.\n\nThe court released one opinion Wednesday – on a case involving a US Border Patrol agent – and has 29 remaining.\n\nIn addition, the justices are dealing with unprecedented turmoil triggered by an internal investigation. Last month, Chief Justice John Roberts ordered the Marshal of the Court to find the person who breached internal protocols and leaked the draft opinion that would reverse Roe v. Wade that had been circulating among chambers.\n\nAs a result, according to CNN’s exclusive reporting, the court has taken steps to require law clerks to provide cell phone records and sign affidavits. The process will distract the court from its duties and sow uncertainty – even paranoia.\n\nThe leak, that Roberts himself called “absolutely appalling,” has rattled the justices’ faith in their ability to deliberate. Justice Clarence Thomas – the conservative leader of the court – told an audience last month that justices are now looking over their shoulders, shaken by the breakdown of their institution. He compared the leak to an “infidelity.”\n\nHere are the highlights of the court’s docket:\n\nAbortion\n\nIt was Thomas, the longest serving justice on the current court, who likely assigned fellow conservative Justice Samuel Alito to write the draft majority opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. The dispute concerns a Mississippi law that bans abortion after 15 weeks. The state is asking the justices to take the giant step of overturning Roe v. Wade, a seminal case decided in 1973 establishing a constitutional right to abortion before fetal viability which most experts say occurs now around 23-24 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nAt oral arguments, Mississippi Solicitor General Scott Stewart told the justices that Roe and a follow up decision from 1992 “haunt” the country.\n\nAt one time Mississippi’s law was dismissed as blatantly unconstitutional, even by a conservative-leaning appellate court. But much has changed since then, including the fact that in December the justices allowed a six-week ban on abortions in Texas to remain in effect. Since then, red states, invigorated by the Supreme Court’s conservative majority, have passed increasingly restrictive laws. Last month, for example, Oklahoma Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt signed a bill into law that bans abortions from the stage of “fertilization” and allows private citizens to sue anyone who helps a woman obtain the procedure.\n\nIn the draft opinion, Alito said that Roe “must be overruled.” If the five-member majority holds, it will wipe away near 50-year-old precedent and change the landscape of women’s reproductive health going forward.\n\nSupporters of abortion rights are clinging to the fact that Alito’s opinion was a draft and hope it only reflects an opening salvo written after the justices casted initial votes at conference.\n\nVotes can change during deliberations. Sometimes majority opinions fizzle into concurrences or even dissents. Other justices could be simultaneously working on separate opinions, hoping to pick off votes from Alito’s draft or to weaken the thrust of his opinion.\n\nSecond Amendment\n\nAs the country grapples with gun violence, the justices will decide how broadly they want to rule in a case that could open up a new chapter in constitutional challenges to gun safety laws.\n\nAfter oral arguments last year, it seemed the conservatives were ready to strike down a New York law – enacted more than a century ago – that places restrictions on carrying a concealed weapon outside the home. Supporters of gun rights have been pushing the court to clarify the scope of the Second Amendment for years. The effort has been led by Thomas who in the past called the Second Amendment a “disfavored right in this court.”\n\nBut the entire landscape of the debate has shifted in recent months. Since the justices began deliberating, mass shootings have occurred across the country including a Texas massacre of 19 school children in Texas. While the shootings did not directly implicate the issue of concealed carry, the country as a whole is now debating gun safety laws.\n\nReligious liberty\n\nOn top of abortion and gun rights, the court is also considering cases that could allow more religion in public life.\n\nIn December, they heard arguments concerning a Maine initiative that excludes some religious schools from a tuition assistance program. The program allows parents living in rural areas with no school district to use vouchers to send their children to public or private schools elsewhere. But it came under challenge when some parents wanted to use the vouchers to send their kids to religious schools.\n\nThe court could insist that if a state provides vouchers for public and private education, it cannot exclude schools that teach the curriculum through the lens of faith.\n\nThe justices are also grappling with the case of Joe Kennedy, a former Washington state high school football coach at a public school who lost his job for praying at the 50-yard line after games.\n\nKennedy told CNN that “every American should be able to have faith in public and not be worried about being fired over it.”\n\n“I think it is important to keep our promises – especially to God,” he said.\n\nBut the school district said it suspended Kennedy to avoid the appearance that the school was endorsing a particular faith, in violation of the Establishment Clause of the Constitution.\n\nThe liberal justices on the court – Justices Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor –made clear at oral arguments that they were worried about players feeling coerced by the school to pray.\n\n“I’m going to just sort of suggest,” Kagan began “the idea of why the school can discipline him is that it puts some kind of undue pressure, a kind of coercion, on students to participate in religious activities when they may not wish to, when their religion is different or when they have no religion,” she said.\n\nImmigration\n\nAs the political branches spar over immigration, the justices are considering several cases concerning border disputes.\n\nIn one case, a group of Republican-led states are seeking to step in and defend a controversial Trump-era immigration policy, a version of which the Biden administration abandoned. The policy – an expansion of the “public charge rule” – has been excised by the Biden administration.\n\nThe case does not center on the legality of the rule, but, instead, whether the Biden administration followed proper procedures when it set out to revoke the rule and dismiss pending legal challenges. The Trump policy made it more difficult for immigrants to obtain legal status if they use certain public benefits such as Medicaid, food stamps and housing vouchers. The justices could reinvigorate legal challenges.\n\nIn a separate dispute, the justices are grappling with whether the Biden administration can terminate a Trump-era border policy known as “Remain in Mexico.” Lower courts have so far blocked Biden from ending the policy.\n\nUnder the unprecedented program launched in 2019, the Department of Homeland Security can send certain-non Mexican citizens who entered the United States back to Mexico – instead of detaining them or releasing them into the United States – while their immigration proceedings played out. Critics call the policy inhumane and say it exposes asylum seekers with credible claims to dangerous and squalid conditions. The case raises questions not only regarding immigration law, but also a president’s control over policy and his diplomatic relationships with neighboring countries.\n\nClimate change\n\nThe justices unexpectedly also agreed to decide a case concerning the EPA’s authority to regulate carbon emissions from existing power plants, in a dispute that could cripple the Biden administration’s attempts to slash emissions. It comes at a moment when scientists are sounding alarms about the accelerating pace of global warming.\n\nThe court’s decision to step in now concerned environmentalists because there is currently no rule in place. A lower court wiped away a Trump era rule in 2021 and the Biden administration’s EPA is currently working on a new rule.\n\nBut the fact that there were enough votes to take up the issue now, struck some as an aggressive grant, signaling the court wants to limit the scope of the EPA’s authority even before a new rule is on the books.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Ariane De Vogue"], "publish_date": "2022/06/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/20/politics/supreme-court-title-42/index.html", "title": "Title 42: Biden administration wants Supreme Court to allow Trump ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe Biden administration told the Supreme Court Tuesday that the justices should reject an emergency bid by a group of GOP-led states to keep the controversial Trump-era border restriction known as Title 42 in effect while legal challenges play out.\n\nBut it also asked for the court to delay the ending of Title 42 until at least December 27, citing ongoing preparations for an influx of migrants and the upcoming holiday weekend.\n\nThe administration said that the states, led by Arizona, do not have the legal right to challenge a federal district court opinion that had vacated the program and ordered its termination by Wednesday.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts temporarily froze that deadline on Monday, and asked the parties involved in the lawsuit, the Justice Department and the American Civil Liberties Union, to weigh in.\n\nUntil the Supreme Court issues an order – which can come at any time, although the court has no deadline – the authority will remain in place.\n\nSince March 2020, Title 42 has allowed US border agents to immediately turn away migrants who have crossed the southern border illegally, all in the name of Covid-19 prevention. There have been nearly 2.5 million expulsions – mostly under the Biden administration, which has been bracing for an influx of arrivals if the authority lifts.\n\nThe last-minute legal wrangling comes as federal officials and border communities have been bracing for an expected increase in migrant arrivals as early as this week as the issue of immigration continues to ignite both sides of the political divide. The Department of Homeland Security has been putting in place a plan for the end of the program that includes surging resources to the border, targeting smugglers and working with international partners.\n\nIn court papers Tuesday, Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar stressed that it would be highly unusual for the court to allow the states to step in at the last minute when they had not been an official party in the dispute at hand.\n\n“The government recognizes that the end of the Title 42 orders will likely lead to disruption and a temporary increase in unlawful border crossings,” Prelogar wrote.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Large group of migrants cross into El Paso 02:46 - Source: CNN\n\n“The government in no way seeks to minimize the seriousness of that problem. But the solution to that immigration problem cannot be to extend indefinitely a public-health measure that all now acknowledge has outlived its public-health justification,” she wrote.\n\nLawyers for the ACLU, who are representing families subject to Title 42, also urged the justices to deny the states’ appeal.\n\n“The record in this case documents the truly extraordinary horrors being visited on noncitizens every day by Title 42 expulsions,” Lee Gelernt, a lawyer for the families, wrote.\n\n“The States’ argument effectively boils down to an assertion that Title 42 – with no hearings and no access to asylum – is a better immigration control system from their perspective than the actual immigration statutes that Congress has enacted,” Gelernt added. “But again, that is a choice for Congress.”\n\nPreparing for end of Trump-era authority\n\nThe White House has been preparing for Title 42 to end, expecting a flow of migrants crossing the US-Mexico border. In the Del Rio sector, for example, officials predicted that the number of migrant encounters could double from 1,700 a day to 3,500 a day when Title 42 ends, straining overwhelmed resources in a remote area of the border.\n\nDespite the freeze from Roberts’ Monday decision, the administration is moving forward with planning, CNN has reported.\n\n“We’re going on as if nothing’s changed,” a senior US Customs and Border Protection official told CNN, adding that policy discussions are still underway to provide other legal pathways to Nicaraguans, Haitians and Cubans who make up a large number of encounters.\n\nA group of migrants are waiting on the US side of the Rio Grande as the Texas National Guard blocked access to parts of the border with barbed wire and vehicles as seen from Ciudad Juarez, Mexico con 20 December 2022. David von Blohn/CNN\n\nA DHS spokesperson told CNN in an email that officials along the southern border have moved over 9,000 migrants out of El Paso over the last week. US Border Patrol has also moved nearly 6,000 other migrants through to other sectors, the spokesperson said, and migrants have been placed in immigration proceedings “in addition to several measures that have been put in place over the last six months as part of the DHS Plan for Southwest Border Security and Preparedness.”\n\nCNN’s Ed Lavandera, reporting from El Paso on Tuesday, described soldiers from the Texas National Guard deploying fence and barbed wire in areas where migrants have been crossing. The city’s Democratic mayor has declared a state of emergency and the city is looking for warehouse space to use as temporary shelter.\n\nJust across the border from El Paso in Ciudad Juarez, CNN’s David Culver has spoken with migrants who spent weeks traveling hundreds of miles, often on foot, and are now confused as they hope for asylum in the US.\n\nAs for what happens on Wednesday if the expiration is still on hold, one official said there may be a “mini surge.”\n\n“I think there’s some that probably haven’t gotten the message and won’t until they cross,” the official said. “There are some already committed who will cross.”\n\nLate Friday night, the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled against the states, holding that they waited an “inordinate” amount of time before trying to get involved in the case. That order triggered the emergency application at the high court, which was addressed to Roberts.\n\nArizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich – who took the lead for the states – said Monday that “getting rid of Title 42 will recklessly and needlessly endanger more Americans and migrants by exacerbating the catastrophe that is occurring at our southern border,” adding: “Unlawful crossings are estimated to surge from 7,000 per day to as many as 18,000.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback A Texas shelter works overtime trying to keep up with the surge in migrants crossing the U.S. border 04:07 - Source: CNN\n\nBrnovich had told the justices in court papers that they should put the lower court ruling on hold. As an alternative, he said that the justices should grant an “immediate” temporary injunction to maintain the status quo and also consider whether to skip over the appeals court and agree to hear arguments on the merits of the issue themselves.\n\n“Failure to grant a stay here will inflict massive irreparable harms on the States, particularly as the States bear many of the consequences of unlawful immigration,” Brnovich argued.\n\nIn the case at hand, six families that unlawfully crossed the US-Mexico border and were subject to the Title 42 process brought the original challenge.\n\nIn court papers, the ACLU previously argued that Covid-19 was always a thinly veiled pretense to increase immigration control. “There is no legal basis to use a purported public health measure to displace the immigration laws long after any public health justification has lapsed.”\n\nMeanwhile, although the Biden administration objects to the states’ attempt to intervene in the ongoing dispute and has said it is prepared to allow the program to end, it is still appealing the district court opinion to preserve the authority of the government to impose public health orders in the future.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Ariane De Vogue"], "publish_date": "2022/12/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/02/politics/roe-v-wade-supreme-court/index.html", "title": "Roe v. Wade: Supreme Court draft opinion that would overturn ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIn a stunning breach of Supreme Court confidentiality and secrecy, Politico has obtained what it calls a draft of a majority opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito that would strike down Roe v. Wade.\n\nThe draft was circulated in early February, according to Politico. The final opinion has not been released and votes and language can change before opinions are formally released. The opinion in this case is not expected to be published until late June.\n\nThe court confirmed the authenticity of the document Tuesday. It also stressed it was not the final decision.\n\nRELATED: Breaking down Samuel Alito’s draft opinion\n\nAccording to the draft, the court would overturn Roe v. Wade’s holding of a federal constitutional right to an abortion. The opinion would be the most consequential abortion decision in decades and transform the landscape of women’s reproductive health in America.\n\nIt appears that five justices would be voting to overturn Roe. Chief Justice John Roberts did not want to completely overturn Roe v. Wade, meaning he would have dissented from part of Alito’s draft opinion, sources tell CNN, likely with the court’s three liberals.\n\nThat would mean that the five conservative justices that would make up the majority overturning Roe are Alito and Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.\n\nRoberts is willing, however, to uphold the Mississippi law that would ban abortion at 15 weeks of pregnancy, CNN has learned. Under current law, government cannot interfere with a women’s choice to terminate a pregnancy before about 23 weeks, when a fetus could live outside the womb.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Roberts said he has ordered an investigation.\n\n“This was a singular and egregious breach of that trust that is an affront to the Court and the community of public servants who work here,” Roberts said. I have directed the Marshal of the Court to launch an investigation into the source of the leak.”\n\n“To the extent this betrayal of the confidences of the Court was intended to undermine the integrity of our operations, it will not succeed,” Roberts said. “The work of the Court will not be affected in any way. We at the Court are blessed to have a workforce – permanent employees and law clerks alike – intensely loyal to the institution and dedicated to the rule of law. Court employees have an exemplary and important tradition of respecting the confidentiality of the judicial process and upholding the trust of the Court.”\n\nAfter the draft was published, a crowd gathered outside the Supreme Court building Monday evening, as people came together to console one another and question what to do next.\n\nAt one point, the crowd began to chant, “Hey, hey, ho, ho, Samuel Alito’s gotta go.” “We will not go back.” “Abortion rights are under attack, what do we do, stand up fight back.” “Pack the courts.”\n\nPolitico’s publishing of the draft is unprecedented by the high court’s standards of secrecy. The inner deliberations among the justices while opinions are being drafted and votes are being settled are among the most closely held details in Washington.\n\n“This news is simply stunning for the Supreme Court as an institution,” said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law. “Not only is the result it portends – the overruling of Roe and Casey – a shockwave to our constitutional politics, but we have never seen a leak remotely like this from inside the Court, where we’re not just hearing what the result is going to be, but we’re seeing the draft majority opinion in advance. It’s hard to believe that the former doesn’t help to explain the latter, but it’s an earthquake in both respects.”\n\nThe case in question is Dobbs v. Jackson. It concerns a challenge to Mississippi’s 15-week ban on abortion and oral arguments were heard on December 1. The release of a final opinion in the case is expected later this Spring or early summer.\n\nIn the draft opinion, Alito writes that Roe “must be overruled.”\n\n“The Constitution makes no reference to abortion and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision,” Alito wrote. He said that Roe was “egregiously wrong from the start” and that its reasoning was “exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences.”\n\nHe added, “It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people’s representatives.”\n\n“That is what the Constitution and the rule of law demand,” he said, according to the draft.\n\nAlready nearly half of the states have or will pass laws that ban abortion, while others have enacted strict measures regulating the procedure.\n\nProcess of voting\n\nOral arguments in the case were held on December 1.\n\nUnder normal procedure, by the end of that week the justices would have met in their private conference to take a preliminary vote on the issue. They would have gone around the table in order of seniority discussing their take on the case. Roberts would have gone first, with Barrett last.\n\nAfter that initial tally, if Roberts was in the majority he would assign the majority opinion. Otherwise the most senior justice would have taken that responsibility. After that, draft opinions would go between chambers. In the past, justices have changed their votes and sometimes a majority opinion ultimately becomes a dissent.\n\nA reversal of Roe would leave abortion policy up to individual states and would likely produce a patchwork system where the procedure would remain largely available in Democratic-led states, while Republican-led states would pass extreme limits or outright bans on it.\n\nThe Dobbs case was perhaps the most anticipated case of the court’s term, and most court observers expected that the conservative majority was likely to scale back or outright overturn Roe’s holding. At oral arguments, Roberts was the only one of the six Republican appointees who signaled interest in exploring a narrower opinion that would have upheld Mississippi’s law but preserved some protections for abortion rights.\n\nBecause it is one of the court’s most high-stakes and contentious decisions, the anticipation was that the opinion would be among the final ones the court released at the end of its term in late June.\n\nRoe is the law of the land until the court formally issues its opinion.\n\n“Let’s be clear: This is a draft opinion. It’s outrageous, it’s unprecedented, but it’s not final. Abortion is your right – and it is STILL LEGAL,” Planned Parenthood said in a tweet following Politico’s reporting.\n\nDecades-long project of conservative legal moment\n\nOverturning Roe would be the culmination of a decades-long project of the conservative legal moment.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, when running for the White House in 2016, promised to appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe “automatically.” His nominee Kavanaugh replaced Justice Anthony Kennedy, who sided with the liberal justices in past abortion rights cases. Barrett replaced the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a Democratic appointee and abortion rights champion who died weeks before the 2020 election.\n\nCelebrated by supporters of abortion right and long reviled by critics, Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973 establishing a constitutional right to abortion before fetal viability, which most experts say occurs now at around 23-24 weeks of pregnancy. The decision was reaffirmed in 1992, in Planned Parenthood v. Casey. A majority of the court in that case replaced Roe’s framework with a new standard to determine the validity of laws restricting abortions. The court said that a regulation cannot place an “undue burden” on the right to abortion, which is defined as a “substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability.”\n\nAccording to a CNN Poll conducted by SSRS in January, most Americans oppose overturning Roe, with a majority saying that if the decision was vacated, they’d want to see their own state move toward more permissive abortion laws.\n\nJust 30% of Americans say they’d like to see the Supreme Court completely overturn its Roe vs. Wade decision, with 69% opposed – a finding that’s largely consistent both with other recent polling and with historical trends.\n\nStare decisis and overturning precedent\n\nIn the opinion, Alito also addresses the fact that Roe has been on the books for some 50 years. Although the court is loath to overturn precedent, Alito says it must do so. He said that the notion of “stare decisis” does not “compel unending adherence to Roe’s abuse of judicial authority.”\n\nHe said that instead of “bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue” Roe and a follow-on decision “have enflamed debate and deepened division.”\n\n“The inescapable conclusion,” Alito wrote, according to the draft, “is that a right to an abortion is not deeply rooted in the Nation’s history and traditions.”\n\nHe also said the decision was on a “collision course” with the Constitution “from the day it was decided.”\n\nAlito also pushed back on the notion that if the court were to overturn Roe it could lead the court to overturn other cases like Obergefell v. Hodges, that upheld the right to same-sex marriage. He said that what “sharply distinguishes” Roe from other cases is that “abortion destroys” potential life.\n\nThe court, Alito added, was not able to end the debate on abortion nearly a half century ago when Roe came down, so it should leave the issue to states.\n\n“This court cannot bring about the permanent resolution of a rancorous national controversy simply by dictating a settlement and telling the people to move on,” he wrote.\n\nIf Roe were overturned or fundamentally weakened, 21 states have laws or constitutional amendments already in place that would make them certain to attempt to ban abortion as quickly as possible, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which favors abortion rights.\n\nAn additional five states are likely to ban abortion as soon as possible without federal protections. As of April 2022, 536 abortion restrictions have been introduced in 42 states.\n\nDemocrats outraged, call to end filibuster\n\nPresident Joe Biden said a woman’s right to have an abortion is “fundamental” in his first statement on the issue Tuesday morning.\n\n“Roe has been the law of the land for almost fifty years, and basic fairness and the stability of our law demand that it not be overturned,” Biden said in a statement.\n\nSeveral Senate Democratic candidates immediately called for the elimination of the filibuster and passing legislation to protect abortion rights.\n\n“Democrats need to act NOW—end the filibuster, codify Roe, and defend reproductive freedom,” tweeted Wisconsin state Treasurer Sarah Godlewski, who’s running for her party’s nomination for Senate.”This fight is too urgent.”\n\n“Control of the Senate has never been more important: it’s time to end the filibuster, pass the Women’s Health Protection Act, and fight like hell to make sure all Ohio families are free to make these critical decisions without interference from politicians in Columbus or Washington,” added Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan, who’s favored to win his Democratic primary on Tuesday.\n\nThe push from the Democratic candidates and others is likely to fail, unless some incumbent senators change their minds. In the 50-50 Senate, Democrats need every vote to eliminate the chamber’s rules requiring 60 votes to advance most legislation. And Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona have repeatedly committed to protecting the filibuster, which sets up a 60-vote threshold that requires bipartisan cooperation to pass most legislation.\n\nIn February, Manchin also joined Senate Republicans in blocking the House-passed Women’s Health Protection Act that aimed to preserve access to abortion.\n\nIn a statement, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said overturning Roe would be “the greatest restriction of rights in the past fifty years – not just on women but on all Americans.”\n\n“Several of these conservative Justices, who are in no way accountable to the American people, have lied to the U.S. Senate, ripped up the Constitution and defiled both precedent and the Supreme Court’s reputation,” the leaders said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Tierney Sneed Ariane De Vogue Joan Biskupic", "Tierney Sneed", "Ariane De Vogue", "Joan Biskupic"], "publish_date": "2022/05/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/26/politics/scotus-unpopular-roe-v-wade/index.html", "title": "A historically unpopular Supreme Court made a historically ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThis week, the US Supreme Court delivered its most controversial decision in at least a decade. The ruling to overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade decision that established a constitutional right to an abortion may have major electoral consequences in this year’s midterm elections.\n\nI covered the political impact in part in a prior column. But the court’s actions in this case may do something more than just affect the elections this year.\n\nThe Supreme Court’s own reputation is at stake, and the decision to get rid of Roe v. Wade and to upset the status quo comes at a very sensitive time for the justices in a different court: the one of public opinion.\n\nAnd that’s where we’ll start our look at the news of the week through numbers.\n\nThe Supreme Court is historically unpopular\n\nThe Supreme Court is not elected by the voters. A lot of people agree, though, that it’s important that the court maintains its legitimacy in the eyes of the public. After all, the court relies on others to enforce its own rulings.\n\nThe high court’s legitimacy in the public’s mind was already at very low levels, and that was before the overturning of Roe – something most Americans didn’t want.\n\nForty-one percent of voters approved of the job the Supreme Court was doing, according to a May Quinnipiac University poll. The majority (52%) disapproved. That was the highest disapproval rating recorded by Quinnipiac since it started asking about the court’s approval back in 2004.\n\nThe court’s standing is a reversal from where things were two years ago when 52% of voters approved and 37% disapproved in Quinnipiac polling.\n\nQuinnipiac isn’t the only pollster to show a major degradation in the court’s standing. The percentage of Americans (25%) who have great or quite a lot of confidence in the court is at the lowest level ever recorded by Gallup since 1973.\n\nThe slide can primarily be attributed to Democrats. Today, 78% of Democrats disapprove of the job the court is doing, according to Quinnipiac. In 2020, just 43% did. Republican disapproval of the court has declined from 38% two years ago to 28% now.\n\nThe reason the public and Democrats have turned against the Supreme Court is pretty clear: It’s been seen as increasingly political and issuing decisions that aren’t popular.\n\nThe aforementioned Quinnipiac poll showed that a mere 34% of voters believed the court is mainly motivated by the law. Most (62%) felt that the Supreme Court is mainly motivated by politics. Four years ago, the split was far more even, with 50% believing the court was mainly motivated by politics and 42% saying it was mainly motivated by the law.\n\nAgain, this trend is driven by Democrats. Eighty-six percent of them told Quinnipiac the court is mainly motivated by politics. That’s up from 60% in 2018. Republicans who said the same had barely changed, from 46% in 2018 to 42% now.\n\nIt would be one thing if the court was seen as activist and making popular rulings. It’s not. Both the Gallup and Quinnipiac polls were taken after word leaked in May that the court was on the precipice of overturning Roe.\n\nAmericans agreed with the 1973 Roe ruling. A May NBC News poll found that 63% of them didn’t want Roe overturned. Indeed, every poll I know of has shown a clear majority of Americans in favor of Roe.\n\nThis has pretty much always been the case, going back to 1973, when 52% favored the decision in a poll by Louis Harris & Associates.\n\nIndeed, I’m not sure I can recall another controversial and consequential Supreme Court decision that was this unpopular.\n\nPolls found a split public when the court mostly upheld the Affordable Care Act in 2012.\n\nA majority of Americans (54%) were in favor of the court stopping the hand recount in Florida that effectively ended the 2000 presidential election between George W. Bush and Al Gore, according to a CBS News poll at the time.\n\nA majority (55%) also approved of the court’s decision to desegregate public schools in 1954’s Brown v. Board of Education.\n\nOne could argue that what the Supreme Court has done in overturning Roe is unprecedented from a public opinion point of view.\n\nWhat effect it will ultimately have, however, is yet to be determined.\n\nRecord midterm turnout looks possible\n\nOne potential impact of the Supreme Court’s latest ruling is that it could make people more likely to turn out to vote – in a cycle that is already seeing really high turnout.\n\nIn other words, we could be looking at a second consecutive midterm with record turnout.\n\nThrough Tuesday, turnout in primaries is up 13% in the states that have voted so far compared with this point in 2018. (This does not include states where statewide turnout by party was unavailable for either 2018 or 2022.)\n\nThe 2018 turnout, itself, was up from both 2014 and 2010. In fact, 2018 had the highest midterm turnout – as a percentage of the voting-eligible population – in more than a century.\n\nThe high primary turnout shouldn’t be surprising given what we saw in Virginia last year or in the polling so far this cycle. The competitive 2021 Virginia gubernatorial election had the highest turnout for an off-year election in the commonwealth since at least the mid-1990s.\n\nFurther, more voters are extremely enthusiastic about voting this year than in either 2010 or 2014, according to CNN/SSRS polling. And that extreme enthusiasm matches how voters felt at this point in 2018.\n\nUnder a slightly different metric, ABC News/Washington Post polling has found more voters saying at this point in the midterm cycle that they’re certain to vote in November than at similar points in the 2010, 2014 or 2018 cycles.\n\nI should point out that under all these turnout metrics, Republicans have been doing better than Democrats. Turnout is up 28% in Republican primaries from 2018, while it is down 2% in Democratic primaries. Republicans are more enthusiastic and certain to turn out than Democrats, according to the polls.\n\nThe fall of Roe could alter that dynamic, at least a little bit. A majority of Democrats (55%) said in a May Kaiser Family Foundation poll that they would be more motivated to turn out in the midterms if Roe were overturned. Only 23% of Republicans said the same.\n\nPut another way, the overturning of Roe means we might not only be looking at record Republican turnout come November. Democrats may end up not being too far behind.\n\nFor your brief encounters: School ends in the nation’s largest city\n\nMany students, from kindergarten to 12th grade, have been on summer break for a while now. That is not the case in New York City, where the final day of school is Monday.\n\nFor most elementary school students, 2015 Gallup polling suggests there will be a bit of sadness. The majority of them feel engaged by school. The opposite is true of high school students, who feel mostly bored.\n\nAn editorial note: This writer always felt ecstatic at the end of school, no matter the grade. He hated school and never, ever, wishes to go back.\n\nLeftover polls\n\nAmerica’s influence: A new Pew Research Center poll finds that 47% of Americans think the country’s influence in the world is waning, while 19% think it is getting stronger. A majority (66%) think China’s influence is getting stronger.\n\nSmartphone attachment: A recent Gallup poll shows that 58% of Americans say they spend too much time on their smartphones, but about 65% say the devices have made their lives at least a little better.\n\nTrump Troubles: Former President Donald Trump had led in every national or early-primary-state poll since February 2016.

An earlier version was published in November.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe future of Title 42, and the situation at the US-Mexico border, remains in limbo for now.\n\nThe Supreme Court said Tuesday that the controversial Trump-era border restriction will remain in effect while legal challenges play out, a move that ensures federal officials will be able to continue to swiftly expel migrants at US borders at least for the next several months.\n\nThe high court stepped in days before Title 42 was set to end earlier this month after an emergency appeal filed by a group of Republican-led states.\n\nThat means the public health restrictions remain in effect – for now – as the court weighs arguments from the states and responses from the Biden administration and the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nHere’s a look at some of the key questions and answers about Title 42’s history, what the court is weighing, what’s happening on the ground and what could happen next.\n\nWhat is Title 42?\n\nIn the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a public health order that officials said aimed to stop the spread of Covid-19. The order allowed authorities to swiftly expel migrants at US land borders. The policy is widely known as Title 42, for the portion of US code that allowed the CDC director to issue it.\n\nMigrants encountered under Title 42 are either expelled to their home countries or into Mexico. Under the policy, authorities have expelled migrants at the US-Mexico border nearly 2.5 million times in less than three years, according to US Customs and Border Protection data.\n\nIn a ruling last month, US District Judge Emmet Sullivan ordered the government to end the “arbitrary and capricious” policy. He granted a request for a five-week reprieve, setting a deadline of December 21.\n\nNow after an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court from 19 GOP-led states, that deadline is on hold pending further legal review.\n\nThe Biden administration is continuing to prepare for the policy’s end, a White House official said earlier this month.\n\n“While this stage of the litigation proceeds, we will continue our preparations to manage the border in a safe, orderly, and humane way when the Title 42 public health order lifts,” the Department of Homeland Security said.\n\nHow could lifting Title 42 change what’s happening at the border?\n\nOfficials predict that lifting Title 42 is likely to spur a significant increase in the number of migrants trying to cross into the US.\n\nLast month the Department of Homeland Security was projecting between 9,000 to 14,000 migrants may attempt to cross the US southern border daily when Title 42 ends, more than double the current number of people crossing, according to a source familiar with the projections.\n\nThere’s no doubt Title 42 has become a policy officials frequently turn to at the border, but it’s not the only way migrants’ cases are handled. A CNN analysis of 10 months of data earlier this year found that the public health restrictions were applied in about 50% of migrant encounters at the southwest border.\n\nImmigrants from Haiti, who crossed through a gap in the US-Mexico border barrier, wait to be processed by the U.S. Border Patrol on May 20, 2022, in Yuma, Arizona. Mario Tama/Getty Images\n\nIf Title 42 is lifted, the way migrants are processed at the border would go back to how it was before 2020. Under that system, migrants are either removed from the country, detained or released into the US while their cases make their way through immigration court.\n\nBut officials have also been weighing the possibility of implementing additional policies. Among them: a proposal that would bar migrants from seeking asylum at the US-Mexico border if they could have received refuge in another country they passed through on their journey, mirroring Trump-era asylum limits.\n\nIs there a connection between Title 42 and what’s been happening in El Paso?\n\nEl Paso Deputy City Manager Mario D’Agostino told reporters two weeks ago that about 2,500 migrants were crossing the border there daily.\n\nAt this point there isn’t any known connection between the rise in crossings there and the looming end of Title 42.\n\nBut El Paso officials say they’re worried what they’re seeing now at the border will only intensify once the policy is lifted.\n\nMigrants warm themselves by a fire next to the US-Mexico border fence on Thursday, December 22, in El Paso, Texas.

Jose Luis Gonzalez/Reuters In pictures: El Paso sees surge in border crossings Prev Next\n\nD’Agostino said already what his city is seeing is different than past surges of migrants across the border\n\nBefore, D’Agostino said, increases in migrant populations crossing the border were gradual and over a series of months. This time, he said, it has been rapid and over a few days.\n\n“Our infrastructure cannot keep up,” he said.\n\nWhy is Title 42 controversial?\n\nThe border restrictions were controversial from the moment the Trump administration announced them. Immigrant rights advocates argued officials were using public health as a pretext to keep as many immigrants out of the country as possible. Public health experts also slammed the policy, saying it wasn’t justified by the circumstances.\n\nIn April, the policy became a political lightning rod and a topic of fierce debate as the Biden administration announced plans to end it. But ultimately, the policy remained in place after a federal judge in Louisiana blocked the administration’s plans to roll it back.\n\nDebate resurged after Sullivan’s November ruling, and again several weeks later as word spread of the increasing number of migrants crossing in El Paso.\n\nMigrants cross the Rio Grande near El Paso, Texas, on Sunday. Officials say the city is bracing for the end of Title 42 next week. Jose Luis Gonzalez/Reuters\n\nThose who support Title 42 point to border arrests as they argue how essential the pandemic policy has been for blocking illegal immigration. Those who oppose the policy argue official statistics about encounters at the border inflate the severity of the situation, because the data include people crossing the border multiple times. They argue Title 42 has actually caused more border crossings.\n\nThe GOP-led states trying to block the lower court from ending the policy argue they’ll suffer “irreparable harm” and be forced to spend more money on law enforcement, education and healthcare if Title 42 is lifted. They told the Supreme Court that a “crisis of unprecedented proportions” would unfold at the border if the court failed to issue a stay while justices considered the case.\n\nThe DC Circuit US Court of Appeals on Friday had denied the states’ request to intervene, ruling that they waited an “inordinate” amount of time before trying to wade into the case. Now the Supreme Court will weigh those states’ claims and responses from the government and the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing migrant families in the case.\n\nWho has been subjected to Title 42?\n\nEarlier this year, Title 42 drew attention when authorities at first were using it to turn away Ukrainians at the border, then largely started granting exceptions that allowed thousands of Ukrainians seeking refuge to cross.\n\nAdvocates argued a racist double standard was at play as many migrants from Central America and Haiti continued to be turned back under the policy. Federal officials denied that accusation and said each exemption is granted on a case-by-case basis.\n\nIn August, CNN’s analysis found that migrants from outside Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador were far less likely to be subjected to Title 42.\n\nBut for some migrants, that’s started to change in recent months. Nearly 6,000 Venezuelan migrants were expelled under Title 42 in October after the Biden administration announced a new policy toward migrants from the South American nation.\n\nAdvocates say for many of those who are expelled, the situation is dire.\n\nSince Biden took office, Human Rights First says it’s identified more than 13,000 incidents of kidnapping, torture, rape or other violent attacks on people blocked or expelled to Mexico under Title 42.\n\nWhere does the Biden administration stand on Title 42?\n\nThe Biden administration has sent mixed messages on Title 42. It has criticized Title 42 and vowed to end its use at the border, but more recently came to rely on the policy.\n\nMany advocates expected President Biden would lift the order as soon as he took office, given his campaign promises to build a more humane immigration system. Instead, his administration extended the policy more than a year into his presidency and defended it for months in court.\n\nIn April 2022, the administration announced plans to end the policy, stating that it was no longer necessary given “current public health conditions and an increased availability of tools to fight Covid-19.”\n\nAfter the federal judge in Louisiana blocked that effort, the Justice Department vowed to appeal.\n\nBut in October, facing mounting political pressure over a marked increase in migrants crossing the border, the administration announced it was expanding the use of Title 42 to expel Venezuelans into Mexico.\n\nNow once again officials say they’re preparing for the policy to end. But they’re also appealing the federal judge’s recent ruling, arguing that public health restrictions limiting migration are legal.\n\nWhatever happens next is sure to face intense political scrutiny.\n\nAlready the increasing number of migrants crossing in El Paso in recent weeks are intensifying debate over the border once again.", "authors": ["Catherine E.

Wearing their judicial robe and exhausted from the final push of work, the justices take their seats and the majority opinion is read by its author.\n\nThe hand-down can take several minutes as the audience of spouses, staff, spectators and journalists digest what’s being read aloud. Often times, the justice who penned the principal dissent, also chooses to address the audience, offering a fiery oral critique of the majority opinion.\n\nNone of that is expected to happen this month.\n\nInstead, the courtroom’s majestic chamber is dark – ostensibly due to lingering Covid concerns. The plaza has been completely walled off by security fences, a move prompted by protests that erupted last month after a draft opinion overturning Roe v. Wade was leaked to the media. Meanwhile, a federal grand jury has returned an indictment charging a California man with attempting to murder Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nNow, armed guards are providing 24-hour protection at the justices’ homes while protestors sometimes gather outside and the President has signed legislation to enhance security protection for the justices and their families.\n\nWith no pomp and circumstance, an official will push a button and opinions changing the contours of some of the most divisive social issues of the day including abortion, gun rights, religious liberty and the environment – will simply be released via the internet.\n\nBy then, with no reason to appear publicly, many of the justices may have already fled Washington.\n\nJustices announced five new opinions Tuesday morning, including a much-anticipated ruling on the separation of church and state. The next opinion day is Thursday, with 13 cases remaining.\n\nHere are the highlights of the court’s docket:\n\nAbortion\n\nIt was Justice Clarence Thomas, the longest serving justice on the current court, who likely assigned fellow conservative Justice Samuel Alito to write the draft majority opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization that could overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\nThe dispute concerns a Mississippi law that bans abortion after 15 weeks. The state is asking the justices to take the giant step of overturning Roe, a seminal case decided in 1973 establishing a constitutional right to abortion before fetal viability which most experts say occurs now around 23-24 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nAt oral arguments, Mississippi Solicitor General Scott Stewart told the justices that Roe and a follow up decision from 1992 “haunt” the country.\n\nAt one time Mississippi’s law was dismissed as blatantly unconstitutional, even by a conservative-leaning appellate court. But much has changed since then, including the fact that in December the justices allowed a six-week ban on abortions in Texas to remain in effect. Since then, red states, invigorated by the Supreme Court’s conservative majority, have passed increasingly restrictive laws. Last month, for example, Oklahoma Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt signed a bill into law that bans abortions from the stage of “fertilization” and allows private citizens to sue anyone who helps a woman obtain the procedure.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Roberts may be working on an alternative opinion, analyst says 02:57 - Source: CNN\n\nIn the draft opinion, Alito said that Roe “must be overruled.” If the five-member majority holds, it will wipe away near 50-year-old precedent and change the landscape of women’s reproductive health going forward.\n\nSupporters of abortion rights are clinging to the fact that Alito’s opinion was a draft and hope it only reflects an opening salvo written after the justices cast initial votes at conference.\n\nVotes can change during deliberations. Sometimes majority opinions fizzle into concurrences or even dissents. Other justices could be simultaneously working on separate opinions, hoping to pick off votes from Alito’s draft or to weaken the thrust of his opinion.\n\nSecond Amendment\n\nAs the country grapples with gun violence, the justices will decide how broadly they want to rule in a case that could open up a new chapter in constitutional challenges to gun safety laws.\n\nAfter oral arguments last year, it seemed the conservatives were ready to strike down a New York law – enacted more than a century ago – that places restrictions on carrying a concealed weapon outside the home. Supporters of gun rights have been pushing the court to clarify the scope of the Second Amendment for years. The effort has been led by Thomas, who in the past called the Second Amendment a “disfavored right in this court.”\n\nBut the entire landscape of the debate has shifted in recent months. Since the justices began deliberating, mass shootings have occurred across the country including a Texas massacre of 19 schoolchildren in Texas. While the shootings did not directly implicate the issue of concealed carry, the country as a whole is now debating gun safety laws.\n\nReligious liberty\n\nOn top of abortion and gun rights, the court is also considering cases that could allow more religion in public life.\n\nTuesday, the court said that Maine cannot exclude religious schools from a tuition assistance program that allows parents to use vouchers to send their children to public or private schools.\n\nThe 6-3 ruling is the latest move by the conservative court to expand religious liberty rights and bring more religion into public life, a trend bolstered by the addition of three of former President Donald Trump’s nominees.\n\nThe justices are also grappling with the case of Joe Kennedy, a former Washington state high school football coach at a public school who lost his job for praying at the 50-yard line after games.\n\nKennedy told CNN that “every American should be able to have faith in public and not be worried about being fired over it.”\n\n“I think it is important to keep our promises – especially to God,” he said.\n\nBut the school district said it suspended Kennedy to avoid the appearance that the school was endorsing a particular faith, in violation of the Establishment Clause of the Constitution.\n\nThe liberal justices on the court – Justices Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor – made clear at oral arguments that they were worried about players feeling coerced by the school to pray.\n\n“I’m going to just sort of suggest,” Kagan said, “the idea of why the school can discipline him is that it puts some kind of undue pressure, a kind of coercion, on students to participate in religious activities when they may not wish to, when their religion is different or when they have no religion.”\n\nImmigration\n\nAs the political branches spar over immigration, the justices are considering several cases concerning border disputes.\n\nIn one key case, the justices are grappling with whether the Biden administration can terminate a Trump-era border policy known as “Remain in Mexico.” Lower courts have so far blocked Biden from ending the policy.\n\nUnder the unprecedented program launched in 2019, the Department of Homeland Security can send certain-non Mexican citizens who entered the United States back to Mexico – instead of detaining them or releasing them into the United States – while their immigration proceedings played out. Critics call the policy inhumane and say it exposes asylum seekers with credible claims to dangerous and squalid conditions. The case raises questions not only regarding immigration law, but also a president’s control over policy and his diplomatic relationships with neighboring countries.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Toobin: SCOTUS says this is history, we're dealing in the present 02:56 - Source: CNN\n\nClimate change\n\nThe justices unexpectedly also agreed to decide a case concerning the EPA’s authority to regulate carbon emissions from existing power plants, in a dispute that could cripple the Biden administration’s attempts to slash emissions. It comes at a moment when scientists are sounding alarms about the accelerating pace of global warming.\n\nThe court’s decision to step in now concerned environmentalists because there is currently no rule in place. A lower court wiped away a Trump era rule in 2021 and the Biden administration’s EPA is currently working on a new rule.\n\nBut the fact that there were enough votes to take up the issue now, struck some as an aggressive grant, signaling the court wants to limit the scope of the EPA’s authority even before a new rule is on the books.", "authors": ["Ariane De Vogue"], "publish_date": "2022/06/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/03/politics/supreme-court-kentucky-abortion/index.html", "title": "Supreme Court allows Kentucky's GOP attorney general to defend ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe Supreme Court on Thursday cleared the way for Kentucky’s Republican attorney general to step in to defend a controversial abortion law, after the Democratic governor declined to continue doing so.\n\nThe law restricts a standard second-trimester abortion method known as “dilation and evacuation” that is used after 15 weeks of pregnancy. It was signed into law in 2018 but has so far been blocked by the courts.\n\nThe Supreme Court’s ruling doesn’t address the constitutionality of the law. Instead, the dispute involved a procedural issue: whether the attorney general could step in to defend the law after other state officials said they would no longer pursue an appeal.\n\nThe court’s 8-1 decision revives the case at hand and will make it easier for states that elect their attorneys general to defend laws when a state official from an opposing party has a different viewpoint.\n\nJustice Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, said that the federal appeals court should not have ruled that the attorney general was unable to intervene to defend the law. He said “a State’s opportunity to defend its laws in federal court should not be lightly cut off.”\n\nThursday’s opinion comes as the justices allowed Texas’ strict six-week abortion ban to remain in effect and as they are considering the future of Roe v. Wade in a case concerning a restrictive abortion law in Mississippi.\n\nThe decision wasn’t a complete surprise because during oral arguments last month in a case that raised some similar legal issues, Justice Stephen Breyer accidentally gave away the result of the Kentucky case even before the opinion had been released.\n\nKentucky is one of several states where attorneys general are elected – giving rise to potential conflicts if the governor of a state is of a different party. Abortion providers expressed concern that it the state’s attorney general in the case at hand prevailed, the legal dispute would continue.\n\nComplicated procedural background\n\nThe Kentucky abortion law was signed in 2018 by Gov. Matt Bevin, a Republican, and immediately challenged by EMW Women’s Surgical Center and two of its doctors. They argued the law imposed an undue burden on the right to pre-viability abortion.\n\nThen-Attorney General Andy Beshear, a Democrat, said his office did not have the authority to defend the law and he agreed to be bound by the decision of the state’s secretary of health.\n\nAfter a five-day bench trial, a district court blocked the law, and the case went to the federal appeals court. At the same time, however, an election occurred and Beshear became governor. In the same election, Republican Daniel Cameron was elected attorney general.\n\nAfter an appeals court affirmed the district court’s decision, the divide between the parties opened: Beshear’s administration said it would not appeal the decision.\n\nThat prompted Cameron to intervene in the case, attempting to revive the dispute, only to lose when the federal appeals court said his request came too late. The lower court emphasized that the office of the attorney general had already agreed to step out of the case, and now it was too late to try to step back in.\n\nCameron appealed to the Supreme Court. Kentucky’s Principal Deputy Solicitor General Matthew Kuhn told the justices that as a matter of Kentucky law, Cameron has the final say on whether to accept a decision that enjoined a state law, and that even under the previous attorney general, the office had preserved the ability of the attorney general to “participate in any appeal.”\n\nHe said Cameron “had the ability to protect Kentucky’s interests when it became unrepresented” and that the decision to defend the law represented a “hand off” from one state official to another.\n\nWriting in dissent on Thursday, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, one of the court’s liberal members, said the appeals court had come to the right conclusion.\n\n“In every case, there must be a point of time when litigation shall be at an end,” she wrote. She said she feared her colleagues’ decision would “open the floodgates for government officials to evade the consequences of litigation decisions made by their predecessors of different political parties undermining finality and upsetting the settled expectations of courts, litigants, and the public alike.”\n\nIn court, Alexa Kolbi-Molinas, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, stressed that the office of attorney general had already spoken on the law during an earlier phase of the proceedings and that Cameron stands in the “shoes of his predecessor.”\n\n“Intervention is not a revolving door,” she said, and added that the lower court did not abuse its discretion by holding that Cameron’s attempt to get into the case came too late.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details Thursday.", "authors": ["Ariane De Vogue"], "publish_date": "2022/03/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/27/politics/supreme-court-title-42/index.html", "title": "Supreme Court says Trump-era border restriction will remain in ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe Supreme Court said Tuesday that the controversial Trump-era border restriction known as Title 42 will remain in effect while legal challenges play out, a move that ensures that federal officials will be able to continue to swiftly expel migrants at US borders at least for the next several months.\n\nThe 5-4 order is a victory for Republican-led states that urged the Supreme Court to step in and block a lower court opinion that ordered the termination of the authority. The Biden administration has said it was prepared for the authority to end and had put in place precautions to guard against confusion at the border and any potential surge of migrants.\n\nIn its order, the court also agreed to take up the states’ appeal this term. The court said it would hear arguments on the case during its argument session that begins in February 2023.\n\nJustices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan said they’d deny the application, but they did not explain their thinking. Conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch also dissented and explained his thinking in an order joined by liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\nGorsuch said he does “not discount the States’ concerns” about border security. But Gorsuch noted that Title 42 was put in place to combat Covid-19, and “the current border crisis is not a Covid crisis.”\n\n“Courts should not be in the business of perpetuating administrative edicts designed for one emergency only because elected officials have failed to address a different emergency,” Gorsuch wrote.\n\nSince March 2020, Title 42 has allowed US border agents to immediately turn away migrants who have crossed the southern border in the name of Covid-19 prevention.\n\nImmigrant advocates and public health experts have long denounced use of the public health authority along the US southern border, arguing it was an inappropriate pretext for barring migrants from entering the United States. In nearly three years, the authority has been used over 2 million times to turn migrants away, according to US Customs and Border Protection.\n\nAt the border, migrants have been waiting in encampments in Mexico for months, anticipating the end of the authority so they can make their claim of asylum in the US. Immigrant advocates have tried to disseminate updates and information to migrants, but desperation has grown, especially as temperatures drop.\n\nEl Paso, Texas, has been at the center of the crisis as thousands of migrants have crossed that region of the border. The city opened government-run shelters at its convention center, hotels and several unused schools to care for migrants, though some have still had to sleep on the streets in cold temperatures.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has been putting in place a plan for the end of the authority that includes surging resources to the border, targeting smugglers and working with international partners.\n\n“We will continue to manage the border, but we do so within the constraints of a decades-old immigration system that everyone agrees is broken. We need Congress to pass the comprehensive immigration reform legislation President Biden proposed the day he took office,” the department said in a statement.\n\nThe White House said it would comply with the order.\n\n“Today’s order gives Republicans in Congress plenty of time to move past political finger-pointing and join their Democratic colleagues in solving the challenge at our border by passing the comprehensive reform measures and delivering the additional funds for border security that President Biden has requested,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.\n\nAsked to respond to the ruling, President Joe Biden told reporters his administration will enforce the Trump-era immigration restriction, even if he thinks it’s past time to revoke it.\n\n“The court is not going to decide until June apparently, and in the meantime we have to enforce it – but I think it’s overdue,” Biden told reporters on the White House South Lawn.\n\nSolicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar acknowledged to the Supreme Court last week that returning to traditional protocols along the border will pose a challenge, but said there’s no longer a basis to keep the Covid-era rules in place.\n\n“The government in no way seeks to minimize the seriousness of that problem. But the solution to that immigration problem cannot be to extend indefinitely a public-health measure that all now acknowledge has outlived its public-health justification,” Prelogar wrote in a filing with the Supreme Court.\n\nLawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union, who are representing families subject to Title 42, had in arguments underscored the dangers faced by asylum seekers subject to the authority and sent back to Mexico.\n\nLee Gelernt, the lead counsel for the plaintiffs in the case, told CNN in a statement that they are “deeply disappointed” by the ruling, but will continue to fight to end the policy.\n\n“We are deeply disappointed for all the desperate asylum seekers who will continue to suffer because of Title 42, but we will continue fighting to eventually end the policy,” Gelernt said.\n\nSteve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law, called the order “procedurally bizarre.”\n\n“This order is procedurally bizarre, in that it agrees to a request to freeze a district court ruling by states that weren’t even parties to that decision solely to decide whether they should have been allowed to intervene and defend that ruling on appeal,” Vladeck said. “Title 42 aside, that has enormous potential consequences for the ability of states going forward to fight to keep the current president from rescinding policies of her predecessors.”\n\nThe GOP-led states had argued that they’d be harmed by the lifting of the authority because of the influx of migrants entering the United States.\n\n“The border crisis that Respondents bizarrely and eagerly seek to cause would also inflict enormous harms to the States,” a filing, submitted last Wednesday, reads.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.", "authors": ["Ariane De Vogue Priscilla Alvarez", "Ariane De Vogue", "Priscilla Alvarez"], "publish_date": "2022/12/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/09/politics/yeshiva-university-supreme-court-sotomayor/index.html", "title": "Yeshiva University doesn't have to recognize LGBTQ student group ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nSupreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor agreed Friday night to temporarily block a lower court order that required Yeshiva University to recognize a “Pride Alliance” LGBTQ student club.\n\nThe order from Sotomayor – who has jurisdiction over the lower court in the case – suggested that the full Supreme Court is still considering the issue and will issue a more permanent order at a later time.\n\nFor now, the university is temporarily shielded from having to recognize the group.\n\nThe case is complicated by threshold issues – such as the fact that New York State appeals courts have yet to rule on the merits of the dispute – which could be slowing down the court’s considerations.\n\nFormer and current students of the university brought the original challenge arguing that the school’s position violated a New York public accommodation law that bars discrimination based on sexual orientation.\n\nThe case is the latest religious liberty controversy to come before the Supreme Court.\n\nLast term, the court’s conservative majority ruled in favor of religious conservatives in two separate disputes and in 2021, the court sided with a Catholic foster care agency that refused to consider same-sex couples as potential foster parents.\n\nJustice Samuel Alito has repeatedly called for greater protections for the free exercise of religion including during a July speech in Rome. “Religious liberty is under attack in many places,” Alito said.\n\nYeshiva lost at the lower court level when a trial judge focused on whether the University qualified as a religious corporation within the meaning of the New York City Human Rights Law, a public accommodation regulation that bars discrimination based on sexual orientation. The law expressly excludes certain religious corporations and Yeshiva argued that it fell under the exception.\n\nThe court noted, however, that according to an amendment to the school’s charter that was adopted in 1967, the university is considered an “educational corporation.”\n\n“Yeshiva’s organizing documents do not expressly indicate that Yeshiva has a religious purpose,” Judge Lynn R. Kotler said in holding that Yeshiva is not exempt from the law.\n\nThe court also rejected the school’s claims that the NYCHRL violates Yeshiva’s First Amendment Rights holding that the public accommodations law is a neutral law with general applicability to all parties.\n\n“It does not target religious practice, its intent is to deter discrimination, only, and it applies equally to all places of public accommodation other than those expressly exempted as distinctly private or a religious corporation organized under the education or religious law,” Kotler wrote.\n\nThe judge said that the challengers sought “equal access” and that the school “need not make a statement endorsing a particular viewpoint.” Kotler also noted that some of Yeshiva’s graduate schools allow LGBTQ groups, undercutting the university’s arguments.\n\nIn court papers filed with the Supreme Court, the school argued that the lower court opinion represents an “unprecedented intrusion into Yeshiva’s church autonomy” and argues that as “a deeply religious Jewish university, Yeshiva cannot comply with that order because doing so would violate its sincere religious beliefs about how to form its undergraduate students in Torah values.”\n\nLawyers for the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, representing Yeshiva, said that the lower court’s order is an “unprecedented” intrusion into the University’s religious beliefs and a clear violation of Yeshiva’s First Amendment rights.\n\nA lawyer for the current and former students behind the challenge, who won in the lower court, argued that it was premature for the Supreme Court to step in because New York appellate courts have yet to rule on the merits and the state law issue has not been fully resolved.\n\n“Not only do Applicants leapfrog the entire state appellate process, but they also press the Court to address both novel and weighty First Amendment questions on a rocket docket without the benefit of full briefing or oral argument,” lawyer Katherine Rosenfeld told the justices in court papers.\n\nRosenfeld said that the lower court ruling “simply requires” the University to grant the “Pride Alliance” access to the same facilities and benefits as its “87 other recognized student groups.”\n\n“This ruling does not touch the University’s well-established right to express to all students its sincerely held beliefs about Torah values and sexual orientation,” Rosenfeld said.\n\nJillian Weinberg, a student at Yeshiva’s Ferkauf Graduate School of Psychology, told CNN in an interview that Ferkauf recognizes LGBTQ groups, even if Yeshiva’s undergraduate school does not.\n\nShe said that Ferkauf’s faculty and students “are concerned about the harm that President Ari Berman’s actions will cause to the mental health and well-being LGBTQIA+ students and faculty.”\n\nThe New York Court of Appeals has agreed to hear an appeal to the ruling this fall but refused to put the trial court’s ruling on hold prompting school officials to petition the high court.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Ariane De Vogue"], "publish_date": "2022/09/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/16/politics/title-42-immigration-biden/index.html", "title": "Title 42: Appeals court rejects bid by GOP-led states to keep Trump ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA federal appeals court on Friday rejected a bid by several Republican-led states to keep the so-called Title 42 rule in force, after a district court struck the controversial Trump-era border policy down.\n\nThe new ruling from the DC Circuit US Court of Appeals sets the stage for the case to go to the Supreme Court. The Biden administration is set to stop enforcing Title 42 – which allows for the expulsion of migrants at the US-Mexico border – on Wednesday.\n\nThe Republican-led states previously indicated that if the appeals court ruled against them, they’d seek the intervention of the Supreme Court.\n\nIn the new order, the DC Circuit denied the states’ request to intervene in the case and dismissed as moot the states’ request that it put the lower court’s ruling on hold.\n\nThe unsigned order was handed down by a circuit panel made up of an Obama appointee, a Trump appointee and a Biden appointee.\n\nThey wrote that the “inordinate and unexplained untimeliness” of the states’ request to get involved in the case “weighs decisively against intervention.”\n\nThe case is a lawsuit the American Civil Liberties Union, representing several migrants brought In January 2021 challenging the program. The appeals court noted on Friday that the Republican-led states had long known that their interest in keeping the policy in force would diverge from the Biden administration’s approach to the case.\n\nThe appeals court wrote that “more than eight months ago, the federal government issued an order terminating the Title 42 policy.”\n\n“Yet these long-known-about differing interests in preserving Title 42—a decision of indisputable consequence—are the only reasons the States now provide for wanting to intervene for the first time on appeal,” the DC Circuit said. “Nowhere in their papers do they explain why they waited eight to fourteen months to move to intervene.”\n\nThe ACLU attorney representing the migrants praised the court’s decision.\n\n“The states are clearly and wrongly trying to use Title 42 to restrict asylum and not for the law’s intended public health purposes,” the attorney, Lee Gelernt, told CNN in an email. “Many of these states were vigorously opposed to past COVID restrictions but suddenly believe there is a need for restrictions when it comes to migrants fleeing danger.”\n\nWhite House spokesperson Abdullah Hasan said after the ruling that the administration has a “robust effort underway” for managing the border following the policy’s expected lifting next week.\n\n“To be clear: the lifting of the Title 42 public health order does not mean the border is open. Anyone who suggests otherwise is doing the work of smugglers spreading misinformation to make a quick buck off of vulnerable migrants,” Hasan said in a statement. “We will continue to fully enforce our immigration laws and work to expand legal pathways for migration while discouraging disorderly and unsafe migration. We have a robust effort underway to manage the border in a safe, orderly, and humane way when Title 42 lifts as required by court order.”\n\nThe White House also urged Republicans in Congress to agree to more border funding and work on comprehensive immigration reform. The Biden administration has asked Congress for more than $3 billion as it prepares for the end of Title 42 to help shore up resources for border management and technology.\n\nThe administration’s handling of Title 42, which the Trump administration put in place during the Covid-19 pandemic, has been the target of litigation from both supporters and opponents of the program.\n\nLast month, US District Judge Emmet Sullivan struck down the program. But Sullivan put his ruling on hold for five weeks so that the Biden administration would have time to prepare for the policy’s wind down. The administration has also appealed the ruling, arguing that the program was lawful, even if federal public health authorities have determined it is no longer necessary.\n\nAs the December 21 deadline for Sullivan’s ruling to go into effect approaches, officials have been preparing for a surge of migrants. More than 1 million migrants have been expelled under the rule, which is a public health authority the Trump administration began using at start of the Covid-19 pandemic to expel migrants before they went through the asylum application process.\n\nRepublican-led states, in their attempts to intervene in the case, allege that allowing the policy to terminate would “cause an enormous disaster at the border.”\n\nThey have argued that the “greatly increased number of migrants that such a termination will occasion will necessarily increase the States’ law enforcement, education, and healthcare costs.”\n\nThe Biden administration opposed the states’ attempt to intervene and their request to keep the policy in place, calling the requests untimely and unjustified.\n\n“The States could have sought to intervene after the CDC acted to terminate the Title 42 orders in April 2022,” the administration wrote.\n\nThe migrants who challenged the program in the case also opposed the states’ request, writing in a court filing that the states were “transparently interested in Title 42 as a restriction on immigration and asylum” rather than as a public health measure.\n\nThe Biden administration tried to wind down the Title 42 program earlier this year, but a coalition of mostly GOP-led states – in a separate case filed in Louisiana – successfully sued to block the Department of Homeland Security from ending enforcement.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated when the Biden administration announced its intention to end Title 42.

An act of love this mom says her daughter has made more times than she can remember since they left their native Nicaragua.\n\n“She would tell me, ‘Mom, don’t cry.’” Yensel Castro says.\n\nCastro wipes away more tears as she recounts the dangerous journey through Mexico with her daughter Camila.\n\n“I witnessed a rape. It hurts my soul,” Castro says, crying. Little Camila looks at her mom with a sense of worry as Castro shares the horrific story.\n\nCastro believes she was likely spared from rape on their journey because she had Camila with her. She says those are the risks women take to flee “dictatorship and much poverty” in her home country, where people have no “freedom of expression.”\n\nThe Castros were among the more than 580,000 migrants who were apprehended at the US southern border by Border Patrol, processed and released by immigration authorities into the United States this fiscal year pending immigration proceedings, according to US Customs and Border Protection data.\n\nIn August alone, immigration agents encountered more than 203,000 individuals at the southern border. Migrants from just three countries – Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba – made up about 56,000 of those encounters, or about 28 percent, federal data shows.\n\nAfter an encounter at the border a migrant could be detained, immediately expelled from the US or released pending immigration proceedings.\n\nAmong the latest arrivals were the roughly 50 asylum hopefuls – mostly Venezuelans – sent from Texas to Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts, last month on flights organized by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis – part of a series of moves by Republican governors to transport migrants to liberal areas to protest what they describe as the failure of the federal government to secure the southern border.\n\nAttorneys for the migrants have filed a class action lawsuit, saying they were misled in agreeing to the flights and had been told that they would arrive to find housing, jobs and help with the immigration process.\n\nIn response to the lawsuit, DeSantis’ office repeated what was previously said: The transportation of migrants from Texas to Martha’s Vineyard “was done on a voluntary basis.”\n\nCBP Commissioner Chris Magnus says the latest wave of migration is mostly driven by people fleeing the “failing communist regimes” in Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba, which is complicating the processing and removal of those individuals once they arrive in the US, as they are generally not subject to Title 42.\n\nTitle 42 is the pandemic public health order that since 2020 has allowed immigration authorities to swiftly expel some migrants to Mexico or their home countries.\n\nRising levels of repression, food shortages and economic stability are motivating Venezuelans and Nicaraguans to flee their homelands said Doris Meissner, who directs US immigration policy work at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute in Washington. “These populations … require different kinds of response,” Meissner told CNN recently. “We have not established an asylum system that is in any way up to the level of the challenge that this change brought about.”\n\n‘I don’t think this is sustainable long term’\n\nEl Paso's US Border Patrol sector erected this open-air triage processing center after immigration agents realized that the spike in migration was not an anomaly. Rosa Flores/CNN\n\nIn Del Rio, Texas, a small border town of about 35,000 residents, border patrol vans and buses constantly drop off migrants who have been processed by immigration agents at the Val Verde Border Humanitarian Coalition – the one migrant respite center in town. So far this year, more than 32,000 migrants have come through the center, a nearly 40% increase over last year’s total, according to Tiffany Burrow, the center’s director of operations.\n\n“It’s just been so consistently growing that we’ve been able to adapt. But I don’t think this is sustainable long term,” Burrow told CNN.\n\nEl Paso, which is about 400 miles northwest of Del Rio, opened its own migrant respite center last month after shelters there reached maximum capacity and people started pitching tents on the street.\n\nThat’s where CNN first met Yensel Castro and her daughter, in the children’s play area of the center.\n\nCastro’s voice broke and her eyes flooded with tears as soon as she started talking about her mother waiting for her in Chicago.\n\n“I miss her so much,” she said between sobs, explaining that she had no money to travel to Chicago, where her mom was waiting for her. She said her mother left Nicaragua for Chicago five months ago and had been working to rent a home for the three of them.\n\nA short drive from the respite center, El Paso’s Border Patrol Sector recently erected an open-air triage-style processing center under a highway overpass to help process migrants faster.\n\nCNN got access to the center, which includes sections for intake, medical care and a waiting area, last month. Buses equipped with processing technology were parked on-site. Migrants don’t stay there very long, a few hours at the most. They are swiftly processed and divided into two groups, those who will be expelled to Mexico under Title 42 and those who are allowed to stay, pending their immigration proceedings.\n\n“It’s like a mobile command center,” Magnus told CNN during an interview on-site. Magnus explained that people are given the opportunity to seek asylum, they are being vetted, and criminal backgrounds are being checked.\n\nFar from the border, other Texas cities are responding to the crisis. San Antonio recently opened a respite center and another one is in the planning stages in Houston. Chicago, New York and Washington, DC have been forced to respond after several Republican governors transported migrants in buses to their cities unannounced.\n\nAmerica’s backlogged immigration system\n\nA child sleeps at the El Paso airport after his family's one month journey from Venezuela. According to the child's father, the family is seeking asylum in the United States. Rosa Flores/CNN\n\nThe recently arrived migrants and asylum seekers are entering a highly complicated and backlogged immigration system. This fiscal year alone, U.S. immigration Courts recorded over 819,000 new immigration cases.\n\nAt the end of August, there were nearly 2 million immigration cases pending in immigration courts. That total includes 743,250 cases in which asylum claims have been made and are still pending, according to an analysis of government data by Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) at Syracuse University. There are hundreds of thousands more asylum cases going through US Citizenship and Immigration Services, the USCIS ombudsman told the National Law Review in July.\n\n“It can take many years for the government to even call them [asylum seekers] for an interview or to go to court,” says Conchita Cruz, the co-executive director of the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project (ASAP), a non-profit organization with more than 400,000 asylum seeker members from 175 countries.\n\nIn late May, the Biden administration launched an effort to speed up some types of asylum claims. The rule authorizes asylum officers – and not just immigration court judges – to consider asylum claims for those who assert a fear of persecution and pass the credible fear screening.\n\nThe effort, which is being implemented in a phased manner, is expected to shorten the process of some asylum applications, from several years on average to several months, according to the DHS.\n\nBut while that program rolls out, frustration over asylum application delays is compounded by another layer of the process. Individuals going through the asylum process have to apply separately for the right to work legally.\n\nCruz says asylum seekers are eligible to apply for a work permit 150 days after they file for asylum and, under the law, the federal government has 30 days to process applications.\n\nAt the end of March about 443,000 work permit cases were pending, according to a USCIS spokesperson.\n\nThat month USCIS established new goals to reduce the agency’s pending caseload, the spokesperson said.\n\nASAP and various other non-profit groups are in an ongoing legal battle with the federal government over work permit delays for asylum seekers. Cruz and her legal team are asking a judge to order USCIS to process its members’ work permit applications in 30 days, as the law requires.\n\n“The government should comply, and process asylum seekers’ work permits as quickly as possible whether they’re forced to by a federal judge and a court order or not,” Cruz said.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, USCIS said the agency does not comment on issues directly related to pending litigation; but the agency acknowledged the “historic volumes of employment authorization requests” and noted its efforts to curb delays.\n\n“USCIS set new agency-wide backlog reduction goals, expanded premium processing to additional form types, and implemented efforts to improve timely access to employment authorization documents. The agency remains committed to upholding America’s promise as a nation of welcome and possibility with fairness, integrity, and respect for all we serve,” a spokesperson told CNN by email.\n\nThe faces of America’s new asylum seekers\n\nCNN has met dozens of migrants and asylum hopefuls in respite centers and shelters along the US southern border in the past few months. It’s at these centers that migrants get the opportunity to charge their cellphones, contact family to let them know they’ve been processed by immigration authorities and released into the United States, and where they take buses and planes to the interior of the country.\n\nIsmael Martinez says he's renting a room in New York for $1,000 per month. Rosa Flores/CNN\n\nIsmael Martinez says he was a professional artist from Venezuela. He was processed by immigration authorities in Texas in April. He has since moved to New York, where he is selling hand-made jewelry on the street. He is renting a room for $1,000 per month. He has started his immigration proceedings and is waiting to file his asylum claim.\n\nFranklin Delgado brought his four children from Venezuela. He plans to enroll them in school. Rosa Flores/CNN\n\nFranklin Delgado and his four children, ages 1 to 12, were processed by immigration authorities in El Paso last month. He says his wife couldn’t make the dangerous journey from Venezuela on foot because she is partially paralyzed. The family slept at the airport while they waited to fly to Atlanta. Delgado plans to start his immigration proceedings and enroll the children in school.\n\nJessy Amaya lived in a homeless shelter in San Antonio for a while until he started working in construction. Courtesy Jessy Amaya\n\nJessy Amaya says he was a paramedic in Venezuela before he migrated to the United States in April. He lived in a homeless shelter in San Antonio for a while until he started working construction. Since then, he has purchased a vehicle to get around and rented a two-bedroom home for $800 per month. He has started his immigration proceedings and is waiting to file his asylum claim.\n\n‘I’m starting from zero and it’s very tough’\n\nYensel Castro fled Nicaragua with her 4-year-old daughter Camila. Castro says she's now \"in a very complicated situation.\" Rosa Flores/CNN\n\nFor Yensel Castro, the migrant who said she witnessed the rape on her journey to the US with her child, reuniting with her mother in Chicago has been a rollercoaster of emotion. She was able to catch a bus, provided by the City of El Paso, the day she spoke with CNN. But the reunion was not what she expected. Castro says she was surprised to learn that her mom was very sick with arthritis and can no longer work.\n\n“I’m in a very complicated situation,” Castro says.\n\nCastro says she was processed by immigration authorities and released into the country last month. But she still has to go through her immigration proceedings, file an asylum application and get a work permit. And she is responsible for taking care of both her ailing parent and Camila.\n\n“I thought it would be easy, that upon arriving I’d be working the next day,” Castro said. “I’m starting from zero and it’s very tough.”\n\nCastro says she’s so desperate for help that when a woman she met at the grocery store offered her a bag of hand-me-down clothes for Camila, she walked for two hours, one hour each way, to get the items.\n\nOnce home, Castro showed her daughter each piece of clothing one by one. She took video of the moment and shared it with CNN.\n\nCamila’s face lit up with excitement when her mom pulled out a long-sleeved shirt with a Christmas tree surrounded by presents and a puppy.\n\n“Do you like it?” Castro asked.\n\n“Yes,” Camila said. “It fits me.”\n\nIn the video, Camila holds up the shirt basking in joy that seemed unimaginable just a few days earlier at the migrant respite center – where her journey in the US began.", "authors": ["Rosa Flores"], "publish_date": "2022/10/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/26/us/asylum-backlog-highest-record/index.html", "title": "The US asylum backlog is nearing 1.6 million, the highest number ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nNearly 1.6 million asylum applications are pending in US immigration courts and at US Citizenship and Immigration Services – the largest number of pending asylum cases on record, according to analysis of federal data by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University.\n\nUS immigration courts have seen an over seven-fold increase in asylum cases from fiscal year 2012, when there were 100,000 cases pending, and the end of fiscal year 2022, when the backlog grew to over 750,000, per the clearinghouse.\n\n“Since then, in just the first two months of [fiscal year] 2023 (October – November 2022), the asylum backlog jumped by over 30,000 new cases and now totals, 787,882,” the clearinghouse stated.\n\nThe asylum seekers are from 219 different countries and speak 418 different languages, according to the Syracuse group. About 3 out of 10 are children under the age of 18 and the leading countries of origin include Guatemala, Venezuelan, Cuba and Brazil, the group said. Florida and Massachusetts are among the states with the biggest asylum case growth.\n\nThe overall average wait time for an asylum hearing is about 4.3 years, but in Omaha, Nebraska – the court with the longest delay – the wait time averages 5.9 years, according to the group.\n\nA growing number of asylum seekers are being electronically monitored through the Department of Homeland Security’s Alternative to Detention program, while a small portion – about 2,000 – are in ICE detention, according to the clearinghouse.\n\nThe analysis comes amid a recent surge in migrants – many from Venezuela and Haiti – at the southern US border.\n\nDespite the continued cold temperatures, border agents in the El Paso area continue to encounter between 1,500 and 1,600 migrants every day, a federal law enforcement source with knowledge of operations on the ground told CNN.\n\nIt’s a drop compared to the numbers seen a few weeks ago, when 2,500 migrants were being encountered each day. Last week, the daily encounters dropped to about 1,500 per day, according to a statement issued by the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nThe city declared a state of emergency earlier this month over thousands of migrants living in unsafe conditions.\n\nMany undocumented migrants – those who don’t have the proper documentation showing they’ve been processed by US border patrol – have been on the streets seeking shelter during the winter storm. The same law enforcement source also warned that human smuggling has also continued in the area.\n\nPeter Jaquez, the Border Patrol Chief in El Paso, tweeted last week that in 48 hours, agents foiled 12 smuggling schemes and apprehended 15 human smugglers and 57 migrants.\n\nEfforts to transport migrants to other sectors for processing are ongoing in the El Paso area, according to the law enforcement source. Last week, about 6,000 migrants were moved out of the El Paso area for processing and another 3,400 migrants were expelled in removal flights, CNN previously reported.", "authors": ["Rosa Flores"], "publish_date": "2022/12/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/15/politics/migrant-buses-desantis-abbott-what-matters/index.html", "title": "The surprising details behind DeSantis' and Abbott's immigration ...", "text": "A version of this story appears in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nCNN —\n\nRepublican governors are in a cynical competition to outdo each other and send migrants from the US border by bus to New York, Washington, DC, Chicago and, now, by plane to Martha’s Vineyard.\n\nTwo unannounced planes carrying an estimated 50 migrants landed in the wealthy seaside enclave of Massachusetts on Wednesday night, surprising locals.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis claimed credit for the stunt, which took the migrants from Texas, not Florida, and left them without planning on the street.\n\nHis stunt may have been outdone by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who started sending buses of migrants to Washington, DC, back in April and on Thursday morning, left asylum-seekers outside Vice President Kamala Harris’ house at the US Naval Observatory. She’s under intense criticism from immigration hawks for saying on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday that she was confident the border is “secure.”\n\nMany rightly pointed out that the political point came at the expense of vulnerable migrants who had already been through a tremendously arduous journey – but some of the details of the transport may surprise you. For starters, many of the migrants were appreciative of the ride.\n\nAre these migrants in the country illegally?\n\nThese stunts by Republican governors are built on the false idea that the migrants are in the country illegally. Technically, those on the buses and planes are asylum-seekers who have been processed by federal immigration authorities and are awaiting court dates.\n\nWhere are the migrants coming from?\n\nWhile most of these migrants crossed the border with Mexico, they are fleeing poor economies and dangerous situations at home in Central America and, increasingly, South America. After crossing the border and claiming asylum, they are released in the US to wait for hearings on their asylum claim.\n\nRELATED: A ‘radical shift’ at the border is making things tougher for Biden\n\nOne person left in Massachusetts, a 45-year-old named Leonel, told The New York Times about his three-month journey from Venezuela through Colombia and Central America. He tried more than once to cross the US border with Mexico before being detained and then released in San Antonio.\n\nIt was there that he was approached and asked if he wanted to go to Massachusetts. It’s not clear if he knew he was headed to a wealthy island community unprepared for the arrivals.\n\nAre they being forced on the buses and planes? No, they are not\n\nAnger at the stunts is in part also fed by the idea that the people are being forced onto buses. That is not true, as CNN’s Gary Tuchman found when he visited a shelter in Eagle Pass, Texas, in August.\n\nHe met asylum-seekers planning to meet up with family and friends already spread around the country. Other migrants coming to the US without somewhere to go were happy for the free trip.\n\nWho is happy for the ride? These people have incredible stories\n\nTuchman talked to a 28-year-old woman named Genesis Figueroa from Venezuela who traveled for a month and a half by foot, bus and boat to get to Eagle Pass with her husband.\n\n“I got very tired. My legs hurt and I got sick,” she told Tuchman in Spanish. “I came down with pneumonia. I was hospitalized for three days in Guatemala.” Watch Tuchman’s report.\n\nHe also talked to cousins traveling from Venezuela; one man’s brother died during the journey after disappearing while they crossed the Rio Grande.\n\nNearly 750 migrants are known to have died at the southern border since October 2021, CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez recently reported.\n\n“We left in search of a dream, but now it’s a very difficult, hard situation,” Luis Pulido told Tuchman in Spanish. He was going to get on a DC-bound bus, hoping to get off in Kentucky to be met by relatives before moving toward Chicago.\n\nWhat happens after the bus ride?\n\nA week after their bus trip, Tuchman found Pulido and his cousin in Chicago, where they had met up with relatives, were sheltered in a small, shared apartment and were looking for work in a restaurant. They likely can’t legally work for at least 180 days, according to rules posted on the US Citizenship and Immigration Services website.\n\nWatch Tuchman’s follow-up.\n\nTuchman told me Pulido and his cousin went to their first appointments, but it was mostly administrative and they are waiting for their next appearance.\n\nIt takes a long time to get a work permit\n\nGetting a work permit can take up to a year, New York City officials told CNN’s Polo Sandoval, who also reported on this issue last month.\n\nHe went to a shelter in Brooklyn and met a young couple from Venezuela, Anabel and Crisman Urbaez, who are seeking asylum.\n\nThey showed him cellphone videos from their two-month, 10-country trek, often on foot, which started in Peru and continued through jungles in Colombia and the Darien Gap linking South and Central America – all with their 6- and 9-year-olds and their dog Max.\n\nHow long does it take to settle an immigration case?\n\nIt takes years. The average time to complete an immigration case is 1,110 days, according to data maintained by Syracuse University. During that time, migrants and asylum-seekers start to build American lives.\n\nHow many will be granted asylum?\n\nLess than half of asylum applications have been granted in recent years, according to Syracuse.\n\nDuring the Trump administration, the rate of denial was over 70%, but during the first year of the Biden administration the grant rate grew to nearly 40%.\n\nWhy are so many coming from Venezuela?\n\nAlvarez wrote recently about the mass exodus from Venezuela. The United Nations says similar numbers of people are fleeing the South American country – which has suffered from years of political repression and economic unrest – as war-torn Ukraine. Around 6.8 million Venezuelans are part of this diaspora.\n\nHow many people have crossed the border this year?\n\nThere have been nearly 2 million border encounters reported by US Customs and Border Protection so far in the fiscal year that ends September 30.\n\nSome of those encounters are repeat crossers. Others have been turned away under a Trump-era Covid-19 policy the Biden administration has tried, so far unsuccessfully, to end. A fraction are seeking asylum.\n\nWhy are officials declaring states of emergency?\n\nOfficials in New York City, Illinois and Washington, DC, have declared emergencies to deal with the buses, and they have complained they have no idea when or where to expect them, and they want warning from Texas, Arizona and now Florida.\n\nTexas has spent more than $12 million and bused around 9,000 migrants up north.\n\nOverall, the buses and now planes have moved thousands of migrants, but it’s a small fraction of the nearly 700,000 pending asylum applications slowly working through the justice system.\n\nThese stories are all unique, but so many of them share the theme of fleeing a home without opportunity and being comparatively happy for the trip inside the US from the border.", "authors": ["Zachary B.

Greg Abbott has been organizing buses to bring migrants to DC in an effort to highlight his criticism of Biden administration’s immigration policies. According to Abbott’s office, more than 5,100 migrants have arrived in Washington from Texas on more than 135 buses.\n\nThe first bus arrived in mid-April, but city officials and non-government organizations working with the migrants – who travel voluntarily – have been increasingly concerned about the pace of arrivals over recent weeks.\n\nThe mayor’s office is requesting to convert the DC Armory, Joint Base Bolling, Fort McNair or another “suitable federal location in the National Capital Region” into a processing center for the migrants. The regional welcome center established to aid the migrants in Montgomery County, Maryland, is at capacity, according to the request.\n\nAbbott’s office says that DC’s request for help proves his point about the need for the White House to better address its immigration policies.\n\n“Washington, DC, finally understands what Texans have been dealing with every single day, as our communities are overrun and overwhelmed by thousands of illegal immigrants thanks to President (Joe) Biden’s open border policies,” Abbott’s press secretary Renae Eze said in a statement to CNN.\n\n“If the mayor wants a solution to this crisis, she should call on President Biden to take immediate action to secure the border – something he has failed to do,” Eze added.\n\nBowser called for a federal solution on Thursday.\n\n“I’ve asked for the deployment of the Guard as long as we need the Guard to deal with the crisis that we expect to escalate,” Bowser said. “The number of people crossing the border seeking asylum we expect to only go up. And we need to make sure that there is a national response, not an ad hoc, city-by-city, state-by-state response.”\n\nBowser also highlighted the differences in the situation in DC over other states. “We need to ask the President for the use of our National Guard, which we know can be very helpful in these logistical matters.”\n\nDr. Christopher Rodriguez, director of DC’s Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency, said in the letter that the situation is “unsustainable.”\n\n“To be clear, I recognize the magnitude of this request,” the letter states.\n\n“DCNG has been there for our local community for prolonged missions in the past, most recently for the COVID-19 pandemic,” Rodriguez added. “This humanitarian crisis is no less important.”\n\nDC has already facilitated the help of the Federal Emergency Management Agency with a $1 million grant, Bowser said at a news conference Thursday.\n\nCNN has reached out to the DC National Guard.

Snowstorm\n\nDays into a deadly winter storm that disrupted travel nationwide, officials in Buffalo, New York, are plowing roads to get to stranded drivers and make way for emergency services. At least 27 people have died as a result of the storm in New York’s Erie County, many of them in Buffalo, which was buried under 43 inches of snow and slammed with severe blizzard conditions. Last week’s winter weather travel mess continues to linger into this week, with more than 3,900 flights within, into or out of the US canceled as of Monday night – a majority of them operated by Southwest Airlines, according to flight tracking website FlightAware. Frustrated travelers complained about long wait times to speak with representatives and problems with lost bags. One passenger told CNN her family was on the phone for 10 hours with Southwest.\n\n2. Ukraine\n\nRepeated attacks by Russia on Ukraine’s power grid have left the capital of Kyiv in the dark, a potentially deadly risk to people who use lifesaving medical devices. Russia’s persistent assault on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure has, at least temporarily, left millions of civilians without electricity, heat, water and other critical services in the freezing winter months. Russian President Vladimir Putin is now calling for negotiations in his war – even as his own foreign minister gave Ukraine an ultimatum over four occupied regions, according to Russian state media. A Ukrainian presidential adviser fired back in a tweet, saying, “Putin needs to come back to reality.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said Russia will try to make the last few days of the year “dark and difficult.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 12-year-old boy needs breathing treatments to survive.

China\n\nChina will drop Covid-19 quarantine requirements for international arrivals beginning on January 8 – a major step toward reopening its borders that have shut off the country from the rest of the world for nearly three years. Inbound travelers will only be required to show a negative Covid test result obtained within 48 hours before departure, China’s National Health Commission announced late Monday. Currently, travelers are subject to five days of hotel quarantine and three days of self-isolation at home. Restrictions on airlines over the number of international flights and passenger capacity will also be removed, according to the announcement. China has sealed its borders since March 2020 to prevent the spread of the virus, keeping itself in global isolation even as the rest of the world reopened and moved on from the pandemic.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Scenes in major Beijing crematorium tell a different story from official Covid death numbers 03:15 - Source: CNN\n\n4. Extreme weather\n\nWeather-related tragedies have not been limited to the US. In northern Japan and in other parts of the country, heavy snow has left at least 17 people dead and more than 90 others injured over the Christmas weekend, authorities said. Japan has seen increasingly adverse weather conditions in recent years, including a heat wave this summer. And in the Philippines, floods triggered by heavy rains killed at least eight people in the southern provinces and forced thousands of residents to evacuate, disrupting Christmas celebrations. Nearly 46,000 people sought shelter in evacuation centers, according to data from the Social Welfare Ministry.\n\n5. Immigration\n\nThere are nearly 1.6 million asylum applications pending in US immigration courts and at US Citizenship and Immigration Services – the largest number of pending cases on record, according to a recent analysis of federal data. Immigration courts have seen a massive increase in asylum cases from fiscal year 2012, when there were 100,000 pending cases. The asylum seekers are from 219 countries and speak 418 different languages, according to the group that conducted the analysis. About three out of 10 are minors and the leading countries of origin include Guatemala, Venezuela, Cuba and Brazil.

An earlier version was published in November.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe future of Title 42, and the situation at the US-Mexico border, remains in limbo for now.\n\nThe Supreme Court said Tuesday that the controversial Trump-era border restriction will remain in effect while legal challenges play out, a move that ensures federal officials will be able to continue to swiftly expel migrants at US borders at least for the next several months.\n\nThe high court stepped in days before Title 42 was set to end earlier this month after an emergency appeal filed by a group of Republican-led states.\n\nThat means the public health restrictions remain in effect – for now – as the court weighs arguments from the states and responses from the Biden administration and the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nHere’s a look at some of the key questions and answers about Title 42’s history, what the court is weighing, what’s happening on the ground and what could happen next.\n\nWhat is Title 42?\n\nIn the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a public health order that officials said aimed to stop the spread of Covid-19. The order allowed authorities to swiftly expel migrants at US land borders. The policy is widely known as Title 42, for the portion of US code that allowed the CDC director to issue it.\n\nMigrants encountered under Title 42 are either expelled to their home countries or into Mexico. Under the policy, authorities have expelled migrants at the US-Mexico border nearly 2.5 million times in less than three years, according to US Customs and Border Protection data.\n\nIn a ruling last month, US District Judge Emmet Sullivan ordered the government to end the “arbitrary and capricious” policy. He granted a request for a five-week reprieve, setting a deadline of December 21.\n\nNow after an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court from 19 GOP-led states, that deadline is on hold pending further legal review.\n\nThe Biden administration is continuing to prepare for the policy’s end, a White House official said earlier this month.\n\n“While this stage of the litigation proceeds, we will continue our preparations to manage the border in a safe, orderly, and humane way when the Title 42 public health order lifts,” the Department of Homeland Security said.\n\nHow could lifting Title 42 change what’s happening at the border?\n\nOfficials predict that lifting Title 42 is likely to spur a significant increase in the number of migrants trying to cross into the US.\n\nLast month the Department of Homeland Security was projecting between 9,000 to 14,000 migrants may attempt to cross the US southern border daily when Title 42 ends, more than double the current number of people crossing, according to a source familiar with the projections.\n\nThere’s no doubt Title 42 has become a policy officials frequently turn to at the border, but it’s not the only way migrants’ cases are handled. A CNN analysis of 10 months of data earlier this year found that the public health restrictions were applied in about 50% of migrant encounters at the southwest border.\n\nImmigrants from Haiti, who crossed through a gap in the US-Mexico border barrier, wait to be processed by the U.S. Border Patrol on May 20, 2022, in Yuma, Arizona. Mario Tama/Getty Images\n\nIf Title 42 is lifted, the way migrants are processed at the border would go back to how it was before 2020. Under that system, migrants are either removed from the country, detained or released into the US while their cases make their way through immigration court.\n\nBut officials have also been weighing the possibility of implementing additional policies. Among them: a proposal that would bar migrants from seeking asylum at the US-Mexico border if they could have received refuge in another country they passed through on their journey, mirroring Trump-era asylum limits.\n\nIs there a connection between Title 42 and what’s been happening in El Paso?\n\nEl Paso Deputy City Manager Mario D’Agostino told reporters two weeks ago that about 2,500 migrants were crossing the border there daily.\n\nAt this point there isn’t any known connection between the rise in crossings there and the looming end of Title 42.\n\nBut El Paso officials say they’re worried what they’re seeing now at the border will only intensify once the policy is lifted.\n\nMigrants warm themselves by a fire next to the US-Mexico border fence on Thursday, December 22, in El Paso, Texas.

Jose Luis Gonzalez/Reuters In pictures: El Paso sees surge in border crossings Prev Next\n\nD’Agostino said already what his city is seeing is different than past surges of migrants across the border\n\nBefore, D’Agostino said, increases in migrant populations crossing the border were gradual and over a series of months. This time, he said, it has been rapid and over a few days.\n\n“Our infrastructure cannot keep up,” he said.\n\nWhy is Title 42 controversial?\n\nThe border restrictions were controversial from the moment the Trump administration announced them. Immigrant rights advocates argued officials were using public health as a pretext to keep as many immigrants out of the country as possible. Public health experts also slammed the policy, saying it wasn’t justified by the circumstances.\n\nIn April, the policy became a political lightning rod and a topic of fierce debate as the Biden administration announced plans to end it. But ultimately, the policy remained in place after a federal judge in Louisiana blocked the administration’s plans to roll it back.\n\nDebate resurged after Sullivan’s November ruling, and again several weeks later as word spread of the increasing number of migrants crossing in El Paso.\n\nMigrants cross the Rio Grande near El Paso, Texas, on Sunday. Officials say the city is bracing for the end of Title 42 next week. Jose Luis Gonzalez/Reuters\n\nThose who support Title 42 point to border arrests as they argue how essential the pandemic policy has been for blocking illegal immigration. Those who oppose the policy argue official statistics about encounters at the border inflate the severity of the situation, because the data include people crossing the border multiple times. They argue Title 42 has actually caused more border crossings.\n\nThe GOP-led states trying to block the lower court from ending the policy argue they’ll suffer “irreparable harm” and be forced to spend more money on law enforcement, education and healthcare if Title 42 is lifted. They told the Supreme Court that a “crisis of unprecedented proportions” would unfold at the border if the court failed to issue a stay while justices considered the case.\n\nThe DC Circuit US Court of Appeals on Friday had denied the states’ request to intervene, ruling that they waited an “inordinate” amount of time before trying to wade into the case. Now the Supreme Court will weigh those states’ claims and responses from the government and the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing migrant families in the case.\n\nWho has been subjected to Title 42?\n\nEarlier this year, Title 42 drew attention when authorities at first were using it to turn away Ukrainians at the border, then largely started granting exceptions that allowed thousands of Ukrainians seeking refuge to cross.\n\nAdvocates argued a racist double standard was at play as many migrants from Central America and Haiti continued to be turned back under the policy. Federal officials denied that accusation and said each exemption is granted on a case-by-case basis.\n\nIn August, CNN’s analysis found that migrants from outside Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador were far less likely to be subjected to Title 42.\n\nBut for some migrants, that’s started to change in recent months. Nearly 6,000 Venezuelan migrants were expelled under Title 42 in October after the Biden administration announced a new policy toward migrants from the South American nation.\n\nAdvocates say for many of those who are expelled, the situation is dire.\n\nSince Biden took office, Human Rights First says it’s identified more than 13,000 incidents of kidnapping, torture, rape or other violent attacks on people blocked or expelled to Mexico under Title 42.\n\nWhere does the Biden administration stand on Title 42?\n\nThe Biden administration has sent mixed messages on Title 42. It has criticized Title 42 and vowed to end its use at the border, but more recently came to rely on the policy.\n\nMany advocates expected President Biden would lift the order as soon as he took office, given his campaign promises to build a more humane immigration system. Instead, his administration extended the policy more than a year into his presidency and defended it for months in court.\n\nIn April 2022, the administration announced plans to end the policy, stating that it was no longer necessary given “current public health conditions and an increased availability of tools to fight Covid-19.”\n\nAfter the federal judge in Louisiana blocked that effort, the Justice Department vowed to appeal.\n\nBut in October, facing mounting political pressure over a marked increase in migrants crossing the border, the administration announced it was expanding the use of Title 42 to expel Venezuelans into Mexico.\n\nNow once again officials say they’re preparing for the policy to end. But they’re also appealing the federal judge’s recent ruling, arguing that public health restrictions limiting migration are legal.\n\nWhatever happens next is sure to face intense political scrutiny.\n\nAlready the increasing number of migrants crossing in El Paso in recent weeks are intensifying debate over the border once again.", "authors": ["Catherine E.

With his immigration status up in the air, he didn't have work authorization.\n\nHe needed to rush to the subway to get to a Western Union store in another borough, but the stitches from his recent appendectomy pulled at his skin, reminding him to walk slower so they don't reopen.\n\nThen he needed to make it back to the shelter in time so he would not miss his next meal.\n\nMost pressing, though: He needed to find a decent pair of pants. Ramos had only a pair of shorts, and winter in New York was coming.\n\nThe next day, 7 miles away in the South Bronx, Ariadna Phillips slammed shut the tailgate of her Kia Sorrento. Soon, she would be helping children find shoes that fit and their parents a place to sleep.\n\nHer car was crammed with boxes of donated clothes, shoes, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, apples and loaves of bread. Her phone was filled with WhatsApp contacts. Every migrant she met, she added to several group chats on the social media site, which fill with new questions each morning about how to survive in a new city.\n\nIn New York, Ramos and Phillips are on opposite ends of an immigration pipeline that began on the border with a bus ride.\n\nFor much of 2022, long-haul bus rides have been orchestrated by Republican governors as a kind of political theater: divert asylums seekers out of their states and into liberal coastal cities.\n\nFor many of the riders, though, that theater becomes a difficult reality: They step onto the buses with the promise of a new life in a new city and step off instantly homeless.\n\nSince June, more than 20,000 asylum-seekers have arrived in New York City on buses from Texas and Arizona. Other buses have ferried migrants to Washington and Chicago.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis joined the fray briefly in September when he authorized flights of asylum-seekers from San Antonio to Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts, sparking widespread outcry.\n\nMore:Migrants were promised jobs, free housing before being taken to Martha's Vineyard\n\nOfficials in Texas and Florida maintain that they transport only migrants who choose to reach those destinations. But after the buses roll away, asylum-seekers are left to navigate a foreign city without speaking the language, find a place to live with no relatives or sponsors to help them, and feed themselves with no work lined up.\n\nThe result, in New York, means that thousands of those migrants end up in the city's homeless shelter system, already strained near capacity with thousands of New Yorkers who had lost jobs and homes during the coronavirus pandemic and a decades-old housing crisis, advocates said.\n\nAs of Oct. 24, more than 63,000 people crowded the city's homeless shelter system – a historic high. Last month, Mayor Eric Adams declared a state of emergency and directed workers to erect large temporary tents to handle the overflow.\n\nMurad Awawdeh, head of the New York Immigration Coalition, said it’s the largest influx of migrants to the city he has seen in his two decades working with asylum-seekers.\n\n“We quickly realized folks were showing up hungry, with nothing and in need of actual support,” he said.\n\nFor volunteers like Phillips, assisting this new crush of homeless New Yorkers has become a second full-time job. Delivering food and supplies to spots across town fills her weeknights; each morning her phone is full of new requests.\n\nFor Ramos, a Venezuelan asylum-seeker, the bus ride to the East Coast has not led to the American dream he envisioned.\n\nIn the four months since arriving in New York City, he has been shuttled between three homeless shelters, fought off hunger and homelessness and struggled to earn a few dollars doing odd jobs.\n\n“I thought life here would be different, would be better,” Ramos said. “My dream has come true – the American dream – but lately it’s been more of a terror.”\n\nMore:Free bus rides for migrants to Washington, New York and Chicago begin in Texas border town\n\nPolitical theater vs. daily survival\n\nThe busing of migrants promises to be on the minds of voters as they head to the polls during midterm elections next week. In a national survey by the Pew Research Center in August, 48% of registered voters said immigration was a “very important” issue in the upcoming midterms, beating out climate change (40%) and the coronavirus outbreak (28%) as key topics.\n\nFor thousands of migrants in newfound homelessness on the East Coast, the situation is less about politics and more about survival. Many migrants have struggled inside the New York shelter system, especially after what is often a traumatic journey of leaving their country and traveling to the U.S.-Mexico border, advocates said. In September, a migrant mom died of suicide at a city shelter.\n\nRamos has acquired tricks to navigate the city day to day. He uses the free Wi-Fi hot spot at the subway station on 57th Street to send messages via WhatsApp on his smartphone to his mom and sister in Venezuela. He has learned to navigate the city’s subway lines and stops through the smartphone’s map app. If he has a few bucks for a subway pass, he’ll buy one. If he doesn’t – which is often – he patiently waits for a passenger to exit through the steel gate and slips past the turnstile.\n\nRamos is staying at the Park Savoy Hotel on West 58th Street, a nine-story hotel converted into a city homeless shelter, a block from Central Park and just around the corner from One57, the 75-story tower where in 2014 Dell Technologies founder Michael Dell set a Manhattan record by purchasing a $100 million condo.\n\nOn the cold Wednesday morning, Ramos needed to get to Brooklyn. He had been to a Western Union there earlier to send some of the little money he had made – $50 – to his sister in Venezuela. But the money hadn't arrived. Now he needed to get to an office to persuade an agent to resend it.\n\nHe pulled up the train directions on his phone – take the C train 16 stops to the Franklin Avenue station – and checked his watch. He needed to be back at the shelter by noon for his free lunch. Probably a flimsy ham and cheese sandwich, but it would be the only food he’d have until evening.\n\n“I’ve missed so many meals,” Ramos said, striding toward the subway station. “I can't do it again.”\n\nMore:Border shelters warn migrants about human trafficking\n\nBringing relief to migrants\n\nAriadna Phillips drove from her job at a Bronx middle school, where she teaches English as a new language and computer science, and went directly to La Morada Mexican restaurant on Willis Avenue in the South Bronx. There, she wolfed down a dinner of sopa de nopales (cactus soup) with rice and tortillas, then loaded boxes of donated clothes, shoes, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, apples and loaves of bread into her Sorrento.\n\nA family of recently arrived Venezuelans wandered into the restaurant and picked through the boxes stacked by the front entrance, looking for shoes for their 9-year-old daughter. Phillips bent down on one knee and helped the girl pull on a pair of pink high-tops.\n\n“Ok, in the United States, your shoe size is 4½,” she told her. The girl smiled shyly.\n\nFor years, La Morada has been the epicenter of migrant advocacy in the Bronx (red letters painted on the front door declare “REFUGEES WELCOME”), and boxes of donated goods crowd the front entrance. Since asylum-seekers from Texas and Arizona began arriving in the city, the eatery, run by activist and organizer Yajaira Saavedra, has been at the forefront of helping them get enough clothes and food. Saavedra and Phillips, head of the South Bronx Mutual Aid, have led that effort.\n\nEach day, after working eight hours as a public school teacher, Phillips, 41, begins her second job as a volunteer in the middle of New York City’s migrant crisis. She checks one of several WhatsApp chats on her phone for updates from migrants around the city, then loads up goods at La Morada and visits shelters where the migrants are staying, alerting them via WhatsApp of their arrival time.\n\nAfter loading her car, Phillips decided which of the shelters she and other volunteers will visit first. On some nights, her WhatsApp channels chime repeatedly with news of migrants fleeing a shelter, and she and others scramble to find them housing.\n\n“They’ve been assaulted, they’ve been robbed, they’ve been kicked out of the shelter at all hours of the night or refused a bed,” Phillips said. “We do rapid response to intercept those people, especially if they’re facing a life threat at the particular shelter they’re at.”\n\nThe convoy pulled away from La Morada. Phillips checked her phone. 6:12 p.m. It was going to be a long night.\n\nVolunteer groups play key role in migrant crisis\n\nNew York City has welcomed migrants for centuries, including unexpected, large influxes, such as in 2014-2015, when more than 15,000 unaccompanied migrant minors arrived in the city, said Awawdeh, the coalition director.\n\nTwo key differences are that the federal government closely coordinated that influx, and nearly all those young people had someone waiting for them in the city – an uncle, grandparent or cousin – and willing to take them in, he said. Today’s migrants often arrive with no sponsors or community connections, Awawdeh said. Like Ramos, they end up in the shelters.\n\nAs asylum-seekers continue pouring into New York, straining the city’s ability to deal with them, volunteer groups such as Phillips’ have been vital in ensuring migrants find a place to sleep, something to eat and have other basic needs met, he said. Other groups, such as Artists-Athletes-Activists, have also helped.\n\n“They’ve been doing a lot of amazing work,” Awawdeh said. “They’ve been stepping up, providing people with food, clothes, providing them with shelter or connecting with them alternative housing.”\n\nIf a migrant gets kicked out of or feels threatened and leaves a city shelter, organizers scramble to find the person a “sanctuary space” – often a room in a church, a cot in the backroom of a business or someone’s living room couch.\n\nThe federal government's lack of involvement in the crisis has been keenly felt, said Shahana Hanif, a New York City Council member who chairs the Immigration Committee. Unlike past migrant influxes, today's crush has been handled mostly by the city, she said.\n\n“We need city, state and federal to be coordinating,” Hanif said. “The city alone cannot shoulder this moment.”\n\nMore:Cubans, Haitians are fleeing to US in historic numbers. These crises are fueling migration\n\nA family murder and fleeing Venezuela\n\nAfter exiting the Franklin Avenue station in Brooklyn, Ramos walked six blocks to the Western Union check cashing store on Bedford Avenue.\n\nRecently arrived migrants, most of them from Venezuela, wandered in and out of the small store, sending chunks of small paychecks back to relatives in Latin America. The store was just down the street from a men’s shelter populated by migrants.\n\nOrlando Sanchez, 32, was sending $90 to his wife and daughters in Venezuela. Ten days earlier, he had accepted a bus ride from the Texas-Mexico border to New York, not knowing at the time exactly where the bus was headed, he said. After arriving in New York, he found a job with a painting crew that pays him even though he lacks work authorization. He was saving most of his money to buy professional shears and resume his job as a barber.\n\n“You need to have faith in God,” Sanchez said. “He’ll show you the way.”\n\nAfter some hand gestures and pointing at receipts, Ramos was able to explain to the woman at the counter that the money he had sent to his sister last week wasn’t received because her name had been misspelled. The woman corrected the name and resent the $50.\n\nRamos remembered when he was recently arrived like the other migrants in the shop, when steady jobs and opportunity still felt within reach. The journey to the U.S. was so long and arduous that it has taken on the hazy contours of a bad dream.\n\nRamos is from Maracay, Venezuela. His father was a high-voltage worker for the country’s electrical corporation, known as Corpoelec. He would work with his father on job sites or take on shifts at the local McDonald’s. Ramos’s passion was baseball, and he played third base and outfield for an amateur baseball team. His dream was to follow in the footsteps of his older cousin, Johan, who was courted by the Cincinnati Reds. But a motorcycle accident when he was 22 permanently damaged Ramos's foot and ended his playing career.\n\nRamos was content to keep working with this dad and provide for his family. Then, one day that same year, thieves mugged and killed his father in his car as he drove home from work.\n\nAs the economy spiraled and the streets became ever more dangerous, Venezuela seemed like a dead end. Six years ago, he and his brother, Fernando Ramos, 27, decided the only way to support their families was to go abroad. First they lived in Colombia, earning meager livings as carpenters, but when the economy there also foundered, they decided to give the United States a shot. Friends had told them of plentiful job opportunities and how President Joe Biden was friendlier to immigrants than his predecessor, Ramos said. They decided to go to New York – a city they had seen and admired in the Spider-Man movies, he said. Earlier this year, they set out to the U.S.\n\nRamos and his brother crossed the jungles of Colombia and Panama, spending six days stepping over bodies and sleeping in the bush in the Darién Gap, a notorious jungle trail connecting the two countries. He witnessed women sexually assaulted by criminal gangs, and those who resisted were shot, Ramos said.\n\n\"It was horrible,\" he said. \"Like a nightmare.\"\n\nOut of the jungle and out of money, Ramos and his brother panhandled on the streets across Mexico, landing in and out of Mexican detention facilities, until finally reaching the U.S.-Mexico border in July. Everything was left in the jungle – clothes, toiletries – to be able to move quicker through it, he said.\n\nThey crossed the Rio Grande into Del Rio, Texas, on July 13, penniless but hopeful.\n\n“It took us 27 days to get here to the United States,” Ramos said. “We got here skinny, dehydrated. But we made it – that was the important thing.”\n\nRamos and his brother were picked up and processed by U.S. Border Patrol. They were questioned by agents and released into the U.S. pending an immigration court hearing that could grant them asylum status and a work permit.\n\nWhen officials offered them free bus rides to Washington, D.C., they accepted, he said. Washington, they reasoned, was much closer to New York than South Texas.\n\nWord had spread among migrants that Texas Gov. Greg Abbott was shuttling migrants away from the border as a political statement. The brothers took the bus rides anyway.\n\n“At first, I was hesitant, I felt almost scared,” Ramos said. “I didn’t know where to go exactly. But we had lost any fear years ago when we left our country. … We decided to get on that bus and put ourselves in the hands of God.”\n\n'We're your neighbors'\n\nPhillips and the other volunteers pulled up at the homeless shelter – a hotel turned city shelter – on West 46th Street, a block east of Times Square, at around 6:40 p.m. Migrants streamed out of the hotel and began picking through sweaters, fleece blankets and snacks inside the boxes. Just down the street, jumbotron screens flashed ads for Sephora and Coca-Cola and the Lion King musical. Tourists swerved around the huddle of migrants massed on the sidewalk, filling outstretched shirts with peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and apples.\n\n“Hi, I’m Ariadna,” Phillips told them in Spanish, as she ushered more migrants to the back of a pickup truck holding clothes and loaves of bread. “We’re your neighbors.”\n\nOne woman needed antibiotics for an upper respiratory infection. Another said she didn’t feel safe at the shelter. Phillips jotted down their phone numbers and entered them into her WhatsApp chat. Anything you need, you let us know there, she instructed. The women nodded.\n\n“People said in New York there was all this opportunity,” said Angelica Barrades, an asylum-seeker from Caracas, Venezuela, staying at the shelter with her two daughters, ages 8 and 10. “But it’s been difficult. Very difficult.”\n\nBorn to a U.S. military father and a mother of Mexican indigenous roots, Phillips settled in the Bronx after earning graduate degrees from Fordham University and Queens College and spent much of her adult life advocating for migrants and underserved communities.\n\nDuring the coronavirus pandemic, as New York emerged as its U.S. epicenter, Phillips and her sister delivered food and supplies to first responders in the COVID-19 wards of hospitals.\n\nAround that time, after a video conference call with organizers and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who encouraged the group to create “mutual aid” groups to help neighborhoods through the troubled times, Phillips launched the South Bronx Mutual Aid, a collective of organizers and migrants helping one another. The group is one of dozens that are part of a larger collective focused on serving vulnerable populations, she said.\n\n“The right thing to do is step in and help your neighbor,” Phillips said. “If we all did that, we’d be a lot better off.”\n\nWhen migrant buses began arriving in New York in early August, Phillips, who speaks fluent Spanish, found her days consumed by helping asylum-seekers wandering New York’s boroughs or struggling in the shelter system, she said.\n\nThe WhatsApp chats she began in August today has more than 270 participants that include organizers and migrants, all sharing information and responding to requests. By noon each day, dozens of messages pile up in the chat, ranging from someone asking for HIV medication to migrants in need of a ride to their immigration hearing.\n\nPhillips and others in the collective don’t just bring relief to migrants. They also push the city to focus on bringing permanent solutions to the homeless problem rather than erecting more temporary housing, she said. When Mayor Adams ordered temporary tents erected at Orchard Beach in the Bronx last month, Phillips videotaped the area around the tents flooding during rainstorms and posted the videos on several social media sites.\n\nDays later, the Adams administration announced it was moving the temporary tents to Randall’s Island in Manhattan.\n\n“It’s not enough to just be the Band-Aid. That’s what charity is,” Phillips said. “We’re asking, ‘Why is this this way?’ and ‘Why can’t it be another way?’”\n\nAnother way of provoking change is to teach the asylum-seekers their rights as immigrants in the U.S. and encourage them to organize and advocate for themselves, Phillips said. Migrants help monitor the WhatsApp channels for signs of duress, volunteer at La Morada or even speak at area schools, giving students a firsthand account of their journey to the U.S.\n\n“Mutual aid is not charity,” Philips said. “We all take care of each other.”\n\nDaily hunger and an emergency operation\n\nA church group took in Ramos and his brother in Washington and the pair spent two days there before travel arrangements were made to take them to New York. He remembered marveling at the gleaming buildings of Manhattan, as the bus drove over a bridge and dropped them off at the edge of the city. From there, they walked for over an hour until they reached the main intake shelter at 400 East 30th Street.\n\nThe next day, they were transferred to the Atlantic Armory Shelter on Bedford Avenue in Brooklyn – a 19th-century former military outpost designed to look like a castle. Migrants call it “El Castillo.”\n\nRamos found a few odd jobs helping someone move or on a demolition crew, earning $150 one day, $300 another. Most of it went back to family in Venezuela. But he couldn’t find steady work.\n\nLast month, Ramos was transferred to a homeless shelter in the Bronx. Here, he said, staff members were rude and few, if any, spoke Spanish. He said the cafeteria worker would pile extra food on the plates of others at the shelter but he and other Venezuelans got smaller portions and only one carton of milk, instead of three. He felt as if he never had enough to eat.\n\nIn the third-floor dormitory – a large open hall crammed with 50 beds, side by side – Ramos witnessed residents smoking dope or downing pints of booze, he said.\n\nA spokesman with the New York City Department of Social Services, which runs the shelters, said the agency has \"channels/avenues\" for clients to report any misconduct at their facilities and officials investigate each report thoroughly. All their sites have round-the-clock security, seven days a week.\n\n\"We do not tolerate any misconduct against or among clients,\" the spokesman said in a statement. \"A secure and safe environment is critical to the success of any DSS-DHS program facility.\"\n\nA resident at the shelter gave Ramos Phillips’ name and phone number and soon he was on one of her WhatsApp group. Phillips gave Ramos the number to a free mental health hotline and he spent 2½ hours on a text chat with a counselor, recounting all the recent struggles in his life – from the jungles of Panama to the streets of the Bronx. Phillips also brought him a quart of chicken soup from La Morada, which he eagerly devoured.\n\n“If it weren’t for her, I would’ve starved to death in that shelter,” he said.\n\nOne day in mid-October, Ramos ate the shelter’s undercooked lasagna and soon started feeling violently ill. Cold shivers ran through him and he vomited blood. An ambulance rushed him to a Mount Sinai hospital in Queens, where doctors did an emergency appendectomy.\n\nTwo days later, after repeated emails on his behalf from Phillips, Ramos was awoken late one night and reunited with his brother at the midtown shelter at the Park Savoy Hotel. His room at the Park Savoy is small and bare, with a single twin bed, a small steel locker and a window. But it’s his alone, along with his own bathroom. His brother’s room is across the hall. When he got to his new room, he collapsed to the floor and cried.\n\n“It felt like I had been released from prison,” he said, referring to the Bronx shelter.\n\nThat night, for the first time in months, Ramos slept soundlessly through the night.\n\n'You're going to give us a lot more voters'\n\nRamos said his life has markedly improved since being transferred to the Park Savoy shelter. His meals are good portions and the staff is friendlier. The wounds from his appendectomy have healed enough that he’s walking the streets and reaching out to contacts, looking for work.\n\nThough life is still tougher than he anticipated, he said he relishes in the excitement and perks of living in New York City, such as walking down Broadway and soaking in the bustle of the city, or the kindness of New Yorkers who stop to help if he gets turned around at a subway stop.\n\n“My first challenge is to get better, to help my mother … and to find opportunities we never had in our country,” Ramos said. “And to keep going forward with God’s help.”\n\nLike other migrants assisted by the South Bronx Mutual Aid, Ramos has also pledged to help wherever needed. On the night Phillips drove from one shelter to the next around Manhattan, Ramos joined her to help hand out donated goods or answer migrants’ questions.\n\nAt around 8 p.m., he and Phillips drove to the intake shelter on East 30th Street – where Ramos spent his first night in New York City three months earlier. Asylum-seekers squatted on the curb outside the shelter and peered into their smartphones. Other, U.S.-born shelter residents mingled nearby. The smell of weed wafted through the night air.\n\nRamos pulled his hoody over his cap against the night chill and handed out apples and loaves of bread, as Phillips chatted with migrants. One young couple from Venezuela had arrived to New York just hours earlier. They wanted to stay together but were told the 30th Street was only for men.\n\nPhillips got their personal information and, using her smartphone, registered them in the city system as a couple, then walked them into the shelter to make sure they got in. She added them to her WhatsApp chats. Ramos took questions from another couple and pointed them to Phillips.\n\nAfter more than an hour, Phillips and Ramos packed away what was left of the donated goods and readied to leave. The night had been a good one.\n\nAsylum-seekers like Ramos are special because, having gone through the system, they know the pitfalls and could help other migrants, Phillips said. She plans to continue training them to self-organize and advocate for themselves, she said.\n\nThe more asylum-seekers southern states send them, the brighter the spotlight grows on New York's strained housing situation and the migrants' plight, Phillips said. That attention could lead to more volunteers and, ultimately, more people calling for change at the voting booth.\n\n“What you’re doing is you’re just growing mutual aids,” Phillips said. “You’re going to grow the outrage around lack of social services and, eventually, you’re going to give us a lot more voters.”\n\nFollow Jervis on Twitter: @MrRJervis.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/border-issues/2019/11/19/growing-numbers-migrant-families-come-india-other-continents/4073883002/", "title": "Growing numbers of migrant families come from India, other continents", "text": "One Russian-speaking family arrived at a migrant shelter in Phoenix carrying Louis Vuitton luggage. They had toted the designer bags across the U.S.-Mexico border after traveling halfway around the globe to ask for asylum in the United States\n\nAnother large migrant family from India asked if there was a vegetarian restaurant nearby after being dropped off by federal immigration authorities at the same shelter. They then ordered 15 meatless burgers and sodas to go.\n\nOne Russian-speaking family persuaded a volunteer to sell them their van so they could drive themselves across the country to Philadelphia rather than take a Greyhound bus.\n\nStill another Russian-speaking family carried enough U.S. cash to buy four plane tickets totaling $1,300 to fly to the East Coast.\n\nThese are examples of some of the non-Spanish speaking migrant families federal immigration authorities have been dropping off lately at local churches after the families arrived at the southern border without documents and asked for asylum to remain in the U.S.\n\nSome of the non-Spanish speaking arrivals have raised eyebrows among local pastors whose churches have been assisting migrant families released by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nNot only are the non-Spanish speaking families from countries far from the United States, they carry their own cash and credit cards and appear much better educated than the mostly poor Central American families that federal immigration authorities had been dropping off earlier this year.\n\nThe sudden arrival of affluent migrant families from outside Latin America even prompted one local pastor to close the church's doors to any more families.\n\n\"There are different people coming and the main reason we stopped is because they don't seem to need our help,\" said Angel Campos, head pastor at Iglesia Monte Vista, a Hispanic church on the east side of Phoenix.\n\nThe church had provided assistance to more than 5,000 people until it stopped, Campos estimated.\n\nPreviously, most came from Central America, principally Guatemala but also El Salvador and Honduras, three countries known as the Northern Triangle, plagued by high rates of poverty, corruption and violence.\n\nThe Central American families were content to sleep on floors waiting for relatives already in the U.S. to scrape together enough money to buy them bus tickets or plane fares. Many had little more than a sixth grade education, Campos said.\n\nBecause they often carried little or no money of their own, the Spanish-speaking families often relied on volunteers at the churches to provide them with food, used clothing and basic necessities like toothbrushes and diapers, he said.\n\nIn contrast, the non-Spanish-speaking families coming from India, the former Soviet Union and other countries typically hop on planes within a few hours of being dropped off at the shelters by ICE authorities.\n\n\"We love the immigrants. I don’t care if they are from Central America or from China,\" Campos said.\n\n\"But the point is we don’t see the need for us to (remain) open. ... Some people were even trying to buy a car, or they can take an Uber to whatever place they want,\" Campos said. \"... So that made us see that our participation in helping the people was not so necessary because It was not a crisis anymore.\"\n\nLocal pastors from Hispanic churches who have been helping migrant families since October 2018 say ICE continues to drop off families.\n\nBut the numbers have slowed to a trickle after President Donald Trump's administration effectively shut down the wave of families migrating to the U.S. from Central America.\n\nThe relatively few families ICE is releasing are from regions in Mexico plagued by drug cartel violence, or from countries in other parts of Latin America struggling with political and economic turmoil, notably Brazil, Cuba, and Venezuela.\n\nICE has been increasingly releasing non-Spanish speaking migrant families from faraway countries, most notably from India, China and the former Soviet Union. They were released after arriving at the border without documents after traveling from the opposite side of the globe, possibly with the help of international smuggling rings.\n\nIn October, Mexico deported 311 migrants from India back to their country after they were caught in Mexico without documents. The Indian migrants had paid smugglers about $41,000 each to reach the U.S., The Times of India reported.\n\nHow many migrant families are coming from India, Russia or China?\n\nThe sudden arrival of non-Spanish speaking families reflects a big spike in migrant families overall.\n\nThe Trump administration has focused almost all of its attention on addressing the huge wave of migrant families coming to the U.S. from Central America, so little attention has been paid to the rise in non-Spanish-speaking migrant families from continents on the other side of the globe.\n\nBorder Patrol apprehensions of migrant \"family units\" hit 473,682 in fiscal year 2019, up 342% from the 107,212 the previous year.\n\nMigrant families from the Northern Triangle and Mexico made up 92% of the total.\n\nThe remaining 37,132 from countries outside the Northern Triangle or Mexico was 25 times larger than the 1,442 family unit apprehensions from other countries the previous year, the data shows.\n\nThe Border Patrol does not publish data on migrant family apprehensions by citizenship. That makes it difficult to tell how many of those are from other countries in Latin America and how many come from other continents, which the Border Patrol refers to as \"extra-continentals.\"\n\nIn the past, most \"extra-continentals\" apprehended by the Border Patrol were young adult men. Now more \"extra-continental\" migrants are arriving as families, based on overall Border Patrol data and anecdotal evidence.\n\nSince July 27, when a vacant elementary school in Phoenix converted into a shelter for migrant families opened, ICE has dropped off 201 families, according to data provided by the International Rescue Committee, which runs the shelter, along with other organizations.\n\nOf the 201, 125 families were from Mexico, and 42 came from countries in the Northern Triangle. An additional 16 families were from other parts of Latin America. Eighteen came from countries outside of Latin America, including 12 families from India, 3 from Romania, two from Kyrgyzstan and one from Azerbaijan.\n\n\"We’ve seen families from around the world,\" said Stanford Prescott, a spokesman for the International Rescue Committee in Arizona.\n\nIn trying to stop the wave, the Trump administration has accused migrant families of exploiting \"loopholes\" in the immigration system to get into the U.S. to seek better economic opportunities not to flee persecution.\n\nUnder legal rulings and immigration laws, adults who arrive at the border with children are typically released from custody within 20 days, which Trump says acts as a draw for more families to come illegally and then ask for asylum.\n\nMigrant families are allowed to remain in the U.S. while their asylum claims are pending, a process that can take years because of growing court backlogs, as opposed to single adults who typically are held in detention centers until their asylum cases are decided or they are deported.\n\nIt's difficult to say whether the migrant families arriving from other countries are trying to exploit the U.S. immigration system or are truly fleeing persecution.\n\nNot all asylum-seekers and refugees are economically disadvantaged\n\nExperts point out that refugees and asylum-seekers are often portrayed as destitute and impoverished, a misconception that likely was reinforced by the wave of mostly poor Central American families who poured across the border earlier this year in unprecedented numbers and received so much media attention.\n\nIn reality, people forced to leave their home countries due to persecution come from all walks of life, economic backgrounds and education levels, experts say.\n\nThe sudden arrival of families from India, for example, could reflect rising persecution against religious minorities, including Sikhs, Muslims and Christians, in that country under the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a Hindu nationalist.\n\n\"Indians have been seeking asylum for years now,\" though in the past most were adult men, not families, said Randy Capps, director of research for U.S. programs at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute.\n\n\"Many of them are religious minorities, Sikhs in particular,\" Capps said. \"They are fleeing religious persecution in many cases so their motive on the surface doesn’t appear to be economic the way it appears partially for many of the poorer people coming from Mexico and Central America.\"\n\nThe arrival of Chinese and Russian speaking families asking for asylum also is not surprising, said Daniel Balson, advocacy director for Europe and Central Asia at Amnesty International USA.\n\n\"There is any number of reasons for why individuals from across Eastern Europe and Asia would be interested in the United States,\" Balson said. \"Obviously, the government of the Russian Federation is remarkably repressive. This is especially true if you are active politically, or are actively speaking out against the policies of the (Vladimir) Putin government.\"\n\nHarder to explain is the growing numbers of non-Spanish speaking families at the U.S.-Mexico border. Non-Spanish speaking migrants in the past almost always tended to be young adult men.\n\nBalson believes the Trump administration's immigration policies are driving more non-Spanish speaking migrants, including families, to seek asylum at the southern border, either by crossing illegally or at ports of entry, rather than flying directly to the U.S. with visas.\n\n\"The Trump administration has shut down virtually all of the common paths for individuals fleeing persecution who are interested in seeking asylum,\" Balson said. \"This is really true around the world. What this has resulted in is individuals who are fleeing persecution who have credible claims for asylum are looking for other alternative paths to make those claims. And the southern route is an immigration route that is common.\"\n\nBalson cited examples such as the Trump administration's slashing of refugee admissions into the U.S. and the so-called Muslim ban, which under a version upheld by the Supreme Court in 2018 blocks travel to the U.S. from six predominantly Muslim countries as well as North Koreans and certain Venezuelan government officials.\n\nSome of the migrant families arriving from other continents could be paying smuggling organizations to reach the U.S., he said.\n\n\"What we have seen in Europe is what we have seen in the United States,\" Balson said, \"that shutting down safe, effective ways to secure asylum functions as a subsidy for militiamen, human-traffickers, war lords of all different shapes and stripes.\"\n\nBalson pointed out that migrant families from other continents who choose to travel through Mexico face the same deadly risks as those from Spanish-speaking countries.\n\nOn June 12, the body of a 7-year-old girl from India was found in a remote desert area in the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument in southern Arizona where hundreds of migrants have perished in recent years.\n\nThe girl had crossed the border illegally with a group of migrants from India, the Border Patrol said.\n\nThe Indian girl died less than two weeks before the bodies of a father from El Salvador and his 23-month-old daughter were found on the banks of the Rio Grande in Matamoros, Mexico. The pair drowned trying to reach Brownsville, Texas by wading across the river into the U.S.\n\nOn Nov. 14, a Border Patrol agent shot and wounded a migrant from Russia suspected of trying to cross the border illegally near Lukeville in the southwestern corner of Arizona The agent fired his weapon while trying to arrest the migrant and an altercation ensued, the Border Patrol said. It was not clear if the Russian migrant was traveling alone or with a family.\n\n\"The bottom line is that nobody wants to leave their home to travel to a foreign land where they don’t speak the language, trek across dangerous terrain only to face hostile border guards,\" Balson said. \"When people do this, especially with their families, with their children, it simply is reflective of the fact that their conditions at home have become so unstable, so dangerous so terrifying that this perilous journey is the only possible alternative that they can envision.\"\n\nThe rise in migrant families from other continents arriving at local shelters may show that while the Trump administration has effectively closed the door on migrant families from Central America, it remains open for others, said Capps at the Migration Policy Institute.\n\n\"Over time, people from all over the world are learning that the U.S. system has a hole in it when it comes to families seeking asylum,\" Capps said.\n\nThe Trump administration has essentially \"plugged\" that hole for Central Americans through policies that now require Central Americans to wait in Mexico for asylum hearings in the U.S.\n\nThe U.S. has pressured Mexico to stop Central American migrants from reaching the U.S.\n\nAdditionally, the U.S. has recently signed agreements with Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras that require asylum-seekers who pass through to apply in those countries first.\n\n\"But it hasn’t been plugged for the extra-continentals, for the non-Spanish speakers,\" Capps said.\n\nWhy are families coming to the United States from China, India?\n\nOn Tuesday, Oct. 29, immigration authorities dropped off four families at Iglesia Cristiana Buen Pastor, a small Hispanic church in Mesa.\n\nThree of the families were not out of the ordinary. They included a mother and her 2-year-old son from Chiapas, Mexico, a couple and their 6-year-old daughter from Morelos, Mexico, and a couple and their 4-year-old son from Brazil.\n\nBut the fourth family, a mother and her 17-year-old son stood out. They came from China, and spoke only a few words of English.\n\nZhu Yanying, the 41-year-old mother, her hair cut short, wore an a orange puffy jacket. She had a GPS monitoring device placed on one ankle by immigration authorities before her release to track her whereabouts.\n\nShe told a Chinese-speaking reporter that she and her son, Zou Ling Jie, were fleeing religious persecution in Fujian, a province in China.\n\nShe said she decided to bring her son to the U.S. to ask for asylum after she was jailed for 14 days by the police because of her religious views.\n\nShe said she and her son had plane tickets for a 3:30 p.m. flight from Phoenix to New York City, where a relative lives. The tickets were bought for them by relatives in New York.\n\nAfter eating breakfast at tables volunteers had set up for the families outside in a patio, Yanying and her son went into the church kitchen to figure out how they were going to get to the airport.\n\nTo communicate, volunteers spoke into their phones in English and Spanish, using an app to translate their words into Chinese, and then back again into English or Spanish.\n\n\"Sarah, one of our volunteers, is going to take you to the airport at 1:30 because you need to be at the airport two hours before your flight,\" Renata Garza Irving, one of the church volunteers, told them through the phone app.\n\nTwo weeks earlier, immigration authorities released a family from India at the same church: Surjit Singh, 39, his wife, Parmit Kaur, 35, and their 11-year-old son, Sukhvir.\n\nSingh and his son wore turbans on their heads, which identified them as Sikhs, a religious minority in India.\n\nSingh told a Punjabi-speaking reporter that his family came from Punjab, where the majority of the population are Sikhs.\n\nHe said it took the family two months to reach the U.S. They first flew from India to Dubai, then to Paris and then to Ecuador. From Ecuador, Singh said the family flew to Cancun, a resort city in southern Mexico, and then traveled by bus to the southern border of the U.S.\n\nSingh said the family was on their way to the Los Angeles area, where Singh said a nephew lived. Southern California is home to one of the largest Sikh Indian populations in the U.S.\n\nWhen the reporter asked Singh how much the trip had cost them, he turned and walked away. Singh refused to answer any more questions.\n\nThe Indian family did not stay at the church long. They ate a vegetarian lunch served by volunteers, took showers and picked out a few items of clothing from a room with racks full of donated items, then hopped in a cab to drive them from Phoenix to California.\n\nBefore the family left, Singh told one of the church volunteers, \"You are so generous, I will never forget your help.\"\n\nArizona Republic reporter Alison Steinbach and photographer Nick Oza contributed to this article.\n\nReach the reporter at daniel.gonzalez@arizonarepublic.com or at 602-444-8312.

Yet the national average could still climb back above the $4-a-gallon threshold as soon as May, according to GasBuddy projections shared exclusively with CNN.\n\nThe good news is that GasBuddy, an app that tracks fuel prices, doesn’t expect a repeat of this year’s wild swings that at one point sent gas prices above $5 a gallon for the first time ever. That spike set off recession alarm bells, worsened inflation and crushed consumer confidence.\n\nThe national average for regular gas, a metric closely watched by Wall Street, Main Street and even the White House, is expected to drop to $3.49 a gallon in 2023, down roughly 50 cents from the average this year, according to GasBuddy.\n\nThat cooldown could prove significant, translating to families spending an average of $277 less on fuel for the year. If that holds true, total US gasoline spending would drop by about $55 billion, according to the forecast.\n\nThe bad news is GasBuddy expects the national average to climb from $3.10 a gallon today to a range of $3.52 to $4.05 in May as Americans hit the roads.\n\n“2023 is not going to be a cakewalk for motorists. It could be expensive,” Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, told CNN. “The national average could breach $4 a gallon as early as May – and that’s something that could last through much of the summer driving season.”\n\nGas prices typically rise heading into the summer as Americans hit the road more during the warmer weather. In addition to the pick-up in demand, refiners switch over to summer-grade gasoline, which is designed to improve air quality and costs more to produce.\n\nThe GasBuddy forecast calls for the daily national average to top out at as high as $4.25 a gallon in August before dropping towards $3 a gallon by the end of the year.\n\nThe federal government has issued similar projections to GasBuddy’s.\n\nEarlier this month, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said the national average is expected to average about $3.50 a gallon in 2023 as refineries continue to ramp up production of gasoline.\n\n‘Curveballs coming from every direction’\n\nThe past year shows how difficult it can be to predict energy prices.\n\nVirtually no one expected the spike to $5.02 a gallon in June. But everything changed after Russia invaded Ukraine, raising the specter of severe supply crunches.\n\nBeyond the war, energy markets were rocked by a range of major forces, including China’s Covid-19 lockdowns, recession fears, super-sized interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve and the White House’s unprecedented use of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n\n“Basically, curveballs coming from every direction,” De Haan said, describing the ups swings in energy markets. “Extreme amounts of volatility. I don’t think we’ve ever seen such an amount of volatility as we saw this year.”\n\nThe 2022 experience means forecasts about 2023 should be taken with a grain of salt.\n\nVladimir Putin and Jerome Powell will influence prices in 2023\n\nPrices for the next 12 months will be driven by developments in the war, the Federal Reserve’s fight against inflation, OPEC policy, China’s Covid restrictions, a potential economic recession and perhaps other forces that are not even known at this point.\n\nIn its report, GasBuddy notes there is a “high level of uncertainty” in 2023, “making an accurate forecast very challenging.”\n\nFor instance, De Haan said a US recession would hurt demand for energy and likely drive prices lower than the $3.49 average forecast by GasBuddy.\n\nOn the other hand, a major hurricane or surprise refinery shutdowns could translate to higher-than-expected prices.\n\nStill, quite a bit of uncertainty remains.\n\n“This is probably the second hardest forecast,” De Haan said.\n\nThe hardest? That was last year.\n\nWhy gas prices are dropping\n\nIn December 2021, before Russia amassed troops at Ukraine’s border, GasBuddy projected the national average for gas would be $3.41 a gallon in 2022. That proved to be optimistic as prices took off after the invasion.\n\nBut in March 2022, GasBuddy revised its call to account for the war and projected the national average would be $3.99. That forecast was spot on, with gas prices on track to end the year at roughly that level, or perhaps a few pennies lower.\n\nAfter hitting $5 a gallon in June, gas prices have been on a remarkable decline, especially lately. The national average is now about 20 cents below the same period of a year ago, according to AAA.\n\nThe plunge to 18-month lows has been driven by a range of factors, including the return of refineries sidelined earlier this year, recession fears, record-setting releases of emergency oil by the Biden administration and the fact that Russia’s supply of oil has not been severely damaged by the war in Ukraine and Western sanctions.\n\nGas prices are not expected to return to $5 this summer – although GasBuddy isn’t ruling that out.\n\n“It’s not impossible,” De Haan said, “merely improbable at this moment.”", "authors": ["Matt Egan"], "publish_date": "2022/12/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/06/energy/record-gas-prices-causes/index.html", "title": "Why US gas prices are at a record and why they'll stay high for a ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine is a major reason that US drivers are paying record prices for gasoline. But it’s not the only reason.\n\nNumerous factors are combining to push gas prices up to a record. Gas hit $4.25 for a gallon of regular gas, according to AAA’s survey Wednesday.\n\nGas prices were already expected to breach the $4 a gallon mark for the first time since 2008, with or without shots fired or economic sanctions imposed in Eastern Europe.\n\n“I think we reach $5 somewhere between this weekend and Juneteenth/Father’s Day weekend,” he said.\n\nIt was back in March that prices first broke the record of $4.11 a gallon, which had stood since 2008. That now seems like the good old days: The national average has been rising steadily for the past month, setting 27 records in the last 28 days.\n\nMore than one out of every five gas stations nationwide is now charging more than $5 a gallon for regular, and just more than half are charging $4.75.\n\nThere are 10 states, plus Washington, DC, where the average price is already at $5 or more: Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, Nevada, Oregon and Washington. Several more are within a penny of $5, so those states’ prices are likely only a day or two at most from crossing the mark.\n\nBut prices aren’t likely to fall much whenever they do start to retreat. And Kloza expects they could once again set a record after schools let out and drivers start hitting the road for vacations next month.\n\n“Anything goes from June 20 to Labor Day,” Kloza said.\n\nHere’s what’s behind the record price surge:\n\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine\n\nRussia is one of the largest oil exporters on the planet. In December it sent nearly 8 million barrels of oil and other petroleum products to global markets, 5 million of them as crude oil.\n\nVery little of that went to the United States. Europe got 60% of the oil and 20% went to China in 2021. But oil is priced on global commodity markets, so the loss of Russian oil affects oil prices around the globe, no matter where it is used.\n\nThe concerns about disrupting global markets led western nations to initially exempt Russian oil and natural gas from the sanctions they put in place to protest the invasion.\n\nOn Tuesday the United States announced a formal ban on all Russian energy imports. The UK government said it, too, will phase out Russian oil imports by the end of 2022 and explore ways of ending natural gas imports.\n\nChina lockdowns ending\n\nOne factor keeping oil prices somewhat in check has been the surge of Covid cases, and strict lockdown rules in much of the country. That was a major drag on demand for oil.\n\nBut as the Covid surge has started to retreat, the lockdowns are being lifted in major cities such as Shanghai. And more demand without increased supply can only drive up prices.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback This is what determines the price of gas 01:57 - Source: CNN\n\nLess oil and gasoline from other sources\n\nWhen pandemic-related stay-at-home orders around the world crushed demand for oil in the spring of 2020, oil plunged, briefly trading at negative prices. OPEC and its allies, including Russia, agreed to slash production as a way to support prices. Even when demand returned sooner than expected, they kept production targets low.\n\nUS oil companies don’t follow those types of nationally mandated production targets. But they have been reluctant or unable to resume producing oil at pre-pandemic levels amid concerns about the prospect of tougher environmental rules that could cut future demand. Many of those tougher rules have been scaled back or failed to become law.\n\n“The Biden administration is suddenly interested in more drilling, not less,” said Robert McNally, president of consulting firm Rapidan Energy Group. “People are more worried about high oil prices than anything else.”\n\nIt takes time to scale up production, particularly when oil companies are facing the same supply chain and hiring challenges as thousands of other US businesses.\n\n“They can’t find people, and can’t find equipment,” McNally added. “It’s not like they’re available at a premium price. They’re just not available.”\n\nOil stocks have generally lagged the broader market over the last two years, at least until the recent run-up in prices. Oil company executives wanted to redirect cash to buying back stock and other ways to help their share price rather than increase production.\n\n“Oil and gas companies do not want to drill more,” said Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at Raymond James. “They are under pressure from the financial community to pay more dividends, to do more share buybacks instead of the proverbial ‘drill baby drill,’ which is the way they would have done things 10 years ago. Corporate strategy has fundamentally changed.”\n\nOne of the starkest examples: ExxonMobil (XOM) last month announced first quarter profits of $8.8 billion, more than triple the level of a year ago when excluding special items. It also announced a $30 billion share repurchase plan, far more than the $21 billion to $24 billion it expects to spend on all capital investment, including searching for new oil.\n\nNot only is oil production lagging behind pre-pandemic levels, there’s also less US refining capacity. Today, about 1 million fewer barrels of oil a day are available to be broken into gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and other petroleum-based products.\n\nState and federal environmental rules are prompting some refineries to switch from oil to lower carbon renewable fuels. And some companies are closing older refineries rather than invest the money it would cost to retool to keep them operating, especially with massive new refineries set to open overseas in Asia, the Middle East and Africa in 2023.\n\nAnd major US refineries have yet to return to full operation after two were damaged by hurricanes last year and another by an explosion.\n\n“Economics mandate you make more jet and diesel fuel to the detriment of gasoline,” said Kloza.\n\nAnd with prices in Europe even higher than in the United States, both Canadian and US oil producers have increased exports of oil and gasoline to the continent. That has also limited the US supply.\n\nStrong demand for gasoline\n\nRecord job gains in 2021, and the strongest economic growth since 1984, have combined to fuel the rebound in driving, as did pent-up demand for travel after the first year of the pandemic.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback How to save money on gas by being more fuel efficient 01:40 - Source: CNN\n\nThe US economy had record job growth in 2021, and while those gains have slowed, they remain historically strong. Demand is getting another boost as the many employees who have been working from home for much of the last two years return to the office.\n\nThe start of the summer travel season on Memorial Day weekend is likely to spark the typical annual increases in demand for gas and jet fuel. US airlines all report very strong bookings for summer travel, even with airfares climbing above pre-pandemic levels.\n\nThe end of the Omicron surge and the removal of many Covid restrictions is encouraging people to get out of the house for more shopping, entertainment and travel well. US trips in passenger vehicles have increased 25% since the beginning of this year, according to the mobility research firm Inrix.\n\n“Come hell or high gas prices, people are going to take vacations,” said Kloza.\n\nThere may not be quite as much commuting as before the pandemic. Many who plan to return to the office will be there only three or four days a week, rather than five. The total number of jobs is still slightly below 2019 levels.\n\n“Even before Ukraine, I was expecting to break the record,” Kloza said. “Now it’s a question of how much we break the record by.”", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/06/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personal-finance/susan-tompor/2022/03/01/michigan-gas-prices-russia-ukraine/6937758001/", "title": "Michigan gas prices going up because of Russia: How high they'll go", "text": "Driving around to save 10 cents a gallon on gas might seem like a thankless chore to many even as oil prices skyrocketed in light of developments relating to Russian oil.\n\nYet more people are bound to rethink how they shop for gas, as experts warn that the national average could hit $4 a gallon by mid-March and peak around $4.25 or so through much of the country by Memorial Day.\n\n\"People are creatures of convenience,\" said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy.\n\n\"They don't shop around,\" he said. \"They may pull into the station that's off of their commute or easiest for them, (what's) convenient without checking.\"\n\nComparing gas prices, though, could save surprisingly far more than $1 or $2 a fill-up.\n\nOil prices are soaring\n\nOn Tuesday, oil prices soared and stock prices tumbled in trading as the shock of sanctions against Russia builds.\n\nOil prices surged above $100 a barrel — the first time since 2014 — after Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in the early morning of Feb. 24.\n\nThen Tuesday, the oil market surged by 11% to a bit more than $106 a barrel in trading West Texas Intermediate crude futures for April.\n\nTom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for the Oil Price Information Service, a Dow Jones Company, noted that trading in the oil market was going \"super ballistic.\"\n\nKloza noted in a report Tuesday that \"noted oil analyst Andy Lipow of Lipow Oil characterized the moves of banks, merchants, shippers and insurance companies as a 'de facto ban' on plenty of Russian oil. Oil is not loading in ports in the Black Sea, for example, and there are real questions about deliverability of barrels through the first half of March.\"\n\nLipow, who was a guest on CNBC on Tuesday, said consumers could start to see price hikes of 10 cents to as much as 20 cents a gallon as early as this week.\n\n“The consumer is going to feel the pain across the country,” Lipow told CNBC.\n\nKloza expects gas prices to hit $4 to $4.25 a gallon in much of the U.S. by mid-March and peak around Memorial Day above a record of $4.11 a gallon set back in 2008. States with high taxes and fees, such as California, would be significantly higher.\n\nHow much can gas prices vary?\n\nGas prices aren't one size fits all in neighborhoods across Michigan and elsewhere.\n\nTake ZIP code 48091 in south Warren where De Haan found a 41 cent spread between the highest and lowest prices at the pump Feb. 25 via the GasBuddy app.\n\nThe low prices included a Marathon at 9 Mile Road and Memphis at $3.19 a gallon and the Fuel Zone station at 8 Mile Road and Ryan at $3.18 a gallon earlier that week.\n\nIf you're buying 15 gallons of gas a fill-up, you'd pocket $6 on the spot if you find a price break of 40 cents a gallon. If you drive twice as much, you save $12.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, some might ask: \"Is it worth it to wait in long lines on weekends at popular low-cost hot spots, like Costco or Sam's Club? Or a low cost leader?\" For many people, the answer is \"No.\"\n\nPlenty of others disagree.\n\nOn Sunday, the lineup of cars and trucks was long at the Sam's Club in Madison Heights, where regular unleaded gas was $3.16 a gallon. The backup was huge at the Costco in Madison Heights, roughly a mile away, where regular unleaded was also $3.16 a gallon. Prices were $3.49 and higher elsewhere.\n\nDe Haan is miffed when he sees drivers filling up cars at one gas station that's priced higher than another station that's visible across the corner or down the street.\n\nOver a full year, many drivers could save anywhere from $300 to $600 by taking advantage of vastly different price fluctuations within just a few miles.\n\nInflation surges as oil prices spike\n\nRussia's aggression isn't alone to blame for high oil prices.\n\nHigher prices at the pump have been driving up inflation and putting pressure on pocketbooks for some time.\n\n\"For the last year and certainly for the first 100 days of 2022, the world has been using more oil than it's been producing,\" Kloza said.\n\nThe consumer price index rose 7.5% in January over the past year — the biggest hike in roughly 40 years. The gasoline index went up 40% over the last year, even though it declined in January. Food — a larger part of family budgets — was up 7.4% over the last 12 months, based on January data.\n\nPresident Joe Biden promised Feb. 12 to “work like the devil” to limit the pain consumers are feeling at the pump. The Biden administration is laser-focused on gas prices, knowing high prices will be used against Democrats running for election later this year.\n\nDemand for oil jumped significantly since early in the pandemic when the average in metro Detroit was $1.41 a gallon on April 25, 2020, according to GasBuddy.com. That was down from $2.61 a gallon Jan. 9, 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic hit.\n\nAnd the production of oil has tightened.\n\nPrice hikes also are attributed to efforts by OPEC+, a cartel of oil-producing countries, to limit output and stand firm against appeals for boosting production.\n\n\"They've had the discipline of a gymnast,\" Kloza said. \"And usually, they have the discipline of Charlie Sheen.\"\n\nBut prices could trend back down later in 2022.\n\n\"This is not the new normal,\" Kloza said.\n\nThe most likely scenario is that Russian troops will go no farther than Ukraine and any disruptions to oil, natural gas and other commodity markets will be limited and temporary, according to Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody's Analytics.\n\nZandi expects regular unleaded gas prices to range around $3.70 to $3.90 a gallon for the next several months. After that, he said, prices could drop to $3.30 to $3.50 a gallon.\n\nSince it became clear that Russia was amassing troops on its border with Ukraine earlier this year, Zandi noted in a report Monday, West Texas Intermediate oil prices have risen about $15 per barrel to more than $90 per barrel.\n\nHe noted in the report that \"before Russia’s provocations, global oil prices appeared to be headed lower, as the gap between global supply and demand was closing.\"\n\n\"Assuming Russia stops at the Ukraine border, I think oil prices, as measured by West Texas Intermediate, will average between $90 and $100 per barrel for the first half of this year, and then decline in the second half,\" Zandi told the Detroit Free Press.\n\nZandi, like many economists, is not forecasting a U.S. recession in 2022. But the U.S. economy will grow at a slower pace as higher oil prices cut into household’s purchasing power, Zandi said. Inflation-adjusted GDP growth could slow to 3.5% in 2022.\n\n\"Higher gasoline prices hurt consumers, particularly lower- and middle-income Americans, but less so than in times past as gasoline spending is a much smaller share of the consumer budget,\" Zandi said.\n\nHere's what budget-conscious consumers can do to control spending on gasoline:\n\nComparison shop with an app\n\nIf you can scroll for sports scores, you can track gas prices.\n\nDownload apps, such as GasBuddy, Gas Guru, and AAA, for free to eyeball the going rate.\n\nGas Guru, for example, marks its prices from gray to yellow to green, with green being a great price and among the top 20% of the deals.\n\nOne warning: Prices may not be based on information received two days or three days ago but the price is marked as such. It's possible the price hasn't changed or the spot continues to offer bargains.\n\nGasBuddy gives you information about the spread between the lowest and the highest in an area. There was a 41 cent spread, for example, Monday from $3.28 a gallon for the lowest to $3.69 a gallon for the highest in the Ferndale area.\n\nThe AAA app allows you to click on a map if you're at particular spot, such as a hospital, and see what stations there are charging. The list includes prices for premium and diesel. The AAA app shows some deals within 3 or 4 miles of your location.\n\n\"A lot of people may think they always have a station that's cheap for them. They may not be paying full attention to it,\" De Haan said.\n\nJeff Arevalo, a financial wellness expert at GreenPath Financial Wellness, advises avoiding gas at stations near busy locations, such as airports where prices are higher because a large number of people may be fueling rental cars.\n\nConsider using cash\n\nSome stations do offer a better deal on cash-only sales for gasoline.\n\nThe GasBuddy app allows you to look for gas stations that offer cash and credit when there's a cheaper cash price available. Going for the cash price means that sometimes you can get up to 10 cents off a gallon in the Detroit area from other low prices.\n\nBe warned: Cash can mean cash, not a debit card. Be careful to read the signs.\n\nCheck out warehouse clubs\n\nYou might spend $45 to $60 a year or more to sign up for warehouse club memberships, but these stores often have gas at significantly lower prices for members.\n\nFigure out your break-even point — how many gallons of gas will you buy at that club — and figure out if other deals at the store will make the membership worth the price.\n\nLimit your trips\n\nOne consumer who is trying to control spending to pay down debt plots what routes she takes around town for errands and bunches several errands at a time.\n\nIf you're able to work remotely, avoid commuting when possible. Take a walk or ride your bike to an area store for a few items. Share rides with a coworker or neighbor.\n\nPay attention to rewards programs\n\nGreenPath's Arevalo said apps from Shell, Exxon Mobil and others offer rewards.\n\nGetUpside is an app that works with other programs to offer cash back via PayPal, e-gift cards or directly into your bank account for gas and grocery purchases.\n\nThe Kroger Fuels Points program builds reward points when you buy gift cards, groceries and other goods and you're able to get discounts on the price at the pump.\n\nKroger customers earn 1 point for every dollar spent at Kroger stores and 100 points equals 10 cents off per gallon. If they spend $500 in a month they earn 50 cents off per gallon. You'd earn 2 Fuel Points for each $1 spent buying most gift cards. At times, some gift card purchases can be worth four times the fuel points.\n\nPoints earned in March expire the last day of April.\n\nCustomers can save up to $1 off per gallon per transaction on a maximum of 36 gallons per fill-up. Fuel Points can be redeemed at Kroger Fuel Centers and participating Shell locations.\n\nOr take a closer look at the credit card you're using — especially if you pay off the bill each month. Interest rates on many rewards cards start around 15%. Some rates vary based on your credit history, but if so can end up in the 16% to 24% range. Rates would go up as the Federal Reserve moves to drive up rates.\n\nCiti Custom Cash offers 5% cash back on up to $500 in spending each month for your top eligible spending category — or up to $25 in rewards — and gas is one of the options, according to Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst for Bankrate.com and CreditCards.com. The bank determines your highest spending category, based on your purchases, for each billing cycle. Other categories include restaurants, grocery stores, home improvement stores and other spending. And you'd get 1% on other purchases.\n\nHe noted that the Sam’s Club Mastercard offers 5% cash back on gas on up to $6,000 in annual purchases, and these can be made anywhere Mastercard is accepted, not just at Sam’s Club gas pumps. After $6,000 in purchases, the rewards go to 1% on purchases.\n\nThe Costco Anywhere Visa offers 4% cash back on eligible gas purchases at a variety of gas stations, Rossman noted, on up to $7,000 a year in purchases. And then it's 1% thereafter. But the Costco card notes that cardholders will \"only earn 1% cash back, not 4%, for gas purchased at superstores, supermarkets, convenience stores and warehouse clubs other than Costco or for fuel used for non-automobile purposes.\"\n\nStudy each offer to figure out what gives you the most zip for your money.\n\nContactSusan Tompor: stompor@freepress.com.

Prices in California have long been among the highest, but they’ve soared in recent years in part because of changes at some West Coast refineries. Facilities have closed in some cases, while others are being modified to refine renewable fuels like diesel made from vegetable oil.\n\n“California is the proxy for what will happen with the energy transition,” said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for the Oil Price Information Service, the firm that tracks gas data for AAA. “A number of refineries have closed permanently….Getting people away from fossil fuels might be the right thing to do, but it is not without pain.”\n\nSo that’s one factor: With less refining capacity, the West Coast’s previous 2.5 million barrels of daily production heading into the pandemic has plummeted by nearly a quarter.\n\nKloza thinks $5 a gallon could come to California some point in the second quarter, and perhaps sooner if the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, a major oil producer, comes to pass. Other western states are also feeling the pain, like Hawaii — the only state with an average over $4, at $4.49 a gallon — as well as Washington, Oregon and Nevada, where prices are in the $3.90s.\n\nThe switch to renewables affects prices in another way: higher taxes.\n\nCalifornia state gas taxes and fees are about 68 cents a gallon, compared to a national average of 39 cents, according to the American Petroleum Institute. California also levies taxes and carbon fees of roughly $1.35 a gallon on wholesale gasoline, a cost that gets passed on to consumers, Kloza said.\n\n“Most states don’t have those [wholesale] fees. But it is a coming attraction to a number of blue states,” Kloza said. “If you want to move people away from fossil fuels, you have to start charging for carbon.”\n\nMeanwhile, California’s new record is not only the highest price ever for that state — it’s the highest for any state. The next highest record price was $4.70 a gallon in Alaska, but that was set in July 2008, when a spike in oil prices resulted in the record-high national average of $4.11 a gallon.\n\nThough the national US average of $3.51 a gallon is far lower than California’s $4.72, the national price is actually rising faster on a percentage basis. Gas prices were up 6% nationwide in just the last month and have climbed 40% over the last year, while By comparison California’s is up only 2% for the month and 35% for the year.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/02/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/05/energy/gas-prices/index.html", "title": "Gas prices are starting to take off again. More increases are on the ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nEven before Wednesday’s action by OPEC+ to cut oil production, US gas prices were on their way up. More price increases at the pump likely lay ahead.\n\nGas prices rose nearly 3 cents a gallon in AAA’s daily reading Wednesday, to $3.83 a gallon, the biggest one-day hike in nearly four months.\n\nThe 99-day streak of price declines from mid-June to September 20 may become a distant memory, even as today’s prices are still far below the June record of just over $5.03 a gallon. Gas prices have increased every day but one day since then, and are now up by 16 cents a gallon, or 4%, since they bottomed out two weeks ago at $3.67 a gallon.\n\nFor the most part the price increases have been slow and incremental, but that might be about to change. OPEC+, which includes not only nations in the oil cartel but other major oil producers such as Russia, agreed Wednesday to slash oil production by about 2 million barrels a day.\n\nOil futures rose about 2% on the news and gasoline futures were also slightly higher on the OPEC move. Gasoline futures are up about 20 cents a gallon since the slide in gasoline prices ended last month, pointing to possible higher prices ahead.\n\nOil and gasoline futures had been falling since mid-June due to growing concerns about a possible recession cutting demand for gasoline and oil, among other factors.\n\nThe recent increases have been caused by the unusually high number of US refineries that are shut down for maintenance work, said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for OPIS, which tracks gasoline prices for AAA. He said nearly 18% of the nation’s refining capacity is now offline.\n\n“A lot of it was put off in spring because they were making so much money,” he said. “The margin of error in US refining capacity is so slim right now that you can’t lose any capacity without affecting prices.”\n\nThis is normally the time of year that gas prices drop as regulations requiring cleaner but pricier gas to fight smog come to an end in most of the country. The end of the summer driving season also reduces demand, which in turn pushes prices downward.\n\nUnfortunately, the refinery capacity squeeze “means gas prices are not going to go down like I had thought,” said veteran oil analyst Andy Lipow. “In fact, they might drift upwards.”\n\nOne other factor that helped to reduce prices in recent months: the release of about 1 million barrels of oil a day from the nation’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which is set to end November 1.\n\n“Nobody really knows what happens when SPR sales end,” said Kloza.\n\nOne thing that could reduce prices: California, which typically keeps its rules requiring the summer of blend of gasoline in place until November, lifted the requirement early last week. That could lower the national average price, even if it only affects gasoline in California. The state accounts for about 9% of US gasoline consumption, so the change can affect the national average even if prices don’t move elsewhere. The average price there is $5.52 a gallon, by far the highest in the nation.\n\n“I don’t think we’ll see major moves in national prices. even if we see California prices come back to the pack,” Kloza said.\n\nThe decline in gasoline prices has been an important control on rising overall prices, as well as a support for consumer spending, as it means more money goes in consumers’ pockets.\n\nThe typical US household buys about 90 gallons of gas a month, so the fall from $5.03 a gallon to a low of $3.67 a gallon late last month represented a savings of about $120 a month. By contrast, the 16-cent rise from that low point was costing about $14 a household.\n\nThe concern by the Biden administration is that rising gas prices bring renewed focus in voters’ mind.\n\nFor that reason, members of the Biden administration pushed hard to convince OPEC nations not to cut production and possibly send prices higher ahead of a midterm vote. Those efforts were unsuccessful.\n\n– CNN’s Alex Marquardt, Natasha Bertrand and Phil Mattingly contributed to this report", "authors": ["Chris Isidore Matt Egan", "Chris Isidore", "Matt Egan"], "publish_date": "2022/10/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/10/energy/record-gas-price/index.html", "title": "Why the average gas price is at $4.99 a gallon and how high it'll go ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nAnother day, another record for US gas prices.\n\nThe US average for the price of a gallon of regular gas hit $4.96 according to the most recent reading from AAA Wednesday. It marked the 12th straight day, and the 29th time in the last 30 that gas has set a record in America.\n\nFor much of the country, $5 gas is already here.\n\nThere are now 16 states plus Washington DC with averages of $5 or above. Idaho, Ohio and Pennsylvania became the latest states to cross that threshold. The highest priced state remains California, with a state average of $6.39 a gallon.\n\nAnd the worst is yet to come for drivers.\n\nWith the summer travel season just getting underway, demand for gasoline, coupled with the cut-off of Russian oil shipments due to the war in Ukraine, is sending oil prices higher on global markets.\n\nThe national average for gasoline could be close to $6 by later this summer according to Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for the OPIS, which tracks gas prices for AAA.\n\n“Anything goes from June 20 to Labor Day,” Kloza said about the demand for gas as people hit the road for long-anticipated getaways. “Come hell or high gas prices, people are going to take vacations,”\n\nWhile the United States has never imported significant amounts of oil from Russia, the commodity is traded on global markets, and Europe was greatly dependent on Russian exports. The EU’s recent decision to ban oil tanker shipments from Russia as sent oil prices soaring on those global markets.\n\nThe price of a barrel of crude is now above $120 a barrel, up from just less than $100 a month ago, And prices continued to climb in early trading Wednesday. Goldman Sachs predicted the average price for a barrel of Brent crude, the benchmark used for oil traded in Europe, will be $140 a barrel between July and September, up from its prior call of $125 a barrel.\n\nThere are stations and states where gas is cheaper. About 20% of stations nationwide still are selling gas for less than $4.50 a gallon. But even in many states where gasoline is cheaper, such as Mississippi, lower average income can mean drivers have to work longer to fill-up their tanks than in some high gas price states such as California.\n\nHow much are drivers willing to pay before they cut back on driving? So far the number of gallons pumped at stations in the last week of May was down only about 5% from the same week a year ago, even though gas prices rose more than 50% during the same period. The number of US trips by car has slipped about 5% since early May, according to mobility research firm Inrix, although those trips are still up about 5% since the start of the year.\n\nThe concern is that consumers will cut back on other spending to keep driving the miles they want or need to drive, which could drive an economy already showing some signs of weakness into recession.\n\n– CNN’s Matt Egan contributed to this report", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/06/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2022/05/17/why-gas-prices-continue-rise-record/9798086002/", "title": "Gas prices continue to break records.

Diesel prices have remained the same for a week at $5.57.\n\nAlthough the national average has been above $4 since February, some Midwest states where gas is the cheapest, have remained below the benchmark until Tuesday. The cheapest state to get gas is currently Oklahoma, where the average is now $4.03. Following Oklahoma are Kansas ($4.04), Arkansas ($4.12), Missouri (4.13), Georgia ($4.13) and Colorado ($4.13).\n\nWhile the national record has been broken, it has yet to beat the 2008 record when adjusted for inflation, which would be well over $5 today.\n\nBut experts believe that mark could be eventually be surpassed, and the high cost at the pump will remain.\n\n\"We have to accept that the gas prices are probably going to be high for a long time,\" Leo Waldenback, co-founder of the online driver's education program Zutobi, told USA TODAY. \"It's definitely an extremely unique situation.\"\n\n'Excruciating': This working-class California county has the most expensive gas in the nation\n\nWays to save gas: Will driving my car in economy mode really help save money?\n\nWhy are gas prices so high?\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine was the main contributing factor when gas prices reached all-time records in March, and Waldenback said it still is playing a role today as embargoes on Russian oil remain in place.\n\nAs a result, the cost of oil worldwide continues to be over $100. U.S. crude oil costs $109.67 per barrel, while Brent crude, the international standard, costs $110.04 as of Thursday, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\nMatt Smith, an analyst with data analytics firm Kpler, told USA TODAY last week \"gasoline prices will remain high as long as oil prices remain in the triple digits.\"\n\nAnother factor is the transition into summer months, when demand for gas due to traveling is heightened. AAA said on Monday the switch to the summer blend of gas is already underway, which typically adds seven to 10 cents per gallon.\n\n\"Even the annual seasonal demand dip for gasoline during the lull between spring break and Memorial Day, which would normally help lower prices, is having no effect this year,\" said AAA spokesperson Andrew Gross.\n\nHow long will gas prices be so high?\n\nWaldenback said there is no ceiling, but it's certainly possible for the national average to go above $5 at some point this year.\n\n\"If we're saying the situation is like it is now, then I still think we're going to see fairly high prices for possibly the entire year and possibly longer,\" he said.\n\nPatrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, said on Monday demand and available inventory of gasoline will also dictate future prices. De Haan also said last week the upcoming hurricane season could hurt oil refinery capacity.\n\n\"Prices later this week could be closer to $5 per gallon than $4, as demand continues to edge higher and inventories of both gasoline and diesel continue to decline, temperatures warm and motorists get back outside and we near the Memorial Day weekend, the start of the summer driving season,\" De Haan said. \"There isn’t much reason to be optimistic that we’ll see a plunge any time soon.\"\n\nRoad trip: Here's how to take a summer road trip without spending a fortune as gas prices reach records\n\nGas relief: Is another stimulus check coming soon? Here's how Americans could get relief from rising gas prices\n\nWhen will gas prices go down?\n\nWaldenback said what will help an eventual drop in gas prices is the response from the Biden Administration and other world leaders in their ability to produce oil on their own and meet market demand.\n\n\"It depends on how quickly we're able to ramp up the production of gas and oil in other places and in other parts of the world, but that's going to take a lot a long time. I think we have to accept that the gas prices are probably going to be high for a long time,\" he said.\n\nWhere is gas the most expensive in the U.S.?\n\nCalifornia continues to have the most expensive gas in the country as of Wednesday, according to AAA, being the only state above $6 at $6.06. In total, there are six states averaging at least $5.\n\nHere are the highest regular gas prices per gallon in the U.S.:\n\nCalifornia: $6.06\n\nHawaii: $5.35\n\nNevada: $5.23\n\nWashington: $5.18\n\nAlaska: $5.14\n\nOregon: $5.13\n\nIllinois: $4.97\n\nNew York: $4.90\n\nWashington, D.C.: $4.87\n\nArizona: $4.84\n\nFollow Jordan Mendoza on Twitter: @jordan_mendoza5.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/17/energy/gas-prices/index.html", "title": "California's $6 gas prices could spread nationwide, JPMorgan ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nThe average price for gasoline in California hit $6 a gallon Tuesday for the first time – and analysts at JPMorgan are warning that price could be the national average before the end of the summer.\n\nThe startling forecast comes as US gas prices have surged to record highs in the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, casting a shadow over the economy.\n\n“There is a real risk the price could reach $6+ a gallon by August,” Natasha Kaneva, head of global oil and commodities research at JPMorgan, told CNN in an email on Tuesday.\n\nWith US gasoline inventories sitting at their lowest seasonal levels since 2019, JPMorgan is concerned it will be difficult to satisfy intense demand during this summer’s driving season.\n\n“With expectations of strong driving demand…US retail price could surge another 37% by August,” JPMorgan wrote in its report, fittingly titled “Cruel Summer.”\n\nThe national average for regular gas rose another two pennies on Tuesday to a record high of $4.52 of gallon, according to AAA. That leaves pump prices up by 15 cents in the past week and 44 cents in a month.\n\nReally cheap gas is becoming much tougher to find. Georgia, Kansas and Oklahoma, the last three states with an average price below $4 a gallon on Monday, all crossed that threshold in Tuesday’s reading.\n\nThe average price for regular gas in California surpassed $6 a gallon in Tuesday’s AAA reading. The state’s average of $6.02 a gallon is up sharply from $4.13 a year ago, and $5.84 only a week ago. Many larger cities are paying more: the average stands at $6.07 in Los Angeles County, and $6.27 a gallon in San Francisco.\n\nEven in California, 52% of stations sell gas for less than $6 a gallon, and nearly one station in four is $5.75 a gallon or less. Stations that charge much higher prices inflate the average.\n\nHigh-priced stations that are charging way more than general market prices are not limited to California. Gas is being sold for more than $5 a gallon in 29 states, according to OPIS, the service that collects gas price data for AAA. Six of them – Alaska, Hawaii, Nevada, Oregon, Washington and California – have a state average above that mark. So drivers nationwide could see some stations at or near $6, even if the national average never gets that high. Those station owners are satisfied with selling fewer gallons as long as they can fetch a higher price.\n\n‘Hard to get to $6’\n\nIt’s important to note that this is just one forecast.\n\nOthers in the industry are skeptical that prices would get that high for the simple reason that some Americans would likely balk at $6 gas and just drive less.\n\n“It’s hard to get to $6,” Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates, told CNN. “Before we get there, we would have significant demand destruction, not only here, but around the world.”\n\nPatrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, echoed that sentiment, saying: “I personally think we’d see a recession before we’d see a national average of $6.”\n\nDe Haan said doesn’t agree with JPMorgan – at least, not yet. However, given the widening imbalance between supply and demand, he conceded, “I don’t think much is impossible in this market.”\n\nJPMorgan acknowledged that one caveat to its forecast is that “demand may continue to come in below our expectations.” So far this year, gasoline demand has been lower than JPMorgan’s original expectations by an average of about 500,000 barrels per day.\n\nBut it’s hard to know precisely how consumers would react, given that Covid-weary families are eager to get out this summer – and they’re facing a choice between high gas prices and very high airfares.\n\nFederal government forecasters expect gas prices to dip below $4 a gallon during the second half of the year. The US Energy Information Administration projected last week the national average will drop to $4.81 a gallon during the third quarter and $3.59 a gallon during the final quarter of the year.\n\nEast Coast inventories at decade low\n\nThe problem is that refineries are having trouble churning out all the gasoline needed right now. There is less US and Canadian refining capacity today than there was before the pandemic, as some refineries closed permanently, and others are being converted to refine renewable fuels rather than crude oil.\n\nJPMorgan notes that East Coast gasoline inventories are at their lowest level since 2011. The central driver behind the drawdown of inventories is higher-than-normal exports of gasoline, analysts at the bank said.\n\nAs high as prices are in the United States, they’re much higher in Europe, which is dealing with the loss of supply from Russia. That’s a major factor driving up exports from US and Canadian refineries that would normally supply Eastern US gas stations.\n\n“If exports persist at this elevated pace and refinery runs – already near the top range for reasonable utilization rates – fall within our expectations, gasoline inventories could continue to draw to levels below 2008 lows and retail gasoline prices could climb to $6/gallon or even higher,” the JPMorgan analysts wrote.\n\nBased on those assumptions, total US gasoline inventories could fall below 160 million barrels by the end of August, the lowest level since the 1950s.\n\nSuch a decline in inventories suggests a 37% jump in prices, translating to a national average of $6.20 a gallon, the bank said. And at those levels, gas prices would blow past their inflation-adjusted peak of $5.38, set in June 2008, according to the EIA. The price hit $4.11 at that time, not adjusted for inflation.\n\nJPMorgan said that unless refineries “immediately” cut exports and shift production towards gasoline, “US consumers should not expect much in the way of relief in prices at the pump until the end of the year.”\n\nOne thing that could limit gas prices, or even send them lower, would be if the US economy slows or falls into recession. Strong job growth is one factor driving gas prices higher as more people are driving to work and have money to spend on gas. If the jobs trend reverses, that would keep gas from going higher, but at a terrible cost.\n\nThe one wild card that could raise gasoline prices is if major hurricanes hit the US refineries and oil platforms along the Gulf Coast.

Here's why | CNN ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nUS natural gas prices have skyrocketed to levels unseen since 2008, a spike that threatens to offset the benefits of falling prices at the gas pump.\n\nNatural gas futures surged 7% on Tuesday to close at $9.33 per million British thermal unit (BTU), the highest closing price since August 1, 2008.\n\nAlthough natural gas futures cooled off a touch on Wednesday, they remain up about 70% just since the end of June. And natural gas is up a staggering 525% since closing at $1.48 in June 2020 when Covid-19 had shut much of the US economy down.\n\nThe summer spike is being driven in part by high demand as scorching temperatures through much of the country force Americans to crank up the air conditioning. That in turn has chipped away at relatively low inventory levels.\n\n“We’ve had this perma-heat wave cooking the United States,” said Robert Yawger, vice president of energy futures at Mizuho Securities.\n\nAs temperatures drop this fall and winter, the natural gas spike signals sticker shock for families. Not only is natural gas a leading fuel source for the electric grid, it’s the most popular way to heat homes in America.\n\n“Depending on the weather, it could be a challenging winter,” said Rob Thummel, senior portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors. “But not as challenging as in Europe. They are at risk of running out of natural gas. We aren’t.”\n\nEurope’s natural gas prices are seven times higher\n\nEurope’s natural gas crisis is being driven by its reliance on energy from Russia, which has slashed natural gas flows to Europe in response to Western sanctions.\n\nThe European Union has been forced to lay plans to ration natural gas, a drastic step that will hurt families and businesses. Natural gas prices have skyrocketed so high in Europe that it threatens to send the continent’s economy into recession.\n\nFor context, Europe’s natural gas prices are trading at levels equivalent to about $70 per million BTUs, according to Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates. That is roughly seven times higher than prices in the United States.\n\nBut that is little consolation to Americans grappling with high prices at the grocery store, clothing stores and at restaurants.\n\nEven as natural gas prices surge, oil prices have tumbled, helping to drive gasoline prices sharply lower. The national average for regular gasoline has dropped 64 days in a row, according to AAA.\n\nExports pick-up to Europe\n\nAnalysts say Europe’s natural gas crisis is contributing to the higher natural gas prices in America, although it’s not the main driver.\n\n“Higher global prices are trickling down to the US. Natural gas has become a global commodity with the emergency of LNG,” said Thummel.\n\nThe United States has stepped up its exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Europe in an effort to mitigate the impact of the loss of Russian gas.\n\n“Every spare molecule we can find, we are shipping to the eurozone,” said Yawger.\n\nUS natural gas production is lagging behind\n\nBut the bigger issue for US natural gas is the fact that inventory levels are below historical averages, leaving the market with less of a buffer and driving up prices.\n\n“We entered this year at beaten-down levels and we never caught up,” Yawger said.\n\nSupply has failed to keep up with strong demand for gas. Thummel pointed to how US oil and gas producers are under pressure from Wall Street to spend less on expensive drilling projects and more on dividends and buybacks to shareholders.\n\n“We need more US natural gas production. The production levels are too low,” Thummel said.\n\nThe good news is that higher prices should, eventually, incentivize more production. And investors are not betting today’s high prices will continue. The futures market indicates natural gas prices should be almost 50% lower at this point next year.\n\nThen again, very few people thought a year ago natural gas prices would be at 2008 levels.

So is interest in electric cars | CNN Business", "text": "CNN —\n\nAs gas prices rose in the the first three months of 2022, interest among car shoppers in hybrid and electric cars rose right along with it. That’s not too surprising, since so-called “electrified” cars cost less to fuel than gasoline-only cars. And shopping interest in electrified cars also dropped when gas prices did, according to data from the auto shopping website Edmunds.com.\n\nWhat’s surprising is that interest in “green” vehicles dropped by an even larger percentage than gas prices did.\n\n“People have that knee-jerk reaction,” said Ivan Drury, an analyst with Edmunds.com, “but they get acclimated a little too soon.”\n\nEven when gas prices rose higher still in June, three months after the first price spike, interest in EVs and hybrids increased, but didn’t rise to those former levels. Consumers had, apparently, become inured to higher gas prices and their interest in paying for an electric or hybrid car had lessened as the focus was taken off rapidly rising gas prices.\n\nThe percentage of car shoppers looking at hybrid and electric vehicles on Edmunds.com peaked at 25% around mid-March, 2022, just as gas prices were hitting what was, at the time, a then-high average price of $4.41 per gallon in the United States. Then, as gas prices dropped in April, interest in hybrid and electric vehicles fell, too, but much faster than gas prices did. Even when gas prices rose again reaching a new record of over $5 a gallon in mid-June interest in hybrid and electric vehicles rose, too, but by less than before. That time, the percentage of car shoppers looking reached only about 22%.\n\nAccording to the most recent data, average gas prices are only about 5% lower than at that March $4.41 a gallon peak, but shopping interest in electric cars dropped by 32% since then, according to Edmunds.com data. Edmunds tracked the types of vehicles people were researching on the site and divided them into electrified – meaning hybrid or fully electric – and non-electrified.\n\nThe trend lines for electrified vehicle consideration and gas prices didn’t stay in lockstep because there are other factors, besides the cost of fuel, affecting consumers’ desire for electric and hybrid vehicles, said Daniel Levine, a consumer trends consultant and director of the Avant Guide Institute, a market consultancy. Car shoppers are also influenced by automaker marketing campaigns, changes in government incentives and interest rates, he said.\n\nBut, even when as the lines diverge from one another, the overall trend for electrified vehicle shopping interest still generally paralleled gas price trends going up somewhat when gas prices rose. That still indicates a strong pull, said Drury. It just became less strong after that initial run-up in gas prices.\n\nWhen gas prices first started rising sharply in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February, consumers probably saw it as a new phenomenon and were uncertain how high prices might go, said Aleksandar Tomic, an associate dean for innovation and technology at Boston College. That would have caused queries about electric vehicles to spike. Once prices peaked and came back down, he said, consumers saw that there was limit and the initial fears subsided.\n\n“People were able to adjust to the gas prices by driving less,” he said. Also, companies were flexible about allowing employees to continue working from home, he said, putting less pressure on the need to use gas.\n\nEven though it no longer so directly matches gas prices increases, interest in electric cars is still about three percentage points higher than it was at the start of 2022, according to Edmunds.com’s data.\n\nShopping interest doesn’t directly correlate to actual sales of electric and hybrid sales, of course, especially not in today’s auto market, constrained as it is by supply chain problems, said Drury. Electric and hybrid vehicles still only make up 10% of new vehicle sales.\n\nBut the data indicates gas price shocks can open up a new level of receptivity among consumer, he said.", "authors": ["Peter Valdes-Dapena"], "publish_date": "2022/08/05"}]}

Ukraine\n\nUkraine said its forces shot down 16 Iranian-made drones launched by Russia overnight, a day after Russian missile strikes targeted Ukraine’s electrical infrastructure, knocking out power in several regions and sending crews racing to restore services as the New Year’s holiday approaches. The latest attacks hit several power facilities, said Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential office. “We will not specify the locations of these objects, but because of these hits, we have limited power supply capacities in some regions,” he said. Engineers are working to restore power with capacity limitations remaining in Lviv, Kyiv, Kharkiv and Odesa, he added. Authorities have warned for days that Russia will launch an all-out assault on the power grid to close out 2022, plummeting the country into darkness before the New Year and the Orthodox Christmas holiday a week later.\n\n2.

They are among the at least 39 storm-related deaths in western New York, where crews and emergency personnel are working to clear snow and abandoned vehicles from the roads. Even amid such harrowing stories of loss and grief, there have also been stories of hope. One couple in Buffalo housed dozens in their church during the historic blizzard. “We just jumped into action and was able to deliver up to 154 people to the church, to not freeze to death,” Al Robinson told CNN. “I wish that I could say that for everyone.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'It was God's will': Hear how a good Samaritan delivers essentials to Buffalo residents in need 04:41 - Source: CNN\n\n3. Sesame allergy\n\nStarting January 1, all foods in the US containing sesame will be subject to specific allergen regulatory requirements, including labeling. The FDA has been reviewing whether to put sesame seeds on the major food allergens list – which also includes milk, eggs, fish, crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat and soybeans – for several years. Sesame allergies affect people of all ages and can appear as coughing, itchy throat, vomiting, diarrhea, mouth rash, shortness of breath, wheezing and drops in blood pressure. Sesame is in “dozens and dozens of ingredients,” but it wasn’t always listed by name, said Jason Linde, senior vice president of government and community affairs at Food Allergy Research & Education, a large private funder of food allergy research. “What it means is, for the 1.6 million Americans with life-threatening sesame allergy, that life gets better starting January 1, 2023,” Linde said.\n\n4. George Santos\n\nAs Rep.-elect George Santos continues to face scrutiny for false claims the New York Republican has made about his biography, another story is being questioned: that his mother was at the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, and that the incident played a role in her death. In particular, two tweets sent from his account last year are raising questions about the veracity of the story. In a July 2021 tweet, Santos said, “9/11 claimed my mothers life.” But months later, he reflected on the 5-year anniversary of his mother’s death in 2016. Santos’ campaign website says his mother survived the attacks and passed away a few years later from cancer. In a radio interview last year, Santos said his mother got “caught up in the ash cloud” on 9/11 and did not sign up for financial relief because she didn’t want to take money away from first responders. Santos has previously said his mother was a financial executive, but that description has since been removed from his website.\n\n5.

How the conspiracy theory spread", "text": "In July, many Twitter, Facebook and Instagram users saw posts alleging that high-priced furniture and other products with human names on Wayfair.com was evidence that missing children were being trafficked on the online retailer's site.\n\nThe conspiracy theory exploded on social media around July 10. On Facebook alone, the word \"Wayfair\" was mentioned in thousands of posts in the following week, and there were millions of social media interactions with such content, according to social monitoring platform CrowdTangle.\n\nFrom personal accounts with a few followers to verified social media influencers with hundreds of thousands of followers, users were rapidly spreading the theory.\n\nThis prompted fact checkers from USA TODAY, Reuters, Snopes and other outlets to investigate the validity of the information. Each reported that the conspiracy theory lacked credible evidence. Yet many social media users remain convinced of its validity.\n\nHere are seven things you should know about the Wayfair trafficking theory.\n\nMore:How an Arizona couple helped fuel the Wayfair sex trafficking theory\n\nWhat is the Wayfair human trafficking conspiracy?\n\nThe theory is that Wayfair is trafficking children on its website under the guise of selling home goods such as cabinets, throw pillows and shower curtains.\n\nWhen someone buys a product listed for thousands of dollars, theorists seem to believe that the person somehow indicates a desire to purchase a child whose name is also the product name. This would be done, some have suggested, by entering a promo code, selecting a specific delivery method or being a Wayfair Professional account holder.\n\nBelievers allege that the names of certain Wayfair products match those of children who have gone missing in the United States. Some also believe that the dimensions and weights of the products are actually descriptions of children, not of the products pictured.\n\nIn one user's screen capture, a \"Samiyah 5 — self storage cabinet\" was listed for $12,899.99. After many expressed alarm about a report of a 17-year-old Samiyah Mumin missing in Ohio in 2019, a woman identifying herself as Mumin took to Facebook Live on July 10, 2020, to confirm she was not missing.\n\nThe Poynter Institute's digital media literacy project, Mediawise, found that Mumin and several other children whose names matched Wayfair products had been missing but no longer were. Mediawise reports that one person social media users have connected to the conspiracy, Yaritza Castro of Connecticut, has not been found.\n\nTheorists later turned to Russian search engine Yandex as proof that children, not home furnishings, were being sold on Wayfair's website. Searching for a given SKU — or product identification number — preceded by the phrase \"src usa\" or \"src ru\" — abbreviations for the U.S. and Russia — on Yandex's image search results in images of children.\n\nIt is not clear what \"src\" stands for, though some have suggested a connection to a Russian modeling agency. There does not seem to be a link between the name of the product and the names of the children in the image search.\n\nWhat does Reddit have to do with the Wayfair scandal?\n\nThe conspiracy seems to have originated from a question posed on Reddit's forum for conspiracy theories on July 9: \"Is it possible Wayfair involved in Human trafficking with their WFX Utility collection? Or are these just extremely overpriced cabinets?\"\n\nNearly 3,000 comments ensued and further developed the theory in that thread and in other spin-off conversations.\n\nUsers weighed in with links to seemingly overpriced products on Wayfair's website, and their suspicion grew when some listings were taken down or their prices decreased.\n\nA Wayfair spokesperson said in a statement to USA TODAY: “The products in question are industrial grade cabinets that are accurately priced.\"\n\n\"Recognizing that the photos and descriptions provided by the supplier did not adequately explain the high price point, we temporarily removed the products from (the) site to rename them and provide a more in-depth description and photos that accurately depict the product to clarify the price point,” the statement said.\n\nAt the same time, these conversations moved from an audience of people who regularly engage in conspiracy theories to the mainstream on other social media platforms.\n\nWhat does QAnon have to do with the Wayfair trafficking theory?\n\nQAnon was born as a far-right conspiracy theory around 2017 on image-based forum 4chan. One of the beliefs is that President Trump is working to expose a cabal of Satan-worshiping pedophiles who are high-ranking officials and celebrities involved in a child sex-trafficking ring.\n\nThere seemed to be overlap between people who have previously engaged with QAnon content and those who shared the Wayfair conspiracy theory, pointing to it as proof of a large-scale sex-trafficking scheme.\n\nSome have attempted to connect the Wayfair theory to Ghislaine Maxwell, an associate and alleged accomplice of the late financier Jeffrey Epstein, a registered sex offender who in 2008 pleaded guilty to procuring a minor for prostitution. She was arrested on July 2 and later charged with six federal crimes for her alleged complicity in procuring children for Epstein. She pleaded not guilty.\n\nAn assertion that Maxwell was pictured with Wayfair's \"president of operations\" — a position that doesn't exist today — was debunked by the Associated Press.\n\nHow did the conspiracy catch fire?\n\nFrom Reddit's conspiracy forum, the Wayfair theory moved into the mainstream and was shared by social media influencers.\n\nOne Arizona couple, Maddie and Justin Thompson, gained tens of thousands of Instagram followers after posting a receipt of a $17,337.98 credit card transaction, followed by a 40-minute livestreamed video in which they explain why they bought an expensive desk from Wayfair to prove the trafficking theory.\n\nBefore both posts were later deleted. The video had hundreds of thousands of views.\n\nOther influencers, including those who don't regularly engage in conspiracies, also promoted the theory. They shared screenshots of expensive Wayfair products in their Instagram Stories and expressed shock at the idea.\n\nWhat do human trafficking experts think?\n\nThe Arizona Republic sought the expertise of Dominique Roe-Sepowitz, the director of sex trafficking intervention research at Arizona State University. She also serves on the Arizona Human Trafficking Council and the Mayor’s Human Trafficking Task Force in Phoenix.\n\nWhile Roe-Sepowitz could not speak to the veracity of the Wayfair theory, she told The Republic that she appreciates the opportunity to raise awareness of human trafficking, which \"happens every day\" in Phoenix, she said on July 13.\n\n\"The reality of trafficking is heartbreaking,\" Roe-Sepowitz said. \"There's nothing intriguing, nothing romantic\" about people who go missing and are trafficked, she said.\n\n\"I am happy that this story is interesting the public, but the victims are most likely not on Wayfair,\" Roe-Sepowitz wrote in an email to The Republic. \"They (are) right in front of us on 27th Avenue, in our local hotels, online on sex selling websites and dating sites.\"\n\nShe said people who have posted about child trafficking on social media can \"translate their attention\" to volunteering for and donating money to credible organizations.\n\nTim Ballard, founder of anti-child trafficking nonprofit Operation Underground Railroad and a former special agent for the Department of Homeland Security, went viral in a video posted July 12. Ballard is based in Utah and California.\n\n\"Law enforcement's going to flush that out, and we'll get our answers sooner than later, but I want to tell you this: Children are sold that way,\" Ballard said in the video. \"No question about it: Children are sold on social media platforms, on websites and so forth. I’m glad people are at least waking up to it, especially right now.”\n\nBallard did not confirm or deny the veracity of the theory specifically.\n\nDid the conspiracy theory have any real-world impact?\n\nPolaris, which operates the U.S. National Human Trafficking Hotline, received enough tips from concerned callers to release a statement more than a week after the Wayfair conspiracy theory gained traction online.\n\n\"Over the past several days the National Human Trafficking Hotline has received hundreds of reports that reference a series of viral posts claiming online retailer Wayfair has been involved in a complex scheme involving sex trafficking of children,\" Polaris' statement reads.\n\n\"While Polaris treats all calls to the Trafficking Hotline seriously, the extreme volume of these contacts has made it more difficult for the Trafficking Hotline to provide support and attention to others who are in need of help.\"\n\nThe statement continues: \"What we can say is that none of the reports we have received involving Wayfair contained any information beyond what has been widely shared online. Nor have any of these reports been made by someone who has a specific connection to any alleged missing children. We deeply appreciate those members of the public who have contacted the Trafficking Hotline out of heartfelt concern.\"\n\nIn Arizona, Sgt. Ann Justus of the Phoenix Police Department had not \"heard of calls for service\" related to the theory as of Aug.13.\n\nWhat does Wayfair say about the trafficking claims?\n\nWayfair denied the trafficking claim and defended its prices — while also claiming a \"pricing glitch\" on some product pages — in a statement to several media outlets.\n\n“There is, of course, no truth to these claims,” a Wayfair spokesperson said in a statement to USA TODAY.\n\nA spokesperson for Wayfair told Reuters that the company uses an algorithm to name its products. The algorithm uses “first names, geographic locations and common words for naming purposes.”\n\nReach the reporter at kimi.robinson@gannett.com or at 602-444-4968.\n\nSupport local journalism.

Savers could lose ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: A version of this story appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, a three-times-a-week update exploring what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world. Sign up here.\n\nPeter had put his life savings of about $6 million into accounts at three small banks in China’s central Henan province. He says he hasn’t been able to access them since April.\n\nThe 45-year-old entrepreneur asked us to call him Peter for security reasons. He’s from the eastern city of Wenzhou and is just one of thousands of depositors who have been fighting to recover their savings from at least six banks in rural provinces in central China.\n\n“I’m close to having a nervous breakdown. I can’t sleep,” Peter told CNN Business.\n\nWhen he tried to access his accounts online, a statement would pop up on the homepage informing him that the website was under maintenance and services would be unavailable for a while, Peter told CNN Business. Two months later, those services have not been restored.\n\nThe trouble began in April, when four banks in Henan suspended cash withdrawals.\n\nIn China, local banks are only permitted to obtain deposits from their home customer base, but authorities say that “third-party platforms” were used to acquire funds from depositors outside the region. In Peter’s case, for example, his hometown is over 700 miles away from the banks in Henan.\n\nThe national banking regulator has accused a major shareholder of the four banks of illegally attracting money from savers. “Henan New Fortune Group, a shareholder of the four village banks, has illegally absorbed the public’s funds through internal and external collusion, the use of third-party platforms, and fund brokers,” the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission told state-run Xinhua News Agency in May.\n\nDepositors protest in front of the Henan branch of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, demanding their money back after their funds were frozen. From Lan Nuo Nuo in February\n\n“The police have opened a case for investigation into the matter,” it added.\n\nRuns on small Chinese banks have become more frequent in recent years and some have been accused of financial improprieties or corruption. But experts worry that a much bigger financial problem could be looming, caused by fallout from a real estate crash and soaring bad debts related to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThere are no official estimates yet on the total amount of funds that bank depositors are unable to withdraw. CNN Business did not receive a comment from the local police or the national banking regulator.\n\nAs many as 400,000 banking customers across China were unable to access their savings, according to an estimate in April by Sanlian Lifeweek, a state-owned magazine.\n\nThat’s a drop in the ocean of China’s vast banking system, but about a quarter of the industry’s total assets are held by around 4,000 small lenders, which often have opaque ownership and governance structures and are more vulnerable to corruption, say experts, and the sharp economic slowdown.\n\n“The scope of the bank scandals where bank officials embezzle and steal funds from depositors is alarming, and what is exposed could only be the tip of the iceberg,” said Frank Xie, a professor at University of South Carolina Aiken who studies Chinese business and the economy.\n\n“As the Chinese economy slows down further, the fiscal shortage worsens, and the debt repayments become more widespread among Chinese companies, especially in the real estate sector, bank runs could become more often and on a larger scale,” he said.\n\nMany savers have had enough. Late last month, hundreds of depositors traveled to Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan, to protest outside the office of the banking regulator and to demand their money back, to no avail.\n\nAnother protest was planned in June. But as the depositors arrived in Zhengzhou, they were stunned to find that their health codes — which were green upon departure — had turned red, according to six people who spoke with CNN and social media posts. Anyone with a red code — usually assigned to people infected with Covid or deemed by authorities to be at high risk of infection — immediately becomes persona non grata.\n\nThey are banned from all public venues and transport and are often subject to weeks of government quarantine.\n\nCNN has reached out to the Zhengzhou government for comment. The Henan Provincial Health Commission told state-run news website thepaper.cn it was “investigating and verifying” the complaints from depositors who received red codes.\n\nWhat’s behind the problem in Henan\n\nIn Henan, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission has put the blame on the private investment firm that holds large stakes in all four lenders.\n\nLast week, the Henan police said that a criminal gang headed by the investment firm’s controller “has been suspected of using village banks to commit serious crimes.” Police say several suspects have been arrested.\n\nThe Henan New Fortune Group no longer has a website. CNN tried to reach the company for comment on the phone and by email without success. The company has made no public statements and it’s believed to have been annulled.\n\nLater on Monday, the four Henan banks said they would start collecting information from customers who have been affected by the shutdown of their online transaction systems. The move was required by financial regulators, the banks added in separate statements on their website, without elaborating further.\n\nThat’s of little comfort to the banks’ customers. Deposits up to 500,000 yuan (almost $75,000) are guaranteed in the event of bank failures, but that’s not enough for some — like Peter — and if the government’s investigation finds that their savings are “non-compliant” transactions, they could lose everything.\n\n“I’m quite worried about how they [authorities] are going to deal with our money,” said Ye, who asked CNN Business to only use his surname. Ye is a 30-year old tech worker from the city of Dongguan in Guangdong province — about 1500 km (900 miles) from the banks he used in Henan. He said he has a total of 160,000 yuan (about $24,000) worth of deposits with them.\n\n“We were told by the banks that the deposit products were legal, and that they were protected by the deposit insurance scheme,” he said. “We just want to get our money back.”\n\nThe four banks — Yuzhou Xinminsheng Village Bank, Shangcai Huimin County Bank, Zhecheng Huanghuai Community Bank, New Oriental Country Bank of Kaifeng — have not replied to requests for comment.\n\nRisky liabilities\n\nIn early 2021, Beijing banned banks from selling deposit products via third party online platforms, fearing that the rapid expansion of the fintech sector could increase risks in the wider financial system. The People’s Bank of China called such practices “illegal financial activities.”\n\nSo why were small local banks in Henan apparently ignoring the ban and raising deposits from savers — like Ye, who live on the other side of the country?\n\nChina’s national banking and insurance regulator says third party online platforms allowed them to bypass these geographical restrictions and grow their business nationwide.\n\nIn the Henan case, various state-run media are reporting that the deposit products were sold via platforms affiliated with, or owned by, giants of China’s tech scene such as Baidu (BIDU) and JD.com. (JD)\n\nThose platforms — Du Xiaoman Financial, which is the financial affiliate of Baidu, as well as JD Finance — have not responded to requests for comment.\n\n“The central government regulators seem to be incapable of enforcing those regulations aimed at preventing this kind of bank run from occurring,” said Frank Xie, the Chinese economy expert. He added that corruption was “rampant” at local levels of financial institutions.\n\n“Perpetrators such as the person stealing millions from the depositors often get shielded by accomplices in governments and in the upper-level management of the banks,” Xie said.\n\n“The core problem is that China’s financial system simply expanded far too fast relative to the size of the economy over the previous decade,” said Logan Wright, director of China markets research at Rhodium Group.\n\nChina’s banking sector has increased sixfold in size since 2008, with total assets reaching over $50 trillion, according to government statistics.\n\nThe funding structure of small lenders also makes them more risky, say experts.\n\nCompared with big banks, they are more reliant on deposits for funding. Many of them offer high interest rates to attract commercial and interbank deposits. But as the slowing economy means borrowers struggle to repay the banks, it becomes difficult for them to deliver the returns they offered savers.\n\n“The funding structure of liabilities in many of China’s mostly smaller and regional banks is most likely still vulnerable to deposit runs, lender caution, and deteriorating economic performance and rising unemployment,” said George Magnus, an associate at the China Centre at Oxford University and former chief economist at UBS.\n\nDeteriorating financial health\n\nThe Henan crisis arrived at a time when public confidence in China’s banking system was already waning.\n\nIn the past decade, Beijing has been clamping down on “shadow banking” activities — which means unregulated, off-the-book lending by financial institutions — on worries that most of the funds had been diverted to property developers and local government infrastructure projects, leading to a rapid run-up in debt and growing financial risks.\n\nIn 2019, China seized control of Baoshang Bank, based in Inner Mongolia, citing serious credit risks posed by the lender.\n\nIt was the first bank seizure in China in more than 20 years and the lender was declared bankrupt.\n\nThe following year, there were at least five bank runs at small lenders, mostly triggered by public fears following reports of financial distress at the banks or anti-graft investigations into bank executives.\n\n“Financial institutions are still grappling with some of the losses that have resulted, particularly in China’s northeast, central provinces, and western regions, where shadow banking activities had expanded the fastest over the past decade,” Wright said.\n\nMaking matters worse, “the ongoing slowdowns in the economy during the Covid-19 pandemic have further exposed financial institutions to new credit risks as well,” Wright added.\n\nSpillover effects\n\nInvestors are closely watching the government’s investigation into the Henan bank run. Analysts are gauging possible spillover effects to other banks.\n\n“The economy is a key reason why affected banks might be experiencing difficulties, and it is quite possible that other banks will be affected, perhaps even larger banks, given that the fate of the property market and real estate prices hang in the balance,” said Magnus from Oxford University.\n\nThe Chinese economy has been struggling with the country’s zero-Covid policy. Many cities have been placed under full or partial lockdowns since March, wreaking havoc on activity. Analysts are worried that the economy could contract in the second quarter.\n\n“This could have multiplier effects given that real estate as an asset class could be compromised now for a few years,” Magnus said.\n\nChina’s gigantic real estate sector, which accounts for as much as 30% of its GDP, is in a worsening downturn. Sales by the country’s top 100 developers collapsed 59% in May from a year ago, according to a recent survey by property research firm Cric China.\n\nEvergrande — one of the country’s biggest developers — is undergoing a huge restructuring after it defaulted on its debts late last year. Analysts have long feared Evergrande’s collapse could have ripple effects across the property industry and spill over to the financial system.\n\nProperty loans accounts for nearly 30% of outstanding loans with China’s financial institutions.\n\nAnalysts aren’t yet worrying about a financial crisis — because the PBOC is likely to ensure that larger and systemically more important banks are protected.\n\nBut the discontent triggered by the bank runs could be a major concern for the government.\n\nWhen Covid health codes of depositors turned red early last week, derailing a planned protest in Zhengzhou, it sparked a massive outcry on social media.\n\n“Now (the authorities) can stop you from petitioning by directly putting digital shackles on you, aka giving you red codes,” said one comment on Weibo, China’s Twitter-like platform.\n\nDozens of depositors were taken into a quarantine hotel guarded by police and local officials, before being sent away on trains bound for their hometowns the next day; others were “quarantined” at several other locations in the city, including a college campus, according to the witnesses and online posts.\n\n“Many people lost their lifetime savings because of this and [if] more incidences like this takes place, and [if] a bank run is met with a government crackdown, social unrest will be the only end result,” Xie said.\n\n— Nectar Gan, CNN’s Beijing bureau, and Wayne Chang contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Laura He"], "publish_date": "2022/06/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/12/tech/russia-internet-censorship-circumvention/index.html", "title": "Russian internet users are learning to beat Putin's internet ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nA digital Iron Curtain may be descending on Russia, as President Vladimir Putin struggles to control the narrative about his war in Ukraine. The Kremlin has already moved to block Facebook and Twitter, and its latest step in that direction came Friday as the government announced plans to block Instagram in the country, as well.\n\nBut despite Putin’s efforts to clamp down on social media and information within his borders, a growing number of Russian internet users appear determined to access outside sources and circumvent the Kremlin’s restrictions.\n\nTo defeat Russia’s internet censorship, many are turning to specialized circumvention technology that’s been widely used in other countries with restricted online freedoms, including China and Iran. Digital rights experts say Putin may have inadvertently sparked a massive, permanent shift in digital literacy in Russia that will work against the regime for years.\n\nSince the invasion of Ukraine, Russians have been flocking to virtual private networks (VPNs) and encrypted messaging apps, tools that can be used to access blocked websites such as Facebook or safely share news about the war in Ukraine without running afoul of new, draconian laws banning what Russian authorities consider to be “fake” claims about the conflict.\n\nA rapid rise in downloads\n\nDuring the week of February 28, Russian internet users downloaded the five leading VPN apps on Apple and Google’s app stores a total of 2.7 million times, a nearly three-fold increase in demand compared to the week before, according to the market research firm SensorTower.\n\nThat growth dovetails with what some VPN providers have reported. Switzerland-based Proton, for example, told CNN Business it has seen a 1,000% spike in signups from Russia this month. (The company declined to provide a baseline figure for comparison, however.)\n\nVPN providers are just one type of application seeing higher uptake in Russia. Since March 1, a range of messaging apps including Meta’s Messenger and WhatsApp services have seen a gradual increase in traffic, said the internet infrastructure company Cloudflare, a trend consistent with an increase in traffic to global social media platforms such as Twitter, YouTube, Instagram and TikTok.\n\nBut perhaps the fastest-growing messaging app in Russia may be the encrypted messaging app Signal. SensorTower said Signal was downloaded 132,000 times in the country last week, an increase of more than 28% from the week before. Russian internet traffic to Signal has seen “significant growth” since March 1, Cloudflare told CNN Business.\n\nOther private messaging apps, such as Telegram, saw a relative slowdown in growth that week but still witnessed more than half a million downloads in that timeframe, SensorTower said.\n\nIn recent weeks, Russian internet users also appear to have increased their reliance on Tor, a service that anonymizes internet browsing by scrambling a user’s traffic and bouncing it through multiple servers around the world. Beginning the day of the Ukraine invasion, Tor’s metrics page estimated that thousands more Russian users were accessing the web through secret servers connected to Tor’s decentralized network.\n\nTor users got a helping hand from Twitter on Tuesday, as the social network — which has been partially blocked in Russia following the invasion — added the ability to access its platform through a specialized website designed for Tor users. Facebook, for its part, has had its own Tor site since 2014.\n\nAnd Lantern, a peer-to-peer tool that routes internet traffic around government firewalls, began seeing more downloads from Russia starting about two months ago, said Sascha Meinrath, a communications professor at Penn State University who sits on the board of Lantern’s parent company, Brave New Software.\n\nLantern has seen a 2,000% increase in downloads from Russia alone over the past two months, Meinrath said, with the service going from 5,000 monthly users in Russia to more than 120,000. By comparison, Meinrath said, Lantern has between 2 million and 3 million users globally, mostly in China and Iran.\n\n“Tor, Lantern, all the VPNs, anything that’s masking who you are or where you’re going —Telegram — everything, downloads are increasing dramatically,” said Meinrath. “And it’s a bootstrapping thing, so the people that are on Telegram, they’re using that to swap notes about what else you should download.”\n\nThe most tech-savvy and privacy-conscious users, said Meinrath, know how to combine multiple tools together to maximize their protection — for example, by using Lantern to get around government blocks while also using Tor to anonymize their activity.\n\nThe war for information technology\n\nThe growing prominence of some of these tools highlights the stakes for Russian internet users as the Kremlin has detained thousands of people for protesting the war in Ukraine. And it contrasts with the steps Russia has taken to clamp down on social media, from blocking Facebook entirely to passing a law that threatens up to 15 years behind bars for those who share what the Kremlin deems “fake” information about the war.\n\nNatalia Krapiva, a lawyer at the digital rights group Access Now, said some Russian internet users have been using secure communications tools for years, as the Russian government began restricting internet freedoms more than a decade ago.\n\nIn the past, the Russian government has tried to block Tor and VPN providers, Krapiva said. But it hasn’t been very successful, she said, due to Tor’s open, decentralized design that hinges on many distributed servers and the willingness of new VPN providers to fill the gap left behind by banned ones. What Russia faces now is an intensifying game of cat and mouse, Krapiva said.\n\nBut while Putin may not be able to shut down censorship-resistant technologies entirely, supporters of the Kremlin can still try to drag it into Russia’s wider information war and hinder adoption.\n\nOn February. 28, Signal said it was aware of rumors suggesting the platform had been compromised in a hack — a claim the company flatly denied. Without blaming Russia directly, Signal said it suspected the rumors were being spread as “part of a coordinated misinformation campaign meant to encourage people to use less secure alternatives.”\n\nSignal’s claim underscores how quickly the information war has evolved from being about the news coming out of Ukraine to being about the services people use to access and discuss that news.\n\nIf only a small minority of Russians end up embracing circumvention technologies to get access to outside information, it may allow Putin to dominate the information space within the country. And while there are many indications of growing interest in these tools, it appears to be on the scale of thousands, not millions, at least for now.\n\n“The concern, of course, is that the majority of the people, the general population, might not necessarily know about those tools,” said Krapiva. “[They] can be complex if your digital literacy is quite low, so it’s going to remain a challenge to have a bigger section of the population really adopt these tools. But I’m sure there will be more education and I want to remain hopeful they will persevere.”\n\nNormalizing censorship-resistant tech\n\nSome digital rights experts say it’s important for these tools to be used for ordinary and innocuous internet activities, too, not just potentially subversive ones. Performing mundane tasks like checking email, accessing streaming movies or talking to friends using these technologies makes it harder for authoritarian regimes to justify cracking down on them, and can make it more difficult to identify efforts to violate government restrictions on speech and access.\n\n“The more that regular users use censorship-resistant technology for everyday activities like unblocking movies, the better,” said John Scott-Railton, a security and disinformation researcher at The University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab.\n\nAnd this may only be the start.

That amount can increase to up to $500 if the customer can document any losses they might have experienced due to the outage.\n\nIncluding earlier fee reimbursements the company has made, RushCard will have paid out more than $19 million, a company spokesman said.\n\n“We are pleased to have reached this preliminary settlement which will resolve the claims of our cardholders,” Rick Savard, CEO of Unirush, the parent company of RushCard, said in a statement.\n\nRushCard’s problems started in mid-October, when the company switched payment processors.

In following through on that commitment, however, Musk risks further alienating other users and advertisers, and exacerbating concerns among watchdog groups about the rise of hate speech on the platform under his ownership (a fact Musk has attempted to refute).\n\nAmong those recently unbanned are a range of large and small accounts, including users promoting NFTs and cryptocurrencies, users tweeting about sports, many users tweeting in languages other than English, as well as both users that appear to be left-leaning and pro-Trump, according to observations by CNN.\n\nBut the restored accounts also include far-right figures such as Andrew Anglin, a self-professed white supremacist who founded the neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer, and Patrick Casey, who is associated with the far-right group “America First” and was subpoenaed by the House January 6 committee for his involvement in the Capitol riot.\n\nA number of accounts restored in recent days, including many with thousands of followers, used their first tweets in years to thank Musk for allowing them back on the platform, according to a review of their posts by CNN. Some also quickly began sharing conspiracy theories about issues such as Covid-19 and the 2020 US Presidential election.\n\nA data set of many of the unbanned accounts compiled by researcher and software developer Travis Brown, who worked for Twitter for a year in 2014 and last year began a project tracking hate speech on the platform, shows dozens of users who have had their bans reversed are using QAnon-related phrases or hashtags in their account bios. The dataset was built using Twitter’s API and a tool Brown had originally built to observe and track high-profile Twitter suspensions.\n\nThe accounts that have been restored includes “a really strange mix of accounts” that includes apparent far-right extremists and QAnon adherents, but also, for example, a Miley Cyrus fan account that has been repeatedly suspended and appears aimed mostly at growing a large following, Brown said.\n\nBut Brown added that other accounts he has observed as part of his hate speech tracking project have yet to be reinstated, raising questions about the criteria Twitter is using to restore previously banned accounts, although it’s possible Musk’s reinstatement process will take time. Many users on Twitter have also raised questions about Musk’s move last week to again suspend Kanye West, who has made numerous antisemitic comments, while restoring the accounts of other white supremacists and Neo-Nazis. In another instance, Musk tweeted that he would not restore Alex Jones’s account because of a personal preference.\n\n“I’ve found it really hard … to generalize about how and why certain accounts are allowed back,” Brown said.\n\nTwitter, which has made substantial cuts to its public relations team, did not immediately respond to a request for comment and questions on the number of previously banned accounts restored or its process for doing so.\n\nMusk said last month that he would begin restoring most previously banned accounts to the platform, after having polled his Twitter followers about whether to offer “general amnesty to suspended accounts, provided that they have not broken the law or engaged in egregious spam.” The poll, which garnered more than three million votes, finished with more than 72% voting in favor of the proposition. It is not clear how Musk and Twitter’s remaining staff are sorting out which accounts were banned for spam or illegal activity.\n\nThe new Twitter owner had already begun to restore the accounts of some prominent, controversial users that had previously been banned or suspended from the platform, most notably former President Donald Trump, as well as conservative Canadian podcaster and all-beef diet promoter Jordan Peterson and the right-leaning satire website Babylon Bee.\n\nSome of the accounts restored in the latest wave have already raised concerns from civil rights groups. The Anti-Defamation League on Monday described as “deeply disturbing” Twitter’s decision to allow Anglin back on the platform.\n\n“The return of extremists to the platform has the potential to supercharge the spread of extremist content and disinformation, and this in turn could lead to the increased harassment of users,” Yael Eisenstat, vice president of ADL’s Center for Technology and Society said in a statement to CNN. “Musk’s actions to date show that he is not committed to a transparent process that incorporates the best practices we have learned from civil society groups.”\n\nBefore taking over Twitter, Musk said he disagreed with the platform’s policy of permanent bans, which were typically doled out only after a user had received a number of “strikes” for repeatedly violating Twitter’s policies, including those against Covid-19 or civic integrity misinformation.\n\nShortly after acquiring the company, Musk said he would create a “content moderation council” prior to making major changes, but there is no evidence such a group was ever formed or involved in the decisions to bring back violative accounts. Instead, Musk has appeared to make the decisions himself.\n\nMusk and Twitter have repeatedly stressed that the platform’s rules have not changed, despite restoring accounts that had repeatedly violated its rules and ceasing enforcement of the company’s policy prohibiting Covid-19 misinformation. In a blog post last month, Twitter said that its trust and safety team “remains strong and well-resourced, and automated detection plays an increasingly important role in eliminating abuse.” Content that violates Twitter’s rules, it added, will be demoted on the platform.\n\nYoel Roth, Twitter’s former head of trust and safety who left the company following Musk’s takeover, criticized the billionaire Twitter owner’s top-down approach to content decisions in an interview with journalist Kara Swisher last month, suggesting that the platform had started to be run by “dictatorial edict rather than by a policy.” He also raised concerns about layoffs that hit Twitter’s safety teams.\n\nRestoring additional, previously banned accounts could exacerbate several big issues Twitter is currently facing. It could further alienate Twitter’s advertisers, many of whom have fled the platform in the wake of the chaos since Musk took over and out of fear that their ads could end up running alongside objectionable content. Musk has said the departure of key Twitter advertisers in recent weeks has led to a “massive drop in revenue” for the company.\n\nAds for major brands, including Kia, Amazon, Snap and Uber, have already begun to appear alongside tweets from reinstated accounts such as Anglin’s, according to reporting from the Washington Post and observations by CNN. (Kia told CNN it “continues to monitor the evolving Twitter environment and work closely with their teams on advertisement placement and usage.” The other brands did not immediately respond to CNN’s requests for comment.)\n\nIt could also draw more attention from Apple, which Musk previously tweeted had threatened to remove Twitter from its app store. Musk later said that the concern had been resolved following a meeting with Tim Cook, but Apple has previously shown a willingness to remove social media platforms from its app store over concerns about their ability to moderate hate speech and other potentially harmful content. Getting booted from Apple’s app store would be detrimental to Twitter’s business by making it harder for the iPhone maker’s more than one billion global customers to access the app, and difficult if not impossible for iPhone users to receive app updates.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/12/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2021/01/12/tuscaloosa-strip-celebration-alabama-football-national-championship-covid-19-super-spreader/6638271002/", "title": "Tuscaloosa Strip: #RollCOVID trending after Alabama football ...", "text": "Following Alabama football's 52-24 victory over Ohio State on Monday night, large crowds of people took to the streets of Tuscaloosa to celebrate the program's 18th national title in history.\n\nRoll Tide?

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nScientists have identified two minerals never before seen on Earth in a meteorite weighing 15.2 metric tons (33,510 pounds).\n\nThe minerals came from a 70-gram (nearly 2.5-ounce) slice of the meteorite, which was discovered in Somalia in 2020 and is the ninth-largest meteorite ever found, according to a news release from the University of Alberta.\n\nChris Herd, curator of the university’s meteorite collection, received samples of the space rock so he could classify it. As he was examining it, something unusual caught his eye — some parts of the sample weren’t identifiable by a microscope. He then sought advice from Andrew Locock, head of the university’s Electron Microprobe Laboratory, since Locock has experience describing new minerals.\n\n“The very first day he did some analyses, he said, ‘You’ve got at least two new minerals in there,’” Herd, a professor in the university’s department of Earth and atmospheric sciences, said in a statement. “That was phenomenal. Most of the time it takes a lot more work than that to say there’s a new mineral.”\n\nOne mineral’s name — elaliite — derives from the space object itself, which is called the “El Ali” meteorite since it was found near the town of El Ali in central Somalia.\n\nHerd named the second one elkinstantonite after Lindy Elkins-Tanton, vice president of Arizona State University’s Interplanetary Initiative. Elkins-Tanton is also a regents professor in that university’s School of Earth and Space Exploration and the principal investigator of NASA’s upcoming Psyche mission — a journey to a metal-rich asteroid orbiting the sun between Mars and Jupiter, according to the space agency.\n\n“Lindy has done a lot of work on how the cores of planets form, how these iron nickel cores form, and the closest analogue we have are iron meteorites,” Herd said. “It made sense to name a mineral after her and recognize her contributions to science.”\n\nThe International Mineralogical Association’s approval of the two new minerals in November of this year “indicates that the work is robust,” said Oliver Tschauner, a mineralogist and professor of research in the department of geoscience at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.\n\n“Whenever you find a new mineral, it means that the actual geological conditions, the chemistry of the rock, was different than what’s been found before,” Herd said. “That’s what makes this exciting: In this particular meteorite you have two officially described minerals that are new to science.”\n\nThe role of lab-created minerals in discovery\n\nLocock’s quick identification was possible because similar minerals had been synthetically created before, and he was able to match the composition of the newly discovered minerals with their human-made counterparts, according to the University of Alberta release.\n\n“Material scientists do this all the time,” said Alan Rubin, a meteorite researcher and former adjunct professor and research geochemist in the department of earth, planetary and space sciences at the University of California, Los Angeles. “They can create new compounds — one, just to see what’s physically possible just as a research interest, and others … will say, ‘We’re seeking a compound that has certain properties for some practical or commercial application, like conductivity or high strain or high melting temperature.\n\n“It’s just fortuitous that a researcher will find a mineral in a meteorite or a terrestrial rock that hasn’t been known before, and then very often, that same compound will have been created previously by material scientists.”\n\nBoth new minerals are phosphates of iron, Tschauner said. A phosphate is a salt or ester of a phosphoric acid.\n\n“Phosphates in iron meteorites are secondary products: They form through oxidation of phosphides … which are rare primary components of iron meteorites,” he said via email. “Hence, the two new phosphates tell us about oxidation processes that occurred in the meteorite material. It remains to be seen if the oxidation occurred in space or on Earth, after the fall, but as far as I know, many of these meteorite phosphates formed in space. In either case, water is probably the reactant that caused the oxidation.”\n\nThe findings were presented in November at the University of Alberta’s Space Exploration Symposium. The revelations “broaden our perspective on the natural materials that can be found and can be formed in the solar system,” Rubin said.\n\nThe El Ali meteorite the minerals came from appears to have been sent to China in search of a buyer, Herd said.\n\nMeanwhile, the researchers are still analyzing the minerals — and potentially a third one — to find out what the conditions were in the meteorite when the space rock formed. And newly discovered minerals could have exciting implications for the future, he added.\n\n“Whenever there’s a new material that’s known, material scientists are interested too because of the potential uses in a wide range of things in society,” Herd said.", "authors": ["Kristen Rogers"], "publish_date": "2022/12/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/michigan/2018/01/17/michigan-meteor-meteoroid-detroit/1039523001/", "title": "Find piece of Michigan meteor?

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nChristmas came a little early for NASA’s InSight mission last December when the lander detected a massive quake on Mars.\n\nNow, scientists know what caused the red planet to rumble. A meteoroid slammed into Mars 2,174 miles (3,500 kilometers) away from the lander and created a fresh impact crater on the Martian surface.\n\nThe ground literally moved beneath InSight on December 24, 2021, when the lander recorded a magnitude 4 marsquake. Before and after photos captured from above by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which has been circling Mars since 2006, spotted a new crater this past February.\n\nBefore and after photos taken by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter show where a meteoroid slammed into Mars on December 24, 2021. NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS\n\nWhen scientists connected the dots from both missions, they realized it was one of the largest meteoroid strikes on Mars since NASA began studying the red planet. Images from the orbiter’s two cameras showed the blast zone of the crater, which allowed scientists to compare it with the epicenter of the quake detected by InSight.\n\nThe journal Science published two new studies describing the impact and its effects on Thursday.\n\nThe space rock also revealed boulder-size ice chunks when it slammed into Mars. They were found buried closer to the warm Martian equator than any ice that has ever been detected on the planet.\n\nBoulder-size ice chunks can be seen scattered around and outside the new crater's rim. NASA/JPL-Caltech/University of Arizona\n\n“The image of the impact was unlike any I had seen before, with the massive crater, the exposed ice, and the dramatic blast zone preserved in the Martian dust,” said Liliya Posiolova, orbital science operations lead for the orbiter at Malin Space Science Systems in San Diego, in a statement.\n\n“I couldn’t help but imagine what it must have been like to witness the impact, the atmospheric blast, and debris ejected miles downrange.”\n\nStudying the ice revealed by the impact will help scientists better understand previous climate conditions on Mars, as well as how and when the ice was deposited and buried.\n\nResearchers estimated the meteoroid, the name for a space rock before it hits the ground, was about 16 to 39 feet (5 to 12 meters). While this would have been small enough to burn up in Earth’s atmosphere, the same can’t be said for Mars, which has a thin atmosphere only 1% as dense as Earth’s.\n\nWhen the meteoroid crashed into Mars, it created a crater in the planet’s Amazonis Planitia region spanning 492 feet (150 meters) across and 70 feet (21 meters) deep. Some of the material blasted out of the crater landed as far as 23 miles (37 kilometers) away. Teams at NASA also captured sound from the impact, so you can listen to what it sounds like when a space rock hits Mars.\n\nNASA’s InSight Records the Sound of a Martian Impact\n\nThe images captured by the orbiter, along with seismic data recorded by InSight, make the impact one of the largest craters in our solar system ever observed as it was created. Mars is littered with massive craters, but they’re much older than any mission to explore the red planet.\n\n“It’s unprecedented to find a fresh impact of this size,” said Ingrid Daubar, InSight impact science lead at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, in a statement. “It’s an exciting moment in geologic history, and we got to witness it.”\n\nIf a quake like this one had occurred on Earth, it would be “big enough to be felt, but not big enough to cause a ton of damage,” Daubar said. About a thousand quakes of this size occur on Earth each year, but Mars is less active than our planet, so it was “a pretty big one” for the red planet, she said.\n\nThe quake that resulted from the impact also created surface waves, or a seismic wave that moved along the top of the Martian crust. InSight’s data from the event will help scientists study the planet’s crust and learn more about its structure.\n\nStudying craters and their formation rate can help scientists pin down Mars’ geologic timeline. Impact craters also excavate material and bring it to the surface, like the ice revealed by the December 24 strike.\n\nIce beneath the Martian surface could be used for drinking water, rocket propellant and even growing crops and plants by future astronauts. And the fact that the ice was found so near the equator, the warmest region on Mars, might make it an ideal place to land crewed missions to the red planet.\n\nPreviously, InSight has “heard” and detected space rocks hitting Mars, but the December impact was the largest. Since landing on 2018, the mission has revealed new details about Mars’ crust, mantle and core and detected 1,318 marsquakes.\n\nSadly, InSight’s mission is running out of time. Increasing amounts of dust have settled on the lander’s solar panels, only exacerbated by a continent-size dust storm detected on Mars in September, and its power levels keep dropping.\n\nThe beige clouds are a continent-size dust storm imaged by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter on September 29. The locations of the Perseverance, Curiosity and InSight missions are also labeled. NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS\n\nFortunately, the storm didn’t pass over InSight directly — otherwise, the darkness of the storm would have ended the mission. But the weather event has kicked a lot of dust up into the atmosphere, and it has cut down the amount of sunlight reaching InSight’s solar panels, said Bruce Banerdt, InSight principal investigator at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.\n\nThe mission scientists estimate InSight will likely shut down in the next six weeks, ending a promising mission to unlock the interior of Mars.\n\n“For the last four years we’ve gone well beyond the intended lifetime of the mission, which was two years,” Banerdt said. ” And even now as we’re winding down, we’re still getting these amazing new results.”", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/10/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/science/2018/04/18/space-diamonds-may-have-come-large-lost-planet-study-says/527345002/", "title": "Space diamonds: Stones found in meteorite may be from 'lost planet'", "text": "Associated Press\n\nBERLIN (AP) — Fragments of a meteorite that fell to Earth about a decade ago provide compelling evidence of a lost planet that once roamed our solar system, according to a study published Tuesday.\n\nResearchers from Switzerland, France and Germany examined diamonds found inside the Almahata Sitta meteorite and concluded they were most likely formed by a proto-planet at least 4.55 billion years ago.\n\nThe diamonds in the meteorite, which crashed in Sudan’s Nubian Desert in October 2008, have tiny crystals inside them that would have required great pressure to form, said one of the study’s co-authors, Philippe Gillet.\n\n“We demonstrate that these large diamonds cannot be the result of a shock but rather of growth that has taken place within a planet,” he told the Associated Press in a telephone interview from Switzerland.\n\nGillet, a planetary scientist at the Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, said researchers calculated a pressure of 2.9 million psi would be needed to form such diamonds, suggesting the mystery planet was at least as big as Mercury, possibly even Mars.\n\nScientists have long theorized that the early solar system once contained many more planets — some of which were likely little more than a mass of molten magma. One of these embryo planets — dubbed Theia — is believed to have slammed into a young Earth, ejecting a large amount of debris that later formed the moon.\n\n“What we’re claiming here,” said Gillet, “is that we have in our hands a remnant of this first generation of planets that are missing today because they were destroyed or incorporated in a bigger planet.”\n\nAddi Bischoff, a meteorite expert at the University of Muenster, Germany, said the methods used for the study were sound and the conclusion was plausible.

A colleague there further analyzed the sample, including with an acid test to reveal the Widmanstätten pattern, a property of most iron-nickel meteorites that cannot be faked.\n\nJan. 17:'Slow' meteor brings dazzling light show to Detroit area\n\nNovember 2017:Blazing fireball lights up Arctic sky in 'glow of 100 full moons'\n\nOn Jan. 17, Michigan experienced a meteor flash that shook the state and left small rocks scattered in Livingston County as it blew apart entering the atmosphere.\n\nBut this chunk was from a much older asteroid: When the man from Grand Rapids, Michigan, bought his farm in the Edmore, Michigan, area in 1988, the previous owner told him that the doorstop was a meteorite from the 1930s.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe first glimpse of how the James Webb Space Telescope will change the way people see the universe has arrived.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has released one of Webb’s first images, and it’s “the deepest and sharpest infrared image of the distant universe to date,” according to NASA.\n\nThe image shows SMACS 0723, where a massive group of galaxy clusters act as a magnifying glass for the objects behind them. Called gravitational lensing, this created Webb’s first deep field view of incredibly old and distant, faint galaxies.\n\nThe presentation occurred at the White House during a preview event with NASA Administrator Bill Nelson.\n\n“It is the deepest image of our universe that has ever been taken” in infrared, according to Nelson.\n\nSome of these distant galaxies and star clusters have never been seen before. The galaxy cluster is shown as it appeared 4.6 billion years ago.\n\n“This slice of the vast universe covers a patch of sky approximately the size of a grain of sand held at arm’s length by someone on the ground,” according to a NASA release.\n\nThe image, taken by Webb’s Near-Infrared Camera, is composed of images taken at different wavelengths of light over the course of 12.5 hours. The Hubble Space Telescope’s deepest fields took weeks to capture.\n\nThe rest of the high-resolution color images will make their debut on Tuesday, July 12.\n\nThe space observatory, which launched in December, will be able to peer inside the atmospheres of exoplanets and observe some of the first galaxies created after the universe began by viewing them through infrared light, which is invisible to the human eye.\n\nThe first image release highlights Webb’s science capabilities as well as the ability of its massive golden mirror and science instruments to produce spectacular images.\n\nThere are several events taking place during Tuesday’s image release, and all of them will stream live on NASA’s website.\n\nOpening remarks by NASA leadership and the Webb team will begin Tuesday at 9:45 a.m. ET, followed by an image release broadcast that kicks off at 10:30 a.m. ET. Images will be revealed one by one, and a news conference at 12:30 p.m. ET will offer details about them.\n\nThe first images\n\nNASA shared Webb’s first cosmic targets on Friday, providing a teaser for what else Tuesday’s image release will include: the Carina Nebula, WASP-96b, the Southern Ring Nebula and Stephan’s Quintet.\n\nLocated 7,600 light-years away, the Carina Nebula is a stellar nursery, where stars are born. It is one of the largest and brightest nebulae in the sky and home to many stars much more massive than our sun.\n\nWebb’s study of the giant gas planet WASP-96b will be the first full-color spectrum of an exoplanet. The spectrum will include different wavelengths of light that could reveal new information about the planet, such as whether it has an atmosphere. Discovered in 2014, WASP-96b is located 1,150 light-years from Earth. It has half the mass of Jupiter and completes an orbit around its star every 3.4 days.\n\nThis test image was taken by Webb's Fine Guidance Sensor over a period of eight days at the beginning of May. It shows how Webb can capture detailed images of very faint objects. NASA/CSA/FGS team\n\nThe Southern Ring Nebula, also called the “Eight-Burst,” is 2,000 light-years away from Earth. This large planetary nebula includes an expanding cloud of gas around a dying star.\n\nThe space telescope’s view of Stephan’s Quintet will reveal the way galaxies interact with one another. This compact galaxy group, first discovered in 1877, is located 290 million light-years away in the constellation Pegasus. Four of the five galaxies in the group “are locked in a cosmic dance of repeated close encounters,” according to a NASA statement.\n\nThe targets were selected by an international committee, including members from NASA, the European Space Agency, the Canadian Space Agency and the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nThese will be the first of many images to come from Webb, the most powerful telescope ever launched into space. The mission, originally expected to last for 10 years, has enough excess fuel capability to operate for 20 years, according to NASA Deputy Administrator Pam Melroy.\n\n“Webb can see backwards in time just after the big bang by looking for galaxies that are so far away, the light has taken many billions of years to get from those galaxies to ourselves,” said Jonathan Gardner, Webb deputy senior project scientist at NASA, during a recent news conference. “Webb is bigger than Hubble so that it can see fainter galaxies that are further away.”\n\nThe initial goal for the telescope was to see the first stars and galaxies of the universe, essentially watching “the universe turn the lights on for the first time,” said Eric Smith, Webb program scientist and NASA Astrophysics Division chief scientist.\n\nSmith has worked on Webb since the project began in the mid-1990s.\n\n“The James Webb Space Telescope will give us a fresh and powerful set of eyes to examine our universe,” Smith wrote in an update on NASA’s website. “The world is about to be new again.”", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/07/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/12/weather/california-megaflood-study/index.html", "title": "Climate change could make parts of drought-prone California a \"vast ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nMany Californians fear the “Big One,” but it might not be what you think.\n\nIt’s not an earthquake. And it isn’t the mega drought. It’s actually the exact opposite.\n\nA megaflood.\n\nA new study by Science Advances shows climate change has already doubled the chances of a disastrous flood happening in California in the next four decades. And experts say it would be unlike anything anyone alive today has ever experienced.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN reporter shows impact drought has had on California river 02:37 - Source: CNN\n\nDaniel Swain, a climate scientist with UCLA and a researcher involved in the study, describes a megaflood as, “a very severe flood event across a broad region that has the potential to bring catastrophic impacts to society in the areas affected.” He said a megaflood is similar to the 1,000-year flash flood events seen this summer in the St. Louis area and Kentucky, but across a much wider area, such as the entire state of California.\n\nThese massive floods, which experts say would turn California’s lowlands into a “vast inland sea,” might have previously happened once in a lifetime in the state. But experts say climate change is increasing the likelihood of these catastrophic disasters, causing them to occur more like every 25 to 50 years.\n\nClimate change supercharges heavy rain events, making flash floods occur more regularly, as has been noted several times this summer in Eastern Kentucky, St. Louis, and even in California’s Death Valley National Park.\n\nCalifornia is prone to these floods from atmospheric rivers naturally, and major floods from them have happened before – but climate change is upping the ante, and millions of people could be impacted.\n\nThe study said atmospheric rivers could become consecutive for weeks on end, like seen in this animation. Xingying Huang, one of the authors of the study, made this loop, which illustrates the water vapor transportation and potential precipitation accumulation at selected time slices during the 30-day scenario.\n\nThe area with the most destruction would be the Central Valley of California, including Sacramento, Fresno and Bakersfield, the study’s authors project. The Central Valley, roughly the size of Vermont and Massachusetts combined, produces a quarter of the nation’s food supply, according to the US Geological Survey.\n\nA flood with the size to fill this valley has the potential to be the most expensive geophysical disaster to date, costing upwards of $1 trillion in losses and devastating the state’s lowland areas, including Los Angeles and Orange counties, according to the study.\n\nThat would be more 5 times the cost of Hurricane Katrina, the current costliest disaster in US history.\n\n“Such a flood event in modern California would likely exceed the damages from a large magnitude earthquake by a considerable margin,” the study showed.\n\nIn this photo provided by the National Park Service, Mud Canyon Road is closed due to flash flooding in Death Valley, California. National Park Service/AP\n\nThis study is the first phase of a three-part series studying the effects of a future megaflood event in California. The next two phases are expected to be released in two to three years.\n\n“Ultimately, one of our goals is not just to understand these events scientifically, but it’s also to help California prepare for them,” Swain said. “It’s a question of when rather than if (the megaflood) occurs.”\n\nIt’s happened before. It will happen again, but worse, warns scientists\n\nOver 150 years ago, a strong series of atmospheric rivers drenched the Golden State, causing one of the most exceptional floods in history following a dry spell that had left the West parched for decades.\n\nCommunities were demolished in minutes.\n\nThis 1861 photograph shows flooding in Sacramento. Sacramento Public Library\n\nIt was the winter of 1861-1862 and a historic megaflood transformed the San Joaquin and Sacramento valleys into a “temporary but vast inland sea,” according to the study. Some areas had up to 30 feet of water for weeks, obliterating infrastructure, farmland, and towns.\n\nSacramento, the new state capital at the time, was under ten feet of debris-filled water for months.\n\nThe catastrophe began in December 1861, when nearly 15 feet of snow fell in the Sierra Nevada. Repetitive atmospheric rivers dropped warm rain for 43 days thereafter, dumping water down the mountainous slopes and into the valleys.\n\nFour thousand people lost their lives, one-third of the state’s property was destroyed, a quarter of California’s cattle population drowned or starved, and one in eight homes were a complete loss by floodwaters.\n\nIn addition, one-fourth of California’s economy was obliterated, resulting in a state-wide bankruptcy.\n\nSwain warns a megaflood like this will happen again, but worse and more frequent.\n\nDowntown Sacramento today, which was raised 10-15 feet after the historic floods. Melina Mara/The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\n“We find that climate change has already increased the risk of a (1862) megaflood scenario in California, but that future climate warming will likely bring about even sharper risk increases,” the study warns.\n\nMany of today’s major cities with millions of residents are built directly on top of the ancient flood deposits, Swain added, putting far more people in harm’s way.\n\nAbout 500,000 people lived in California in 1862. Now, the state’s population is over 39 million.\n\n“When this (flood) occurs again, the consequences would be wildly different than they were back in the 1860s,” Swain said.\n\nClimate change increases the amount of rain the atmosphere can hold and causes more water in the air to fall as rain, which can lead to immediate flooding. Both are and will continue to occur in California.\n\nThe new study shows a rapid increase in the likelihood of week-long, recurring strong-to-extreme atmospheric rivers during the cool season. An atmospheric river is a long, narrow region of heavy moisture in the atmosphere that can transport moisture thousands of miles, like a fire hose in the sky. They usually bring beneficial rainfall to drought-prone regions like California but could quickly become hazardous with a warming climate.\n\nHistorically these winter atmospheric rivers dump feet of snow in the Sierra Nevada, but as climate warms, more of the snow will fall as rain. Instead of melting slowly over time, it all runs off, piles up, and floods immediately.\n\nCalifornia's Central Valley, which produces one-fourth of the nation's food, will be ravaged by a megaflood. Citizen of the Planet/UCG/Universal Images Group/Getty Images\n\nWith a neighbor like the Pacific Ocean, California has “an infinite reservoir of water vapor offshore,” Swain added.\n\nCalifornia’s mountainous terrain and wildfire risk make it especially vulnerable to flooding. Lingering burn scars from wildfires can create a steep, slick surface for water and debris to flow off. With wildfires becoming larger and burning more area thanks to climate change, more areas are susceptible to these debris flows.\n\nAlthough models show this megaflood is inevitable, experts say there are ways to mitigate excessive loss.\n\n“I think the extent of (megaflood) losses can be significantly reduced by doing certain sorts of things to revamp our flood management and our water management systems and our disaster preparedness,” Swain said.\n\nHuang, a project scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research and a researcher involved in the study, said everyone can make a small effort in combating climate change.\n\n“If we work together to decrease future emissions, we can also reduce the risk of extreme events,” Huang said.", "authors": ["Payton Major Judson Jones", "Payton Major", "Judson Jones"], "publish_date": "2022/08/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/07/opinions/mars-food-agriculture-scn-opinion-hnk-spc-intl/index.html", "title": "Opinion: A Martian menu that could transform how we eat on Earth ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: Evan Fraser is director of Arrell Food Institute at the University of Guelph, Canada.

With space agencies including NASA and China’s National Space Administration hoping to send crewed missions to Mars within the next two decades, and tech billionaires like Elon Musk developing plans to colonize the red planet, feeding a Martian community would be a key question to solve.\n\nWith a round-trip taking over a year, Mars is much too far for takeout. And it costs $10,000 to lift a single pound of material off Earth, which means space explorers would not be able to bring their own supplies either. If humanity is ever to make it on the red planet, we will have to develop self-sustaining systems to produce food in one of the harshest environments imaginable.\n\nThe Curiosity rover discovered this rock, smaller than a penny, that resembles a flower or piece of coral within Gale Crater on February 24. The small pieces in this photo were created billions of years ago when minerals carried by water cemented the rock.

NASA/JPL-Caltech/Univ. of Arizona Cooled lava helped preserve a footprint of where dunes once moved across a southeastern region on Mars. But it also looks like the \"Star Trek\" symbol. NASA Although Mars isn't geologically active like Earth, surface features have been heavily shaped by wind. Wind-carved features such as these, called yardangs, are common on the red planet. On the sand, the wind forms ripples and small dunes. In Mars' thin atmosphere, light is not scattered much, so the shadows cast by the yardangs are sharp and dark. JPL-Caltech/University of Arizona/NASA These small, hematite-rich concretions are near Fram Crater, visited by NASA's Opportunity rover in April 2004. The area shown is 1.2 inches across. The view comes from the microscopic imager on Opportunity's robotic arm, with color information added from the rover's panoramic camera. These minerals suggest that Mars had a watery past. JPL-Caltech/Cornell/USGS/NASA This image shows seasonal flows in Valles Marineris on Mars, which are called recurring slope lineae, or RSL. These Martian landslides appear on slopes during the spring and summer. NASA/JPL-Caltech/Univ. of Arizona Mars is known to have planet-encircling dust storms. These 2001 images from NASA's Mars Global Surveyor orbiter show a dramatic change in the planet's appearance when haze raised by duststorm activity in the south became globally distributed. JPL-Caltech/MSSS/NASA This composite image, looking toward the higher regions of Mount Sharp, was taken in September 2015 by NASA's Curiosity rover. In the foreground is a long ridge teeming with hematite. Just beyond is an undulating plain rich in clay minerals. And just beyond that are a multitude of rounded buttes, all high in sulfate minerals. The changing mineralogy in these layers suggests a changing environment in early Mars, though all involve exposure to water billions of years ago. JPL-Caltech/MSSS/NASA InSight's seismometer recorded a \"marsquake\" for the first time in April 2019. NASA/JPL-Caltech From its perch high on a ridge, Opportunity recorded this 2016 image of a Martian dust devil twisting through the valley below.

Chasma Boreale is about the length of the United States' famous Grand Canyon and up to 1.2 miles deep. JPL-Caltech/MSSS/NASA A dramatic, fresh impact crater dominates this image taken by the HiRISE camera in November 2013. The crater spans approximately 100 feet and is surrounded by a large, rayed blast zone. Because the terrain where the crater formed is dusty, the fresh crater appears blue in the enhanced color of the image, due to removal of the reddish dust in that area.

NASA The best photos of Mars Prev Next\n\nPrepping a Martian meal would be be one of the most technically challenging problems our species has ever confronted. Off Earth, every molecule of water, every scrap of organic matter and every photon of energy is a vital resource that cannot be wasted. A community on Mars would be exposed to punishing radiation and temperatures that could range from minus 220 degrees Fahrenheit to 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Tasty and nutritious meals would be crucial to the psychological as well as the physical health of space pioneers.\n\nBut it would be worth the effort. The technology that would allow us to sustain life on Mars could help solve some of our most pressing problems.\n\nLet’s walk through our vision of what a resident of the red planet would eat on a typical day – and how the technology needed to produce that food could benefit life here on Earth.\n\nBreakfast\n\nCNN/Photo Illustration/Adobe Stock\n\nOur Martian starts their day with a high-protein chocolate chip breakfast bar, washed down with a cup of coffee.\n\nCoffee on Mars would be like coffee on Earth, either cheaper instant coffee (with artificial caffeine and flavor) or more expensive real beans that would be a luxury produced in a domed crater that serves as a giant greenhouse. Solar panels, filters and balloon-mounted mirrors would harvest what little sunlight makes it to Mars to illuminate the greenhouse, while screening out harmful radiation.\n\nThe real magic, however, is in the breakfast bar. It is made of algae grown in tanks filled with water that would be harvested by melting ice found in the Martian regolith (sandy soil). The algae would be fertilized with both locally mined minerals and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This high protein product would be bred to mimic the taste and texture of grains, such as oats, that are commonly found on the terrestrial breakfast table. Although eating algae may sound weird, many of us already consume spirulina, which is a blue-green algae (cyanobacteria) known for being highly nutritious.\n\nLunch\n\nCNN/Photo Illustration/Adobe Stock\n\nLunch takes place in the main cafeteria where every inch of spare space is filled with greenery, because a core design principle on Mars is to ensure that every photon of solar energy is used to grow plants. On the menu is a leafy salad tossed with plant-based protein cubes and seasoned with salty seaweed flakes, accompanied by a milkshake.\n\nThe salad greens are grown in hydroponic solutions under LED lights that are timed to ensure each plant gets the right wavelength of light, at the right intensity, and at the right moment to optimize growth. Most of these plants are cultivated underground, safe from radiation, in an atmosphere enriched with carbon dioxide (plants generally do better when carbon dioxide levels are a bit higher than is comfortable for humans).\n\nThe seaweed is grown in the tanks along with the algae that went into the breakfast bar.\n\nThe accompanying milkshake is made from dairy proteins produced in specially designed fermentation facilities that use microorganisms to convert starches and sugars into dairy products.\n\nMost of the technologies going into this lunch menu already exist. Today, vertical farms grow plants indoors and without sunlight in major cities around the world. Although the number of crops they currently produce is limited, within five years many more fruits and vegetables will be produced year-round indoors, regardless of location, helping to ensure food security.\n\nAnd climate-friendly, cow-free dairy products are already on supermarket shelves. For example, California-based Perfect Day uses fungi to make dairy protein that is molecularly identical to the whey protein in cow’s milk, and has been used to make cream cheese, yoghurt and ice cream.\n\nDinner\n\nCNN/Photo Illustration/Adobe Stock\n\nDinner begins with an appetizer of tomato and avocado garnished with seeds and nuts, followed by slices of salmon sashimi and boiled potatoes. For dessert, ice cream and small pastries are served alongside fresh berries. As an extravagance, there is even some Martian wine.\n\nThe veggies and berries come from the same vertical farms that produced the salad greens served for lunch, while the nuts, avocados and grapes for the wine come from the small number of tree crops planted in the greenhouses, which have different zones designed to mimic different biomes on Earth. Because trees take up more space and only produce a crop after a few years of growth, these delicacies are considered a luxury on Mars.\n\nThe sashimi comes from salmon stem cells, cultured in a lab on Earth and now grown in bioreactors until they are ready to be 3D printed into firm, tasty morsels. The potatoes are a throwback, produced the old-fashioned way in the greenhouse.\n\nBecause potato cultivation uses less space and fertilizer than grain crops like wheat and rice, the pastries served for dessert are also made from potato starch.\n\nAll the technologies that support dinner are well underway on Earth today – for example, California-based startup Wildtype is creating sushi-grade salmon by cultivating cells extracted from salmon eggs.\n\nBut cellular agriculture is still in the early stages of becoming commercially viable – at present, Singapore is the only country to have approved cell-based meat for consumer consumption. We don’t yet produce it at scale and more research is needed to develop cost-effective growth mediums that the rapidly growing cells need. There’s also a lot of work to be done identifying and cultivating the stem cell lines needed to make the different types of muscle and fat responsible for the taste and texture of a good piece of meat.\n\nEvening snack\n\nCNN/Photo Illustration/Adobe Stock\n\nMost of us crave a bit of comfort food late in the day, so we imagine our future space explorers will need to kick back a bit too – with a few deep-fried salty protein balls and either a carbonated beverage or a distilled potato-based vodka drink.\n\nBack to Earth\n\nRight now, we desperately need to find new ways to feed people here on Earth because our food systems are a mess. Food production is responsible for one third of all human-made global greenhouse gas emissions and uses more land and water than any other human activity, while also being the biggest source of water pollution. Feeding the Earth’s human population comes at the expense of biodiversity, driving species extinction and habitat loss. Yet at the same time, a third of the world’s food is wasted. Malnutrition, obesity and hunger are all rising.\n\nWorking towards establishing a community on Mars is likely to give us tools that help to solve some of these problems. Everything – habitable space, water and plant nutrients – will be scarce on Mars, which means that feeding a city on the red planet will teach us how to become much more efficient on Earth.\n\nBut the technologies aren’t a panacea and the benefits of building a Martian food system go beyond innovations like cellular meat. This is because, ironically, building a city on Mars would also help us reconnect to the logics of nature. On Earth, nature works in cycles. A leaf falls from a tree, decomposes, and returns to the soil where it helps to grow another leaf. But Earth-agriculture no longer follows such cycles; instead, we consume resources and create waste.\n\nA food system on Mars cannot work this way. On Mars, fermentation facilities would be fed using starches and cellulose left over after food plants have been harvested and processed. Every scrap of organic waste will be carefully composted and fed back into the production process, creating a circular food system such that the waste products from one step immediately become inputs for another.\n\nAs we develop advanced food production technologies, and design closed-loop food systems capable of feeding Mars, we are also developing the technologies and skills needed to rework the food system here on Earth.\n\nBy launching humans to another planet, we can learn to save our own.", "authors": ["Evan Fraser Lenore Newman", "Evan Fraser", "Lenore Newman"], "publish_date": "2022/10/07"}]}

The King and The Queen Consort will remain at Balmoral this evening and will return to London tomorrow,” the royal family said in a statement posted on its official Twitter account, referring to Charles as the new King for the first time.\n\nThe King said in a statement that the Queen’s death was “a moment of the greatest sadness for me and all members of my family.”\n\n“We mourn profoundly the passing of a cherished Sovereign and a much-loved Mother. I know her loss will be deeply felt throughout the country, the Realms and the Commonwealth, and by countless people around the world,” he said in the statement.\n\nCrowds of mourners gathered outside Balmoral Castle and other royal residences, despite heavy downpours in parts of the UK on Thursday evening. Many brought flowers and lit candles, some looking visibly shaken by the news.\n\nIn keeping with the royal tradition, a written statement announcing the Queen’s death was displayed on the gates of Buckingham Palace. In a striking moment just after the official announcement was made, the heavy rain battering London stopped and a large double rainbow appeared over the palace.\n\nFollow live updates here.\n\nElizabeth ascended to the throne in 1952, on the death of her father, King George VI.

The Queen’s daughter, Princess Anne, known as the Princess Royal, was already there.\n\nPrince William, who is now the heir apparent to the throne, arrived at Balmoral Thursday afternoon together with the Queen’s other two sons, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward, as well as Edward’s wife Sophie, the Countess of Wessex.\n\nPrince William and his wife Catherine have taken on the title of Duke and Duchess of Cornwall, according to their official Twitter account.

A photograph from the audience showed the monarch smiling, standing in the drawing room in Balmoral, carrying a walking stick. Truss is the 15th – and the last – British Prime Minister to be appointed by Elizabeth.\n\nThere have been concerns over the Queen’s health ever since a brief hospital stay last October. She has experienced episodic mobility issues, which have at times caused her to withdraw from official engagements.\n\nBut those concerns grew deeper on Wednesday when Buckingham Palace announced the Queen had postponed a virtual meeting of her Privy Council after being advised by doctors to rest.\n\nOn Thursday, the palace announced that the Queen was under medical supervision, but said she was “comfortable” at Balmoral. As her children rushed to her side during the day, it became clear the situation was serious.\n\nHer death comes seven months after the Queen marked the 70th anniversary of her accession to the throne. The UK officially celebrated the platinum jubilee in June with days of pomp and pageantry and she made several public appearances in London.\n\nGlobal tributes\n\nMessages of condolences started pouring in from around the world immediately after the announcement was made, underscoring the global impact the Queen had made during her 70-year reign.\n\nSpeaking outside Downing Street on Thursday, Truss said the Queen’s death was “a huge shock to the nation and to the world.”\n\n“Queen Elizabeth II was the rock on which modern Britain was built,” the new prime minister said. “Our country has grown and flourished under her reign.”\n\nScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon paid tribute to Queen Elizabeth II, saying she was “loved and admired” by the people of Scotland.\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General António Guterres described the Queen as a “good friend” of the UN, adding: “She was a reassuring presence throughout decades of sweeping change, including the decolonization of Africa and Asia and the evolution of the Commonwealth.”\n\nPope Francis also mourned the Queen’s death, praising her “steadfast witness of faith in Jesus Christ” in an open letter to King Charles III.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said it was “with the heaviest of hearts” that Canada learned of the monarch’s passing, while Australia’s PM Anthony Albanese praised the Queen’s devotion to “duty, family, faith and service.”\n\nNew Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said in a national address that the Queen had come to define “notions of service, charity, and consistency.”\n\nThe Queen was the head of state in Canada, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nUS President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden called the Queen a “steadying presence.”\n\n“Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II was more than a monarch. She defined an era,” they said in a statement.\n\nPresident of Ireland Michael D. Higgins said the country had lost “a remarkable friend.”\n\n“Her Majesty served the British people with exceptional dignity. Her personal commitment to her role and extraordinary sense of duty were the hallmarks of her period as Queen, which will hold a unique place in British history,” Higgins said. In a hugely symbolic moment in 2011, the Queen became the first British monarch to make a state visit to the Republic of Ireland.\n\nNumerous kings, queens and royal families of other countries have also sent messages of sympathy.

Jonathan Brady/Pool/AFP/Getty Images In pictures: Britain's King Charles III Prev Next\n\nThe moment Elizabeth II died, her eldest child, Charles, automatically became monarch. As sovereign, he has chosen to take the name King Charles III.\n\nAll rights and responsibilities of the Crown now rest with King Charles III.\n\nHe becomes head of state not just in the UK but in 14 other Commonwealth realms including Australia and Canada. He will become head of the 56-member Commonwealth, although that is not a hereditary position, after his succession to the role was agreed by Commonwealth leaders at a meeting in London in 2018.\n\nHe has become head of the British Armed Forces, the judiciary and the civil service, and he is the Supreme Governor of the Church of England. He is the Fount of Honour, which means all honors, such as knighthoods, will now be given in his name.\n\nThe United Kingdom does not have a codified constitution, so the role of monarchy is defined by convention rather than law. He has a duty to remain politically impartial, which means he will come under greater scrutiny if he continues to express the views he is known for.\n\nHe has championed alternative medicines and organic farming techniques. In 1984, he hit out at the “glass stumps and concrete towers” of modern architecture. He has spent decades warning of the dangers of climate change. In the so-called “black spider” memos, he raised the issues he was concerned about directly with ministers.\n\nIn a BBC documentary to mark his 70th birthday, Charles acknowledged having ruffled feathers with his past interventions. But he promised not to meddle in controversial affairs once sovereign, saying he would operate within “the constitutional parameters.”\n\nElizabeth stayed “above politics” and never expressed herself in any way on any issue and as a result she rarely divided opinion. She managed to retain popular support and cross-party support in parliament, which was the one body with the power to dethrone her.\n\nWe will never know what she discussed in her regular audiences with her prime ministers, beginning with Churchill, but Charles is a more outspoken character. Will he go quiet on policy matters in public but continue to lobby in private? Will the prime minister act on it?\n\nThe prime ministerial audiences are one of several constitutional duties to which King Charles III will be expected to step up and they will bring him in regular contact with policymakers. He appoints the prime minister, opens parliamentary sessions, approves legislation and official appointments, receives the credentials of foreign ambassadors and hosts world leaders on state visits.\n\nCharles has also adopted the symbolic position as Head of Nation, meaning he becomes the symbol of national identity, unity, and pride. He represents continuity and celebrates excellence on behalf of the country. That’s why we see the monarch opening national events and leading commemorations.\n\nPeople would look to Elizabeth in times of crisis, but will they rally around King Charles III in the same way? He is more divisive not just because of his honest views but also because of the bad taste still left from his acrimonious divorce from his immensely popular first wife, Diana.\n\nAll the official royal residences including Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle will now be under his control. There are also other residences such as Balmoral in Scotland and Sandringham in Norfolk which the Queen owned privately – and the nation will have to see to whom she leaves them in her will.\n\nEither way, Charles’ wealth has ballooned. By far the biggest slice of the family’s fortune, the £16.5 billion ($19 billion) Crown Estate, now belongs to him as reigning monarch. But under an arrangement dating back to 1760, the monarch hands over all profits from the estate to the government in return for a slice, called the Sovereign Grant.\n\nThe estate includes vast swathes of central London property and the seabed around England, Wales and Northern Ireland. It has the status of a corporation and is managed by a chief executive and commissioners — or non-executive directors — appointed by the monarch on the recommendation of the prime minister.\n\nThe grant, which covers the cost of his official duties and amounted to £86.3 million ($99.2 million) for the 2021/2022 financial year. He will take charge of the Royal Collection, which includes one of the most valuable art collections in the world. He also picks up the Duchy of Lancaster, a private estate dating back to 1265, which was valued at about £653 million ($764 million) according to its most recent accounts. Income from its investments cover official costs not met by the Sovereign Grant, and helps support other Royal family members.\n\nKing Charles III has become one of the richest men in England overnight.\n\nCamilla\n\nCharles and Camilla attend the Order of the Garter Service at St George's Chapel on June 13, 2022 in Windsor, England. Toby Melville/Getty Images\n\nFor years, the big question around Charles’ wife surrounded her title. At the time their wedding was announced in February 2005, the official statement said: “It is intended that Mrs Parker Bowles should use the title HRH The Princess Consort when The Prince of Wales accedes to The Throne.” That was a very clear signal that Camilla would not use the title of Queen. Her office at Clarence House distanced itself from that statement in the intervening years, however, saying it was a matter for the reigning monarch.\n\nThen, in February 2022, the Queen expressed her desire for her daughter-in-law to be known as Queen Consort when Charles became King in a message marking the start of her platinum jubilee year – a statement that appeared to resolve the issue for good.\n\nThe Queen’s wishes were welcomed by the couple themselves. That same weekend, a statement released by a spokesperson said they had been “touched and honoured by Her Majesty’s words.”\n\nWhere will the couple live? Well, traditionally the new monarch would move into Buckingham Palace but in 2011, the BBC reported that Charles was considering moving his entire court to Windsor and turning Buckingham Palace into an events center. That would be a dramatic and controversial shift but might also assert King Charles III as the new boss.\n\nWilliam and Catherine\n\nWilliam and Catherine are pictured with their children, George, Charlotte and Louis, and the Queen, Charles and Camilla at Buckingham Palace during platinum jubilee celebrations on June 5, 2022. Toby Hancock/CNN\n\nUp until now, Charles has been responsible for covering the costs of his heir, Prince William.\n\nWilliam has now inherited his father’s titles of The Duke of Cornwall, which comes with an estate which last year delivered an income of £23 million ($26 million). That money now goes straight to William and he becomes independently wealthy.\n\nHis new title is HRH The Duke of Cornwall and Cambridge and tradition dictates that, as first in line to the throne, he also becomes Prince of Wales. And Catherine becomes Her Royal Highness, The Princess of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall and Cambridge.\n\nWilliam and Catherine will be able to solidify their own independent court, which is currently based at Kensington Palace in west London, in an apartment that was refurbished shortly after their marriage. It seems unlikely that William would want to move, so the King’s former residences, including Clarence House and Birkhall in the Scottish Highlands, will likely remain vacant until Charles offers them to other members of the family, or finds an alternative use. The family resides at Adelaide Cottage in Windsor during school term time.\n\nPrince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis will follow their parents’ titling. They are now Their Royal Highnesses Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis of Cornwall and Cambridge. Colloquially they are likely to be known as George, Charlotte and Louis Wales.\n\nHarry and Meghan\n\nMeghan, Duchess of Sussex and Prince Harry react as they attend the annual One Young World Summit in Manchester, north-west England on September 5, 2022. Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIt’s unlikely that Charles’ second son, Harry, will be offered a royal office unless he and wife Meghan return to their royal duties, and the King would also need to confirm that they can continue to use Frogmore Cottage on the Windsor estate, which is part of the royal estate. They currently live with son Archie and daughter Lilibet in California but were allowed to continue using Frogmore as their official residence during the Queen’s reign.\n\nWhen Harry and Meghan announced in early 2020 that they were stepping back from royal duties, they said they would “work to become financially independent.” The terms of the split stipulated that while the pair would always remain part of the family, they would no longer use their HRH titles.\n\nAs grandchildren of the monarch, Archie now automatically becomes Prince Archie of Sussex while Lilibet will be Princess Lilibet of Sussex. Whether they use those titles will only become known the first time their parents refer to them publicly.\n\nPrince Andrew and other family members\n\nKing Charles III also becomes responsible for distributing roles, responsibilities and resources to other members of the royal family.\n\nCharles has never been close to his brother Andrew, who stepped back from royal duties over his links to the late disgraced financier, Jeffrey Epstein. In January 2022 he was stripped of his HRH title, as well as others associated with the military and charity roles. That raises the question of whether the new King continues to allow Andrew to use his Buckingham Palace apartment and offers financial support.\n\nThen there are his other siblings, Princess Anne and Prince Edward, and more distant relatives such as the Gloucesters and Kents who retain royal residences at Kensington.\n\nPrincess Anne attends a service at St Giles' Cathedral on June 30, 2022 in Edinburgh, Scotland. Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images\n\nCharles will need to decide how much family support he needs to carry out his duties and who he wants to offer it. Then he can reveal what support he offers in return. Many of these decisions would already have been taken and the first telling signs of where his loyalties lie will be seen in who gets to keep which residences and especially who gets an upgrade.\n\nAnne and Edward, and his wife Sophie, The Countess of Wessex, are expected to continue with their public duties following decades of dedicated service but the new King needs to balance that against pressure for a slimmed down monarchy in austere times.\n\nTo get updates on the British Royal Family sent to your inbox, sign up for CNN’s Royal News newsletter.", "authors": ["Max Foster"], "publish_date": "2022/09/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2022/09/08/queen-elizabeth-ii-dies-britain-longest-reigning-monarch/6353505001/", "title": "Queen Elizabeth II dead at 96, Prince Charles takes throne as king", "text": "Maria Puente and Jeff Stinson\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nThe longest-ever reign of Queen Elizabeth II, the only monarch most of her subjects have ever known, is over. Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor died Thursday at Balmoral Castle, her estate in Scotland. She was 96.\n\nThe palace issued a black-bordered statement about 6.30 p.m. local time: \"The Queen died peacefully at Balmoral this afternoon. The King and The Queen Consort will remain at Balmoral this evening and will return to London tomorrow.\"\n\nHer eldest son and heir, Prince Charles, Prince of Wales, 73, immediately became King Charles III upon her death. His wife became Queen Consort Camilla.\n\nBuckingham Palace issued another black-bordered statement from \"His Majesty the King,\" shortly after her death.\n\n\"The death of my beloved Mother, Her Majesty The Queen, is a moment of the greatest sadness for me and all members of my family,\" the statement said. \"We mourn profoundly the passing of a cherished Sovereign and a much-loved Mother. I know her loss will be deeply felt throughout the country, the Realms and the Commonwealth, and by countless people around the world.\n\n\"During this period of mourning and change, my family and I will be comforted and sustained by our knowledge of the respect and deep affection in which The Queen was so widely held.\"\n\nAs the 41st monarch since William the Conqueror in 1066, Elizabeth was the symbol of stability as Britain and its 1,000-year-old monarchy sailed through roiling storms of the modern age, including a deadly pandemic.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II died 'peacefully' under medical supervision:William, Harry traveled to be by her side\n\nElizabeth enjoyed robust health most of her life, but lingering “mobility issues” affected her in recent months. She increasingly handed over duties to Charles, from the recreational to the constitutional. Last week, she couldn't attend the annual Highland Games, the Braemar Gathering, which she never missed throughout her reign.\n\nOn Tuesday she presided over the transition of one prime minister to a new one, a constitutional duty as head of state which took place at Balmoral for the first time in her reign.\n\nBut on Wednesday, the palace announced she would not be able to attend via Zoom the meeting of the Privy Council, the standing committee of senior governmental advisers, after doctors' orders to rest.\n\nShe also missed significant appearances in June during the four days of celebration of her Platinum Jubilee of 70 years on the throne.\n\nThe world reacts:King Charles III expresses 'greatest sadness' over mother Queen Elizabeth II's death\n\nIn February, two weeks after marking the 70 anniversary of her ascension to the throne in 1952, the palace announced she had tested positive for COVID-19. During an audience in mid-February, the queen mentioned to her visitors that she had difficulty \"moving,\" leading to \"ongoing mobility\" issues, as Buckingham Palace put it, that prevented some appearances, including the State Opening of Parliament on May 10.\n\nShe had missed this important head-of-state role only twice before during her reign, both for pregnancies, but for the first time she officially delegated Charles to stand in for her, accompanied by his elder son, Prince William.\n\nShe was preceded in death by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, her husband of 73 years, who died April 9, 2021, at Windsor Castle at age 99, just short of his 100th birthday. He was Britain's oldest and longest-serving royal spouse in 10 centuries.\n\nHis funeral yielded poignant pictures of the queen, alone and masked, in St. George's Chapel at Windsor for a sublime service attended by only 30 members of his family amid COVID-19 restrictions. At the end of March, she appeared in public for her first major in-person gathering since her COVID-19 diagnosis, leading her family, dozens of foreign royals and hundreds of Britain's great and good in a service of thanksgiving for the life of her late husband at Westminster Abbey.\n\n► Stay up to date with the latest on King Charles III and the royal succession with our newsletter Keep Calm and Carry On. Sign up here.\n\nThe death of a monarch is followed by a flurry of rituals, including an address to the nation by the new king and by the prime minister, followed by long-established funeral plans carried out with military precision.\n\nFor now, however, Britain prepared to mourn.\n\nThe plans include a funeral worthy of the devout and dutiful woman who pledged herself at age 21 in service to her nation and never wavered as the living symbol of the British people.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II's historic reign\n\nShe reigned, never ruled, as Britain's head of state and constitutional figurehead for decades. She acceded to the throne on Feb. 6, 1952, when her father, King George VI, died at age 56. She was just 25.\n\nHaving celebrated her Diamond Jubilee of 60 years on the throne in 2012, she was the U.K.'s oldest monarch ever, and the longest-serving, surpassing her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria, who reigned 63 years and died in 1901.\n\nMore than half the people alive in Britain today have known no other monarch on their throne, their coins, their bank notes and their stamps. A modest, even shy girl, she became the most famous woman in the world, the most photographed and depicted human being in history, who met and shook hands with an estimated 4 million people or more during her reign.\n\nShe inherited a sun-never-sets empire just starting to disintegrate, then presided over its final collapse into a Commonwealth of nations that looked to her as its leader, and to which she was deeply committed to the end. She was Britain's stiff upper lip during the 20th-century post-World War II recovery, the last gasps of the empire, the Cold War and the war on terrorism.\n\nIn her colorful hats and her sturdy sensible shoes, her ever-present handbag on her arm, she was a constant through kaleidoscope changes as the 20th century roared into the 21st: the growth of television, Beatlemania, Britain's demographic transformation to a multi-ethnic society, and the rise of a celebrity culture that ensnared nearly every member of her family.\n\nShe adapted to changing times by changing – and yet not changing on the important things, such as maintaining a dignified silence – while embracing the internet age with a palace website, Facebook and Twitter accounts, and even a royal channel on YouTube.\n\nShe was stoic and carried on through the antics and scandals of members of her family. Most recently, she had to weather the public downfall of her son Prince Andrew for his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, which later led in an embarrassing civil lawsuit accusing him of sexual abuse. And her grandson Prince Harry's decision to move to America with his wife, Meghan, and leave royal life behind resulted in months of recriminations further inflamed by accusations of racism (hotly denied) in the royal family.\n\nWhen it was necessary, she shed her usual reserve. She presided over the heart-rending 1997 funeral of her former daughter-in-law, Princess Diana, the \"people's princess.\" She did it – despite her desire to protect Charles and Diana's two sons – to save the standing of the monarchy from a grief-maddened populace enraged by what seemed to be royal coldness and detachment in the wake of Diana's death in a car crash in Paris.\n\nIf the queen seemed occasionally out of step with the accelerating changes, she redeemed herself and the monarchy by adjusting, and she gained new popularity and admiration in her later years. Always deeply respected, she was beloved by the time she reached 80, helped partly by the release of the film \"The Queen.\" Dame Helen Mirren's transcendent performance as Her Majesty won her the Academy Award for best actress in 2007, and her tribute in her acceptance speech is as apt a eulogy as any.\n\n\"For 50 years and more, Elizabeth Windsor has maintained her dignity, her sense of duty – and her hairstyle,\" Mirren said in her acceptance speech. \"She has had her feet planted firmly on the ground, her hat on her head and her handbag on her arm. She has weathered many, many storms. And I salute her courage and her consistency.\"\n\nWhat happens to the monarchy after Queen Elizabeth's death?\n\nBiographers point to the queen's devotion to duty as her most important personal and professional characteristic, raising questions about whether the monarchy can survive long without her. Even foes of the monarchy, known as republicans in Britain, acknowledged they admired her. They see the monarchy as a hereditary institution wrapped in wealth and privilege that has no place in a modern democratic society; they credit her with not only saving it but making it more popular than ever.\n\nKing Charles III takes over:What happens to the other royals under new slimmed-down monarchy?\n\n\"She will be remembered for keeping the British monarchy going through the 20th and into the 21st century – and for leaving it in better shape,\" says Robert Lacey, the British historian and biographer who has written four books on the queen. \"She was imbued with a great sense of duty and responsibility. In the long run, that would be a strength and her charm.\"\n\nElizabeth's sense of duty was established early in her life during the monarchy's worst modern crisis: the abdication of the throne by her uncle, King Edward VIII, in 1936. The abdication shocked Britain, especially after the government and palace had kept the crisis out of the headlines until almost the day it happened. From the perspective of commoners and dukes alike, the former king was seen as shirking his duty and turning his back on his country.\n\nThe profound effect on 10-year-old Elizabeth, Lacey says, is that from then on duty was her watchword. Unlike Edward, the queen swore to never abandon the role she was thrust into by chance of birth and thus throw the monarchy and nation into crisis.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II's early life\n\nShe was unlikely to be queen when born the first child of Prince Albert (Bertie) and the former Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, the Duke and Duchess of York, on April 21, 1926, at her parents' townhouse in London. Her father's eldest brother, known in the family as David, was the Prince of Wales and heir to the throne after his father, and her grandfather, George V. Although single when he became Edward VIII in January 1936, he was still young enough to marry and have children.\n\nElizabeth spent her early years in quiet family life, largely at family estates in the country, where she developed a lifelong affinity for horses and dogs, especially Welsh corgis. That bucolic life was shattered after Edward quit the throne in December 1936 to marry Wallis Simpson, a twice-divorced American.\n\nCamilla's new title, explained:What's the difference between queen and 'Queen Consort'?\n\nThe abdication thrust Elizabeth's father to the throne as George VI (he took the name to honor his father), which made Elizabeth heiress presumptive and the likely next monarch. So she became a queen in training under the tutelage of her father and her austere paternal grandmother, Queen Mary.\n\nShe made her first public speech at age 14 in 1940 on BBC Radio, speaking to children, like her, who were being evacuated to safety from the London Blitz in World War II. Two years later, she got her first military appointment, colonel-in-chief of the Grenadier Guards.\n\n'I remain committed to serving you':Queen Elizabeth II's most memorable, poignant quotes\n\nOver the years, her official duties increased, giving her a taste of what was expected of her in charitable work and as figurehead of the British government and military. She became head of children's hospitals. She toured Scotland with her parents. She even became a licensed military driver in 1945 toward the end of the war.\n\nAlthough she and her younger sister, Princess Margaret Rose, spent much of the war years in the safety of Windsor Castle, they and their parents helped rally the British in the brutal effort to win the war against the Nazis. When Britain succeeded, the country was nearly bankrupt but also deeply bonded to the royal family for their roles.\n\nOn her 21st birthday, during a visit to South Africa, then still part of the empire, Princess Elizabeth addressed the British people by radio, vowing that her life, \"whether it be long or short,\" would be dedicated to serving the nation and the imperial family, now known as the Commonwealth. In 1977, celebrating her Silver Jubilee of 25 years on the throne, she told the nation that though her vow was made \"in my salad days, when I was green in judgment, I do not regret nor retract one word of it.\"\n\nFamily life was at times tumultuous\n\nIn 1947, Elizabeth married her distant cousin, Philip (she was the first British monarch to celebrate a diamond wedding anniversary), the exiled Greek prince raised mostly in Britain who was an officer in the Royal Navy and with whom she had been in love since she was 13 and he was 18.\n\nIn contrast to the 1981 fairy-tale extravaganza wedding of Charles to the former Lady Diana Spencer, Elizabeth's wedding was simple. With the country still recovering from the war, she collected ration coupons for her dress like other young brides of the time, which further endeared her to the public.\n\nThe wedding in Westminster Abbey helped lift some of the gloom that fell over London after the war, and soon there were two children to celebrate: Charles, the heir, and Princess Anne, now the Princess Royal. Her early years as a wife and mother were her happiest; then her father died in his sleep while she was on holiday in Kenya. She flew home a queen, somber but composed.\n\nShe was crowned a year later, on June 2, 1953, by this time royally trained for her job, ready for the responsibilities, accepting of the fact that her life and her family's life would never be the same again.\n\nAs a queen, Elizabeth has been an unqualified success. As a mother, not always. She suffered grief and ridicule as head of a modern, often dysfunctional royal family trapped in public expectations of Victorian-era values.\n\nCharles was born in 1948, followed by Anne in 1950. Andrew and Edward came much later, in 1960 and 1964.\n\nThe queen always wanted a large family but put it off because duty came first, biographer Lacey says. Hers was never a warm and fuzzy persona, he says, and her cool aloofness may have carried over into family life.\n\nCharles told his biographer, Jonathan Dimbleby, in 1994 that the queen was an absentee mother. She was off being queen and he was left with nannies, he said. Andrew and Edward, however, insisted they weren't starved for motherly attention. \"They made it clear they thought their mother had been absolutely marvelous,\" Lacey says.\n\nStill, her children were the chief source of distress in the most painful year of her life, 1992, what she called her \"annus horribilis,\" when the marriages of three of her children collapsed, accompanied by reams of scandalous tabloid headlines.\n\nThen, on Nov. 20, 1992, the queen's beloved Windsor Castle burned for 15 hours; 100 rooms were damaged or destroyed. \"It was symbolic of what was happening to the house of Windsor,\" Lacey says.\n\nTaxes paid to restore the castle because it was state property but Elizabeth opened parts of Buckingham Palace to the public the following year, and tourist receipts helped offset the costs.\n\nThen, things got worse. The death of the then-divorced Diana in a car crash in Paris on Aug. 31, 1997, threatened the queen's standing and that of the monarchy more than any time of her reign.\n\nWhile the queen's weeping subjects piled flowers waist-high outside Buckingham Palace and Diana's home at Kensington Palace in London, the royal family kept their grief under wraps as they holed up on their annual summer holiday at Balmoral, their estate in Scotland.\n\nThe queen's instinctive need to grieve privately was seen as out of sentimental step with a nation that wanted an unprecedented public display of sorrow and respect. At that moment, the queen's renowned sense of public sentiment eluded her. Her stiff upper lip, and the monarchy, seemed frozen in a distant time.\n\nOn the advice of then-new but savvy Prime Minister Tony Blair and others, the queen was persuaded to return to London to speak to the nation in a rare televised address. At the funeral the next day, when Diana's casket passed her standing outside the palace, she bowed her head.\n\nWith that simple gesture, the queen began turning public opinion.\n\nEsteem for the queen grew as years passed and a lifetime of official engagements stacked one on top of another. By the time of her Diamond Jubilee in 2012, according to Buckingham Palace, she had conferred more than 404,500 awards and honors; hosted 1.5 million people at garden parties and another 50,000 people a year at banquets, lunches, dinners and receptions; met 11 U.S. presidents (13 as of 2021); hosted 102 state visits in London; traveled on 325 overseas visits, including 96 state visits, to 150 countries; sent more than 540,000 telegrams to couples in the U.K. and Commonwealth celebrating a diamond wedding anniversary; served as patron to more than 620 charities or organizations; sat for 129 official portraits; and launched 23 ships. She also owned 30 corgis since 1944, and her horses won nearly every major race in Britain.\n\nDespite her calculated royal distance from the public – she never gave an interview, and people who met her were encouraged not to divulge what she said, which was usually innocuous anyway – the queen had become a familiar mother figure to her family of subjects.\n\n\"I think it's because we are comfortable with her,\" says Ingrid Seward, a veteran royals observer, biographer and editor of Majesty magazine, as the queen's popularity soared in her later years. \"We can sympathize with all that she has gone through. We know that the queen is always looking out for us. We really respect her.\"\n\nDuring her later years, foes of the monarchy acknowledged they would never be able to abolish the throne as long as the queen was alive. Public admiration for her was just too great, conceded Graham Smith of Republic, Britain's loudest advocacy group for scrapping the monarchy.\n\nThat's because the queen went about her job and avoided controversy, Smith says. Although every prime minister starting with Winston Churchill briefed her nearly every Tuesday during her reign, Elizabeth stayed above politics, never giving a hint of her political leanings or signaling publicly which prime minister she liked best.\n\nSerious debate about getting rid of the royals will come only under a monarch less astute, less admired and more gaffe-prone than Elizabeth on the throne, Smith says. \"Her most enduring quality was her ability to hold onto power.\"\n\nLacey considers that a fitting tribute to a woman who devoted her life to performing a role she didn't choose.\n\n\"In the end,\" Lacey says, \"she triumphed.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/08/europe/queen-elizabeth-ii-life-obituary-intl/index.html", "title": "The life of Elizabeth II: The British Queen who weathered war and ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nQueen Elizabeth II, who has died age 96 after the longest reign in British history, will be mourned around the globe as one of the last monarchs born to a classic age of European royalty, when kings and queens wielded genuine political power.\n\nElizabeth’s death comes seven months after she marked the 70th anniversary of her accession to the throne, yet another milestone achievement in the remarkable life of a queen who, though reluctantly thrust into the spotlight at a young age, won almost universal praise for her steadfast dedication to duty.\n\nHer long reign saw Britain transformed from a war-weary declining imperial power into a modern multi-cultural state that rarely looked to its monarch for leadership, but still held her in high esteem.\n\nAnd while it witnessed its fair share of joy – not least the 2011 marriage of the Queen’s grandson Prince William to Catherine Middleton, and the birth of their three children – Elizabeth’s rule also weathered many storms, both public and personal, as the monarchy tried to keep pace with changing times.\n\nElizabeth Alexandra Mary was born in 1926, the first child of the Duke and Duchess of York.\n\nBut she didn’t become heir presumptive to the throne until 1937, when her father was crowned King George VI after the scandalous abdication of his older brother – events dramatized in the Oscar-winning film “The King’s Speech” and hit Netflix show “The Crown.”\n\nWartime freedoms\n\nAs World War II erupted, Elizabeth was quietly groomed for statehood.\n\nWhile living out the Blitz on London in nearby Windsor Castle, she was privately tutored in matters of constitution by Henry Marten, an eccentric yet respected teacher who reputedly kept a pet raven in his study.\n\nShe began taking tentative steps into public life in 1940 when, aged 14, she made her first radio broadcast: a speech to children displaced by the conflict. At 16, she was made an honorary colonel of the Grenadier Guards, a British army infantry regiment.\n\nPrincess Elizabeth is pictured in 1945 standing by an Auxiliary Territorial Service first aid truck wearing an officer's uniform. Keystone/Hulton Royals Collection/Getty Images\n\nWartime offered her certain freedoms beyond the traditional constraints of royal life.\n\nIn 1945 she joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service and spent four weeks getting her hands covered in oil and grease as she learned to drive and maintain military vehicles.\n\nWhen victory was declared in Europe, a uniformed Elizabeth mingled with jubilant crowds outside Buckingham Palace.\n\nPeacetime brought the return of Lieutenant Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark, a handsome young naval officer who had, by all accounts, won her heart when she was just 13. The pair married in Westminster Abbey in 1947. Their first son, Charles, was born just over a year later.\n\nA youthful monarch\n\nWith her father’s health in rapid decline, Elizabeth began accepting more official duties, taking his place at the annual “Trooping the Colour” military parade in 1949.\n\nIn 1952, while Elizabeth and Philip were on an official trip to Kenya, news came of her father’s death.\n\nShe was now Queen.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh wave at the crowds from the balcony at Buckingham Palace after her coronation, on June 2, 1953. Keystone/Hulton Royals Collection/Getty Images\n\nThe next decade saw the young monarch settle into her role. After her coronation in 1953, she embarked on numerous official overseas trips, oversaw state openings of parliament, welcomed visiting leaders such as Dwight Eisenhower, Charles de Gaulle and Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev, and toured a coal mine.\n\nThese international forays came even as the disintegration of Britain’s empire hastened. India had gained independence from its colonial power in 1947, before Elizabeth became Queen. Dozens more were to follow suit over the following decades, across Africa, Asia and the Caribbean. By the time of her death, Elizabeth was head of state in 14 countries besides the UK.\n\nThe Queen meanwhile embraced her role as Head of the Commonwealth, visiting almost all of its member states – starting with a lengthy Commonwealth tour in 1953 and 1954.\n\nIn 1964, the Queen became a mother for the fourth time as new son Edward joined Charles and fellow siblings Anne and Andrew. There was, however, barely any let-up in her busy schedule.\n\nBy the arrival of her third decade on the throne, she was in her element. Prince Charles was embarking on a military career, Princess Anne, an acclaimed horsewoman, was married – drawing huge crowds of well-wishers.\n\nWhile indulging in her own equestrian pursuits, she continued to throw herself into public life, clocking up dozens of overseas tours and official visits around the UK – one of which, in 1976, saw her become one of the first people to send an email.\n\nThere were family problems when her sister’s marriage collapsed, and constitutional issues as debate grew among Commonwealth countries about the role of the monarch, but these failed to dampen celebrations to mark the silver jubilee of her reign in 1977.\n\nAnother royal wedding followed in 1981 when Prince Charles married Lady Diana Spencer at London’s St Paul’s Cathedral. Millions of people around the world watched the ceremony on television, happily unaware it would usher in the most turbulent period yet of the Queen’s life.\n\nDivorce, fire and Diana’s death\n\nThe Queen’s 40th year on the throne, 1992, marked her lowest moment as three royal marriages fell apart. Princess Anne and Mark Philips divorced, Charles and Diana separated after claims of infidelities while Sarah Ferguson, Prince Andrew’s wife, was photographed topless with an American financial manager.\n\nTo cap it all, a huge fire ripped through Windsor Castle, causing major structural damage. In the wake of the blaze, a furor broke out when it was suggested that public money be used to fund the restoration.\n\nThis year was not one “on which I shall look back with undiluted pleasure,” the Queen said in a speech later. “In the words of one of my more sympathetic correspondents, it has turned out to be an annus horribilis.”\n\nThese problems overshadowed the Queen as she made an historic visit to meet South African President Nelson Mandela in 1995, but criticism reached new heights in the wake of Diana’s tragic death in 1997, when the royals were accused of being aloof and out of touch amid widespread public outpourings of grief.\n\nThis marked a turning point.\n\nAfter days of silence, the Queen returned to London, talked to mourners and admitted there were lessons to be learned from Diana’s life. The gestures struck a chord with the public and criticism ebbed away.\n\nBritain's Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip view the floral tributes to Diana, Princess of Wales, at London's Buckingham Palace, on September 5, 1997. Pool/AP\n\nAfter Diana, the Queen’s popularity rebounded as she presided over what appeared to be a softer, more accessible and thoroughly modern royal family.\n\nThis was evident in 2005 when, to public approval, she assented to the previously unthinkable marriage of Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles. It was capped eight years later when Britain’s parliament ended the principle of men taking precedence over women in the line of succession to the throne.\n\nShe witnessed two of her grandsons, Princes William and Harry, graduate as military officers in 2006 and five years later oversaw the marriage of William and Catherine, the woman who – as the wife of the now heir to the throne – will one day succeed her as Britain’s Queen. She also attended the wedding of Harry to Meghan Markle at St George’s Chapel, Windsor in May 2018.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, and Prince Harry watch a flypast on the balcony of Buckingham Palace as part of events to mark the centenary of the RAF on July 10, 2018 in London. Chris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nIn 2012, the Queen’s diamond jubilee was celebrated around the Commonwealth, culminating in a glittering river pageant on the Thames in London, and a concert showcasing some of the best music from her six decades on the throne.\n\nThree years later, she surpassed Queen Victoria’s 63-year-rule to become the longest-reigning British monarch and, in 2016, she marked her 90th birthday with a series of festivities and goodwill messages from around the world.\n\nIn February 2022, she marked the start of her platinum jubilee year, as she became the first British monarch to reign for 70 years.\n\nFamily upheaval\n\nThe Queen’s final years were punctuated by challenges as well as celebrations, however.\n\nAs the novel coronavirus swept through Britain in 2020, she gave two televised addresses in quick succession, one calling for unity in the face of the pandemic and the other, still amid a national lockdown, to mark the 75th anniversary of VE Day.\n\nBut while rallying the nation’s spirits, the Queen was facing upheaval within her own family. Less than two years after their spectacular Windsor Castle wedding, Harry and Meghan announced that they were stepping back from their roles as senior royals and leaving Britain.\n\nThey subsequently set up home with son Archie in California and, in a March 2021 interview with Oprah Winfrey, accused “the firm” of leaving Meghan unprotected against racist abuse and unfair media coverage, as well as having neglected her mental health concerns. The couple – whose daughter Lilibet, named in honor of the Queen, was born in June 2021 – also made a damaging allegation of racism by an unnamed member of the royal family, although Winfrey later said they had clarified that this was neither the Queen nor Prince Philip.\n\nMeanwhile, Prince Andrew, often referred to as the Queen’s “favorite son,” had been forced to step back from public duties after a disastrous 2019 interview with the BBC over his association with prominent sex offender and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. In January 2022, the Queen sought to distance the royal institution from a civil sex abuse lawsuit brought against Andrew in the United States by stripping him of his HRH status and royal patronages permanently. He subsequently settled the case out of court for an undisclosed figure and continues to reject the allegations against him.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II takes her seat during the funeral of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle on April 17, 2021 in Windsor, England. Jonathan Brady/WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nIn April 2021, the Queen suffered the loss of Prince Philip, her husband of 73 years and the longest-serving consort in British history. Pandemic restrictions meant she cut a lonely figure at his funeral, scaled back in terms of guests but still marked with military pomp.\n\nElizabeth returned to her royal duties within days, now a widow but still dedicated to a lifetime of service. She even continued with light duties after testing positive for Covid-19 in February 2022.\n\nBut as the year wore on, the monarch was forced to significantly slim down her diary due to mobility issues. On Tuesday, she met with outgoing Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his successor, Liz Truss, at Balmoral Castle in Scotland, rather than traveling to Buckingham Palace to do so.\n\nThe nation had come together to mark her platinum jubilee in June 2022 – a crowning achievement in a long and storied life.\n\nBy the time of her death in September, she had reigned for a little over 70 years – a constant, if regally distant, presence in the lives of several generations of Britons.\n\nTo get updates on the British Royal Family sent to your inbox, sign up for CNN’s Royal News newsletter.", "authors": ["Barry Neild"], "publish_date": "2022/09/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/11/india/india-queen-death-legacy-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "How India has moved on since the Queen took the throne | CNN", "text": "New Delhi CNN —\n\nIndia was still a British colony when Queen Elizabeth II was born in 1926, but it had been independent for nearly five years by the time she became Britain’s monarch in February 1952.\n\nBritain at that time, though less powerful than in the heyday of the Empire, was still a major world power. India was just starting out.\n\nHow things have changed.\n\nElizabeth’s death at the age of 96 is likely only to add to debates in Britain about how to remain relevant in the world as it retreats from Europe post-Brexit.\n\nIndia, meanwhile, aspires to become a world power on the back of its growing economy and youthful population. Close to half of India’s nearly 1.3 billion people are under the age of 25; many hadn’t even been born when the Queen made her third, and final, visit to India in 1997.\n\nBritain's Queen Elizabeth II inspects a guard of honor at the Presidential palace in New Delhi during her visit to India in 1997. Ravi Raveendran/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAt an official level, India has been quick to pay its respects to the Queen – Prime Minister Narendra Modi has offered his condolences to Britain and his government declared Sunday a day of mourning.\n\nBut for many among the Indian public, her death is little more than a distant foreign news story – highlighting just how deeply Britain’s relationship with India, once the jewel in the Empire, has changed over the past 70 years.\n\nTrading places\n\nTo be sure, among the G20 countries, the United Kingdom remains one of the largest investors in India with British companies employing close to 800,000 people in the country, according to a 2017 report, and bilateral relations remain strong.\n\nBut while British leaders often cite trade with India as an opportunity in the post-Brexit world, Indian leaders devote more energy to building ties with new partners.\n\nWhen Theresa May became Prime Minister in 2016, she came to India on her first bilateral visit outside Europe, bringing a large trade delegation to drum up business for Britain in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum. And Boris Johnson planned to visit the country in April 2021 – in what would have been his first trip to Asia since becoming Prime Minister in 2019 – but was forced to cancel after Covid-19 cases in India soared. He later visited in 2022.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II meets Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Buckingham Palace in London, England in 2015. Dominic Lipinski/WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nIn contrast, India’s leader, Narendra Modi, visited more than 25 countries, among them resource-rich Turkmenistan, before finally making it to the UK in 2015.\n\nWhich makes sense: back in 2000, Britain’s economy was more than three times the size of India’s. By 2019, India had surpassed Britain in the rankings, according to World Bank figures.\n\nMoving on from the past\n\nMeanwhile, British leaders often talk about “the links of the past, ties of history, language and culture” between the two countries – that’s from a 2013 speech by then-British Prime Minister David Cameron.\n\nBut many Indians are far more concerned with the future. Take the idea of the Commonwealth, so often invoked by ardent Brexiteers as an alternative to the EU. In India, the grouping is hardly ever talked about.\n\nCase in point: the 2018 Commonwealth heads of government meeting in London, when Prince Charles was named as the Queen’s successor as the body’s ceremonial head. Modi was there. But the headlines in India weren’t about the goings-on at the summit. No. The focus was on Modi’s outing at a public event with the Indian diaspora in central London and bilateral meetings with his opposite number at Number 10.\n\nWhy? Because in an increasingly young and forward-looking India, these “links of the past” are seen, when they are remembered at all, very differently.\n\nIn the wake of the Queen’s passing, multiple young people who spoke to CNN in India’s capital New Delhi said they associated the monarchy with a colonial past that was marked by violence.\n\n“If you don’t see people mourning the death of Queen Elizabeth in India, (it is) because she doesn’t have that connection with the new generation of Indians,” Ravi Mishra said.\n\n“She was in a position of power for 70 years when she could have done a lot. You know, all the bad that the British did to this country and to the other countries around the world. She did nothing.”\n\nSandeep Gandotra said the British “took everything from India.”\n\n“As Queen of Britain, she might have left some legacy for (Britons), not for India,” he said.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II meets Indira Gandhi at Hyderabad House in Delhi, India, in 1983. David Levenson/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nA point of contention for many Indians is the monarchy’s continued possession of one of the world’s most famous gems, the 105.6 carat Koh-i-Noor diamond.\n\nThe diamond was unearthed in central southern India and passed through the possession of Indian princes and kings before ending up in British hands in 1849.\n\n“The diamond should have come back to India a long time ago,” Mishra said. “But we all know … the Queen didn’t do anything, so I’m not surprised that it is not coming back to the country.”\n\nThe Koh-i-Noor, or \"mountain of light,\" diamond, set in the Maltese Cross at the front of the crown made for Britain's late Queen Mother Elizabeth, in a picture from 2002.

I will be the first one to clap and rise and celebrate,” she said.\n\nAnd one of the most successful non-fiction books in recent years in India was called “An Era of Darkness: The British Empire in India.” (Its title, when it was published in the UK, was “Inglorious Empire: What the British Did to India.”) Written by the Indian writer and Congress Party politician Shashi Tharoor, it tells the story of how Britain’s plunder of India fueled its rise.\n\nThe book followed a speech Tharoor gave during an Oxford Union debate in 2015 – arguing for the motion that “Britain Owes Reparations to Her Former Colonies” – that went viral, with at last count more than 9.6 million views on YouTube. Importantly, Tharoor wasn’t arguing for a particular monetary sum.\n\n“We are not arguing specifically that vast sums of money need to be paid. The proposition before this house is the principle of owing reparations … the question is: is there a debt?… As far as I’m concerned, the ability to acknowledge a wrong that has been done, to simply say sorry, will go a far, far, far longer way than some percentage of GDP in the form of aid,” Tharoor said.\n\nHe added: “Personally, I’d be quite happy if it was one pound a year for the next 200 years after the last 200 years of Britain and India.”", "authors": ["Nikhil Kumar Rhea Mogul", "Nikhil Kumar", "Rhea Mogul"], "publish_date": "2022/09/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/11/uk/queen-death-whats-next-guide-intl-cmd/index.html", "title": "Queen Elizabeth II's state funeral: How the royal family will say ...", "text": "London (CNN)–The death of Queen Elizabeth II has set into motion an intricate period of mourning which will culminate with a huge state funeral on September 19 honoring her lifetime of devotion and steadfast service.\n\nCodenamed “Operation London Bridge,” arrangements for Britain’s longest-serving monarch have been carefully pored over for years by the many agencies involved, with the Queen herself signing off on every single detail before her death. However, these details were kept under wraps until the sitting sovereign, King Charles III, gave it all his final seal of approval.\n\nThe Queen will ultimately be laid to rest within St. George’s Chapel, in the grounds of Windsor Castle, alongside her “strength and stay” of 73 years, Prince Philip. Here, we’ve put together a day-by-day guide on what will happen from now until the state funeral.\n\nFollowing the Queen’s death, her oak coffin – draped with the Royal Standard for Scotland and a wreath of flowers – sat in the ballroom at Balmoral, where estate staff had the chance to pay their last respects.\n\nOn Sunday morning, gamekeepers carried it to a waiting hearse, and then the beloved monarch left Balmoral for the last time. The first leg of the Queen’s final journey saw the royal cortege make a six-hour journey to Edinburgh and the Palace of Holyroodhouse, the official residence of the British monarch in Scotland. The trip by road ordinarily takes around three hours, however, it was driven slowly to allow people to witness the procession and bow their heads as it passed.\n\nAn honor guard made up of the Royal Regiment of Scotland greeted the hearse in Edinburgh with a royal salute before the coffin was transferred to the Throne Room by a military bearer party.\n\nMeanwhile, back in London, the King met with the Commonwealth secretary general before hosting a reception for the high commissioners from the realms of which he is now head of state in Buckingham Palace’s Bow Room.\n\nOn Monday morning, the King started the day with a trip to Westminster Hall where both Houses of Parliament expressed their condolences. He and his wife Camilla then flew to Edinburgh, where they headed straight to the Palace of Holyroodhouse.\n\nIn the afternoon, the King led a procession carrying the Queen’s coffin to St. Giles’ Cathedral for a service of thanksgiving attended by members of the royal family, as well as a congregation made up “from all areas of Scottish society,” according to a senior palace official. Afterward, the coffin rested there for 24 hours to allow the Scottish public to see it.\n\nFollowing the service, the King had an audience with Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, and a meeting with the presiding officer of the Scottish Parliament. Charles, accompanied by the Queen Consort, also went to the Scottish Parliament to receive a motion of condolence.\n\nIn the evening, the King and members of the royal family mounted their own guard – or vigil – of the Queen’s coffin.\n\nThen-Prince Charles and his brother Edward, left, stand vigil beside their grandmother's coffin while the Queen Mother lies in state at Westminster Hall in 2002.

The couple visited Hillsborough Castle and viewed an exhibition on the Queen’s long association with Northern Ireland. The King then met the secretary of state for Northern Ireland in addition to other party leaders, and received a message of condolence led by the speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly.\n\nBack in Scotland, the Queen’s only daughter, Princess Anne, accompanied her mother’s body as it was flown back to London. The coffin traveled 8.2 miles (13.2 kilometers) by hearse to Edinburgh Airport, where it departed for RAF Northolt.\n\nA state hearse brought the monarch’s remains to Buckingham Palace, where the King, the Queen Consort, as well as other members of the Windsor clan, were waiting for the coffin’s arrival at around 8 p.m. (3 p.m. ET). The Dean of the Chapels Royal conducted prayers and a bearer party founded by The Queen’s Company, 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards placed the coffin on trestles in the center of the Bow Room to rest overnight.\n\nWednesday saw an extraordinary procession take the coffin on a gun carriage from Buckingham Palace over to Westminster Hall, the oldest part of the Palace of Westminster, where the Queen will lie in state until the morning of the funeral.\n\nFor this journey, the coffin was be adorned with the Imperial State Crown and a flower wreath. The procession set off at 2:22 p.m. (9:22 a.m. ET) along The Mall, across Horse Guards Parade, past Downing Street toward Westminster.\n\nSenior royals including King Charles III and Princes William and Harry walked behind their beloved matriarch. They were followed by senior staff from the royal households as well as close personal staff and members of the Household Division. As crowds watched the procession – which took around 40 minutes – Big Ben tolled and minute guns fired by The King’s Troop Royal Horse Artillery at Hyde Park echoed across the capital.\n\nThe Queen’s coffin was placed on a raised platform – or catafalque – in the middle of the hall and is being guarded around the clock by officers from the Household Division, the King’s Bodyguard or the Royal Company of Archers.\n\nUpon its arrival at Westminster Hall, a short service was conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, after which the hall opened for the public to pay their respects.\n\nKing Charles III walks with his sons behind the Queen's coffin on Wednesday.

The UK government has warned that those wishing to pay their respects “will be required to queue for many hours, possibly overnight.” All those attending the lying in state will go through “airport-style” security with only small bags permitted.\n\nBrass plaques in the 11th-century hall mark the spot where Edward VII lay in state in 1910, George V in 1936, George VI in 1952 and Queen Mary a year later. The hall, which is 900 years old, is also where wartime British Prime Minister Winston Churchill lay in state in 1965.\n\nOn Friday, the lying in state continued for a second full day. Huge numbers of people lined up in central London for a chance to visit the coffin and be part of this historic moment.\n\nSeparately, King Charles and Camilla visited Wales on Friday, bringing their tour of all four nations that make up the United Kingdom to a close.\n\nPublic access to the lying in state continues into the weekend. And in a surprise announcement, the Queen’s eight grandchildren – including Princes William and Harry – will stand vigil beside her coffin on Saturday evening.\n\nSunday marks the final full day the Queen’s body will lie in state in Westminster Hall.\n\nThe UK public has also been invited to observe a minute’s silence at 8 p.m. (3 p.m. ET) in a national moment of reflection.\n\nOn the morning of Monday, September 19 – declared a public holiday across the UK – the Queen’s lying in state will end. The coffin will then travel in procession once more to Westminster Abbey for the state funeral, the details of which will likely come in the following days.\n\nWestminster Abbey, founded in 960 AD by Benedictine monks, is one of the most recognizable landmarks in London. The historic church has been the setting for every coronation since 1066, and was where the then-Princess Elizabeth married Prince Philip in 1947. But there hasn’t been a funeral of a monarch there since that of George II in 1760.\n\nHeads of state and dignitaries from around the world are expected to be invited to the British capital to join members of the royal family to celebrate the Queen’s life and unwavering service to the nation and Commonwealth. While a guest list has not yet been announced, US President Joe Biden plans to attend the funeral.\n\nOther familiar faces at the televised service will be some of the 15 prime ministers to have served during the Queen’s reign.\n\nAt its conclusion, the coffin will travel in procession to Wellington Arch, before making its final journey out of London to Windsor.\n\nThe George VI Memorial Chapel in St. George's Chapel, Windsor, where the Queen's father and mother were interred.

She was the last senior royal from a generation that will soon seem alien to modern monarchists.\n\nDuring her 70 years on the throne, Elizabeth gave only one media interview which was limited to the subject of her coronation. She never publicly stated a strong opinion on any subject that could be considered political or controversial. She avoided any kind of public intervention into how the public institutions of the UK should be run.\n\nIn fact, the most controversial political moments during Elizabeth’s reign came from the indiscretion of others.\n\nFormer UK Prime Minister David Cameron said that the Queen “purred” in delight when Scotland voted to remain part of the UK in a 2014 independence referendum. The Sun newspaper speculated in 2016 that the Queen supported Brexit, something that former Buckingham Palace communications director Sally Osman was quick to rubbish while interviewed on CNN earlier this week.\n\nCompare this to the royals who now lead the monarchy into a new, more uncertain future. Elizabeth’s eldest child, now King Charles III, embarrassed the family when letters he wrote to former Prime Minister Tony Blair between 2004 and 2005 were published.\n\nKing Charles reacts as a member of the public hands him a drawing of his late mother, as he meets with people waiting in line to pay respects at the Queen's lying in state on September 17, 2022. Aaron Chown/Pool/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhile the letters seemed fairly innocuous – focusing on things like subsidies for farmers and, amusingly, the merits of publishing private letters such as these – the fact that the first-in-line to the throne was so happy to express political views to the prime minister alarmed those who supported the convention that the monarchy is apolitical.\n\nCharles has also controversially supported using public money to provide homeopathy on the UK’s state-funded National Health Service. NHS England said in 2017 it would no longer fund homeopathy because of a “lack of any evidence for its effectiveness did not justify the cost.”\n\nHowever unimportant knowing Charles’ views on these matters might have seemed at the time, it’s worth remembering that for the entirety of her reign we knew virtually nothing of Elizabeth’s personal views, let alone how she felt government funding should be distributed.\n\n“The monarchy has a huge amount of indirect power in that it can influence public opinion on a matter, which is arguably more important than lobbying ministers,” says Kate Williams, a leading royal historian and professor of public engagement with history at the UK’s University of Reading.\n\nShe points to the time Elizabeth II said that Scottish voters should “think carefully about future” while leaving a church service in Scotland ahead of the referendum in 2014. “While that comment in isolation was probably aimed to be neutral, in the context of the referendum both sides could claim it was an endorsement of rejecting independence,” Williams adds.\n\nScathing views on the media\n\nThe seemingly incompatible mess of a monarch sharing views on such matters while remaining apolitical becomes murkier the further we generationally move from the late Queen.\n\nThe Prince and Princess of Wales were, as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, very public campaigners for mental health. William, who will take the throne after Charles, has spoken on the record about his own struggles with mental health, particularly following the death of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales.\n\nWilliam has also used his platform to speak out against racism in football, heavily implying at a time when it was a huge controversy in the sport that he supports players taking the knee before matches, an issue that has prompted a huge backlash for many football clubs in the UK.\n\nAnd the now-first in line has had a difficult relationship with the British media, particularly the BBC following revelations that one of its journalists, Martin Bashir, had used nefarious methods to secure an interview with his mother when she was extremely vulnerable following her divorce from Charles.\n\nWilliam, Prince of Wales leads his brother Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, followed by their cousins before mounting a vigil around the coffin of their grandmother Queen Elizabeth II on September 17, 2022. Ian Vogler/Pool/AFP/Getty Images\n\nRight now, support for the monarchy is high. We have witnessed the outpouring of both grief for the late Elizabeth, and sympathy for the new King, taking on the role of his life while mourning his mother. But that doesn’t mean support will remain high forever.\n\nCharles, in a BBC documentary filmed for his 70th birthday in 2018, promised he would not meddle in controversial affairs once he became king. Specifically asked if his campaigning would continue, he said: “No, it won’t. I’m not that stupid.”\n\nHe added: “I’ve tried to make sure whatever I’ve done has been nonparty political, but I think it’s vital to remember there’s only room for one sovereign at a time, not two. So, you can’t be the same as the sovereign if you’re the Prince of Wales or the heir.”\n\nNonetheless, the problem facing both the King and his heir is that they can’t put these comments back in the bottle. And the fact these opinions exist will inevitably affect their relationship with the public in the years that follow, as we move further from the era of the inscrutable Elizabeth.\n\nThat said, republicanism has never been hugely popular in the UK. Even last week, during the official events, the protests were mostly limited to a small group of people, many of whom did little more than hold up pieces of paper. A disproportionate reaction from police, in which some protesters were arrested, led to some media coverage and outcries, but hasn’t moved the dial against the royals in any meaningful way.\n\nAbility to remain neutral undermined\n\nElizabeth was a particularly popular monarch. Most public research on the matter shows that older monarchists think her relative silence, in comparison to her successors, was dignified and preserved the integrity of the Crown.\n\nMany of these traditional supporters, however, have historically been skeptical of Charles and would prefer he followed in his mother’s footsteps.\n\nConversely, the late Queen was popular with younger monarchists in spite of her silence. It’s hard to identify precisely why, but it’s plausibly just a by-product of Elizabeth having always been on the throne and younger people knowing no different.\n\nHowever, what is also clear is that younger monarchists approve the royal family speaking out on issues that would previously have been considered too controversial for the Queen.\n\n“It is entirely possible that the generation who thinks the Royals should maintain a stiff upper lip and not talk about issues like women’s rights and mental health will die out,” says Joe Twyman, director of the political research organization Deltapoll.\n\nPrince William, King Charles III, Princess Anne, and Prince Harry follow the coffin of Queen Elizabeth II during a procession from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Hall on September 14, 2022. WPA Pool/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\n“To people from a certain generation, the idea of bowing to your grandmother every time you see her just because she’s the Queen seems insane,” he added, in reference to the row following Meghan Markle’s interview with Oprah Winfrey last year in which she described how surreal she found royal life at times.\n\nThis conflict in the precise role of the monarch is important because the institution lives or dies by whether the public thinks it’s worth it or not.\n\nIt’s likely there will always be traditional monarchists who will defend its every action providing it doesn’t evolve or modernize. They tend to be the most ardent in support.\n\nHowever, this group will probably become a minority before William takes the throne. If Charles lives to 99, as his father did, William will not become King till 2048. No credible social scientist could confidently tell you what public attitudes towards anything will be by then, be it the royal family, climate change, or racial equality.\n\nThe fact that the King and his heir have already said things on all these issues will dramatically undermine their ability to remain neutral on any such issues being raised in the future, something which, however serious the matter, is expected of the Sovereign.\n\nThe fact is their perceived opinions on any of these issues, even if based on past comments, will continue to affect public opinions and therefore policy. If William’s dim view of the BBC leads to more Brits thinking public funding should be pulled in years to come, how will politicians respond to that pressure?\n\nThe monarchy has not had to address these issues for some time because, as long as Elizabeth was on the throne, the public view of the family and its role was largely stable.\n\nThat era is truly over. Now, Charles and William must navigate less certain times, balancing old and new views of who they are against the pressure of being an apolitical head of state. And, unlike Elizabeth, they will do so knowing that the popularity on which they rely will be less guaranteed than it was at any point in the longest-serving monarch’s 70-year reign.\n\nTo get updates on the British Royal Family sent to your inbox, sign up for CNN’s Royal News newsletter.", "authors": ["Luke Mcgee"], "publish_date": "2022/09/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/10/africa/colonialism-africa-queen-elizabeth-intl/index.html", "title": "Cloud of colonialism hangs over Queen Elizabeth's legacy in Africa ...", "text": "Lagos, Nigeria CNN —\n\nThe death of Queen Elizabeth II has prompted an outpouring of reflection and reaction online. But not all was grief – some young Africans instead are sharing images and stories of their own elders, who endured a brutal period of British colonial history during the Queen’s long reign.\n\n“I cannot mourn,” one wrote on Twitter, posting an image of what she said was her grandmother’s “movement pass” – a colonial document which prevented free travel for Kenyans under British rule in the east African country.\n\nAnother wrote that her grandmother “used to narrate to us how they were beaten & how their husbands were taken away from them & left to look after their kids,” during colonial times. “May we never forget them. They are our heroes,” she added.\n\nTheir refusal to mourn highlights the complexity of the legacy of the Queen, who despite widespread popularity was also seen as a symbol of oppression in parts of the world where the British Empire once extended.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II inspects men of the newly-renamed Queen's Own Nigeria Regiment, Royal West African Frontier Force, at Kaduna Airport, Nigeria, during her Commonwealth Tour, on February 2, 1956. Fox Photos/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nKenya, which had been under British rule since 1895, was named an official colony in 1920 and remained that way until it won independence in 1963. Among the worst atrocities under British rule occurred during the Mau Mau uprising, which started in 1952 – the year Queen Elizabeth took the throne.\n\nThe colonial administration at the time carried out extreme acts of torture, including castration and sexual assault, in detainment camps where as many as 150,000 Kenyans were held. Elderly Kenyans who sued for compensation in 2011 were ultimately awarded £19.9 million by a British court, to be split between more than 5,000 claimants.\n\nThe UK Foreign Secretary at the time, William Hague, said: “The British Government recognises that Kenyans were subject to torture and other forms of ill treatment at the hands of the colonial administration. The British government sincerely regrets that these abuses took place, and that they marred Kenya’s progress towards independence.”\n\nAfrica’s memory of the Queen cannot be separated from that colonial past, professor of communication Farooq Kperogi at Kennesaw State University told CNN.\n\n“The Queen’s legacy started in colonialism and is still wrapped in it. It used to be said that the sun did not set over the British empire. No amount of compassion or sympathy that her death has generated can wipe that away,” he told CNN.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II on her way to the Kumasi Durbah with Kwame Nkrumah, President of Ghana, during her tour of Ghana, November 1961. Keystone/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\n‘Tragic period’\n\nWhile many African leaders have mourned her passing – including Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari, who described her reign as “unique and wonderful” – other prominent voices in regional politics have not.\n\nIn South Africa, one opposition party, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), was unequivocal. “We do not mourn the death of Elizabeth, because to us her death is a reminder of a very tragic period in this country and Africa’s history,” the EFF said in a statement.\n\n“Our interaction with Britain has been one of pain, … death and dispossession, and of the dehumanisation of the African people,” it added.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip wave to a crowd of schoolchildren at a rally held at a racecourse in Ibadan, Nigeria, February 15, 1956. Fox Photos/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nOthers recalled Britain’s role in the Nigerian civil war, where arms were secretly supplied to the government for use against Biafrans who wanted to form a breakaway republic. Between 1 million and 3 million people died in that war. British musician John Lennon returned his MBE, an honorary title, to the Queen in protest over Britain’s role in the war.\n\nStill, many on the continent remember the Queen as a stabilizing force who brought about positive change during her reign.\n\nAyodele Modupe Obayelu from Nigeria told CNN: “Her reign saw the end of the British Empire and the African countries … became a Republic. She doesn’t really deserve any award or standing ovation for it, but it was a step in the right direction.”\n\nNigerian magazine publisher Dele Momodu met Queen Elizabeth on a 2003 state visit to Abuja, Nigeria. From Dele Momodu\n\nAnd Ovation magazine publisher Dele Momodu was full of praise, recounting meeting her in 2003 in Abuja while covering her visit to Nigeria. He added that he had fled Nigeria for the UK in 1995, during the dictator Sani Abacha’s regime.\n\n“I told her I was a refugee and now the publisher of a magazine. She told me ‘congratulations,’ and moved on to the other people on the line. I salute her. She worked to the very end and was never tired of working for her country. She did her best for her country and that is a lesson in leadership,” he told CNN.\n\nMomodu believes that the Queen did try to “atone” for the brutality of the British Empire. “She came to Nigeria during our independence and some of the artifacts were returned under her reign. That is why the Commonwealth continues to thrive. I feel very sad that the world has lost a great human being.”\n\nAdekunbi Rowland, also from Nigeria, said: “The Queen’s passing represents the end of an era. As a woman, I’m intrigued by her story. This young woman had an unprecedented accession to the throne, and with much grace and dignity did everything in her power to protect the country and Commonwealth she loved no matter what it took.”\n\nCommonwealth Queen\n\nThe Queen once declared, “I think I have seen more of Africa than almost anybody.”\n\nShe made her first official overseas visit to South Africa in 1947, as a princess and would go on to visit more than 120 countries during her reign, many of them on the continent.\n\nElizabeth, then a princess, and Prince Philip step from their plane in Nairobi, Kenya, on the first stage of their Commonwealth tour in 1952. PA Images/Getty Images\n\nIt was while visiting Kenya in 1952 that she learned that she had become Queen. Her father George passed away while she was there with Prince Phillip and she immediately ascended the throne.\n\nAs colonialism later crumbled and gave way to independence and self-rule in what had been British overseas territories, the former colonies became part of a Commonwealth group of nations with the Queen at its head and she worked tirelessly to keep the group together over the years.\n\nShe forged strong bonds with African leaders, including Nelson Mandela, whom she visited twice in South Africa, and Kwame Nkrumah, with whom she was famously pictured dancing during her visit to Ghana in 1961.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II dances with President Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana, during her visit to Accra, Ghana, in 1961. Universal Images Group/Getty Images\n\nHowever, there is now a growing clamor for independence and accountability over Britain’s past crimes such as slavery. In November 2021, Barbados removed the Queen as its head of state, 55 years after it declared independence from Britain, and other Caribbean countries, such as Jamaica, have indicated they intend to do the same.\n\nPrince William and his wife, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, visited Jamaica in March but they faced protests and calls for reparations during the trip. There were also calls for a formal apology for the royal family’s links to slavery.\n\n“During her 70 years on the throne, your grandmother has done nothing to redress and atone for the suffering of our ancestors that took place during her reign and/or during the entire period of British trafficking of Africans, enslavement, indentureship and colonization,” wrote members of a protest group, the Advocates Network Jamaica.\n\nIn June, Prince Charles became the first UK royal to visit Rwanda, where he was representing the Queen at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.\n\nFollowing his mother’s death, he now heads the Commonwealth, and will embark on a new relationship with its members, about a third of which are in Africa.\n\nSome are asking whether he will be as effective in building the organization as his mother, and above all, how relevant it still is, given its roots in Empire.", "authors": ["Stephanie Busari"], "publish_date": "2022/09/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2022/09/15/king-charles-iii-age-wife-who-is-he/10375776002/", "title": "King Charles III: Everything to know about the new king of the UK", "text": "After more than 70 years of Queen Elizabeth II's steady reign over the United Kingdom, Prince Charles ascended the throne upon her death and is now King Charles III.\n\nThe first-born son of the queen and her late husband, Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, Charles was next in line for the throne from the time he was 3 years old, making him the longest serving, and the most prepared, heir to the throne in British history.\n\nElizabeth was the reigning monarch from February 1952, when she was 25, up until her death at 96 last week.\n\nNow that Charles has become king, people (especially Americans) are asking questions about who he is, his role in the royal family and what he is expected to do during his reign.\n\nHere's everything to know about King Charles III.\n\nNow begins the reign of King Charles III:What kind of sovereign will he be? Not like his mother\n\nWho is King Charles III of the United Kingdom?\n\nBorn, Nov. 14, 1948, Charles Philip Arthur George Windsor is the eldest son of Queen Elizabeth II and her late husband, Prince Philip. Upon the death of the queen on Sept. 8, 2022, Charles, formerly known as Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales, became king of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\n\nKing Charles is known for his previous marriage to the late Princess Diana. The couple had two children, Prince William and Prince Harry.\n\nMore Q&As:King Charles III succeeds Queen Elizabeth. What to know about British royal line.\n\nWhen will Charles be crowned?\n\nLegally, Charles became king from the moment of the queen's death, meaning he is head of state for the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and a dozen other countries. He's also the titular head of the Church of England, head of the military and the judiciary, and carries a host of other royal titles and duties.\n\nThe name he chose as his regnal, or reign, name is his own first name, Charles, and it is followed by the Roman numeral III because he is the third king Charles in British history.\n\nIn the days following the queen's death, Charles was formally proclaimed as monarch in an accession ceremony and gave his first formal address as king.\n\nCharles will likely be crowned within the year; the ancient ritual of the coronation requires advance planning, although a lot of that has already been done. But there hasn't been a coronation since June 1953 when the late queen was crowned.\n\nKing Charles speech:Read the full transcript from his first national address following queen's death\n\nHow old is King Charles III?\n\nHe is 73, the oldest monarch to ever take the British throne.\n\nSurvival of the monarchy:Why Queen Elizabeth II's funeral is more than just ceremony\n\nWho is first in line to become king after Charles?\n\nPrince William, King Charles' elder son and formerly the Duke of Cambridge, is next in line for the throne under the British line of succession.\n\nCharles named William, 40, the new Prince of Wales in an announcement on his first full day as king. As a result, William's wife Catherine, or Kate as she is widely known, also 40, became Princess of Wales. She is the first to hold that title since the death of Princess Diana in 1997.\n\nAfter Prince William, the line of succession turns to Prince William and Princess Kate's children. The succession is as follows:\n\nPrince William, the Prince of Wales (Charles and Diana's first-born son) Prince George of Wales (Will and Kate's first-born son) Princess Charlotte of Wales (Will and Kate's second-born daughter) Prince Louis of Wales (Will and Kate's third-born son) Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex (Charles and Diana's second-born son)\n\nMore:What happens to the other royals under King Charles III and his new slimmed-down monarchy?\n\nIs King Charles married?\n\nCharles is married to the former Camilla Parker Bowles, who was known as Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. She is now the Queen Consort.\n\nLegally, Camilla was the Princess of Wales when she married Charles in 2005 but it was decided at the time she would assume one of the Charles' lesser titles instead. Diana long blamed Camilla for the breakup of her marriage to Charles and public fury remained when Camilla and Charles married eight years after Diana's death in a car crash in Paris.\n\nWhen did Charles marry Camilla?\n\nCharles married Camilla in 2005 in two ceremonies in Windsor. Right after the reception for 800 guests at Windsor Castle, the couple left for a honeymoon in Scotland.\n\nFew Brits thought the wedding would actually happen. A future king had never married a divorced woman. Plus, Camilla was once the most despised woman in Britain, the alleged home-wrecker who broke up the marriage of Charles and Diana.\n\nBut by the couple's 10th wedding anniversary, public perception of Camilla began to change as the royal family, including the queen, embraced her. Charles once said she would never be called Queen Camilla when he assumed the throne. His wishes on that later changed, and the late queen made if official in February 2022 when she announced she wanted her heir's second wife to be known as Queen Consort.\n\nWhen were Prince Charles and Princess Diana married?\n\nCharles was first married to Lady Diana Spencer, later known as the beloved Princess Diana. They were married for 15 years from 1981 to 1996. Diana was 20 and Charles was 32 at the time of their nuptials. The wedding was billed as a fairy tale, but their married life was not.\n\nAs the public would learn later, Charles had always been in love with Camilla, a woman he’d met over a decade prior in 1970. During the marriage of Charles and Diana, there were affairs on both sides.\n\nThe royal couple separated in 1992 and divorced in 1996.\n\nDiana, Charles and Camilla:The love triangle of the century\n\nWhat will Camilla be called now?\n\nPeople could call her just Queen Camilla, but her official title is Queen Consort Camilla, or Camilla, the Queen Consort.\n\nThe vexing question of what to call her once Charles assumed the throne was resolved when the late queen announced during festivities marking her seven decades on the throne that the then-Duchess of Cornwall should be known as Queen Consort, as opposed to Princess Consort, when Charles became king.\n\n\"Queen Consort\" is the fancy name for the wife of a reigning king. In general, a queen consort's job is to support the king in any way she can. As with the first lady of the United States, there's no job description, no official duties and no salary. But there's high visibility, high pressure and high expectations from the public whose taxes pay for the monarchy.\n\nCamilla's new title, explained:What's the difference between queen and 'Queen Consort'?\n\nIf King Charles dies, will Camilla be queen?\n\nWhile we call her Queen Camilla, she will never be the reigning queen. Only members of the royal family who are born in the direct line of succession can become the monarch.\n\nWith Prince William and his son Prince George, 9, the next two in line for the throne after King Charles, a reigning queen is unlikely to come anytime soon. (There have only been six reigning queens in British history since 1066.)\n\nWho are King Charles’ siblings?\n\nKing Charles has three siblings: From oldest to youngest, Princess Anne, The Princess Royal, 72, Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, 62, and Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex, 58. They are all children of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip.\n\nCharles' only sister, Princess Anne, is a full-time working royal, currently 16th in line for the throne. She appears in line after her younger brothers because she was born before the Succession to the Crown Act of 2013, which ended the system of male primogeniture.\n\nBefore the rules changed, younger sons would displace an elder daughter in the line of succession. Now the succession is based on birth order, not gender: Thus, Princess Charlotte, 7, is now third in line and ahead of her younger brother Prince Louis, 4, who is fourth.\n\nPrince Andrew is eighth in line for the throne despite his scandal-ridden history. He's been under fire in Britain since at least 2011 for his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted American sex offender who died in jail in 2019. After a disastrous 2019 TV interview about his relationship with Epstein, Andrew officially stepped back from public duties and as a senior working royal.\n\nEarlier this year, Andrew settled a lawsuit with an American sexual assault accuser, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who had been airing allegations against him publicly since 2015.\n\nCharles' youngest brother, Prince Edward, the Earl of Wessex, is a full-time working royal and is 13th in line for the throne.\n\nWhat is King Charles III known for?\n\nBeyond his role in the royal family as William and Harry's father, the queen's son and the new king, Charles is known for his long and steady service as the Prince of Wales, as he carried out his official and ceremonial duties and established more than 20 charities, including The Prince's Trust, The Prince's Foundation and The Prince of Wales’s Charitable Fund.\n\nAs Queen Elizabeth's mobility waned in the months before her death, Charles stepped in for the monarch, including standing in for her for the first time at the state opening of Parliament this year, when he delivered what has long been called \"the Queen's Speech.\" Now it will be called \"the King's Speech.\"\n\nWhat are King Charles' interests? Did he serve in the military?\n\nKing Charles has shown keen interest in environmental causes including organic farming, architecture and urban planning, and fighting climate change. He served in the military, the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy in the 1970s, and will no doubt be on hand for many military parades and events during his reign.\n\nAs king, Charles is expected to \"slim down\" the monarchy – reduce the number of working senior royals supported by taxpayers – and reduce the overall multimillion-pound annual cost of the royal show.\n\nMore:How much power did Queen Elizabeth II actually have?

(AP) — Bruce Arians has decided to retire as coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and move into a front-office role with the team, a stunning move announced Wednesday night.\n\nArians, who will turn 70 this coming season, coached the Bucs to the Super Bowl title in the 2020 season — Tom Brady’s first with Tampa Bay. The Bucs were 31-18 in Arians’ three seasons there and he was 80-48-1 in eight years as a head coach overall when adding in his five seasons with the Arizona Cardinals.\n\nDefensive coordinator Todd Bowles will replace Arians as coach.\n\nNBC Sports and the Los Angeles Times first reported Arians’ decision and that Bowles would be promoted.\n\n“I have spent most of the last 50 years of my life on the sidelines as a football coach in one form or another,” Arians said in a statement released by the team. “Today, I have made the decision to move from the sidelines into another role with the Buccaneers front office, assisting (general manager) Jason Licht and his staff.\n\nFollow every game: Latest NFL Scores and Schedules\n\n“I love football. I love the relationships, the strategy, the competition — everything. It has been one hell of a ride, but I know this is the right time for me to make this transition.\"\n\nIt is the second major retirement announcement for the Bucs this offseason, following Brady’s announcement in February that he was ending his career. Brady, a seven-time Super Bowl champion quarterback, returned 40 days later, saying he would return for a 23rd season and noting he had “unfinished business.”\n\nThere was no public indication at the NFL’s annual meetings on the Atlantic side of the state in Palm Beach, Florida that such a move was coming. Arians was there, briefly, and did an interview with NFL Network about what the team would have done to replace Brady if the quarterback hadn’t changed his mind. Licht addressed reporters for a short time during the meetings, as did team co-owner Joel Glazer.\n\nArians did not do a group interview there, with the team saying he was leaving for personal reasons. He was also one of the four coaches who opted to not be part of the annual group photo of all NFL head coaches at the meetings.\n\nBowles was an interim head coach in Miami for three games in 2011, and went 24-40 in four seasons with the New York Jets from 2015 through 2018.\n\n“I am appreciative of the Glazer family and Jason Licht for having faith in me to take on this role, and to Coach Arians for his support and guidance over the past four decades,” Bowles said. “Tampa has become home for my family, and we are excited to remain part of this community for years to come. ... I am eager to get started with our players, coaching staff, and front office in preparation for the 2022 season.”\n\n—\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://apnews.com/hub/pro-32 and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/03/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/buccaneers/2022/03/31/bruce-arians-retires-tom-brady-tampa-bay-buccaneers/7232696001/", "title": "Bruce Arians denies rift with Tom Brady, explains coaching retirement", "text": "Outgoing Tampa Bay Buccaneers head coach Bruce Arians, who stunned the NFL with his decision Wednesday night to step away from coaching and move into a front-office role with the team, downplayed reports of a rift with quarterback Tom Brady and said his decision to walk away was focused on having a succession plan that benefitted a protégé.\n\nThe Buccaneers announced the appointment of former defensive coordinator Todd Bowles as the new coach to replace Arians. Bowles said he has known Arians, his former coach at Temple, for around four decades and noted Arians has always championed Bowles, bringing him along as a defensive coordinator at both of his head coaching stops, with the Arizona Cardinals and then with the Buccaneers.\n\nThe curious timing of Arians' decision raised questions about what influence Brady, who reversed course on March 13 on his earlier retirement decision, might have had in the move.\n\n\"We have a great relationship,\" Arians said of Brady. \"All the players, there are a few in here, every one of them has gotten cussed out, all right, including him. It's just part of me. That's nothing new. We have a great relationship. As soon as he retired, I think we texted every week, 'Where you at? What are you doing? When are you going to go play golf? When are you getting back down this way?' People gotta write (expletive). It couldn't be further from the truth.\"\n\nBrady was present at Thursday's press conference, sitting in the auditorium with other players, coaches and media.\n\nFollow every game: Latest NFL Scores and Schedules\n\nMost often, coaching changes happen shortly after the end of a season. Arians was still acting as the forward facing figure of the franchise as late as Sunday, where he represented the team at the NFL annual meetings in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nArians said this decision \"was building\" and was something he was contemplating as far as the end of Tampa Bay's season in January after a loss to the Los Angeles Rams in the NFC divisional playoffs. After conversations with his family and team executives, however, he said he felt the timing wasn't quite right.\n\nArians said he was focused on continuing to build the roster, alongside general manager Jason Licht, to leave the team competitive for the future. Then, Brady's announcement of his short-lived decision to retire Feb. 1 further complicated Arians' timeline for retirement. Arians continued to prepare for the upcoming season, heading out to Indianapolis for the NFL scouting combine at the end of February as well as making preparations for the NFL draft.\n\nBrady reversed course, however, and announced March 13 that he had changed his mind and would be playing for the Buccaneers in the 2023 season. It was shortly after Brady's announcement that Arians said he came to the decision to retire and told Brady about his looming decision to walk away.\n\nBowles said Arians called him on Monday to let him know that he would be appointed as the new head coach of the Buccaneers. Arians said the rest of the coaching staff didn't know until Tuesday night.\n\n\"I thought about it after the season, but it wasn't right,\" Arians said. \"Obviously, going through the combine and all that process trying to build next year's team without Tom, but then when Tom said he'd come back, now it's easy. We're in the best shape we've ever been. There's no better time to pass the torch than now. ...\n\n\"Jason and I have been talking about this. Obviously, we included (Buccaneers owner) Joel (Glazer) and Tom and a few other people, but it wasn't spur of the moment. ... I felt very comfortable after talking with Tom that the franchise was in great shape.\"\n\nGlazer said that Arians would be going into the franchise's Ring of Honor in the upcoming season to commemorate his contributions to the team. The Buccaneers said in a statement Wednesday night that Arians would be transitioning to the front office as a senior football consultant.\n\n\"It has been an unbelievable ride,\" Arians said. \"I'm extremely excited about the future and what the future holds for this franchise and for me. A number have already asked: 'Why are you stepping away from the chance to go to the Hall of Fame and win another Super Bowl?' I don't give a (expletive) about the Hall of Fame.

He also had been an assistant coach at Georgia, where Simmons’ brother, Tyler, played wide receiver from 2016 to 2018.\n\n“I didn’t know too much about (Tucker), but my parents knew about him,” Jordon said by phone Wednesday. “They knew he was a good coach. And overall, once the news broke with him becoming the head coach, I thought it was a good hire for the program overall. …\n\n“Once they hired him, I mean, that was it. I was all-in.”\n\nSimmons signed Sunday with MSU, the 22nd player for the 2020 class. Call him the last of Dantonio’s recruits, or the first of Tucker’s tenure. But the torch officially has been passed to the new regime.\n\n[ Michigan State hires Jay Johnson to be offensive coordinator ]\n\nTucker has been aggressive in his first week-plus on the job, extending scholarship offers to 2021 targets while trying to finalize his coaching staff and getting to know the Spartans’ returning players and early enrollees.\n\nSuch is life during a rare coaching change at a Power 5 school in February.\n\n“Listen, we want to hit the ground running. Time is of the essence,” Tucker said during his introductory news conference Feb. 12. “We are not going to waste any time. We are going to be efficient. We are going to be effective in everything that we do. ... We are going to identify the players that we feel like can help us and then we are going to target them. We are going to recruit them with the intent of signing those guys.\n\n“And so we sleep fast. We'll be sleeping fast and getting after it. We're going to make the most of every opportunity we have.”\n\nThat meant quickly turning the page to the 2021 class; Tucker already has issued a number of offers.\n\nHe targeted a pair of California quarterbacks — four-star Peter Costelli and three-star Ari Patu — who Colorado had been pursuing, as well as Texas QB Hampton Fay, who is currently unrated in 247Sports.com’s composite rankings.\n\n[ Harlon Barnett returning to Michigan State as secondary coach ]\n\nTucker offered four-star twin receivers Bryson and Blaine Green from Texas, and massive offensive linemen Cameron James (6-foot-8, 280 pounds) from Chicago and Ru’Quan Buckley (6-6, 250 pounds) from Godwin Heights.\n\nJames said via text message that he had not met Tucker when the coach called earlier this week. But he liked what he heard right away.\n\n“He’s a great person to talk to and seems like he gets the job done,” said James, whom Dantonio’s staff had recruited. “He knows I like to be challenged in practice and I love the weight room, so he believes it’s a great place for me.”\n\nJames falls within the geographical footprint of where Tucker said he plans to focus much of MSU’s recruiting — similar to Dantonio's blueprint as he built the Spartans into a Big Ten power in the 2010s.\n\n“It starts here in our state — we've got to keep the best players in the state here with us,\" Tucker said. \"And then in our 4-6 hour driving radius, including Ohio, we're gonna be very aggressive in there and use the relationships that we do have.\n\n“And then obviously, I have tremendous ties in the state of Georgia, and Georgia has a lot of really good football players. So we'll go wherever we need to go to get players.”\n\nBut an equally pressing priority for Tucker is to get to know the other incoming recruits, including the other two 2020 signees from Georgia — wide receiver Ricky White and defensive tackle Simeon Barrow.\n\nThe Spartans have seven freshmen already enrolled: cornerback Angelo Grose; linebackers Cal Haladay and Devin Hightower; defensive lineman Kyle King; kicker Jack Olsen; safety Darius Snow; and offensive tackle Justin Stevens.\n\nTucker watched them and the returning Spartans go through workouts at MSU’s indoor football building Tuesday, with Dantonio by his side.\n\nSenior linebacker Antjuan Simmons last week said Dantonio caught the team off guard when he met with them to tell them he was retiring.\n\n“He was just like, ‘I tell you all the time there could be a new face up here one day,' ” Simmons said. “But it was good though. You could feel it was genuine. It’s good for him, he gets to spend a lot of time with his family, his girls, and still be around us.\n\n“We love Coach D, and we’re happy he can still be around. But we’re just as excited to have Coach Tucker as our head coach, and we’re gonna play just as hard for him.”\n\nWith his focus on building next year’s recruiting class and preparing the Spartans for spring practice, which starts next month, there has not been a lot of time for Tucker to catch up with other 2020 signees who have not arrived on campus yet.\n\nOne of them, Ian Stewart, said he understands, what with everything that is going on. The wide receiver from Gibraltar Carlson High said he had not talked with Tucker as of Wednesday afternoon.\n\nWhat blindsided the December signee was when Dantonio called minutes after he announced his retirement.\n\n“He said he was gonna be helping us every step of the way,” Stewart said. “When I found out he was retiring, I was just shocked. I didn’t know anything. But at the same time, I just tried to put myself into his shoes and understand why he’s doing it. I know Coach Dantonio, if he’s gonna do something, he’s making a wholehearted decision and it’s the best decision for himself. And that’s ultimately what matters. We got his back over here.”\n\nStewart said the incoming recruits have been keeping in touch through a group chat, which mainly has been focused on who their future position coaches might be. MSU has eight of its 10 assistants in place, and one recruit on the group chat said assistant coach Mike Tressel said the coaches would start reaching out once the staff is set. .\n\nStewart said he likes what he has seen from his new coach publicly and believes the coaching change could give incoming players a chance to play sooner, with everyone learning new systems and demands.\n\n“I think he’s relentless, like he says,” he said of Tucker. “I feel like he’s one of those coaches that’s gonna develop you, and he’s gonna do whatever it takes to win. I feel like his type of mindset and the way he goes about the game is similar to mine. I think playing under him, I’m really gonna develop.\n\n“I always try to stay positive about things. I always remind myself, yeah, the previous coaching staff, I did build a strong relationship with them. But as Coach Dantonio always said, Michigan State’s bigger than any one person. So even though he’s out and Coach Tucker is in, I just see Michigan State as the university that I’m excited I get to play for.”\n\nSimmons said his older brother gave him similar advice and urged him to go where he felt most comfortable, rather than focusing on a coach. Tyler Simmons also gave Jordon the lowdown on what to expect.\n\n“He gave positive words about Coach Tucker,” Simmons said. “I think he’s going to come in, change the program around and be the coach that brings everything to the table to come in and do great things. He’s a family guy, and he’s a good guy to be around and hang around. So overall, I thought it was a good hire.”\n\nContact Chris Solari at csolari@freepress.com. Follow him on Twitter @chrissolari.

About 24 hours later, after his candidacy became public, he withdrew his name and announced he would remain at Colorado for a second season as head coach.\n\nYet the pull to return to his Midwest roots remained strong, even as front-runner candidate Luke Fickell announced Monday he planned to remain at Cincinnati.\n\nMSU again pursued Tucker on Monday through his representatives. By Tuesday night, Beekman made his final pitch.\n\nFollow every game: Latest NCAA College Football Scores and Schedules\n\n“The only person we offered the job to is Mel Tucker,” Beekman said.\n\nMEL TUCKER:Returning to Michigan State 'a once in a lifetime opportunity'\n\nOPINION:Michigan State's Mel Tucker hire underscores type of competitive imbalance NCAA ignores\n\nDAILY SPORTS, DELIVERED:Get the best Sports news in your inbox!\n\nTucker, 48, now follows in the lineage of Nick Saban, Bobby Williams and Dantonio — all of whom he has worked with — to become the Spartans’ 25th head coach. MSU’s board of trustees voted 7-0 to approve Tucker’s hiring, with one trustee (Renee Knake) absent from the vote.\n\n“Leaving Colorado was probably — was actually — the toughest thing that I have ever done in my career. In my life actually,” Tucker said Wednesday night at a news conference to announce his hiring. “This is the right time for me to be here. That's really what it comes down to. The commitment is here, the resources are here, the want-to, the leadership is here.\n\n“Everything is here. Everything we need is here right now to get done what we need to get done.”\n\nBefore Tucker woke up Wednesday morning in Boulder, Colorado, and boarded a plane to Michigan, the Cleveland native had agreed to replace Dantonio — MSU’s winningest coach, who retired after 13 seasons.\n\nFull contract details are expected to be made public later this week, but Beekman confirmed Tucker received a six-year contract starting around $5.5 million per year. The Spartans also are expanding their assistant coaching pool to around $6 million, Beekman said, but Tucker said he has yet to formalize and finalize who will be on his staff.\n\nTucker left a five-year, nearly $15 million contract at Colorado that included a $3 million buyout, according to his contract obtained by USA TODAY Sports.\n\nTucker said he “brought quite a few bags with me, so I actually don’t plan on going back” to Colorado with his wife and children right away. The goal, he said, is “to hunker down” and get things rolling with his new program with spring practice set to start early next month.\n\n“Listen, we want to hit the ground running. Time is of the essence,” he said. “We are not going to waste any time. We are going to be efficient. We are going to be effective in everything that we do.”\n\nDantonio was not at Tucker’s introduction, and the new head coach said he has yet to speak with either Dantonio or Saban, for whom he began his coaching career working under at MSU as a graduate assistant in 1998-99 and later at both LSU and Alabama. Tucker also was Dantonio’s defensive backs coach on Ohio State’s 2002 national championship team.\n\nSaban and Dantonio issued glowing statements about Tucker, who has worked at Miami (Ohio), LSU, Ohio State, Alabama and Georgia as an assistant in college and in the NFL with Cleveland, Jacksonville and Chicago during his 23-year coaching career. Tucker also served five games as interim coach of the Jaguars before going 5-7 last year with Colorado in his first full-time head coaching position.\n\nSaid Dantonio: \"Mel is charismatic, brings good energy, and is a very forward-thinker. He's also an outstanding recruiter who connects with his players, but also holds them accountable. He's from the Midwest and has a Spartan background with knowledge of the Big Ten. I'm extremely excited for Mel and his family. I'm looking to support him in any way possible.”\n\nSaid Saban: “Mel has made a name for himself as one of the best and brightest coaches in our profession. I believe he will do a tremendous job as the head coach of the Spartans. MSU is getting a guy with infinite class and a great personality, who is smart, works hard, and does it with an incredible amount of enthusiasm and positive energy.”\n\nOne of the first things Tucker did when he arrived Wednesday afternoon was meet with MSU players. He said he was not given the chance to address his players at Colorado but did speak to his staff there.\n\nWhat he told the Spartans, who have been going through offseason conditioning, is to jump right into the 15 allowable spring practices by early March. And his new players sensed his energy immediately.\n\n“That meeting, it was intense,” senior linebacker Antjuan Simmons said with a laugh. “We’re ready, we’re going to play for you. And like you guys know, the head of the program changes, but the expectations don't. We still are going to have the same expectations for this program, and we going to play hard.”\n\nBeekman reiterated to MSU’s board of trustees Wednesday the criteria he and the search committee — which included deputy athletic directors Alan Haller and Jennifer Smith — were seeking in a new coach. .\n\nThe committee consulted with Dantonio, Saban, former MSU players Jimmy Raye and Gene Washington, and former Ohio State coach and Youngstown State University president Jim Tressel. Beekman said new Big Ten commissioner Kevin Warren also helped the process, as did “a wide array of former players from across the generations of Spartan football as well as current student-athletes.”\n\nTucker is MSU's second black football coach since the program was established in 1896. Williams took over for Saban after the 1999 season and was fired in 2002.\n\nTucker arrived in Lansing shortly before Wednesday’s board meeting, and he was accompanied by his wife, Jo-Ellyn, and their sons Joseph (16) and Christian (14). They introduced Tucker at his news conference inside the Gilbert Pavilion attached to Breslin Center, with MSU basketball coach Tom Izzo, a number of coaches in other sports and university dignitaries including university president Samuel Stanley all on hand.\n\n“It is my honor and pleasure to introduce the fearless leader of our family,” his wife said, “and the guy that we just love to death and would follow him anywhere.”\n\nTucker — his voice wavering, his eyes at times looking weary and others getting teary — chuckled when he stepped to the podium.\n\n“Fearless leader, huh? I like that touch,” he said with a grin. “Thank you. She's never called me that before. Truth comes out.”\n\nThat is now what the Spartans hope they have as their new leader.\n\n“We will do everything to prepare, practice and play relentless and accountable football with toughness and integrity. We will do that,” Tucker said. “We have much to live up to and much to prove, and I believe the time is right now.”\n\nContact Chris Solari at csolari@freepress.com.

His salsa dancing in the end zone to celebrate touchdowns made him famous, as did his remarkable rise to incredible heights as a Super Bowl champion with the Giants in 2011.\n\nBut when Cruz, now an uber celebrity and NFL analyst, is asked to what moment he goes back as the most unforgettable of his time with the Giants, his mind does not go to the Super Bowl, the fame he earned or the countless dances he did.\n\nCruz goes back to the moment when an undrafted long shot from Paterson, N.J., left everyone in awe as a rookie in a preseason game against the Jets.\n\nFollow every game: Latest NFL Scores and Schedules\n\n\"I close my eyes, when I go back: it's always the first one: preseason game, rookie year, up the sideline, first catch ever, first anything, against the Jets,\" Cruz told The Record and NorthJersey.com on Tuesday morning, the news of his retirement still flooding social media. \"For that one to be a touchdown out of the gate, it was like, my season, my career could have ended right there, and I had already accomplished so much. Being from New Jersey, playing in Giants Stadium, scoring a touchdown like that, in front of my family and my mom, that moment alone takes the cake for me.\"\n\nThe story continues below the gallery.\n\nCruz had been a Giants fixture since August of 2010, when the undrafted rookie from UMass who grew up in the shadow of the Meadowlands stunned everyone with a breakthrough performance in a preseason game against the Jets. He rose to stardom with the Giants, celebrating his touchdowns with his trademark salsa dance and winning a Super Bowl in the 2011 season.\n\n\"Obviously Victor had a terrific career and a great Giant, and a guy who kind of exploded onto the scene in this preseason game versus the Jets coming up in 2010,\" Giants quarterback Eli Manning said Tuesday, adding: \"Really just had a great feel for the offense, for his routes in that slot, and he was tough to cover. Running down the field, breaking in, we gave him a lot of options. He mastered some of those concepts and gave him a great opportunity to get open and make big plays for us. Tremendous player, and a great guy. He was in the locker room a few weeks ago. I got to talk with him and hang out with him. Obviously, I wish him all the best going forward. I think he’s gone to the dark side and has gone into the media [laughter]. I wish him all the best going over there.\"\n\n\n\nOnly Calvin Johnson and Brandon Marshall had more 100-yard receiving games than Cruz from 2011 to Week 6 of the 2014 season when the latter tore the patellar tendon in his right knee during a game against the Eagles in Philadelphia.\n\nFollowing his release from the Giants, Cruz signed with the Chicago Bears last summer. He was cut in the preseason, and spent the last year waiting for an offer that never came.\n\n\"When a year passes without a phone call, that's kind of the wake up call,\" Cruz said. \"That's the biggest lesson I've learned: you have your moment when you make it to the top, and mine came so quickly. Everything's great, your career is ascending, and then in a blink of an eye, in Year 4 for me, I'm gonna play 15-20 years, win a couple championships, and then after Year 7, I'm done. That's what the league is telling me.\"\n\nIn trying to make it to the NFL, Cruz earned respect from so many along the way.\n\nHe once was a North Jersey teenager harboring a dream to play basketball at Duke University, not the NFL for his beloved Dallas Cowboys, let alone the Giants for whom he would star, becoming a worldwide celebrity of football and fashion.\n\nOpposing coaches in the now-defunct Bergen-Passaic Scholastic League used to complain about how that kid wearing No. 9 for Paterson Catholic (now closed) was too physical, and all he did was push off in the end zone. That was the reason he was catching all those touchdown passes, they said.\n\nCruz committed to UMass on scholarship, but first had to attend prep school. Then he had to come home and work in retail at Garden State Plaza in Paramus after his grades at UMass led to his dismissal not only from the team, but the school, and not once, but twice.\n\nNow he's a role model for all those who dream of following in his footsteps, including those involved with the Boys and Girls Club of America, which has honored him on several occasions through his foundation.\n\n\"My story, it wasn't easy to get here,\" Cruz said. \"But I wouldn't change a thing.\"\n\nIt was Cruz's story that inspired many around the league: the kid who did that dance to honor his grandmother and his Puerto Rican heritage, the one who outworked the crowd at the bottom to make it to the top.\n\nThere's a reason why former Philadelphia Eagles coach Chip Kelly visited Cruz in a Philadelphia hospital the morning after Cruz's football world changed forever back in 2014 - and why Giants coach Pat Shurmur stepped to the microphone for his Tuesday news conference and opened with a salute to a player he never coached.\n\n\"What a great Giant,\" Shurmur said. \"I remember playing against him when I was [coaching] in Philly and we were certainly well aware of the impact he could have on a ball game. I had a chance to meet him and be around him, and he certainly doesn’t need an invite from me, but much like all the ex-Giants, I look forward to seeing him at practice any time he wants to be here. So, congratulations to him.\"\n\nCruz will make his ESPN debut Wednesday during the 9 a.m. hour on both Get Up! and SportsCenter. He visited the Giants here at training camp two weeks ago after staying away for much of last year, still trying to come to grips with his exit.\n\nThis time, Cruz said he felt at home again.\n\n\"I'll always be blue 80 in New York in my opinion, in my mind, in my heart,\" Cruz said. \"To me, the blue 80 jersey will always say Cruz on the back of it, New York City. I hope the fans don't lose that. That's where I was born, essentially, from a football perspective, and [the Giants and the New York City area] will always be home, always be family.\"\n\nEmail: stapleton@northjersey.com\n\nMore NY Giants news\n\nNY Giants:Growing pains continue for remade offensive line\n\nAmani Toomer:Medical marijuana discussion in Fort Lee brings out former NY Giants receiver\n\nNY Giants:Did Big Blue's decision to draft Saquon Barkley gift a franchise QB to Jets?", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/08/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2022/03/13/tom-brady-is-returning-to-tampa-to-play-23rd-season-in-nfl/49932899/", "title": "Tom Brady is returning to Tampa to play 23rd season in NFL", "text": "AP\n\nTAMPA, Fla. (AP) — Tom Brady’s retirement lasted 40 days.\n\nBrady said Sunday he’s returning to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for his 23rd NFL season.\n\nThe seven-time Super Bowl champion announced his decision on Twitter and Instagram, saying he has “unfinished business.” The news stole the spotlight from the NCAA’s Selection Sunday.\n\n“These past two months I’ve realized my place is still on the field and not in the stands,” Brady wrote. “That time will come. But it’s not now. I love my teammates, and I love my supportive family. They make it all possible. I’m coming back for my 23rd season in Tampa.”\n\nBrady led the Buccaneers to a Super Bowl title following the 2020 season and NFC South championship last season. He teamed with coach Bill Belichick to win six Super Bowls during 20 seasons with the New England Patriots.\n\nFollow every game: Latest NFL Scores and Schedules\n\nThe 44-year-old Brady led the NFL in yards passing (5,316), touchdowns (43), completions (485) and attempts (719) in 2021, but the Buccaneers lost at home to the Los Angeles Rams in the divisional round.\n\n“Tom Brady loves to play football as much as anyone I have ever been around,\" Buccaneers coach Bruce Arians said. \"As Tom said, his place right now is on the football field. He is still playing at a championship level and was as productive as anyone in the league last season. We are ecstatic that he decided to continue playing and working toward winning another championship.”\n\nBrady cited his desire to spend more time with his wife, supermodel Gisele Bundchen, and three children when he decided to walk away from the game on Feb. 1. But he changed his mind about staying home, a day after attending the Manchester United match against Tottenham Hotspur. Brady sat with the Glazer Family, who own Manchester United and the Buccaneers.\n\nHis reversal sent shock waves throughout the sports world, and his teammates and Buccaneers fans reacted with jubilation.\n\nAll-Pro right tackle Tristan Wirfs called it “unreal.” Receivers Mike Evans and Chris Godwin shared their joy in emojis.\n\nGiants safety Logan Ryan said Brady’s return is “good for football.” Rams star cornerback Jalen Ramsey tweeted: “THANK YOU! throw that last touchdown on somebody else.”\n\nMany Hall of Fame players across several sports returned to playing after retiring, including Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson and Bob Cousy in the NBA, Brett Favre and Reggie White in the NFL, Guy Lafleur and Mario Lemieux in the NHL.\n\nThe Buccaneers are hopeful star tight end Rob Gronkowski also returns. Brady convinced his buddy to unretire to join him in Tampa in 2020. The team lost Pro Bowl guard Ali Marpet, who retired at age 28. But Godwin is staying after getting the franchise tag.\n\nBrady’s decision comes right before the NFL free agency period begins. The Bucs have several key players set to hit the open market: running back Leonard Fournette, cornerback Carton Davis, safety Jordan Whitehead, linebacker Jason Pierre-Paul, defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh, Gronkowski and others.\n\nThey kept one of those key players when Pro Bowl center Ryan Jensen agreed to a three-year contract late Sunday night, his agent Mike McCartney said on Twitter.\n\nBrady’s return should impact their decisions and the team’s plans. Tampa’s odds for winning the Super Bowl went from 25:1 to 7 1/2:1, tied with Green Bay for second-best behind Buffalo at 7:1, according to FanDuel Sportsbook.\n\n“We are thrilled that Tom has decided to come back this season,\" Bucs general manager Jason Licht said. \"We said we would leave all options open for him should he reconsider his retirement and today’s announcement is something we have been preparing for in recent days.\n\n\"Bruce and I have had plenty of conversations with Tom recently that led us to believe there was a realistic chance he would want to come back. Tom is the greatest quarterback of all time who is still playing at an elite level. With this decision now made, we will continue to move forward with our offseason plans to reload this roster for another championship run.”\n\nBrady is the NFL’s career leader in yards passing (84,520) and TDs (624). He’s the only player to win more than five Super Bowls and has been MVP of the game five times.\n\nBrady has won three NFL MVP awards, been a first-team All-Pro three times and selected to the Pro Bowl 15 times. He is 243-73 in his career in the regular season and 35-12 in the playoffs.\n\nHe’s back to build on all those numbers.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/03/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2022/05/10/tom-brady-fox-sports-analyst/9714644002/", "title": "Tom Brady to join Fox Sports as lead NFL analyst when playing ...", "text": "Whenever Tom Brady decides to end his NFL career, he already has a new gig lined up.\n\nBrady will join Fox Sports, the network announced Tuesday, as its lead NFL analyst when he retires, and will call games with the network's #1 play-by-play commentator Kevin Burkhardt.\n\n\"Brady will not only call our biggest NFL games with Kevin Burkhardt, but will also serve as an ambassador for us, particularly with respect to client and promotional initiatives,” said Fox Corporation CEO Lachlan Murdoch.\n\nAccording to the New York Post, Brady's broadcasting contract is for 10 years, paying him $375 million, shattering the record for compensation for an analyst.

Cruise is reprising his role as Pete “Maverick” Mitchell, the cocky fighter pilot who felt the need for speed 36 years ago.\n\nThe Paramount film — which has Cruise’s Maverick teaching a new class of Top Gun recruits — is expected to make roughly $120 million for its three-day opening. That will easily make “Maverick” the highest-grossing debut in Cruise’s 40 year career, overtaking “War of the Worlds,” which opened to $64.8 million in 2005.\n\nCruise and Paramount are already on target for a big weekend, with the film making $51.8 million for its opening day. The film is also on track for a $150 million opening over the four-day holiday weekend.\n\n“Tom Cruise is one of the few true movie stars left in the business,” Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore (SCOR), told CNN Business. “His name on the marquee means something to audiences who have come to trust that his films will be worth every dollar of that movie ticket purchase.”\n\nCruise Control\n\n\"Top Gun: Maverick\" is set to become Tom Cruise's biggest opening. Scott Garfield/Paramount Pictures\n\nIt might seem odd that none of Cruise’s films have had an opening in excess of $65 million, but that’s because Cruise is the Hank Aaron of the movies — a reliable and consistent hit maker — who has notched more than $10 billion at the global box office since 1981 despite his films never coming close to a $100 million opening.\n\n“Cruise is all about the marathon, not the sprint, when it comes to his performance at the box office,” Dergarabedian said. “The consistency of his bankability over his more than four decades on the big screen is virtually unrivaled.”\n\n“Maverick” was supposed to hit theaters in 2020, but was delayed because of the pandemic. Other theatrical films pivoted to streaming, but “Maverick” waited and waited until audiences could experience it on the big screen — a strategy Cruise was adamant about.\n\nHolding the release for two years has paid off, with the film garnering great reviews. It currently has a near perfect 97% score on review site Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nWhether the buzz translates into ticket sales remains to be seen, but it certainly won’t be for lack of trying on Paramount or Cruise’s part. Cruise has gone all out, from landing a helicopter on the deck of an aircraft carrier for the film’s premiere to terrifying James Corden in a jet to showcasing “Maverick” at the Cannes Film Festival, where it inspired a five-minute-long standing ovation.\n\n“‘Maverick’ is virtually assured to become his biggest career opening at this point,” Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at BoxOffice.com, told CNN Business. “Everything is in its favor, from strong reviews to social media buzz, ticket pre-sales, and an eager audience that has waited for a sequel to his career-making role for a very long time.”\n\nRobbins added that younger moviegoers “drive the lion’s share of box office business,” but even though “Maverick” comes 36 years after the original, it still matters.\n\n“Make no mistake, this is still a very important film for helping to bring back more pandemic era stragglers of a certain age that can still make a difference for the overall health of the industry as it continues to recover,” Robbins said.\n\nClimbing Back Up The Mountain\n\nParamount is having a great year. It could fly even higher with \"Top Gun: Maverick.\" Mark Davis/Getty Images\n\nHow “Maverick” fares at the box office also matters a lot to Paramount.\n\nMuch like it’s famed snowy mountaintop logo, Paramount (PGRE) used to be at the top of the mountain in Hollywood, producing mega hits including “The Godfather,” “Raiders of the Lost Ark” and “Titanic.”\n\nRecently, though, the studio has struggled to find its footing in an ever-evolving film industry. It’s been more than a decade since Paramount placed first in yearly box office market share.\n\nYet the studio is doing great in 2022, and is currently in third place thanks to hit films “Scream,” “The Lost City” and “Sonic the Hedgehog 2.” Paramount has even made more than Disney (DIS) so far this year. And with “Maverick” set to take off this weekend, Paramount’s 2022 could fly even higher.\n\n“Paramount has been one of the studios at the forefront of movie going’s rebound,” Robbins said. “From a philosophical standpoint, because of what their presence on the big screen has meant for theatrical exhibition, it might very well prove to be one of the most important years in Paramount’s storied history.”", "authors": ["Frank Pallotta"], "publish_date": "2022/05/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/31/media/top-gun-maverick-box-office-record/index.html", "title": "'Top Gun: Maverick' jets to new box office records | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\n“Top Gun: Maverick” took off at the box office this weekend — setting a new record in the process.\n\nThe sequel to the 1986 blockbuster, which has Tom Cruise reprise his most iconic role as Pete “Maverick” Mitchell, made an estimated $156 million domestically for its four-day opening weekend, according to Paramount (PGRE).\n\nThat gives the film the record for biggest opening over the Memorial Day holiday weekend, overtaking “Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End,” which made $153 million in 2007.\n\n“Maverick” surpassed expectations at the ticket booth this weekend. Analysts forecast the film to make closer to $80 million for its weekend opening and $150 million over the four day holiday. It’s easily Cruise’s biggest debut at the box office over his 40-year career and marks the star’s first $100 million opening.\n\nOn top of all of that, “Maverick” is the third-biggest debut of the year behind two superhero films, Marvel’s “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness” and Warner Bros.’ “The Batman.”\n\nStudios and theaters couldn’t ask for a better way to dive into the summer — the film industry’s most lucrative season.\n\nRecently, Paramount has struggled to find its footing in an ever-evolving Hollywood.\n\nThat’s not the case in 2022.\n\nFilms such as “Scream,” “The Lost City” and “Sonic the Hedgehog 2” have helped give a boost to Paramount and “Maverick” continues that trend.\n\nAs for theaters, “Maverick” is another blockbuster helping the industry rebound from two brutal years of the pandemic decimating the business.\n\n“Top Gun: Maverick,” which garnered a stellar 96% score on review site Rotten Tomatoes, now has a clear runway to rack up even more success at the box office.

It’s Cruise’s first $100 million opening weekend and the third biggest debut of the year.\n\nParamount said that “Maverick” is projected to make $151 million over the four-day Memorial Day weekend at the US box office. If the sequel, which has Cruise’s Maverick teaching a new group of Top Gun pilots, lands at that number Monday, it’ll be one of the highest openings ever for a Memorial Day weekend.\n\nGlobally the film has earned $248 million so far, according to Paramount, which said that 55% of the US total came from ticket buyers over age 35.\n\n“Maverick” had a lot of buzz coming into this weekend with anticipation running high and reviews even higher at 97% on review site Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nSo the big weekend is a victory for Cruise, Paramount (PGRE), and especially theaters.\n\n“Maverick” was supposed to hit cineplexes in 2020, but was delayed multiple times because of the pandemic.

The film garnered a perfect “A+” CinemaScore and has relatively no competition at the box office until “Jurassic World: Dominion” opens in two weeks.\n\n“‘Top Gun: Maverick’ has a clear runway,” Dergarabedian added. “By the time ‘Jurassic’ hits theaters, [‘Maverick’] will likely have already generated blockbuster numbers.

Paramount/Kobal/Shutterstock\n\nYear: 1993\n\nBox office haul: $158.3 million\n\nAdjusted for inflation: $350.4 million\n\nIf you’re looking for a time when Tom Cruise was at the peak of his stardom, it’s hard to argue with the early 1990s.\n\nCruise starred in “A Few Good Men” in 1992 and “Interview with a Vampire” in 1994. Right smack dab in the middle of that blockbuster run was one of his most profitable films, 1993’s “The Firm.”\n\nThe actor solidified himself as one of Hollywood’s most bankable actors playing a young lawyer who joins a law firm with some criminal undertakings. “The Firm” may not be one of Cruise’s most memorable roles, but it’s one of his most successful.\n\nIt likely helped that it was based on the John Grisham bestseller.\n\n4. “Mission: Impossible II”\n\nTom Cruise returned to his role as Ethan Hunt in 'Mission: Impossible II' in 2000.

However, it still found an audience to help Cruise enter yet another decade of box office dominance.\n\nDespite the film being the second-highest grossing installment in the series, it is the worst-reviewed film in the Mission: Impossible series: a 57% on Rotten Tomatoes — the only rotten score for the rollicking spy franchise.\n\n3. “Mission: Impossible”\n\nTom Cruise as Ethan Hunt in a scene from the film 'Mission: Impossible', released in 1996.

The series has also made a boatload of money, notching more than $3.5 billion over six films at the global box office. The next film in the series, “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” hits theaters next year.\n\nThe original film — which was directed by Brian De Palma — is more of a cerebral spy thriller than its “oh my god, did Tom Cruise just do that stunt?” counterparts. Ye it was still one of the biggest hits of 1996 and of Cruise’s career.\n\n2. “Rain Man”\n\nTom Cruise starred with Dustin Hoffman in 'Rain Man' in 1988.

That includes best actor for Hoffman, best director for Barry Levinson and best picture.\n\nCruise, however, wasn’t nominated for the film. In fact, Cruise has never won an Oscar.\n\n1. “Top Gun”\n\n'Top Gun' was released in 1986 with Tom Cruise as Lt. Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell.

It ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\n“Top Gun: Maverick” was never going to be an easy sell.\n\nSure, the film starred Tom Cruise — arguably one of Hollywood’s most iconic movie stars — and it would be the sequel to “Top Gun,” one of the biggest blockbusters of all time. But the original “Top Gun” was in theaters when Ronald Reagan was president, leg warmers were still in style, and the New York Mets last won the World Series.\n\nThe challenge for Paramount — the studio that released the film — and its CEO Bob Bakish was how to roll out a sequel to the 1986 Cold War classic for a world that had seemingly left Pete “Maverick” Mitchell and his “need for speed” behind.\n\nAnd as if that wasn’t enough, the movie was scheduled to be released in the summer of 2020 when the world was in the midst of pandemic that was shutting down entire industries and throwing millions of people out of work and, oh yes, closing movie theaters around the world.\n\n“It was pretty clear that that wasn’t a viable idea,” Bakish told CNN Business about releasing the film. “The world was pretty shut down, you weren’t going to put an expensive movie that you had real hopes for… in theaters and have nobody come.”\n\nWhat was Paramount to do? “Maverick” was ready to take off — but had nowhere to land. The film, with its hefty $170 million price tag, could go straight to streaming — like many movies did during the pandemic — and as a marquee title would have likely pushed subscribers to the studio’s growing streaming service, Paramount+. However, the company chose to save it for the big screen.\n\n“We really felt, and Tom [Cruise] certainly agreed with the fact that we had a great big screen movie and we just had to hold it,” Bakish said. “It just felt like the right thing to do.”\n\nStill, it was a big risk. Would audiences leave their homes during a pandemic to watch a sequel to a movie more than three decades old? Bakish and Paramount wouldn’t find out until roughly two years after the film’s original release date, after its fourth and final release date of May 27, 2022.\n\n“Top Gun: Maverick” has since become the fifth-highest-grossing film in US history.\n\n“The future is coming… and you’re not in it”\n\n\"No one could predict it would do this well,\" Paramount CEO Bob Bakish said about \"Top Gun: Maverick\" Eamonn M. McCormack/Getty Images for Paramount Pictures\n\n“It’s a very, very bad time to own a movie theater.”\n\nThat’s how Brent Lang, executive editor of Variety, described the climate of the movie theater industry during the depths of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020.\n\nThe global health crisis shuttered theaters, delaying films for months, if not years. That left some in Hollywood to wonder if the business, which notched more than $40 billion in global ticket sales in 2019, would ever recover.\n\nStreaming — which had already upended the theatrical model — was now booming. Netflix was setting subscriber records, Disney+ surpassed 100 million subscribers in a mere 16 months and other new services were popping up seemingly every day.\n\nAmid that landscape, Warner Bros. decided to release its entire 2021 film slate directly to theaters and simultaneously to the company’s streaming service, HBO Max — a move that shocked Hollywood. (Warner Bros., like CNN, is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery.)\n\nYet, cineplexes kept trying. In 2021, hits like Sony’s “Venom: Let There Be Carnage,” Disney’s “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings” and Universal’s “F9: The Fast Saga” all brought in sizable ticket sales that helped theaters stay open.\n\nBut it wasn’t until Marvel’s “Spider-Man: No Way Home” debuted on the big screen in December that theaters saw a glimmer of hope. “No Way Home” made nearly $2 billion worldwide, but it didn’t really give the industry the confidence it needed — after all, Marvel movies are supposed to do well at the box office no matter what.\n\nSo if a superhero couldn’t save the day, what kind of film would inject new life into theaters? Enter a cocky 60-year-old flyboy and his rag-tag team of young fighter pilots.\n\n“Maverick” flew into theaters with lots of buzz and strong reviews, and that helped the movie blow past box office projections for its opening weekend. It brought in a Memorial Day weekend record of $160 million at the North American box office. That alone would have been a victory for Paramount, but the film was just taking off.\n\nAudiences came back week after week, making “Maverick” the only film ever to take the top spot on Memorial Day and Labor Day weekends. For 75 straight days the film made at least $1 million a day, and now accounts for roughly 12% of the overall domestic box office so far this year, according to Comscore (SCOR). Simply put, “Maverick” refused to land.\n\n“It was an event-level motion picture made for theaters,” Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at Boxoffice.com, told CNN Business. “It also brought back a significant portion of older audiences who held out during the early months of cinematic recovery in 2021 and early 2022.”\n\nEven Bakish was surprised by audiences’ reaction to the film, noting that Paramount “always knew it was a great movie” but it “probably underappreciated how great it was because no one could predict it would do this well.”\n\nBut there’s also a symbolic aspect to the film’s success. “Maverick” is an old-school box office hit made for the biggest screen possible that emerged just as the industry’s future was very much in doubt. “Maverick” showed that audiences still want to go to the movies.\n\n“The commercial reception of Tom Cruise’s legacy sequel was the summer movie miracle theaters needed,” Scott Mendelson, a box office reporter, wrote for Forbes.\n\nClimbing back up the mountain\n\n\"We really felt, and Tom certainly agreed with the fact that we had a great big screen movie,\" Bakish said. Kris Connor/SipaUSA/AP\n\n“Maverick” was also the type of success that Paramount — a company in transition — sorely needed.\n\nIn recent years, the studio behind some of cinema’s greatest films — think “The Godfather,” “Chinatown” and “Raiders of the Lost Ark” — found itself lagging behind competitors in box office market share.\n\nParamount recombined with CBS in 2019 after splitting off from the company in 2006 and rebranded itself as Paramount Global, revamping its top streaming service into Paramount+ during a rapid evolution of the entertainment industry.\n\nFor Bakish, Paramount’s current success comes from focusing on “multiplatform, global execution,” or as he himself puts it, “it’s about theatrical, it’s about television and it’s about streaming.” In other words, Paramount has more than just a streaming-centric view of the media business.\n\nThe strategy has been working. Paramount (PGRE) has had six No. 1 debuts so far this year — more than any other studio — with hit films across multiple genres, including romantic comedy (“The Lost City”), family (“Sonic the Hedgehog 2”) and horror (“Smile”).\n\nPutting films in theaters has not hindered Paramount’s streaming efforts, which include Paramount+ and Showtime and have nearly 67 million subscribers worldwide, the company said last week. While that’s lower than competitors like Netflix (NFLX) and Disney+, Paramount+ is the fastest-growing service in the US so far this year, according to Bloomberg.\n\nAnd those numbers will likely see a boost in the coming months with international expansion in the next year and “Maverick” finally hitting Paramount+ by the end of 2022.\n\n“This is an extraordinary collection of assets,” Bakish said of Paramount’s portfolio of brands. “And at the moment — and yes, I’m biased — we’re executing pretty well.”\n\nBut will that lead to another “Top Gun”?\n\n“You’ve got to have the stars align again. You’ve got to have a story that people love and you’ve got to put the team together,” Bakish said. “We’ll see.”", "authors": ["Frank Pallotta"], "publish_date": "2022/11/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/26/media/val-kilmer-top-gun-maverick/index.html", "title": "Val Kilmer, once one of Hollywood's biggest stars, returns to 'Top ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\n“Top Gun: Maverick” hits theaters this weekend, marking the return of one of the biggest movie stars of the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nWe’re not talking about Tom Cruise.\n\nVal Kilmer returns to the screen to reprise his role as Tom “Iceman” Kazansky in the long-awaited sequel to the 1986 blockbuster. Although Cruise is the marquee star of “Top Gun: Maverick,” Kilmer has a notable role, but some younger moviegoers may not realize just how big of a star he once was.\n\nKilmer’s films have made a huge amount of money over his long career — nearly $2 billion at the global box office, according to Comscore (SCOR). (Cruise has racked up more than $10 billion at the worldwide box office.) Kilmer, like Cruise, became a major star in “Top Gun,” playing “Iceman,” the cocky but cool rival to Cruise’s Pete “Maverick” Mitchell.\n\nAfter that iconic role, Kilmer starred in a long streak of successful genre-spanning movies: Superhero films like 1995’s “Batman Forever” in which he played the Dark Knight, and memorable turns in Westerns as Doc Holliday in 1993’s “Tombstone,” biopics as Jim Morrison in 1991’s “The Doors” and in crime films as a bank robber in Michael Mann’s 1995 masterpiece, “Heat.”\n\nBut “Top Gun: Maverick” is a likely swan song for Kilmer, who underwent a tracheotomy that has completely altered his voice. Kilmer revealed he had throat cancer in 2017, and has largely stepped away from acting.\n\nKilmer’s off-screen health issues are woven into the story of “Top Gun: Maverick,” giving the sequel a real life emotional layer. If the new film is indeed Kilmer’s last role, it will conclude one of the most interesting — and bankable — careers in Hollywood history.\n\nLast year, Kilmer was featured in “Val,” an intimate documentary that dealt with his health issues and explored his career. The documentary shares interactions he had videotaped with his family and on film sets for years.\n\nDavid Rooney, The Hollywood Reporters’ chief film critic, wrote in his review that “Top Gun: Maverick’s” most “moving element comes during the brief screen time of Kilmer’s Iceman, whose health issues reflect those suffered by the actor in real life, generating resonant pathos.”\n\n“There’s reciprocal warmth, even love, in a scene between Iceman and Maverick that acknowledges the characters’ hard-won bond as well as the rivalry that preceded it, with gentle humor,” Rooney wrote.", "authors": ["Frank Pallotta"], "publish_date": "2022/05/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2022/05/18/tom-cruise-honored-with-surprise-award-at-cannes-film-festival/9828005002/", "title": "Tom Cruise honored with surprise award at Cannes Film Festival", "text": "Jake Coyle\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nCannes, France — Tom Cruise mania descended Wednesday in Cannes where the actor made a whirlwind appearance at the film festival, walking the red carpet, receiving a surprise Palme d'Or and watching a squadron of French fighter jets fly over the European premiere of \"Top Gun: Maverick.\"\n\nCannes pulled out all the stops to fete the 59-year-old star, paying tribute to Cruise with not just a rare interview on stage and a red-carpet premiere featuring a flyby of jets trailing colored smoke, but with the unexpected presentation of an honorary Palme d'Or.\n\nFestival president Pierre Lescure announced the award — about 15 honorary Palmes have been given before — on stage just before the screening was to begin.

My life has been blessed beyond measure and I do know that one can only come this far by faith,” Jackson said.\n\n“Among my many blessings, and indeed the very first, is the fact that I was born in this great country,” she added. “The United States of America is the greatest beacon of hope and democracy the world has ever known. I was also blessed from my early days to have had a supportive and loving family. My mother and father, who have been married for 54 years, are at their home in Florida right now and I know that they could not be more proud.”\n\nRELATED: Republicans attack Biden Supreme Court pick as pawn of ‘radical Left’\n\nThough historic, the choice of Jackson will not change the ideological makeup of the court. The court currently has six conservative justices and three liberal justices – and the retiring Breyer comes from the liberal camp. The court is already poised to continue its turn toward the right with high-profile cases and rulings expected from the court in the coming months on abortion, gun control and religious liberty issues.\n\nBiden met with Jackson for her Supreme Court interview earlier this month, a senior administration official said, in a meeting that the White House managed to keep secret. Jackson received and accepted Biden’s offer in a call Thursday night, a source familiar with the decision told CNN, yet was present for DC Circuit Court hearings Friday morning.\n\nThe White House considered delaying the announcement, given the Russian invasion in Ukraine, but believed it was critical to get the second phase of the confirmation process moving, the official said.\n\nChance to excite Democrats\n\nBiden’s pick is a chance for him to fire up a Democratic base that is less excited to vote in this year’s midterm elections than it has been over the past several election cycles. The selection gives Biden a chance to deliver on one of his top campaign promises, and he’ll hope that the Black voters who were crucial to his election win will see this as a return on their investment.\n\nWhile Jackson was the leading contender, the official said the President gave “considerable weight” to other finalists, including Judge J. Michelle Childs and California Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger.\n\nFor more than a year, the President had familiarized himself with her work, reading many of her opinions and other writings, along with those of other contenders.\n\nBut Biden was also was impressed by her life story, including her rise from federal public defender to federal appellate judge – and her upbringing as the daughter of two public school teachers and administrators.\n\n“Her parents grew up with segregation, but never gave up hope that their children would enjoy the true promise of America,” the President said Friday.\n\n“Her opinions are always carefully reasoned, tethered to precedent and demonstrate respect for how the law impacts everyday people,” Biden said. “It doesn’t mean she puts her thumb on the scale of justice one way or the other. But she understands the broader impacts of her decisions, whether it’s cases addressing the rights of workers or government service. She cares about making sure that our democracy works for the American people. She listens. She looks people in the eye – lawyers, defendants victims and families – and she strives ensure that everyone understands why she made a decision, what the law is, and what it means to them. She strives to be fair, to get it right, to do justice. That’s something all of us should remember. And it’s something I’ve thought about throughout this process.”\n\nNomination process\n\nEyes will now turn to the Senate, where Biden’s Democratic Party holds the thinnest possible majority. The President will hope that Jackson can garner bipartisan support, but Democrats will need all their members in Washington to ensure her confirmation.\n\nUnlike for most major pieces of legislation, Democrats do not need Republican help to confirm a Supreme Court justice and can do it with their 50 votes and Vice President Kamala Harris breaking a deadlock. When Jackson was confirmed to the appellate bench, she had the support of three Republican senators. Harris, whom the White House said played an active role in the selection process, was working the phones Friday morning, calling senators as the news was reported.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has indicated that he wants to push a nominee through the process quickly, using Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett’s Senate proceedings as a model for Jackson’s confirmation timeline. And Sen. Dick Durbin, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told CNN recently that he expects to have a hearing within a few weeks of the selection.\n\nThe goal of the leadership is to have the nominee confirmed by the April 11 recess.\n\nJackson is expected to have her courtesy meetings with senators next week, according to a person familiar with the plans. It’s common for Supreme Court nominees to meet with the leadership on both sides, then members of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nBiden first committed to nominating a Black female US Supreme Court justice when he was running for president in 2020. On a debate stage in South Carolina, Biden argued that his push to make “sure there’s a Black woman on the Supreme Court” was rooted in an effort to “get everyone represented.”\n\nThough there are currently no Black women serving in the United States Senate in a position to vote for the nominee, Black female House members, all Democrats, applauded Biden for “fulfilling his campaign promise.”\n\nCongressional Black Caucus chair Rep. Joyce Beatty of Ohio said the nomination is “something that I will remember forever.” Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman of New Jersey said Jackson will “bring a new, necessary perspective” to the court and “will also be an inspiration to Black women and girls everywhere.” Rep. Frederica Wilson of Florida said she “never dreamed that, in my lifetime, I would see a Black woman nominated” to the Supreme Court.\n\nPersonal history\n\nJackson was born in the nation’s capital but grew up in the Miami area. She was a member of the debate team at Miami Palmetto Senior High School before earning both her undergraduate degree and law degree at Harvard.\n\nShe also previously clerked for Breyer and served as a federal public defender in Washington – an experience that her backers say is fitting, given Biden’s commitment to putting more public defenders on the federal bench. She was also a commissioner on the US Sentencing Commission and served on the federal district court in DC, as an appointee of President Barack Obama, before Biden elevated her to the DC Circuit last year.\n\nJackson thanked Breyer in her speech.\n\n“Justice Breyer, in particular, not only gave me the greatest job that any young lawyer could ever hope to have, but he also exemplified every day, in every way, that a Supreme Court justice can perform at the highest level of skill and integrity, while also being guided by civility, grace, pragmatism and generosity of spirit,” Jackson said. “Justice Breyer, the members of the Senate will decide if I fill your seat, but please know that I could never fill your shoes.”\n\nAt her 2021 confirmation hearing for the appellate court, she connected her family’s professions – her parents worked in public schools – to her decision to work as a public defender.\n\n“I come from a background of public service. My parents were in public service, my brother was a police officer and (was) in the military,” she said at the time, “and being in the public defenders’ office felt very much like the opportunity to help with my skills and talents.”\n\nFormer House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican, is a relative by marriage and introduced her at the 2013 hearing for her district court nomination.\n\nRyan also congratulated Jackson Friday.\n\n“Janna and I are incredibly happy for Ketanji and her entire family. Our politics may differ, but my praise for Ketanji’s intellect, for her character, and for her integrity, is unequivocal,” Ryan said.\n\nAt the White House Friday, Jackson noted that an uncle was previously given a life sentence on drug charges, an issue of which she hasn’t previously spoken about publicly.\n\n“You may have read that I have one uncle who got caught up in the drug trade and received a life sentence,” Jackson said. “That is true, but law enforcement also runs in my family. In addition to my brother, I had two uncles who served decades as police officers, one of whom became the police chief in my hometown of Miami, Florida.”\n\nIn 2008, when Jackson was in private practice and well before she became a judge, Jackson referred her uncle’s file to WilmerHale, a law firm that handles numerous clemency petitions, according to a spokesperson for the firm.\n\nThe firm submitted the petition on Brown’s behalf on October 7, 2014, and Obama commuted his sentence on November 22, 2016. According to the firm, Jackson had “no further involvement in the matter” after making the referral. Jackson’s chambers said she would decline comment on the issue.\n\n“I am standing here today by the grace of God as testament to the love and support that I’ve received from my family,” Jackson added Friday.\n\nRepublicans signal potential opposition\n\nAs a judge in DC – where some of the most politically charged cases are filed – Jackson’s issued notable rulings touching on Congress’ ability to investigate the White House. As a district court judge, she wrote a 2019 opinion siding with House lawmakers who sought the testimony of then-White House Counsel Don McGahn. Last year, she was on the unanimous circuit panel that ordered disclosure of certain Trump White House documents to the House January 6 committee.\n\nAs a judge, some other notable cases she has in her record are a 2018 case brought federal employee unions where she blocked parts of executive orders issued by Trump, and a case where she ruled against Trump policies that expand the categories of non-citizens who could be subject to expedited removal procedures without being able to appear before a judge.\n\nJackson penned more than 500 opinions in the eight years she spent on the district court.\n\nThough Biden has said that he’d pick a nominee with bipartisan appeal who is “worthy of Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence and decency,” his decision to name the first Black woman to the court is already facing Republican opposition. Several Senate Republicans have told CNN they disagreed with the President’s decision to name a Black woman to the court rather than judging a nominee squarely on their credentials, even though Ronald Reagan and Trump both said they’d name a female justice to the Supreme Court when they were on the campaign trail.\n\nEven before Biden nominated Jackson, GOP senators and Senate candidates were already concluding that she’d be far left, throwing cold water on the names floated as being on Biden’s potential short list and calling for a slow confirmation process. Still, Republicans are limited in their ability to block a Supreme Court nominee, and Jackson may win the support of some GOP senators.\n\nSens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Susan Collins of Maine all voted for Jackson last summer when she was confirmed as a circuit court judge on the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, the second most important court in the country.\n\nCollins touted Jackson’s “impressive academic and legal credentials” following the announcement. But Graham, who had expressed support for Childs, suggested Jackson does not have his approval, saying in a tweet that the choice of Jackson “means the radical Left has won President Biden over yet again.” Graham added that he expects a “respectful but interesting hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee.”\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell called for a “rigorous, exhaustive” review of Jackson in a statement.\n\n“I also understand Judge Jackson was “impressive academic and legal credentials the favored choice of far-left dark-money groups that have spent years attacking the legitimacy and structure of the Court itself,” McConnell said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments, reaction and background information.", "authors": ["Jake Tapper Ariane De Vogue Jeff Zeleny Betsy Klein Maegan Vazquez", "Jake Tapper", "Ariane De Vogue", "Jeff Zeleny", "Betsy Klein", "Maegan Vazquez"], "publish_date": "2022/02/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/04/politics/ketanji-brown-jackson-committee-vote/index.html", "title": "Ketanji Brown Jackson expected to be confirmed this week after ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nJudge Ketanji Brown Jackson is expected to be confirmed as the first Black woman Supreme Court justice this week, after a bipartisan group of senators voted on Monday to advance her nomination.\n\nAfter the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 11-11, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called for a vote to break the deadlock and send her nomination to the floor. Every Democrat and three Republican senators – Susan Collins of Maine, Mitt Romney of Utah and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska – voted in support of Jackson.\n\nSenate Republican and Democratic leaders agree that Jackson is a well-qualified nominee, but almost all GOP senators are expected to oppose her. Jackson, 51, sits on DC’s federal appellate court and had been considered the front-runner for the vacancy since Justice Stephen Breyer announced his retirement. Jackson previously worked as a clerk for Breyer, a federal public defender, an attorney in private practice, a federal district court judge and a member of the US Sentencing Commission.\n\n“Justice Jackson will bring to the Supreme Court, the highest level of skill, integrity, civility and grace,” said Illinois Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin, the Judiciary Committee chairman, in explaining his support for her on Monday. “This committee’s action today is nothing less than making history. I’m honored to be part of it.”\n\nBut the vast majority of Senate Republicans will oppose her, citing concerns with her judicial philosophy, or lack thereof, her sentencing in some criminal cases and her advocacy for certain clients. So far, only three Senate Republicans – Collins, Romney and Murkowski – have said they would support Jackson.\n\n“My support rests on Judge Jackson’s qualifications, which no one questions; her demonstrated judicial independence; her demeanor and temperament; and the important perspective she would bring to the court as a replacement for Justice Breyer,” said Murkowski on Monday. “It also rests on my rejection of the corrosive politicization of the review process for Supreme Court nominees, which, on both sides of the aisle, is growing worse and more detached from reality by the year.”\n\nSome GOP senators said on Monday they were not swayed by Jackson’s assertion that she does not have a judicial philosophy per se but instead a methodology that ensures she rules impartially.\n\n“The judge must call balls and strikes,” said Texas GOP Sen. John Cornyn, alluding to Chief Justice John Roberts’ metaphor comparing a judge to an umpire. “And given what I’ve seen, and her unwillingness to disclose her judicial philosophy, and disavow an expansionist view of unenumerated rights, I have concerns that Judge Jackson will be pinch hitting for one team or the other.”\n\nOther Republican senators portrayed Jackson as a pawn of the “radical left.” Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said he believed “she will prove to be the most extreme and the furthest-left justice ever to serve on the United States Supreme Court.” Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton said Jackson would “coddle criminals and terrorists.” And Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley lambasted her sentencing decisions in some child pornography cases.\n\nDemocrats said that some Republicans were fear-mongering and cherry-picking cases, noting she authored over 550 cases in her eight years as a district judge and had already been confirmed by the Senate to three prior positions. California Sen. Dianne Feinstein said that Jackson “had the very low reversal rate of only 2%.” Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal said the GOP had engaged in “meritless demagoguery” and “concocted outrage.” And New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker noted Jackson’s support from law enforcement groups, including the International Association of Chiefs of Police and the Fraternal Order of Police, and those advocating for victims like the National Children’s Alliance.\n\nOne potential Republican vote for Jackson was South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, who supported Jackson a year ago for her current job. But he said last week that he would oppose her, citing her sentencing for cases of child pornography and representation of detainees at Guantanamo Bay.\n\nGraham, a member of the Judiciary Committee, said that while Jackson exhibits “exceptionally good character,” she was too lenient in sentencing those cases and had an “activist zeal” in calling former President George W. Bush and former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld war criminals in legal briefs as she advocated for a detainee.\n\n“My decision is based upon her record of judicial activism, flawed sentencing methodology regarding child pornography cases and a belief Judge Jackson will not be deterred by the plain meaning of the law when it comes to liberal causes,” said Graham.\n\nAn in-depth CNN review of the child pornography cases showed that Jackson had mostly followed common judicial sentencing practices. It has become a norm among judges to issue sentences below the guidelines in such cases that don’t involve producing the pornography itself. As for her advocacy for Guantanamo detainees, Jackson argued that they had been tortured and subjected to other inhumane treatment but did not explicitly use the phrase “war criminal.” Jackson’s four detainee clients were not convicted and were eventually released from Guantanamo.\n\nDurbin refuted Graham on both issues on the Senate floor last week, calling Jackson “in the mainstream of sentencing” of child pornography cases and saying Republicans have also voted for President Donald Trump’s judges who “do exactly the same thing she does.” He said it was a “gross exaggeration and unfair on its face” to say that Jackson had called Bush administration officials “war criminals.”\n\nIt’s rare for the Senate Judiciary Committee to tie on a Supreme Court nomination. But nomination battles have become increasingly contentious, and the current Senate is split 50-50, so there are an even number of Democrats and Republicans on the panel, rather than the majority party holding more seats.\n\nOver the past five decades, the panel has deadlocked once – over Clarence Thomas, who was facing sexual harassment allegations. Fifteen justices – William Rehnquist, John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O’Connor, Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, John Roberts, Samuel Alito, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, Neil Gorsuch , Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett – passed the committee during that timeframe.\n\nIn 1987, Democrats who controlled the committee voted to unfavorably recommend President Ronald Reagan’s nominee Robert Bork on ideological grounds. And in 2020, Democrats boycotted a committee vote on Barrett, arguing that the chamber should not consider President Donald Trump’s lifetime appointment to the court while the country was voting in the presidential election.\n\nIn the Trump era, Senate Republicans strengthened the conservatives’ grip on the court from 5-4 to 6-3, after holding up President Barack Obama’s nominee Merrick Garland during another election year – 2016 – and then confirming Gorsuch in 2017, and Coney Barrett in 2020 to replace the late Ginsburg. Jackson’s confirmation would likely replace a liberal – Breyer – with another.\n\n“I think all indications are that Judge Jackson is going to be a liberal activist from the bench,” said Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell on Fox last week. “But the good news for people like me, is the Court is still 6-3.”\n\n“We made massive changes over the last four years that I think put the Court in a very solid position with a great number of judges who believe in the quaint notion that maybe a judge ought to follow the law,” he added.\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments Monday.", "authors": ["Alex Rogers"], "publish_date": "2022/04/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/29/politics/supreme-court-jackson-investiture/index.html", "title": "Supreme Court investiture marks another historic first for Justice ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe Supreme Court, a place bound by tradition and formality, will hold one of its most scripted rituals on Friday for a justice whose appointment broke the mold of history.\n\nThe investiture ceremony for Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first Black woman on the bench, will be marked by pomp from the ages, including the use of Chief Justice John Marshall’s historic bench chair and commission language that dates to the first justice, John Jay, appointed by President George Washington.\n\n“Know ye,” the presidential commission, as read by Clerk of Court Scott Harris, will begin, “that reposing special trust and confidence in the wisdom, uprightness, and learning of Ketanji Brown Jackson … in testimony whereof, I have caused these letters to be made patent and the seal of the Department of Justice to be hereunto affixed.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden, who selected Jackson, will attend the Friday morning ceremony, a White House official told CNN. It is customary before the event for the president to chat privately with the justices in a conference room and to sign the court’s oversized guest book.\n\nThe official told CNN that Vice President Kamala Harris, first lady Jill Biden and second gentleman Doug Emhoff will also be at the investiture.\n\nNo cameras are allowed inside the courtroom, and photographers usually wait outside for the new justice to emerge from the ceremony and take the traditional walk down the 36 marble steps at the front of the columned building. Per custom, Jackson will be accompanied by Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nIn the court’s 233-year history, no African American woman has participated in this rite and gone on to decide the law of the land. Of the total 116 justices over time, all but eight have been White men. Jackson is the sixth woman on the bench; three of the others are still serving: Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Amy Coney Barrett.\n\nThe symbolic moment comes as Biden, who vowed during his 2020 campaign to appoint the first Black woman justice, continues to emphasize diversity in his judicial picks. He has nominated 143 federal judges, 68% of whom are women and 66% people of color. He has nominated 13 Black women as circuit court judges, with seven confirmed so far.\n\nJackson, 52, who previously sat on US district and appellate courts, took her official Supreme Court oaths at the end of June when Justice Stephen Breyer retired. Jackson has been voting on emergency cases and preparing for the upcoming 2022-23 session since then. She participated in Wednesday’s first closed-door session for the new term, as the nine culled through case petitions that had arrived over the summer and hashed out procedures for their building, opening to the public for the first time since it was closed in March 2020 because of Covid-19.\n\nThe special sitting of the court to receive the commission of a new justice was instituted in the early 1970s by then-Chief Justice Warren Burger, who reveled in the trappings of the institution.\n\nBurger also started the use of the Marshall chair, distinguished by a black horsehair seat and backrest, with brass nail trim. The new justice sits in the chair before being escorted to the bench to take the oath.\n\nFriday’s investiture, the first for a Democratic appointee in 12 years, is also likely to bring out, along with family and friends of Jackson, progressive luminaries of the law. Earlier such events for GOP appointees saw the Republican old guard hobnobbing in the courtroom before the event. An invitation-only reception will be held at the court afterward. Outside, crowds of well-wishers sometimes gather. Occasionally, it’s protesters.\n\nAs carefully arranged as these investitures are, they have not been without glitch. The attorney general usually stands at the lectern to present the commission, which has been previously signed by the president.\n\nIn November 2018, one day before the formal investiture for Brett Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions, for wholly unrelated reasons. Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker then undertook the duty of referring the parchment commission to the court.\n\nAnother asterisk to the Kavanaugh ceremony: Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s black leather chair at the bench was empty. She had fallen and fractured her ribs. When she was hospitalized for that injury, physicians discovered lung cancer, for which she had surgery that December. Ginsburg died in September 2020.\n\nThe courtroom audience for the investiture of her successor, Barrett, was scaled back because of pandemic precautions, and for that event, held in 2021, Kavanaugh’s chair was unoccupied. He had just tested positive for Covid-19.\n\nCurrent Attorney General Merrick Garland will be in place on Friday to ask Clerk Harris to read the parchment commission for the record. Garland at one time might have been at the elevated bench himself. Former President Barack Obama nominated Garland in 2016 to succeed the late Justice Antonin Scalia, but Senate Republicans blocked action on the nomination.\n\nBreyer is expected to be back in the courtroom for the special sitting. He will watch from one of the spectator seats close to the front of the room. Among the other judicial dignitaries expected are colleagues from the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, where Jackson sat from mid-2021 until her high court confirmation this year and the US District Court in DC where Jackson first wore the black robe, including Paul Friedman and Ellen Huvelle.\n\nOther close friends and mentors on her list are US District Court Judges Patti Saris, of Massachusetts, and Landya McCafferty, of New Hampshire, as well as US Appeals Court Judge Ray Lohier, of New York.\n\nThe new justice’s husband, Patrick Jackson, a surgeon, will be in the courtroom, along with their daughters Leila and Talia. Jackson grew up in the Miami area, and her parents who still live in Florida, Johnny and Ellery Brown, are scheduled to attend the ceremony.\n\nMaking history\n\nThe first justice to be seated, for investiture purposes, in the chair of Chief Justice Marshall (who served 1801-1835) was Lewis Powell in January 1972. He was immediately followed by William Rehnquist, sworn in on the same day as an associated justice. (Rehnquist became chief justice in 1986.)\n\nPowell was succeeding Hugo Black, and Rehnquist, John Marshall Harlan. (Both predecessor justices had been ailing when they left the bench in September 1971 and died soon after.)\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Judge Jackson in remarks: I am the dream of the slave 02:17 - Source: CNN\n\nThe Powell and Rehnquist appointments were the third and fourth of then-President Richard Nixon. According to The New York Times, a single picketer marched outside the investiture with a sign that said, “America mourns the death of an institution.”\n\nIt just so happens that Sandra Day O’Connor, a dear friend of Rehnquist from Arizona, was there that January 7, 1972, day. It was her first time in the courtroom. And within a decade, O’Connor, a lawyer, state senator and then state court judge, sat in the John Marshall chair. President Ronald Reagan appointed her in 1981, making O’Connor the nation’s first woman justice.\n\nNow Jackson will be the first African American woman to rule on high court cases. The nine justices will return to the courtroom on Monday for the beginning of the 2022-23 session.\n\nAlready on the calendar are disputes testing whether colleges and universities may continue to use students’ race as a factor in admissions for campus diversity and the breadth of Voting Rights Act protections against discriminatory electoral practices.\n\nAfter the commission is read, Roberts will administer the judicial oath, during which a new justice swears to “administer justice without respect to persons … do equal right to the poor and to the rich … faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all the duties incumbent upon” an associate justice of the Supreme Court “under the Constitution and laws of the United States.”\n\nThe entire ceremony usually lasts only about five minutes.\n\nWhen Roberts and Jackson then stand out front, as photographers capture the scene, they will be joined, per the schedule, by Jackson’s husband.\n\nRarely is much said in this one moment in the public lens.\n\nBut back in 1981, when Burger descended the steps with O’Connor, the chief justice quipped to photographers, “You’ve never seen me with a better-looking justice, have you?”\n\nIf Burger’s remark put off O’Connor, the first woman justice didn’t let it show.", "authors": ["Joan Biskupic"], "publish_date": "2022/09/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/04/07/senate-confirm-ketanji-brown-jackson-first-black-woman-scotus/9473483002/", "title": "Ketanji Brown Jackson confirmed by Senate as first Black woman on ...", "text": "Ketanji Brown Jackson is the first Black woman to serve on the nation's highest court.\n\nThe Senate voted 53-47 to confirm her with three Republicans joining Democrats to approve her.\n\nShe will replace Stephen Breyer who's expected to stay on the high court for a few more months.\n\nWASHINGTON – The Senate confirmed Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court on Thursday afternoon, making her the 116th justice – and first Black woman – to serve on the nation's highest court.\n\nThe Senate's historic vote was 53-47, and three Republicans – Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitt Romney of Utah – joined every member of the Democratic caucus in voting for her confirmation.\n\nPresident Joe Biden nominated Jackson in February after Associate Justice Stephen Breyer announced he would retire at the end of this court term. Though confirmed, Jackson, 51, will wait months to take her seat on the bench, until Breyer officially steps down.\n\nWhat is the Supreme Court? Everything you need to know about the SCOTUS and its justices\n\nThough Jackson's ascension will not change the ideological makeup of the court – where conservatives hold a 6-3 advantage – she will be the first federal public defender to sit on the high court. Of the 115 justices in the Supreme Court's 233-year history, 108 have been white men. Only five have been women, and three have been people of color.\n\nWhen Jackson takes her seat, it will be the first time the court's nine-member bench will include two Black justices and four female justices.\n\n\"Judge Jackson’s confirmation was a historic moment for our nation,\" Biden tweeted after the vote. \"We’ve taken another step toward making our highest court reflect the diversity of America. She will be an incredible Justice, and I was honored to share this moment with her.\"\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, the first Black woman to serve in her role, presided over the Senate for the vote. Most of the senators were in their seats, announcing their vote aloud one-by-one alphabetically before Harris read the final tally to the packed chamber.\n\nThe chamber erupted in cheers after Harris announced the vote.\n\n\"It's an extraordinary day, and I think it's a very important statement today about who we are as a nation that we put Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson on the highest court of our land,\" a \"very proud\" Harris said after the vote.\n\n\"I think it makes a very important statement about who we aspire to be, who we are, who we believe ourselves to be,\" she said. \"It's a statement that on our highest court in the land, we want to make sure there's going to be full representation and the finest and the brightest and the best, and that's what happened today.\"\n\nSen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., one of only three Black senators – none of whom is a women – told USA TODAY that during the vote, Harris encouraged him and Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., to write letters to young girls in their life. Harris gave them paper from her office, which features a gold seal and says \"The Vice President.\"\n\n\"Seeing Judge Jackson ascend to the Supreme Court reflects the promise of progress on which our democracy risks. What a great day it is in America,\" Warnock said. \"Today, the word of justice and equal protection under the law becomes flesh.\"\n\nBiden and Jackson watched the results of the Senate vote on her nomination in the Roosevelt Room, alongside White House senior staff. Biden, Harris and Jackson will deliver remarks on the judge’s confirmation Friday on the South Lawn of the White House.\n\nThe momentous vote was temporarily overshadowed by the news of a COVID-19 outbreak among several lawmakers who attended Saturday's Gridiron Club dinner featuring journalists and politicians. Several senators attended the dinner, all of whom showed up for Thursday's vote.\n\nJackson serves on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, appointed by Biden. She previously served as a U.S. District Court judge, appointed by President Barack Obama. Before that, the Harvard Law School graduate served as vice chair of the U.S. Sentencing Commission and as a federal public defender.\n\nJackson, a former clerk for Breyer, was a front-runner for Biden's first Supreme Court nomination. Her confirmation marks the fourth time she was approved by the Senate. She was confirmed to her role on the Court of Appeals with bipartisan support last year, including Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., Collins and Murkowski.\n\nDuring his presidential campaign, Biden promised to nominate a Black woman to the high court. At a primary debate in South Carolina in 2020, he said, \"I'm looking forward to making sure there's a Black woman on the Supreme Court, to make sure we, in fact, get every representation.\"\n\nWhile much of Biden's agenda is held up in the 50-50 Senate, Jackson's confirmation will be one of the lasting legacies of his first term. Democratic senators made sure to highlight the significance of the moment.\n\nJackson likely confirmed in a hurry. Getting on the Supreme Court? That'll take time.\n\nDespite her earlier confirmations, the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Jackson's nomination took an acrimonious turn.\n\nThough Republican members of the committee largely praised Jackson's character and demeanor, they accused her of being soft on crime – in particular, they said she offered too-lenient sentences in a number of child pornography cases. GOP Sens. Graham, Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Ted Cruz of Texas and Josh Hawley of Missouri led the crusade against Jackson. In addition to her record on sentencing, they pushed Jackson on hot political topics such as gender, packing the court and critical race theory. Some Republicans took issue with her representing accused enemy combatants from the military's Guantanamo Bay detention facility in Cuba when she was a public defender.\n\n\"Based on her record, I believe she will prove to be the furthest left of any justice who has ever served on the Supreme Court,\" Cruz said before the vote Thursday.\n\nJudicial philosophy to child porn sentencing: Takeaways from Ketanji Brown Jackson's Supreme Court hearings\n\nMurkowski, one of the three Republicans to break from her conference in support of Jackson, said after the vote that she hadn't faced any pushback from Republican leaders or her colleagues.\n\n\"The confirmation of Judge Jackson is one that will help to ensure that the face of the United States Supreme Court is more representative of the American people,\" she said. \"I think that that is important.\"\n\nDemocrats stressed the historic nature of Jackson's nomination and what it means to have a Black woman join the court.\n\nDuring one of the hearings, Jackson teared up as Bookerspoke about how meaningful her nomination was to him.\n\n\"You have earned this spot. You are worthy,\" Booker told Jackson.\n\n\"I’m sorry, you’re a person that is so much more than your race and gender,\" he said. \"But for me, I’m sorry, it’s hard for me not to look at you and not see my mom, not to see my cousins. ...

For the most recent updates, click here.\n\nWASHINGTON – Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, President Joe Biden's nominee to the Supreme Court, made history Monday as she faced senators on the first day of a marathon process to potentially be confirmed as the nation's first Black woman on the Supreme Court.\n\nAcross more than two centuries of American history, the Supreme Court has had 115 justices. Only five have been women. Just one has been a woman of color. Before Jackson, a Black woman had never been nominated to the high court.\n\nHer nomination is the latest barrier to fall at the highest levels of American government. More than a year ago, then-Sen. Kamala Harris made history as the first woman and first woman of color to be sworn in as vice president.\n\nIn an emotional opening statement, Sen. Cory Booker, the New Jersey Democrat and only Black member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he could barely contain his joy in seeing Jackson in the Capitol for her confirmation.\n\n“This is not a normal day for America,” Booker said, harkening to other historic firsts for the court. “We have never had this moment before.”\n\nSenators from both sides of the aisle celebrated the historic nature of Jackson's nomination on Monday, but they also started to draw their own battle lines before the real fireworks likely begin Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nJackson will face questions from members of the Senate Judiciary Committee the rest of this week before members make a report on her confirmation to the full Senate.\n\nDemocrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee emphasized Jackson's role in the greater history of the Supreme Court, which has never had a Black woman as a justice.\n\n\"You, Judge Jackson, can be the first,\" Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin said, noting that being first isn't always easy. \"Today is a proud day for America.\"\n\nThe news come to you:Sign up for the OnPolitics newsletter here and say informed on everything politics\n\nGallery:Biden nominates U.S. Circuit Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to Supreme Court\n\nRead her prepared statement\n\n\"Chairman Durbin, Ranking Member Grassley, and Distinguished Members of the Judiciary Committee: thank you for convening this hearing and for considering my nomination as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. I am humbled and honored to be here, and I am truly grateful for the generous introductions that my former judicial colleague, Judge Tom Griffith, and my close friend Professor Lisa Fairfax have so graciously provided.\n\nI am also very thankful for the confidence that President Biden has placed in me and for the kindness that he and the First Lady, and the Vice President and Second Gentleman, have extended to me and my family.\n\nIn her own words:Ketanji Brown Jackson's opening statement:\n\nDurbin dismisses idea that Jackson is soft on crime\n\nDemocratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, dismissed GOP accusations that Judge Jackson is soft on crime.\n\n“Those of us who are on the committee can tell you that every nominee from the Biden administration faces the same charge, regardless of their background, regardless of their record,” Durbin told reporters after the first day of the hearing.\n\n“It is a campaign theme for 2022. It's played out every time the Judiciary Committee considers” a nomination, Jones said. “I don't think there's any credibility to it.”\n\n-- Dylan Wells\n\nSupreme Court Sherpa Doug Jones reflects on first day\n\n“We're very hopeful that this hearing is going to go as well as it did today,” former Sen. Doug Jones, D-Ala., told reporters after the first day of the confirmation hearing. Jones serves as Supreme Court Sherpa, helping Judge Jackson navigate the Hill.\n\n“No one is perfect. Everybody's gonna find something that they are not happy about,” said Jones of GOP criticism of Jackson. “Nothing that we've heard today was something that we haven't heard before.”\n\n“I think there's gonna be some very pointed questions about her record, and that's what the senators are there for. I think she will be prepared,” Jones said. Jackson delivered an opening statement today, but won’t be questioned until tomorrow.\n\nJones said it will be “very simple” for Jackson to argue that she’s not soft on crime due to her record, an attack leveled by some Republicans. As for Missouri GOP Sen. Josh Hawley listing a number of child pornography cases today that he hopes to question Jackson about, Jones said “given his tweets and statements, it was not surprising. We expected those and she will be able to talk about each one of those cases.\"\n\nAsked if Jackson will share her thoughts on if the court should be expanded, another criticism from Republicans, Jones said, “I don’t think any judicial nominee should be talking about legislative policy. Everybody understands that the size of the Supreme Court is an issue for this body, for the Congress – it is not for the court.”\n\n“I think what you saw today was a concerted effort on everyone’s part to make sure that this nominee gets her hearing in a very respectful way,” Jones said.\n\n-- Dylan Wells\n\nIn case you missed it:Biden formally introduces 'truly humbled' Ketanji Brown Jackson as Supreme Court pick\n\nJackson: Lengthy legal opinions show value of transparency\n\nJudge Ketanji Brown Jackson said she has developed a reputation for writing long.\n\nAbout her nearly 600 opinions the Senate Judiciary Committee has collected as part of her confirmation process for the Supreme Court, Jackson joked about the length of the reading material, saying she strives to be explicit in her writings.\n\n“I believe in transparency, that people should know precisely what I think and basis for my decision,” she said.\n\nHer time as a public defender have made her sensitive to litigants’ need to understand that they have been heard by their judge, even if they don’t prevail.\n\nShe said she has dedicated her career to ensuring the words “equal justice under law” engraved on the front of the Supreme Court building “are a reality and not just an idea.”\n\n-- Rick Rouan\n\nMore:We binge-watched 14 hours of Ketanji Brown Jackson's speeches. Here’s what we learned.\n\nJackson pledges to be an 'independent' and 'neutral' judge\n\nPerhaps anticipating Republican criticism, Jackson pledged to be a Supreme Court justice who will adhere to the Constitution and not to her personal views.\n\n\"I have been a judge for nearly a decade now, and I take that responsibility and my duty to be independent very seriously,\" Jackson said. \"I decide cases from a neutral posture.\"\n\nWhile critics have accused her of being a liberal ideologue, Jackson said that \"I evaluate the facts, and I interpret and apply the law to the facts of the case before me, without fear or favor, consistent with my judicial oath.\"\n\n-- David Jackson\n\nJackson: Name honors African heritage\n\nThe first Black woman nominated to the Supreme Court said she got her name from her parents' pride in their African heritage.\n\nKetanji Brown Jackson said her parents were told that her given name, Ketanji Onyika, meant “lovely one.”\n\n“My parents taught me that, unlike the many barriers that they had had to face growing up, my path was clearer, such that if I worked hard and believed in myself, in America I could do anything or be anything I wanted to be,” she said. “Like so many families in this country, they worked long hours and sacrificed to provide their children every opportunity to reach their God-given potential.”\n\n-- Rick Rouan\n\nJackson thanks her husband and daughters\n\nLike most nominees, Jackson isn't talking about issues and is instead stressing personal qualities - particularly family.\n\nPraising her husband, Dr. Patrick Jackson, the Supreme Court nominee said: \"I have no doubt that, without him by my side from the very beginning of this incredible professional journey, none of this would have been possible.\"\n\nJackson also praised daughters Talia and Leila: \"Girls, I know it has not been easy as I have tried to navigate the challenges of juggling my career and motherhood. And I fully admit that I did not always get the balance right.\"\n\n\"But,\" she added, \"I hope that you have seen that with hard work, determination, and love, it can be done.\"\n\n-- David Jackson\n\nJackson: My faith sustains me\n\nAfter thanking President Biden and other officials for her nomination, Jackson also spoke about her religious roots.\n\n\"While I am on the subject of gratitude, I must also pause to reaffirm my thanks to God, for it is faith that sustains me at this moment,\" Jackson said. :Even prior to today, I can honestly say that my life had been blessed beyond measure.\"\n\n-- David Jackson\n\nJackson stresses her history of being confirmed\n\nThe Supreme Court nominee opened with a subtle reminder to the assembled senators: You have confirmed me for three previous jobs.\n\n\"Today will be the fourth time that I have had the honor of appearing before this Committee to be considered for confirmation,\" Jackson said in her opening statement.\n\nThat includes the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., Jackson's current position.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nHearing preview:What to watch for in Ketanji Brown Jackson's hearing\n\nLisa Fairfax introduces Jackson as a role model who ‘defines friendship.’\n\nLisa Fairfax, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Law, introduced her friend Jackson before she spoke at the Senate judiciary confirmation hearing.\n\n“She's the friend that made sure we all (belonged.) A woman of deep faith in God and unyielding love for family,” said Fairfax, who first met Jackson in college.\n\nThe two have remained friends for 35 years, she said. The Supreme Court nominee appeared to wipe a tear as Fairfax spoke of how Jackson showed their friend group the power of hard work in transforming “the seemingly impossible into the achievable.”\n\n-- Chelsey Cox\n\nBiden wishes Jackson good luck\n\nPresident Joe Biden called Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson on Sunday night to wish her good luck with her confirmation hearing this week, the White House said.\n\nBiden has been receiving regular updates on the hearing, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said.\n\n-- Michael Collins\n\nBlackburn promises \"tough questions\" for Jackson\n\nSen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., one of the most outspoken Republican critics of Jackson's nomination, promised \"tough questions\" for the nominee at the hearings, but said they would be asked respectfully.\n\nBlackburn's complaints about Jackson included issues of parental rights, trans athletes, education policy, mask mandates, criminal justice, court packing and the length of prison sentences for child pornographers.\n\n“I can only wonder, what’s your hidden agenda?\" Blackburn asked Jackson at one point.\n\nBlackburn's criticism echoed those of other Republicans, though there is no indication they have the votes to derail her nomination.\n\nHer statement also concluded the opening statements by senators.\n\n-– David Jackson\n\nMore:What's next for Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson?

Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said he would retain an “open mind” as he considered whether Ketanji Brown Jackson’s judicial philosophy fits with how he would prefer a Supreme Court justice to weigh cases.\n\n“I don’t want an activist at either end of the spectrum,” Tillis said during opening remarks on Monday, saying he told all three of former President Donald Trump’s nominees that he expected they would deliver opinions he disagreed with.\n\n“If we are talking about preserving the integrity of the Supreme Court, there’s no place on the court for judicial activism,” he said.\n\nTillis said justices should call “balls and strikes” based on the law.\n\nCalling the first nomination of a Black woman to the court “quite extraordinary,” Tillis said Jackson was showing “young boys and girls” that sitting on the high court was within reach.\n\n-- Rick Rouan\n\nIn her own words:We binge-watched 14 hours of Ketanji Brown Jackson's speeches. Here’s what we learned.\n\nSen. Alex Padilla: \"You are ready to blaze this trail\"\n\nSen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., stressing his own Latino roots, said Jackson's nomination to be the first Black woman on the Supreme Court proves the need for '\"more voices\" and \"more perspectives\" in government.\n\n\"You are ready to blaze this trial,\" said Padilla, who also echoed other Democrats in stressing Jackson's years of judicial and legal experience.\n\n\"You are clearly more than qualified,\" Padilla said.\n\nPadilla closed his opening statement by speaking in Spanish in praise of the nominee - perhaps a first for a Supreme Court nomination hearing.\n\n-– David Jackson\n\nReview:Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson's opinions shows outcomes cut both ways\n\nRep. Jackson Lee dismisses Hawley’s child pornography remarks\n\nDuring the hearing lunch break, Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas told reporters that she expects that the child pornography questions raised by GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri “will be meritless.”\n\n“We will see how they are poised in the hearing. I don’t even call them charges, they are points that he wanted to make. But we’ll see how they poison hearings in terms of the questions to her,” Jackson Lee said.\n\nJackson Lee, a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, said of Judge Jackson, “I’m here to celebrate, but also going to be here to support her.”\n\nAs Jackson returned to the hearing room after the break, Jackson Lee approached the judge and grabbed her hands, before introducing herself to Jackson’s husband.\n\n– Dylan Wells\n\nBooker: ‘This is not a normal day for America’\n\nIn an emotional opening statement, Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., celebrated the historic nomination of a Black woman to the Supreme Court.\n\n“This is not a normal day for America,” Booker said, harkening to other historic firsts for the court. “We have never had this moment before.”\n\nIn its history, the court has had 115 justices, but only five have been women and only one has been a woman of color.\n\n“We are showing that we indeed will go deep into the waters of our nation and pull forth the best talent,” Booker said. Qualified candidates from underrepresented groups have had an “artificial barrier” that have kept them from sitting on the federal bench, he said.\n\nCiting his upbringing in a small Black church, Booker said he was struggling to contain the joy he felt over Jackson’s nomination.\n\n“The senate is poised right now to break another barrier. We are on the precipice of shattering another ceiling,” he said. “I just feel this sense of overwhelming joy as I see you sitting there.”\n\n-- Rick Rouan\n\nMore:Jackson says she's 'humbled' by historic nomination to Supreme Court as focus shifts to Senate\n\nTom Cotton: Biden administration is 'waging war on the rule of law'\n\nSen Tom Cotton, R-Ark., a Republican who is thinking of running for president, said little about Jackson's record, but instead focused on attacking the Biden administration in general.\n\nThe administration is \"waging war on the rule of law\" on issues like gun rights, border security, and executive power, Cotton said in his opening statement. He also hit the administration over rising crime rates, and claimed we are witnessing \"a breakdown\" of society.\n\nOfficials also want to \"pack the Supreme Court,\" Cotton said, and the panel should remain at \"nine justices and no more.\"\n\nAs for Jackson, Cotton – who voted against her for a lower court slot – said he enjoyed meeting the nominee and will have \"more questions\" for her in the days ahead.\n\n-– David Jackson\n\nHow does someone become a Supreme Court Justice?\n\nJackson must be approved by the Senate, a power given to the chamber in the Constitution.\n\nEvery aspect of Jackson's personal and professional life has been and will be scrutinized by both the Senate and general public. Senate staffers will read through all of her judicial decisions, speeches, interviews and any other information they can find to prepare lines of questioning for a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing.\n\nThough the Biden administration vetted Jackson before nominating her, new information could emerge during the confirmation process.\n\nRead the whole story here:What's next for Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson? A high-profile confirmation process\n\n-- Dylan Wells\n\nHirono condemns use of term 'affirmative action' to describe Jackson nomination\n\nSen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, condemned those who oppose the nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court by invoking the phrase “affirmative action.”\n\n“They have implied you were solely nominated due to your race,” she said, calling a conservative media personality’s demand for the judge to release her LSAT scores “incredibly offensive and condescending.”\n\nAs the first Black woman to be nominated to the court, Jackson would break new ground for a court long dominated by white men who make decisions for a diverse country, she said.\n\n“Your nomination is not about filling a quota. It’s about time,” she said. “It’s about time we have a highly qualified, highly accomplished Black woman on the Supreme Court. It’s about time the highest court reflects the country it serves. It’s about time Black women and girls can find someone who looks like them sitting on the court.”\n\n-- Rick Rouan\n\nWho were the women who preceded Jackson?:For Black women judges like Jackson, blazing a trail has meant opportunity, scrutiny\n\nHawley leans on pornography sentencing\n\nSen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., didn’t waste time going after Jackson directly on a line of attack he’s raised in recent days: That as a federal trial court judge, she handed down sentences for defendants of child pornography charges below sentencing guidelines.\n\nHawley's criticism was notable, in part, because it represented a departure from many other Republicans on the committee who have directed their ire at Democrats or the Supreme Court itself.\n\nHawley, a former attorney general from Missouri, went through several of the cases he has focused on.\n\nU.S. Sentencing Commission guidelines are not mandatory and the independent agency’s own research has demonstrated that the majority of federal possession charges are sentenced under the guidelines regardless of the judge involved in the case.\n\n\"She hasn’t had the chance yet to respond to this,\" Hawley noted. “I think it’s important that we hear from Judge Jackson in coming days.\"\n\nHawley, a potential 2024 presidential candidate, was closely watched heading into the hearing because he was the one who first raised the allegations in the first place. Several independent fact check organizations have found that the claims are missing important context, including a years-old debate about whether the guidelines are too harsh.\n\nHawley said he believes they are not.\n\n\"This committee has heard testimony from prosecutors and others who are grappling with the problem of how to get at this porn and those who distribute it,\" Hawley said. \"I think it's difficult, against this backdrop, to argue that the sentencing guidelines are too harsh or outmoded.\"\n\n– John Fritze\n\nWho would Jackson be replacing?:Pragmatist.

Richard Blumenthal gave the most robust defense of any Democratic senator on the committee thus far on President Joe Biden’s choice to nominate a Black woman to the high court.\n\n“The appointment of a Black woman to the U.S. Supreme Court – let’s be very blunt –should have happened years ago. This day is a giant leap into the present for our country and for the court,” he said.\n\nA poll released Monday by Monmouth University found 53% of Americans approve of the president’s pledge as a candidate.\n\nJackson will bring a different perspective to the court, Blumenthal, D-Conn., said, adding how representation is important to the judicial branch’s legitimacy and credibility.\n\n“Your service will make the court look more like America, hopefully too it will make the court think more like America,” he said.\n\n– Phillip M. Bailey\n\nSasse pushes back against 'broken' confirmation process\n\nSen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., said the Senate Judiciary Committee can break a cycle of confirmation hearings for Supreme Court justices that have become increasingly characterized by personal attacks as it considers the nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\nFollowing his Republican colleagues' invocation of conservative nominees he said faced unfair criticism, Sasse called the process “broken,” and a symptom of a “broader brokenness and the erosion of our constitutional structure.”\n\nSasse said “screamed threats” in 2018 from Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer, now the Senate majority leader, against justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh were an example of the “bullying” justices have faced. Schumer later apologized for comments made as the court heard a case about a Louisiana abortion law.\n\n“That’s weird. We should all be able to pause and say that’s weird. That kind of behavior shouldn’t happen,” Sasse said.\n\n– Rick Rouan\n\nJackson compared to Ruby Bridges\n\nSen. Chris Coons, D-Delaware, compared Jackson's expected walk through the door of becoming the first Black woman on the Supreme Court to the walk 6-year-old Ruby Bridges made in November 1960, when she became the first African American student to integrate a public school in the South.\n\n– Kevin McCoy\n\nWho is Ruby Bridges? 60 years ago, Ruby Bridges integrated a New Orleans school.

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, focused his opening statement on what has become a common theme of the hearing so far: Complaints about how Democrats handled past Supreme Court nominees from Republican presidents.\n\nAlmost as interesting is what Cruz didn't discuss: Much of anything about Jackson's record.\n\n\"This will not be a political circus,\" said Cruz, a potential 2024 presidential candidate. \"This will not be the kind of character smear that sadly our Democratic colleagues have gotten very good at.\"\n\n\"This is not about race,\" Cruz said. \"It is, however, about issues and substance.\"\n\nCruz also spent considerable time discussing the Supreme Court itself, arguing that it had become a quasi legislative body for progressive causes.\n\n\"It's much simpler to convince five lawyers in black robes than to try to convince 330 million Americans,\" Cruz said.\n\nIt is conservatives who have a 6-3 advantage on the current court.\n\n– John Fritze\n\nSupreme Court 101:What is the Supreme Court? Everything you need to know about the SCOTUS and its justices\n\nKlobuchar: Jackson would bring ‘real-world perspective’ to Supreme Court\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., pushed back against Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee advocating for a strict reading of the Constitution.\n\nDuring her opening remarks in the confirmation hearing for Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson, Klobuchar said the court should consider the people at the other end of its decisions.\n\nJackson, she said, would bring a “real world perspective” the court needs.\n\nCiting Associate Justice Stephen Breyer, whom Jackson would replace upon his pending retirement, Klobuchar said the court had to ensure the Constitution remains “workable” for the time.\n\n“Those words, his words, are highly relevant to the court,” she said.\n\n– Rick Rouan\n\nLee: Court packing delegitimizes the Supreme Court\n\nOne issue Republicans will bring up often over the next four days will be a call by progressive activists to add justices to the bench as a way to combat the current 6-3 conservative-leaning majority.\n\nSen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, indicated how he will grill Jackson about whether she agrees if more justices should be added to the bench. He noted former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt attempted to do such in the late 1930s, and how it stained the court’s reputation.\n\n“There is nothing in the Constitution that requires us to have nine and only nine justices,” Lee said. “But nine is the number that works, and it’s worked now for 152 years. It’s not one we ought to revisit.”\n\nLee said previous justices of different ideological leanings have opposed the idea.\n\nJackson, he said, has served at all three levels of the judiciary and he acknowledged how given the 50-50 makeup of the Senate – with Democrats hold the tie-break vote with the vice president – she will likely be confirmed.\n\n– Phillip M. Bailey\n\nSentencing:Supreme Court pick Jackson could have 'profound' impact on sentencing\n\nCornyn questions whether Jackson 'advocacy' guides decisions\n\nSen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said he was “disappointed” that Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson hasn’t revealed more about her “judicial philosophy.”\n\nPointing to Jackson’s lengthy resume, Cornyn said the federal judge had plenty of time to form that philosophy and questioned whether her “advocacy has bled over into (her) decision-making process as a judge.”\n\n“This is not your first rodeo,” Cornyn said.\n\nCornyn picked up where other Republicans had left off, railing against judicial activism and in favor of a court that constitutional framers, he said, believed would play a “modest but important” role in the government.\n\n– Rick Rouan\n\nWhitehouse: Jackson not from 'partisan petri dishes'\n\nSen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., has drawn significant attention to the issue of “dark money” influencing Supreme Court nominees in the past. He used most of him time during Associate Justice Amy Coney Barrett’s hearing in 2020, for instance, to focus on that issue.\n\nBut while Republicans on the committee are hoping to raise that issue with Jackson, Whitehouse argued it’s an apples-to-oranges comparison.\n\n“She wasn’t groomed in partisan petri dishes,” Whitehouse said of Jackson, who he said “came to us not through a dark-money funded turnstile, but through a fair and honest selection process.”\n\n– John Fritze\n\nFeinstein: As a woman, I am proud\n\nSen. Diane Feinstein, D-California, who has participated in nine previous Supreme Court confirmation hearings, said Jackson’s resume is one of the most impressive she’s seen.\n\n“Looking at your record, it’s clear you have the qualifications, and the experience and the knowledge needed to serve on the Supreme Court,” she said. “And as a woman, it makes me very proud of that.”\n\nFeinstein mentioned how the high court is facing “foundational” cases, including abortion rights, gun regulations and environmental concerns such as climate change. She said as the former mayor of San Francisco she knows how those issues will impact real people across the country.\n\nJackson, the longtime California lawmaker said, has exemplified an even-handed approach to the law that will stand above politics, and independent of the other branches of government.\n\n– Phillip M. Bailey\n\nGraham tears into Dems for past hearings\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., used his opening statement to complain bitterly that, in his view, Democrats have not treated previous nominees from Republican presidents fairly.\n\nGraham, who voted for Jackson for the D.C. Circuit last year, complained that diverse candidates nominated by Republican presidents haven't received the same treatment as Jackson, the first Black woman nominated to the Supreme Court.\n\n\"If you're a Hispanic or African American conservative it's about your philosophy,\" Graham said of past Democratic criticism. \"Now, it's going to be about the historic nature\" of the nomination.\n\nGraham said Republicans would be labeled \"racist if we ask hard questions\" but said that's \"not gonna fly with us.\"\n\nGraham, who has voted for Democratic nominees for the Supreme Court before, also criticized what he described as a \"takedown\" on the left of another Supreme Court candidate Biden had considered, U.S. District Judge J. Michelle Childs, who is from Graham's home state.\n\nSome labor groups had questioned Childs' previous work on behalf of employers against unions.\n\n\"It's gonna be a couple interesting days,\" Graham said.\n\n– John Fritze\n\nLeahy: Jackson ‘fair and impartial’ jurist\n\nSen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said Ketanji Brown Jackson’s nomination to the Supreme Court could help restore American confidence in a judicial system he described as part of the increasingly partisan “judicial wars.”\n\n“She’s a fair and impartial jurist with a fidelity to the law above all else,” Leahy said. “That’s what Americans want to see in a Supreme Court justice.”\n\nJackson, he said, could help unite the Senate behind a nominee who already has won bipartisan support as a nominee for the District Court of Washington, D.C.\n\n“In this moment we have before us a unique opportunity to change that narrative. I’m under no allusion that we can mend this process overnight,” he said. “We have before us a nominee who has brought us together across party lines before and one I hope can bring us back together again.”\n\n– Rick Rouan\n\nGrassley notes delay in records requests\n\nSen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, the Judiciary Committee's ranking GOP member, said the U.S. Sentencing Commission has not yet given Republican members of the panel many records from Jackson's tenure at the independent advisory organization for the judicial branch.\n\nHe sarcastically predicted those records might surface \"about 20 years from now,\" long after the hearings conclude.\n\n– Kevin McCoy\n\nGrassley: Jackson hearing will be more respectful than Kavanaugh\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, used his opening statement to set the GOP tone for how they plan to interrogate Jackson’s legal thinking and decision making.\n\nThe ranking Republican noted how this week’s hearings will be an “exhaustive examination” Jackson’s record and views, but will be much different than the raucous tone of the hearings that confirmed Justice Brett Kavanaugh in 2018.\n\n“We won’t try to turn this into a spectacle based on alleged process fouls,” Grassley said. “On that front, we’re off to a good start. Unlike the start to the Kavanaugh hearings, we didn’t have repeated, choreographed interruptions of Chairman Durbin during his opening statement like Democrats interrupted me for more than an hour during my opening statement at the Kavanaugh hearing.”\n\nGrassley said since Biden announced her as his nominee for the Supreme Court, he encouraged his GOP colleagues to schedule meetings with her. He said Republicans will be asking tough questions about Jackson’s judicial philosophy, and the role judges should play in U.S. society, as Republicans are expected to discuss rising violent crime and adding justices to the high court.\n\n“I’ve continually emphasized the need for a thorough, respectful process,” Grassley said.\n\n– Phillip M. Bailey\n\nDurbin defends Jackson on crime\n\nDurbin defended Jackson against charges that have emerged from Republicans in recent days that she has handed down sentences in child pornography possession cases below U.S. Sentencing Guidelines.\n\n\"These baseless charges are unfair,\" Durbin said. \"They fly in the face of pledges my colleagues made that they would approach your nomination with civility and respect.\"\n\nSome Republican senators have noted that Jackson has sentenced defendants on the charges below the guidelines. But others – including some conservatives – have noted that many judges regularly sentence below the guidelines. Several independent fact check organizations have found that the claims are missing important context.\n\n– John Fritze\n\nWho is Jackson?: Supreme Court pick Ketanji Brown Jackson in her own words\n\nDurbin: Jackson not a ‘rubber stamp’ for president\n\nSen. Dick Durbin, the Democratic chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, had a message for the critics of Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson: check the record.\n\nDurbin said during opening remarks that Jackson would not be a “rubber stamp” for the president who is nominating her to the high court, pointing to thousands of pages of transcripts and hundreds of opinions the committee has reviewed during her previous confirmations to other posts.\n\n“You’ve been faithful to the law not to any person,” he said.\n\n– Rick Rouan\n\nSenators settle in for hearing\n\nThe other 21 members of the Senate Judiciary Committee are listening as Chairman Sen.

Tom Cotton of Arkansas bent over a piece of paper, taking notes.\n\n– Dylan Wells\n\nFirst GOP criticism from Blackburn\n\nSen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., offered a preview of the kind of criticism Republicans are likely to deliver.\n\n“While I’m concerned that you don’t take seriously the rights of parents to choose what’s best for their children, you’ve consistently called for greater freedoms for hardened criminals,” Blackburn will say, according to excerpts of her opening statements.\n\nBlackburn will also raise the issue of child pornography sentencing, which has emerged as a GOP taking point in recent days. Some Republican senators have said that Jackson has sentenced defendants with child pornography possession charges below the guidelines set out by the U.S. Sentencing Commission. But others – including some conservatives – have noted that many judges regularly sentence below the guidelines.\n\n– John Fritze\n\n'Sherpa' Doug Jones, guests file into hearing room\n\nAhead of the start of the first Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, guests are beginning to file into the room.\n\nFormer Democratic Sen.

Fairfax is longtime friend and Harvard classmate of Jackson’s who will speak to her character.\n\nGriffith is perhaps a less expected choice. A former judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, Griffith was nominated by President George W. Bush, a Republican. And so the message Jackson’s supporters hope to send is clear: She may be President Joe Biden’s nominee, but she has support from across the spectrum of judicial ideologies.\n\nGriffith was also involved in one of the cases Republicans most often cite to criticize Jackson: A decision in which she ruled that President Donald Trump’s White House counsel, Don McGahn, was required to testify before a congressional committee that was at the time exploring impeachment. Griffith was one of two judges on a three-judge panel that overturned Jackson’s ruling in that case.\n\nGriffith noted the disagreement in a letter supporting Jackson last month.\n\n“However, I have always respected her careful approach, extraordinary judicial understanding, and collegial manner, three indispensable traits for success as a Justice on the Supreme Court,” Griffith wrote.\n\n– John Fritze\n\nSupreme Court nomination highlights lack of Black women in Senate\n\nWhen Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson begins her confirmation as the first Black woman nominated for the U.S. Supreme Court, she won’t face questions from anyone who looks like her.\n\nThere are no Black women in the U.S. Senate.

About 2 in 10 believe that having a Black woman on the court will have a real impact on how cases are decided.\n\nThe results are consistent with other polling since President Joe Biden announced Jackson as his nominee about a month ago. Just more than half of voters in a Wall Street Journal poll earlier this month said the Senate should confirm Jackson to the court. About a third said they are opposed. Just under 20% said they had no opinion or didn’t know.\n\n– John Fritze\n\nProfile:Who is Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson? For starters, she clerked for Breyer\n\nGallery:Associate Justice Stephen Breyer's Supreme Court career in photos\n\nWhat does bipartisanship look like?\n\nWhen the Senate confirmed Associate Justice Stephen Breyer in 1994, the vote was 87 to 9, with more than two dozen Republicans backing President Bill Clinton's nominee.\n\nHow times – and politics – have changed.\n\nBreyer, who is retiring this year, was the last Supreme Court nominee from a president of either party to win substantial bipartisan support. These days, a bipartisan confirmation means a nominee is lucky to pick up three or four senators from the other party.\n\nWhen Associate Justice Samuel Alito came along a dozen years later, the vote was far more narrow, 58-42, with only four Democrats breaking ranks. He was nominated by President George W. Bush. Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor did slightly better in 2009, picking up nine Republicans. Associate Justice Elena Kagan, arguably one of the least controversial nominees in modern times, pulled in five GOP votes. Sotomayor and Kagan were both Obama appointees.\n\nAnd then came President Donald Trump, whose three nominees were cleared on very thin margins. Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch got three Democrats; Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh received one Democratic vote – West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin – and Associate Justice Amy Coney Barrett became the first justice since the 19th Century to win confirmation without a single vote from the party opposing the president.\n\nWhat does this mean for Jackson? There's little reason to think the trend will change: In the current political landscape, Biden will be able to claim victory – and the mantle of bipartisanship – if only two or three Republicans wind up supporting her. If recent history is any guide, that's about the best she can hope for.\n\n– John Fritze\n\nWho is Ketanji Brown Jackson?\n\nBiden's decision to nominate Jackson for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court wasn't much of a surprise. In many ways, she was the safest bet.\n\nThat's because Jackson, who Biden nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit last year, has already been confirmed three times before. The Miami native and Harvard-educated lawyer had formerly served as a U.S. District Court judge and on the U.S. Sentencing Commission. Both of those jobs required Senate approval.\n\nJackson, 51, clerked for the man she would replace, Associate Justice Stephen Breyer. And President Barack Obama not only nominated her to the federal bench in 2012 but he considered nominating her to the Supreme Court back in 2016.\n\nBio:What to know about Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, Biden's Supreme Court pick\n\nReligion:Jackson would add another Protestant voice to Supreme Court\n\nJackson has served on the D.C. Circuit since June and so has written only three opinions there. Of her two majority opinions, one dealt with whether a defense contractor could sue Iraq. In the other, Jackson wrote for a unanimous court that sided with federal unions in a dispute over labor negotiations.\n\nBut she has a deep record from the federal trial court, writing hundreds of opinions. In her most often-cited decision, Jackson ruled in 2019 that President Donald Trump's former White House counsel, Don McGahn, had to testify as part of a congressional impeachment inquiry. But she's also crafted opinions that sided with the Trump administration, including on immigration and his border wall.\n\n– John Fritze, Kevin McCoy, Nick Penzenstadler\n\nA look at Ketanji Brown Jackson's family\n\nGrowing up in a largely Jewish community in South Miami, Florida, Jackson, who is Protestant, was a nationally ranked orator on her high school speech and debate team. At Harvard, actor Matt Damon was one of her scene partners in a drama course. But it was another relationship she developed at Harvard that would shape her life.\n\nShe and her husband, Dr. Patrick Jackson, met as Harvard undergraduates. They married later, as she went to Harvard Law School and he went to Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons. Patrick Jackson is now a surgeon on staff at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, D.C.\n\nJackson and her husband have two daughters, Talia, a college student, and Leila, a high schooler. After Associate Justice Antonin Scalia died in 2016, Leila Jackson, then in middle school, wrote a letter asking Obama to consider her mother as Scalia's successor.\n\n\"She's determined, honest and never breaks a promise,\" Leila wrote, \"even if there were other things she'd rather do.\"\n\n– John Fritze, Kevin McCoy, Nick Penzenstadler\n\nAgenda for Jackson's hearing\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee, evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans, will hold four days of hearings to consider Jackson for the Supreme Court, which is consistent with past nominees in modern times.\n\nStarting at 11 a.m. ET Monday, the first day's hearing will be like an appetizer, with committee members delivering 10-minute opening statements. Jackson will also get 10 minutes to give an opening pitch to the senators. The statements will likely offer some clues about the lines of questioning Democrats and Republicans will pursue.\n\nThe main event begins on Tuesday, when members of the committee will each get 30 minutes, in order of seniority, to question Jackson. The questioning will continue Wednesday with another round, with each senator receiving 20 minutes.\n\nThe final day of hearings, Thursday, will be an opportunity for outside groups and experts, such as the American Bar Association, to offer their thoughts on Jackson.\n\n– John Fritze", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/03/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/23/politics/gop-senators-opposing-kbj-confirmation/index.html", "title": "Jackson faces tight confirmation vote as Graham signals 'no' vote ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham broke ranks in the Obama era, voting for President Barack Obama’s two Supreme Court nominees. Under President Joe Biden, Graham has backed scores of lower court nominees – including Ketanji Brown Jackson to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals just last year.\n\nBut now as GOP opposition is stiffening with Jackson up for a vote to sit on the Supreme Court, Graham has taken a markedly different approach — sharpening his attack on the nominee, making it all but certain he’s going to vote against her nomination.\n\nIn an interview with CNN, Graham pinned the blame on Biden – first for voting to filibuster Janice Rogers Brown, a Black woman picked by George W. Bush to serve on the DC Circuit nearly two decades ago, and more recently for picking Jackson over district court Judge Michelle Childs, whom Graham was pushing for the high court.\n\n“He made a political decision,” Graham said of Biden. “All these are political decisions. The Supreme Court pick by every President has a political calculation. He made his decision that, ‘I’m not going down the consensus road. I’m going go down the base road.’ I’ll make my decision based on his decision.”\n\nThe acknowledgment underscores the sharp shift over how Supreme Court nominees have been treated over the past couple decades – going from a time when senators used to be deferential to presidents of both parties to more recently where it’s hard to even win a handful of defectors given the intense partisan battles. Each side blames the other for the deterioration, with Republicans slamming Democrats for their treatment of Bush and Trump nominees, while Democrats are quick to note that Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell held a vacant seat open for more than a year in order to let then-President Donald Trump put his imprint on the court.\n\nNow, as Jackson’s marathon hearings wrap up and confirmation votes are slated to be held, it’s almost certain that Jackson – a 51-year-old Ivy League educated judge who would be the first Black woman in history to sit on the high court and whose credentials and demeanor have been praised by both parties – won’t be able to win more than a few Republican votes, meaning it could be one of the closest confirmation votes in US history.\n\n“Things have changed so dramatically over the last 10 or 20 years,” Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, said in an interview. “It’s so hard to really create a bipartisan unity. I hope we can on this but as you can tell, it’s going to be a struggle.”\n\nIn 2018, Trump’s pick of Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed by just a 50-48 vote – after being accused of sexual assault, something he furiously denied – the closest margin of any judicial nominee since Reconstruction. Amy Coney Barrett, meanwhile, didn’t win any Democratic votes, confirmed just 52-48 over Democratic objections that the nomination was pushed through just days before the election. The narrow margins are a stark difference to the 96-3 vote the liberal Ruth Bader Ginsburg enjoyed in 1993 and the 98-0 vote conservative Antonin Scalia won in 1986.\n\nFor Jackson, Republicans are almost certain to vote against her en masse – raising concerns over her sentencing decisions for child pornography cases as a district court judge, her representation of Guantanamo Bay detainees as an attorney as well as her refusal to take positions on some hot-button issues, such as changing the size of the Supreme Court.\n\nJackson has defended her record, saying she can’t weigh in on a political issues like the size of the high court, while maintaining that serving as an attorney does not mean she has the same views as her client. And in several intense exchanges with Republicans, Jackson has said that her sentencing decisions in child pornography cases were based on the evidence in each case and the constraints on judges imposed by Congress. Democrats say her sentencing decisions are within the mainstream of judges across the country – including many backed by Republicans.\n\nBut Republicans say they’re not buying it.\n\n“She’s been articulate and done a nice job in terms of her tone and demeanor,” said Senate GOP Whip John Thune of South Dakota. “But I think that they’ve drilled on down on the sentencing guidelines – and that is really starting to raise some alarms for our members.”\n\nThune’s prediction that the universe of potential GOP “yes” votes is three – the same number of votes she won for her current post.\n\n“Right now, it probably doesn’t get much beyond that,” Thune said.\n\nPotential GOP swing votes are scarce\n\nWith Graham likely a “no” vote, it’s uncertain where she could grow her vote count.\n\nSen. Susan Collins of Maine, who doesn’t sit on the Senate Judiciary Committee and voted for Jackson for the DC Circuit last year, was warm toward the judge when she met with her before the hearing, and said Wednesday she was still evaluating her position now.\n\n“I had both the Health Committee and Intel yesterday. I watched some of the excerpts last night,” Collins said. “I’m not going to make a decision until the hearings have been completed.”\n\nAlaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who also voted for Jackson for the lower court and doesn’t sit on the panel, says she is still evaluating the nominee and hasn’t been able to watch all of the hearings yet.\n\nMurkowski, who is up for reelection in her red state this year, did say she had no issues with the GOP’s line of questioning over Jackson’s sentencing decisions in child porn cases.\n\n“I think it’s a fair line of questioning if, in fact through, through her tenure on the Sentencing Commission or as a judge previously there were there were issues with that,” Murkowski said.\n\nThat leaves a small universe of other senators – including retiring Republicans who could be “yes” votes. But those retiring Republicans – Sens. Pat Toomey, Richard Shelby, Richard Burr and Roy Blunt – all were mum about Jackson when asked about her on Wednesday.\n\n“I don’t think there’s anything wrong with asking questions about this important area of the law and this important area to society,” Blunt said, referring to the questions over her handling of child pornography cases.\n\nSen. Rob Portman, a retiring Ohio Republican, said he was not sold on Jackson.\n\n“I have concerns,” Portman told CNN. “I have expressed those after meeting with her personally: (her) judicial philosophy … but also I have a specific concern about regulatory issues.”\n\n“She is more on the liberal side on a lot of these issues,” Portman said.\n\nSome Republicans have indicated they are still open to backing her, even though they opposed her for the lower court.\n\nSen. Shelley Moore Capito, a West Virginia Republican, said: “I’m watching it but I’m still open-minded.”\n\nSen. Ben Sasse, a Nebraska Republican who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, told CNN that Jackson “is an impressive person,” though he opposed her pick to the DC Circuit last year.\n\nSen. Mitt Romney, a Utah Republican who has broken with his party on high-profile issues, also is viewed by Democrats as a winnable vote. But Romney told CNN recently he voted against Jackson to the D.C. Circuit because he viewed her as “not in the mainstream of judicial thought,” even as he said he’s keeping an open mind now.\n\nOn Wednesday, Romney said he was open to backing her but would “review anything (the committee) thinks is important, and I’ll take a look at it myself and make that decision.”\n\nFor Graham’s part, he has had to reconcile his support for Jackson to sit on the second most important court in the country to his likely opposition for her ascension to the Supreme Court.\n\nAt Wednesday’s hearing, Graham railed on Jackson’s sentencing decisions of child pornographers and even criticized her as an “activist” for being overturned on an immigration ruling while serving as a district judge – all topics that he could have raised before supporting her for the DC Circuit.\n\n“The bottom line is the difference between DC Circuit courts and Courts of Appeals, the Supreme Court, is the ability of a judge on the Supreme Court to make the law different than it is today, and I think that’s something everybody’s taking into consideration,” Graham said in the interview. “It’s a different game.”\n\nGraham added that if Biden picked Childs, “I could have gotten her a lot of votes.”\n\nNow, Graham said: “I think this is going to be really hard for Judge Brown,” he said, referring to Jackson.", "authors": ["Manu Raju"], "publish_date": "2022/03/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/26/politics/shortlist-breyer-replacement-supreme-court/index.html", "title": "A shortlist of potential nominees to replace Breyer on the Supreme ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIn what will be one of the most monumental endeavors of Joe Biden’s presidency, the retirement of Stephen Breyer sets the stage for an immensely important decision by the President.\n\nBreyer’s seat may be the only one that Biden fills on the Supreme Court, and it may not be one he fills at all – if Republicans retake the Senate before the President’s choice for a replacement is confirmed.\n\nBiden at the White House on Thursday confirmed the nominee will be the first Black woman on the high court.\n\n“It’s long overdue, in my opinion,” the President said.\n\n“Our process is going to be rigorous. I will select a nominee worthy of Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence and decency. While I’ve been studying candidates’ backgrounds and writings, I’ve made no decision except one: the person I will nominate will be someone with extraordinary qualifications, character, experience and integrity. And that person will be the first Black woman ever nominated to the United States Supreme Court,” Biden said.\n\nA short list of potential nominees had been circulating Washington well before Breyer’s retirement plans became public, and officials in the White House Counsel’s office built files on various candidates in anticipation of a potential vacancy. Biden said he will make his choice by the end of February.\n\nThe White House is stacked with officials deeply familiar with the confirmation process, starting with Biden himself – who chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee – as well as White House chief of staff Ron Klain, who has experience both at the White House counsel’s office and working for the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nWith Democrats holding the narrowest of majorities in the upper chamber, Biden will have to choose someone who can safely get 50 votes in the Senate (Vice President Kamala Harris could provide the tie-breaking vote if the Senate is split on the nomination). In addition to the vote count, Biden also has to keep an eye on the calendar. Senate Republicans are likely to retake the chamber in this year’s midterms and have already signaled they would block a Biden nominee to the Supreme Court. It typically takes two to three months for a president to see his nominee confirmed by the Senate once he or she is named. The most recent justice, however, was confirmed in just a month and a half, as Senate Republicans rushed to get Justice Amy Coney Barrett approved before the 2020 election.\n\nGiven the disappointments that have been recently dealt to the progressives under the Biden administration – between the congressional demise of the President’s Build Back Better proposal and his failure to find a way forward on voting rights legislation – Biden’s choice for the Supreme Court gives him the opportunity to reinvigorate the democratic base. If his nominee is confirmed, Biden will secure a much-needed victory for his administration.\n\nHere are potential nominees who have been on observers’ short list.\n\nDC Circuit Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson\n\nKetanji Brown Jackson, nominee to be U.S. Circuit Judge for the District of Columbia Circuit, testifies during her Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing. Tom Williams/Pool/Getty Images\n\nBiden has already elevated Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson once, appointing her last year to the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which is considered the second-most powerful federal court in the country. Previously, the 51-year-old judge served on the federal district court in DC. Because of that appellate appointment, she’s already been through a vetting process that included an interview with the President himself. Fittingly, she clerked for Breyer and holds degrees from Harvard and Harvard Law School. She also served as an assistant federal public defender, making her a prime example of the Biden’s White House focus on appointing judges with backgrounds that are outside the typical prosecutor and Big Law box.\n\nAs a judge, Jackson has ruled on high profile cases including the Don McGahn congressional subpoena lawsuit (where, as a district court, she ordered the former Trump White House counsel to comply with the House’s subpoena). As an appellate judge, she signed on to the recent opinion ordering the disclosure of Trump White House documents being sought by the House January 6 committee. The Supreme Court declined Trump’s request that it reverse the decision in an order this month allowing the documents to be released.\n\nCalifornia Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger\n\nIn this Dec. 22, 2014, photo, Leondra Kruger addresses the Commission of Judicial Appointments during her confirmation hearing to the California Supreme Court in San Francisco. S. Todd Rogers/Pool/AP\n\nKruger, now 45, was the youngest person to be appointed to the California Supreme Court when then-Gov. Jerry Brown nominated her in 2014.\n\nKruger is intimately familiar with the Supreme Court having worked as a clerk for the late Justice John Paul Stevens and served as acting deputy solicitor general in the Obama administration. While in the Solicitor General’s office, she argued 12 cases in front of the Supreme Court representing the government. At the Justice Department, she also earned the Attorney General’s Award for Exceptional Service, the department’s highest award for employee performance, in 2013 and 2014.\n\nAt the California Supreme Court, she has authored notable opinions on the 4th Amendment – holding that law enforcement could not search a woman’s purse without a warrant after she declined to provide a driver’s license – and upholding a California law that requires law enforcement to collect DNA samples as well as fingerprints from all persons arrested for or convicted of felony offenses.\n\nThough she is said to be well-liked among the alumni of the Solicitor General’s office, she has not yet received the thorough vetting that other potential nominees have gone through.\n\nSouth Carolina US District Court Judge J.

The president has been dogged by high inflation, the ongoing pandemic and Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nMore:Jackson confirmed in a hurry. Getting on the Supreme Court? That'll take time.\n\nBiden vowed to nominate the nation's first African American Supreme Court justice during the 2020 presidential campaign, eventually choosing the 51-year-old Jackson over two other candidates he interviewed. He nominated Jackson on Feb. 25, setting off a quick seven-week confirmation process.\n\n\"I could see it – a day of hope, a day of promise, a day of progress,\" Biden said of his long desire for a Black woman to be elevated to the nation's highest court.\n\nWhile Republican members of the committee largely praised Jackson's character and demeanor, they seized on her sentencing in child pornography cases to accuser her of being soft on crime. They also pushed Jackson on hot political wedge issues such as gender identity and critical race theory. But with Collins, Romney and Murkowski bucking their party to support Biden's nominee, the White House was able to avoid a potential tie in the evenly divided Senate.\n\nBiden said he knew whoever he nominated would be “put through a painful and difficult confirmation process.”\n\n“But I have to tell you, what Judge Jackson was put through was well beyond that,” he said. “It was verbal abuse. The anger, the constant interruptions, the most vile, baseless assertions and accusations.”\n\nBiden said despite the attacks, Jackson showcased “patience and restraint” and joy. “In the face of it all, Judge Jackson showed the incredible character and integrity she possesses.\"\n\nThe White House ceremony came amid a wave of positive COVID-19 cases among top Biden officials and other high-ranking Democrats, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Attorney General Merrick Garland, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and Jamal Simmons, communications director for Vice President Kamala Harris. Biden's sister, Valerie Biden Owens, also tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nMore:Speaker Nancy Pelosi tests positive for COVID-19 as outbreak spreads among government officials in DC\n\nThe White House has said Biden was not in \"close contact\" according to CDC guidelines with any of the official including Pelosi, who interacted with Biden at White House events both Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nThe White House did not take additional precautions such as testing, social distancing or masking requirements for the ceremony. Psaki pushed back at comparisons between Friday's event for Jackson and a 2020 White House celebration hosted by thenPresident Donald Trump for Justice Amy Coney Barrett, which turned into a super-spreader gathering.\n\n\"At that point in time, vaccines were unavailable. People were not vaccinated,\" Psaki said. \"It certainly puts us in a different space.\"\n\nAttendees included several cabinet members; among them, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia Fudge. Ten Senators were also in attendance, including Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., and Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill, who oversaw Jackson's confirmation as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. They were joined by dozens of House members led by several members of the Congressional Black Caucus. The Rev. Al Sharpton and civil rights attorney Ben Crump also attended.\n\nGuests sat in white fold-out chairs, eight rows deep, as an orchestra played to the side before the president’s arrival. Most in attendance were not wearing masks despite the wave of recent positive COVID-19 cases.\n\nJackson might have to wait as long as three months before officially joining the nation's highest court. Breyer, who announced his retirement in January, has said he intends to finish the Supreme Court term, which will probably end in late June or early July.\n\nJackson used much of her speech to thank those she said made her rise possible. They included her grandparents who did not get past grade school; her parents educated in segregated schools; her Harvard College roommates; mentors including Breyer; senators and White House aides; and her family. Jackson's husband, Patrick Jackson, beamed from the front row as they watched.\n\nJackson also thanked her many admirers, especially children, who reached out to her with congratulatory letters since Biden nominated her.\n\n\"Our children are telling me that they see now, more than ever, that here in America anything is possible,\" Jackson said, adding that she's \"standing on the shoulders\" of so many Americans who did not have her opportunities but \"believed in the promise of America.\" She called herself \"just the very lucky first inheritor of the dream of liberty and justice for all.\"\n\n\"No one does this on their own. The path was cleared for me so that I might rise to this occasion,\" she said, before quoting the poet Maya Angelou: \"I am the dream and hope of the slave.\"\n\nContributing: Dylan Wells and John Fritze\n\nReach Joey Garrison on Twitter @joeygarrison and Rebecca Morin @rebeccamorin_", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/08"}]}

The doctors said the bullet that killed the former Japanese leader was “deep enough to reach his heart” and a team of 20 medical professionals were unable to stop the bleeding.\n\nAbe went into cardiopulmonary arrest at the site of the shooting and was rushed to hospital in a state of cardiac arrest at 12:20 p.m. local time, doctors said. During surgery, doctors discovered a gunshot wound to his neck and a large wound on his heart.\n\nThe suspect, Tetsuya Yamagami, was detained at the scene and admitted to shooting Abe, according to Nara Nishi police.\n\nAbe, 67, was the former Liberal Democratic Party leader and Japan’s longest-serving prime minister, holding office from 2006 to 2007 and again from 2012 to 2020, before resigning due to health reasons. Since stepping down, he remained in the public eye and regularly appeared in the media to discuss current affairs.\n\nAt the time of the shooting, Abe was delivering a speech in support of LDP candidates in Nara city ahead of the upcoming Upper House elections scheduled for Sunday.\n\nSuspect apparently used homemade weapon\n\nVideo aired by public broadcaster NHK captured the moments before the shooting, showing Abe speaking to a small crowd in front of Yamatosaidaiji railway station. In subsequent videos, two shots can be heard and smoke can be seen in the air.\n\nPhotos show people gathered around the former leader as he lay in the street, with what appeared to be blood stains on his white shirt.\n\nAn official from the Nara City Fire Department told CNN earlier Friday Abe was in a state of cardiopulmonary arrest, a term used to describe the sudden loss of heart function and breathing.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Shinzo Abe speaks moments before being shot in front of the Yamato-Saidaiji Station in Nara, Japan, on Friday, July 8.

The prefecture’s police officers and security personnel from the Tokyo Metropolitan police had remained on the lookout and had reportedly watched Abe from all sides during his speech, NHK reported.\n\nSeveral dozen officers, including the Nara prefecture’s plain-clothed police officers and one specially assigned personnel from the Tokyo police force, were on duty, NHK reported.\n\nWorld leaders horrified by assassination\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida paid his “deepest condolences” to former leader Abe, saying he “was a personal friend, with whom (he) spent a lot of time.”\n\nKishida said he had a “great respect for the legacy (Abe) left behind” and would continue election campaigning on Saturday, adding a free and fair election must be defended at all costs.\n\nNews of the shooting and Abe’s subsequent death horrified leaders around the world, many of whom had worked with Abe during his long tenure.\n\nUS President Joe Biden said he was “stunned, outraged, and deeply saddened,” adding he had worked closely with Abe and his killing was “a tragedy for Japan and all who knew him.”\n\n“While there are many details that we do not yet know, we know that violent attacks are never acceptable and that gun violence always leaves a deep scar on the communities that are affected by it. The United States stands with Japan in this moment of grief,” the US president said in a statement.\n\nLater on Friday, Biden ordered American flags at the White House and on other federal grounds be flown at half-staff until Sunday in recognition of Abe’s death.\n\n“Abe was one of Australia’s closest friends on the world stage,” Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese wrote on Twitter, adding Abe was “a leader in the Indo-Pacific, championing a vision of a free and open region.”\n\nAbe’s legacy includes a major Asia-Pacific trade partnership, known as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, and the Quad, Albanese added, saying both were shaped by his diplomatic leadership.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said India would hold a day of national mourning on Saturday. Abe was “a towering global statesman, an outstanding leader, and a remarkable administrator,” said Modi, adding his relationship with Abe “goes back many years.”\n\nEuropean Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called Abe “a wonderful person, great democrat and champion of the multilateral world order” in a tweet on Friday.\n\n“I mourn with his family, his friends and all the people of Japan. This brutal and cowardly murder of Shinzo Abe shocks the whole world,” she said.\n\nBritain’s Queen Elizabeth II said in a statement she had “fond memories of meeting Mr. Abe and his wife” during their 2016 visit to the UK. “His love for Japan, and his desire to forge ever-closer bonds with the United Kingdom, were clear. I wish to convey my deepest sympathy and condolences to his family and to the people of Japan at this difficult time,” the Queen said.\n\nAfter Abe was shot but before his death was confirmed, China’s Foreign Ministry sent its condolences to Abe’s family. “We are following the developments, and we hope former Prime Minister Abe will be out of danger and recover soon. We certainly would like to send our regards to his family,” ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a news conference on Friday afternoon.\n\nJapan’s low gun crime\n\nAbe’s assassination has shocked Japan, which has one of the lowest rates of gun crime in the world due to its extremely strict gun control laws.\n\nLast year, Japan reported only one death from firearms, and a total of 10 firearm-related incidents, according to the National Police Agency.\n\nEight of the 10 reported were gang related, the agency added.\n\nIn 2018, Japan reported nine deaths from firearms, compared with 39,740 that year in the United States.\n\nUnder Japan’s firearms laws, the only guns permitted for sale are shotguns and air rifles – handguns are outlawed. But getting a gun is a long and complicated process.\n\nNancy Snow, Japan director of the International Security Industrial Council, told CNN Friday’s shooting will change the country “forever.”\n\n“It’s not only rare, but it’s really culturally unfathomable,” Snow said. “The Japanese people can’t imagine having a gun culture like we have in the United States.

But getting them is a long and complicated process that requires effort – and lots of patience.\n\nTo qualify for a firearm license, potential buyers must attend an all-day class, pass a written test and a shooting-range test with an accuracy of at least 95%. They also must undergo a mental health evaluation and drug tests, as well as a rigorous background check – including a review of their criminal record, personal debt, involvement in organized crime and relationships with family and friends.\n\nAfter obtaining a gun, the owner must register their weapon with police and provide details of where their gun and ammunition is stored, in separate, locked compartments. The gun must be inspected by the police once a year, and gun owners must retake the class and sit an exam every three years to renew their license.\n\nThe restrictions have kept the number of private gun owners in Japan extremely low.\n\nIn 2017, only an estimated 377,000 guns were held by civilians in Japan, in a country of 125 million people. That was 0.25 guns per 100 people, compared to about 120 guns per 100 people in the US, according to the Small Arms Survey, a project of the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva.\n\nThe last known public shooting of a politician in Japan was in 2007, when the mayor of Nagasaki, Iccho Ito, was shot at least twice in the back at point-blank range by an alleged gangster. He died after suffering cardiac arrest.\n\nSince then, Japan has furthered tightened its gun controls, imposing heavier punishments for gun offenses committed by members of organized crime gangs.\n\nUnder the revision, possessing a gun as part of an organized crime syndicate can lead to up to 15 years in prison; possessing more than one gun is also a crime, which carries a prison term of up to 15 years.

Issei Kato/Reuters In photos: Shock and grief as world reacts to Abe shooting Prev Next\n\nAbe, 67, was pronounced dead by doctors at the Nara Medical University Hospital, at 5:03 p.m local time on Friday, just over five hours after being shot while delivering a campaign speech in front of a small crowd on a street.\n\nAt the time of the shooting, Abe was speaking in support of ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) candidates ahead of Upper House elections on Sunday, which are still scheduled to go ahead. Despite resigning as Japan’s prime minister in 2020 due to health reasons, Abe remained an influential figure in the country’s political landscape and continued to campaign for the LDP.\n\nAbe arrived at hospital in a state of cardiac arrest and despite a team of medical staff fighting to resuscitate him, the former prime minister died from excessive bleeding caused by gunshot wounds to his neck and heart, doctors said.\n\nOutside Abe’s residence in Tokyo on Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in the streets hoping to catch a glimpse of the car carrying his body. People of all ages told CNN they were in disbelief and saddened by Abe’s passing.\n\n“I didn’t expect something like this would happen to someone who was the leader of Japan for such a long time – it’s usually so safe here and we don’t have gun crime,” said Takashi Uchida, 57.\n\nStudent Ryogo Uto, 18, said Abe’s death was “so sudden” that it “still hasn’t sunk in.”\n\n“Abe was a respected leader who did many things for Japan while he was in power,” he said.\n\nLines of tearful mourners also gathered to place flowers and kneel at a makeshift memorial outside the Yamato-Saidaiji Station in Nara, close to where Abe was assassinated.\n\nSuspect admits to shooting\n\nPolice have launched a murder investigation into the assassination but little is known about the suspect who was arrested at the scene of the fatal shooting on Friday.\n\nTetsuya Yamagami, 41, admitted to shooting Abe with a homemade gun, Nara Nishi police said during a news conference on Friday. Yamagami, who is unemployed, told investigators he holds hatred toward a certain group that he thought Abe was linked to. Police have not named the group.\n\nImages from the scene showed what appeared to be a weapon with two cylindrical metal barrels wrapped in black tape. Police said the weapon recovered from the shooting is 40 centimeters long by 20 centimeters wide.\n\nAuthorities later confiscated several similar handmade pistol-like items from the suspect’s apartment. Police said the suspect made the weapons himself using parts bought online.\n\nWhat appears to be a homemade weapon on the ground near where a security officer seized the suspect in front of Yamatosaidaiji Station on July 8, in Nara, Japan. The Asahi Shimbun/The Asahi Shimbun/Getty Images\n\nWhile searching the residence, police found multiple types of guns with iron pipes wrapped in adhesive tape, NHK reported – the guns had three, five, and six such pipes as barrels. The suspect inserted bullets into the pipes, police reportedly said.\n\nThey believe the suspect used the strongest homemade weapon in the assassination, NHK added.\n\nJapan’s National Police Agency said it will review security arrangements put in place before Friday’s shooting, according to NHK. Security was being handled by Nara prefectural police, which drew up a security plan for the former prime minister while he was in the city.\n\nThe agency said several dozen officers and security personnel from the Tokyo Metropolitan police were on duty and had reportedly watched Abe from all sides during his speech, NHK said.\n\nJapan’s ‘JFK moment’\n\nAbe was Japan’s longest-serving prime minister who defined the country’s politics for a generation.\n\nHe will be remembered for boosting defense spending, pushing through the most dramatic shift in Japanese military policy in 70 years, and his grand experiment designed to jolt Japan’s economy out of decades of stagnation, known as “Abenomics.”\n\nTomohiko Taniguchi, a former special adviser to Abe, said the former prime minister was “one of the most transformative leaders” of Japan and described his killing as the equivalent to the assassination of US President John F. Kennedy.\n\n“I think it’s going to be an equivalent of JFK’s assassination day … It’s been a day of sadness, grief, disbelief, and for me, tremendous anger. People are finding it very much hard to digest the reality,” Taniguchi said on Friday.\n\nUS President Joe Biden called Japan’s Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Friday “to express his outrage, sadness and deep condolences” over Abe’s “tragic and violent shooting death,” the White House said.", "authors": ["Helen Regan Emiko Jozuka Mayumi Maruyama", "Helen Regan", "Emiko Jozuka", "Mayumi Maruyama"], "publish_date": "2022/07/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/09/asia/shinzo-abe-tetsuya-yamagami-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Tetsuya Yamagami: What we know about the man suspected of ...", "text": "Tokyo CNN —\n\nPolice in Japan have launched a murder investigation into the assassination of former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe – but little is known about the suspect who was arrested at the scene of the fatal shooting on Friday.\n\nAbe, 67, was pronounced dead by doctors at the Nara Medical University Hospital, at 5:03 p.m local time on Friday, just over five hours after being shot while delivering a campaign speech in front of a small crowd on a street.\n\nTetsuya Yamagami, 41, has admitted to shooting Abe, Nara Nishi police said during a news conference on Friday.\n\nHe was taken to the Nara District Prosecutor’s Office on Sunday morning, and is being investigated as a “suspect for murder,” according to police.\n\nResentment toward a certain group\n\nYamagami, who is unemployed, told investigators he holds hatred toward a certain group that he thought Abe was linked to, Nara Nishi police said.\n\nInvestigators have said he targeted Abe due to the belief that his the former prime minister’s grandfather expanded that group, Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported on Monday.\n\n“I thought that former Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi contributed to the expansion of the group, and I thought about killing his grandson, former Prime Minister Abe,” Yamagami told investigators, according to NHK.\n\nPolice have not named the group, telling CNN they could not provide any information. CNN has not been able to independently confirm what group the suspect was referring to.\n\nNHK and Kyodo News Agency have also reported that Yamagami said his mother was involved with the group, citing police.\n\nThe suspect’s mother was a member of the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification, widely known as the Unification Church, said Tomihiro Tanaka, the church’s Japan office chairman, in a statement on Monday.\n\nThe suspect was never a member of the church, while his mother has been a member who attended church events about once a month, the statement said. Tanaka added that the organization will cooperate with investigators if asked to do so.\n\nCNN has not been able to locate her for comment or determine whether she has legal representation to confirm her alleged affiliation with the group.\n\n‘Totally normal’\n\nYamagami was described as a “totally normal” and seemingly “earnest” person by at least two people who had interacted with him, Kyodo News also reported.\n\nHe was hired through a dispatch agency in October 2020 to work at the freight department of a factory in Kyoto prefecture, the agency reported, citing an unnamed “former senior colleague”.\n\nThe former colleague characterized Yamagami as someone who kept to himself.\n\n“If it was work talk, he would respond, but he didn’t go into his private life. He seemed mild-mannered,” the former colleague said, according to Kyodo News. The former colleague added that Yamagami would “eat lunch alone in his car” and that “conversations with him never strayed beyond the topic at hand.”\n\nThe former colleague said there had been no issues with Yamagami for the first six months of his employment, until he started to exhibit “gradual neglect” of work practices, according to Kyodo News Agency.\n\nIn March, Yamagami started taking “unauthorized time off” and spoke of “heart issues” and other physical problems, despite having no previous issues with punctuality or attendance. His employment ended on May 15, the agency reported.\n\nAn unnamed employee at the dispatch agency who interviewed Yamagami for the job described him as “totally normal,” but added that he “didn’t say much” and “had a slightly gloomy sense to him,” according to the Kyodo News Agency.\n\nWhat kind of gun was fired?\n\nThe suspect used a homemade gun in the shooting, police said, and images from the scene showed what appeared to be a weapon with two cylindrical metal barrels wrapped in black tape. Authorities later confiscated several handmade pistol-like items from the suspect’s apartment.\n\nThe weapon was a gun-like item that measured 40 centimeters (about 16 inches) long and 20 centimeters wide, police said.\n\nWhat appears to be a homemade weapon on the ground near where a security officer seized a suspect on July 8, in Nara, Japan. The Asahi Shimbun/Getty Images\n\nYamagami made multiple types of guns with iron pipes that were wrapped in adhesive tape, Japan’s public broadcaster NHK reported, citing the police. The police found guns with three, five, and six iron pipes as barrels.\n\nThe suspect inserted bullets in his handmade gun, parts of which he had bought online, police said, according to NHK. Police believe the suspect used the strongest weapon he made in the assassination, NHK added.\n\nYamagami told police he watched YouTube videos to learn to make the weapon, and practiced shooting in the mountains days before the assassination, NHK reported Monday, citing ‘investigators’.\n\nPolice found wooden boards with bullet holes in the suspect’s vehicle, according to NHK.\n\nOn Monday, Nara police said Yamagami may have have carried out a “test shooting” of his homemade gun in the early hours of July 7, against the building of a “certain group” in Nara prefecture. The police refused to name the group.\n\nInvestigators said a vehicle believed to belong to the suspect was caught on security cameras close to the site of the alleged test shooting. The footage has not yet been made public.\n\nWhat was the suspect’s plan?\n\nThe suspect told investigators he initially intended to kill Abe by using explosives, according to Japan’s Public Broadcaster NHK.\n\nYamagami originally planned to assassinate Abe at an event in Okayama, a prefecture about three hours’ drive from Nara, NHK reported.\n\n“I was thinking about killing the former prime minister there (Okayama), but I saw that there were admission procedures at the entrance and I felt it would be difficult to get in”, he told investigators, according to NHK.\n\nNara police told CNN on Saturday that surveillance footage showed Yamagami leaving the Yamato-Saidaiji Station in Nara on Friday after arriving by train.\n\nHow have security forces reacted?\n\nAt the time of the shooting, Abe was speaking in support of ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) candidates ahead of Upper House elections on July 10. Despite resigning as Japan’s prime minister in 2020 due to health reasons, Abe remained an influential figure in the country’s political landscape and continued to campaign for the LDP.\n\nJapan’s National Police Agency said it will review security arrangements put in place before Friday’s shooting, according to NHK.

We will cooperate fully with the police to reveal his motive,” he added.\n\nThe church’s comments come after Japanese broadcaster NHK reported earlier in the day that the suspect, 41-year-old Tetsuya Yamagami, targeted the former Prime Minister because he believed Abe’s grandfather – another former leader of the country – had helped the expansion of a religious group he held a grudge against.\n\nAbe’s grandfather Nobusuke Kishi, who served as Prime Minister from 1957 to 1960, was targeted for assassination in the final year of his premiership, though he survived after being stabbed six times.\n\n“I thought that former Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi contributed to the expansion of (the religious group), and I thought about killing his grandson, former Prime Minister Abe,” the suspect, 41-year-old Tetsuya Yamagami, told investigators, NHK reported.\n\n“I had a grudge against a particular religious group, and I thought that former Prime Minister Abe had a close relationship with this group,” Yamagami reportedly said. “My mother got into a group and made a large donation and my family life was messed up.”\n\nYamagami has not been formally charged, but is being investigated on suspicion of murder after admitting to shooting Abe last Friday in the city of Nara, where the former leader had been delivering a campaign speech.\n\nTetsuya Yamagami, the suspect in the assassination of Shinzo Abe, walks out of a police station in Nara on July 10.

It rose to prominence in the late 1950s and early 1960s, an era of upheaval in South Korea, which at the time was transforming from a poor country torn apart by civil war to one of the world’s most modern economies.\n\nBy the 1980s the church had a global reach and it remains prominent in parts of Asia today. It continues to make international headlines for its mass weddings, in which thousands of young couples tie the knot at the same time, with some brides and grooms meeting each other for the first time on their wedding day.\n\nA man prays at the site where Japan's former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was shot during an election campaign on July 8 in Nara.

We will proceed with our election campaign as planned with the firm conviction that we will never yield to violence,” Kishida said on Friday.\n\nPolls opened at 7 a.m. Sunday morning local time and will close in most of the 46,017 stations at 8 p.m. local time.

They say he is suspected of murder but has not been formally charged.\n\nYamagami told investigators he had initially intended to kill Abe by using explosives at an event in Okayama, a prefecture that is a three-hour drive from Nara, Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported Sunday.\n\n“I was thinking about killing the former prime minister there (Okayama), but I saw that there were admission procedures at the entrance and I felt it would be difficult to get in”, Yamagami told investigators, according to NHK.\n\nYamagami was taken to the Nara District Prosecutor’s Office Sunday morning.\n\nNara Prefecture police told CNN on Saturday that surveillance cameras showed the suspect leaving the Yamato-Saidaiji Station in Nara on Friday after taking the train and heading for the Abe event.\n\nThe killing has raised questions about the level of security given to Abe.\n\nThe Nara police chief, Tomoaki Onizuka, said on Saturday he “can’t deny there were problems” with Abe’s security, and that he “take[s] responsibility” for the failure.\n\n“After the first report of the incident came … it was the height of the guilt and regret I’ve felt in my 27 years in law enforcement,” an emotional Onizuka said.\n\n“I feel the weight of my responsibility.”\n\nElections underway\n\nCampaigning was suspended on Friday following Abe’s killing, but politicians resumed pre-election activities on Saturday.\n\nWhile the upper house is the less powerful of the Japanese parliament’s two chambers – and can be overridden by the lower house in vital matters – a strong showing for the LDP could help Kishida push through an agenda that includes boosting defense spending and possibly revising Japan’s pacifist constitution. Both of these causes had been championed by Abe before his death.\n\n“The ruling LDP-Komeito coalition was already on course for a solid victory,” James Brady of the Teneo consultancy said in a note published by Reuters. “A wave of sympathy votes now could boost the margin of victory.”\n\nBrady added that in the months ahead the government is “certain to seek to strengthen domestic security.”\n\nPolls taken before Abe’s death had forecast the LDP to win at least 60 of the 125 seats being contested on Sunday, compared with the 55 it now holds, Reuters reported, allowing it to maintain the majority it holds with its junior coalition partner Komeito.\n\nReaching 69 seats in the upper house would give the LDP a majority, a threshold that had been seen as a stretch prior to Abe’s killing, and possibly boost its ability to push through its agenda, Reuters reported.\n\nA world in mourning\n\nSince Abe’s death, mourners in Japan have been gathering and placing flowers at a makeshift memorial outside the Yamato-Saidaiji Station in Nara, close to where the former leader was gunned down.\n\nBut the reverberations of the killing have been felt far beyond Japan’s borders, where there has been widespread shock that a former prime minister who had defined politics for a generation could be shot dead at close range in a country with one of the world’s lowest rates of gun crime.\n\nPresidents, prime ministers and other international leaders have sent tributes expressing outrage and sadness over the killing.\n\nThe US State Department said on Saturday that Secretary of State Antony Blinken will travel to Tokyo on Monday to pay his respects to the Japanese people.\n\nState Department Spokesman Ned Price said Blinken would also meet senior Japanese officials, adding that “the US-Japan Alliance is the cornerstone of peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific and has never been stronger.”\n\nAbe’s funeral will be held over Monday and Tuesday, his office told CNN, with a wake on Monday to be followed by a memorial service on Tuesday.\n\nThe funeral will be hosted by his widow Akie Abe at a temple in Tokyo and attendance limited to family members and people who were close to the former prime minister, Japan’s public broadcaster NHK reported.", "authors": ["Kathleen Magramo Emiko Jozuka Mayumi Maruyama", "Kathleen Magramo", "Emiko Jozuka", "Mayumi Maruyama"], "publish_date": "2022/07/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/11/asia/shinzo-abe-ldp-upper-house-election-japan-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Shinzo Abe assassination: Japan's LDP sweeps to upper house ...", "text": "Tokyo CNN —\n\nJapan’s ruling coalition swept to victory on Sunday in an upper house election that took on heightened significance following the assassination of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.\n\nAbe, 67, was shot on Friday in the city of Nara while delivering a speech in support of candidates from his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in a killing that has stunned a nation with one of the world’s lowest rates of gun crime.\n\nThe country’s leaders had urged the public to turn out and vote on Sunday, denouncing the killing as an attack on democracy.\n\nVoters receive their ballots during Japan's upper house elections at a polling station in Tokyo on July 10.

The office added that they would hold a ceremony to mourn him.\n\nThe office has set up an altar for the public to lay flowers at their office in Yamaguchi, and will add a space for incense tomorrow, it said.\n\nIn the days since Abe’s death, mourners in Nara have gathered and placed flowers at a makeshift memorial close to where he was gunned down.\n\nA woman lights joss sticks at a site outside of Yamato-Saidaiji Station, near where Shinzo Abe was shot.\n\nAbe was Japan’s longest-serving prime minister, having held office from 2006 to 2007, then again from 2012 to 2020, when he stepped down citing health reasons. But even after his resignation, Abe remained an influential figure in the country’s political landscape and continued to campaign for the LDP.\n\n“He was such a towering figure in Japanese politics for so long … I think everyone expected that for years to come he will continue to wield tremendous power,” said Tobias Harris, senior fellow for Asia at the Center for American Progress.\n\n“So the reality that he’s not there wielding that power, that he’s gone and that he’s left a power vacuum within the LDP is … a much bigger shock, even than just the fact of his death for the public at large.”\n\nMessages of mourning and remembrance have flooded in from world leaders past and present, many of whom worked with Abe – a highly influential figure throughout the Asia-Pacific region who defined politics for a generation – during his terms in power.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Tokyo on Monday, meeting Kishida to pay respects and give his condolences to the Japanese people.\n\n“I’m here because the United States and Japan are more than allies; we are friends. And when one friend is hurting, the other friend shows up,” Blinken told reporters on Monday. He added that Abe was “a visionary who took relations with the US to new heights.”\n\nTaiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen and several senior government officials also visited Japan’s de facto embassy in Taipei on Monday to pay tribute to Abe and to convey her “deepest condolences” to the Abe family.

It was a shocking attack in a country that has some of the strictest gun control laws in the world.\n\nAbe was shot from behind minutes after he started his speech Friday in the city of Nara. He collapsed bleeding and was airlifted to a nearby hospital in Nara, although he was not breathing and his heart had stopped, the Associated Press reported. He was later pronounced dead after receiving massive blood transfusions, officials said.\n\nPolice arrested a male suspect, identified as 41-year-old Tetsuya Yamagami, at the scene of the shooting in Nara, according to Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno. Officials said he used a gun that was clearly homemade, and they confiscated similar weapons and his personal computer when they raided his nearby one-room apartment, according to the AP.\n\nThe Japanese broadcaster NHK reported that Yamagami worked for the Maritime Self-Defense Force for three years until around 2005. He said he wanted to kill Abe because he had complaints about him unrelated to politics, according to NHK. Police said Yamagami was responding to questions and had admitted to attacking Abe.\n\nJapan's current prime minister, Fumio Kishida, called the assassination “dastardly and barbaric.\"\n\nRemembering those we lost: Celebrity Deaths 2022\n\nIn Washington, President Joe Biden said he was \"stunned, outraged, and deeply saddened\" by Abe's assassination.\n\n\"This is a tragedy for Japan and for all who knew him,\" Biden said in a statement early Friday. He called Abe \"a champion of the alliance between our nations and the friendship between our people.\"\n\nOn Friday afternoon, Biden went to the Japanese ambassador's residence in Washington to sign a condolence book for Abe. He said he reached out to Kishida but was unable to make contact because of the time difference. Biden also ordered flags at the White House, public grounds, embassies and military facilities to be flown at half staff in memory of Abe until July 10.\n\nNEWS DEVELOPING INTO THE EVENING:For an update later tonight, sign up for the Evening Briefing.\n\nNHK aired footage showing Abe collapsed on the street, with several security guards running toward him. He was bleeding and holding his chest. Two apparent gun shots are audible in the video.\n\nThe video also shows security guards tackling the apparent gunman to the ground. A double-barreled device that appeared to be a handmade gun can be seen on the pavement. .\n\nJapan has some of the strictest gun laws in the world. Prospective owners must undergo formal instruction as well as written, mental, and drug tests and a rigorous background check.\n\nAbe was making a campaign speech ahead of Sunday’s parliamentary elections. Kishida said the election – for Japan's less-powerful upper house of parliament – would go forward as planned.\n\nAbe first became Japan's prime minister in 2006, when he was 52, making him the youngest leader to hold the post at the time. But he resigned a year later, after his Liberal Democratic Party lost control of the legislature and amid his own health issues; he suffered from ulcerative colitis.\n\nAbe was elected to lead the liberal party again in 2012, elevating him to prime minister a second time in December of that year. He led the country until August 2020, announcing his resignation when his illness resurfaced.\n\nDuring his second stint as prime minister, Abe worked to revitalize Japan's economy from its deflationary doldrums with his \"Abenomics\" formula, which combined fiscal stimulus, monetary easing and structural reforms.\n\nHis ultra-nationalism riled the Koreas and China, and his push to normalize Japan’s defense posture angered many Japanese. Abe failed to achieve his cherished goal of formally rewriting the U.S.-drafted pacifist constitution due to public opposition.\n\nFollowing his resignation, Abe remained an influential political figure in his Liberal Democratic Party.\n\n'NEW RULES FOR THE 21ST CENTURY ECONOMY':Biden rolls out alternative to traditional trade pact in Indo-Pacific, aim is countering China\n\nFormer President Donald Trump said it was \"absolutely devastating news.\" Abe \"was a true friend of mine and, much more importantly, America,\" Trump said in a message posted on his social media platform. \"This is a tremendous blow to the wonderful people of Japan, who loved and admired him so much.\"\n\nRahm Emanuel, the U.S. ambassador to Japan, said he was \"deeply saddened\" by the news of Abe's death.\n\n\"Prime Minister Abe was a leader ahead of his time ...

The latest on Japan's former prime minister's ...", "text": "WASHINGTON — Shinzo Abe, Japan's longest-serving prime minister, was assassinated by a gunman Friday in broad daylight while campaigning in a stunning attack that shook the world.\n\nAbe was 67. He left a polarizing legacy as a leader who helped rebuild Japan's economy and angered liberals with his hawkish military philosophy.\n\nThe killing was even more shocking because Japan, known for its strict gun laws, has one of the lowest homicide rates worldwide. Japan had just 10 criminal gun cases last year despite a population of more than 125 million people, according to the Associated Press.\n\nHow was Abe killed?\n\nAbe – a member of the governing Liberal Democratic Party – was killed in the city of Nara in western Japan at around 11:30 a.m. JST. The suspected gunman shot Abe from behind as the former prime minister delivered a campaign speech outside a train station.\n\nDramatic video captured by NHK, a Japanese media service, shows Abe, wearing a navy blue suit, falling to the ground after two loud bangs, which appeared to be gun shots. Security guards immediately jumped on the suspect.\n\nWhat were his injuries?\n\nAbe was quickly not breathing and his heart stopped, according to reports, but was airlifted anyway to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead.\n\nHe suffered major damage to his heart and two neck wounds that damaged an artery, according to Nara Medical University emergency department chief Hidetada Fukushima.\n\nWho is the suspected gunman?\n\nPolice arrested the suspected gunman, Tetsuya Yamagami, 41, a former member of Japan’s navy.\n\nPolice said Yamagami planned to kill him because he believed rumors about the former prime minister's connection to an organization that police did not identify, the Associated Press reported.\n\nThe gun found at the scene, about 15 inches long, appeared to be hand-made, according to NHK. Police confiscated similar weapons from his home, a nearby one-room apartment. Police said Yamagami admitted to shooting Abe.\n\nWhy was Abe giving a speech?\n\nAbe was campaigning for a candidate running in Sunday's parliamentary elections.\n\nThe gun shots rang out as Abe raised his left hand to make a point.\n\nWhen did Abe serve as prime minister?\n\nAbe resigned as prime minister two years ago after serving two terms – from 2006 to 2007 and again from 2012 to 2020.\n\nHe announced his resignation on Aug. 28, 2020, saying that because of poor health, he was no longer able to serve.\n\nWhat was Abe known for as prime minister?\n\nAbe sought to revise Japan’s constitution, which renounces the use of force in international conflicts and limits Japan's military to self-defense. The constitutional revision failed because of a lack of public support but still has the backing of many ultra-conservatives.\n\nAbe felt that Japan was judged unfairly for its role in World War II and promoted the country’s post-war record of economic success, peace and global cooperation. But critics accused him of trying to whitewash Japan’s actions during the war, and his ultra-nationalism angered the Koreas and China, both wartime adversaries of Japan.\n\nHow did President Biden react?\n\nPresident Joe Biden stopped by the Japanese embassy in Washington on Friday afternoon to sign a condolence book for Abe. \"On behalf of the Biden family and all of America, we extend our heartfelt sympathy to the Abe family and all of Japan,\" Biden wrote, recalling how he got to know Abe as vice president. \"It is not only a loss to his wife and family – and the people of Japan, it’s a loss to the world. A man of peace and judgment – he will be missed.”\n\nIn a statement, Biden called Abe a \"champion of the Alliance between our nations and the friendship between our people.\" Biden said: \"I am stunned, outraged, and deeply saddened by the news that my friend Abe Shinzo, former Prime Minister of Japan, was shot and killed while campaigning. This is a tragedy for Japan and for all who knew him.\"\n\nFormer President Barack Obama said he was \"shocked and saddened\" by Abe's assassination. \"I will always remember the work we did to strengthen our alliance, the moving experience of traveling to Hiroshima and Pearl Harbor together, and the grace he and his wife Akie Abe showed to me and Michelle.\"\n\nWhat are other world leaders saying?\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who hastily returned to Tokyo from campaign events around the country, called the shooting “dastardly and barbaric.”\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron tweeted: \"On behalf of the French people, I send my condolences to the Japanese authorities and people after the assassination of Shinzo Abe. Japan is losing a great Prime Minister, who dedicated his life to his country and worked to bring balance to the world.\n\nIndia’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced Saturday as a one-day national mourning as a mark of the deepest respect for Abe. \"Mr. Abe made an immense contribution to elevating India-Japan relations to the level of a special strategic and global partnership. Today, whole India mourns with Japan and we stand in solidarity with our Japanese brothers and sisters in this difficult moment,” Modi said.\n\nContributing: Associated Press\n\nReach Joey Garrison on Twitter @joeygarrison and Collins @mcollinsNEWS.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/08"}]}

It comes after Musk revealed last week he had lined up $46.5 billion in financing to acquire the company, an apparent turning point that forced Twitter’s board to seriously consider the deal. The board met Sunday to evaluate Musk’s offer.\n\n“The Twitter Board conducted a thoughtful and comprehensive process to assess Elon’s proposal with a deliberate focus on value, certainty, and financing,” Twitter independent board chair Bret Taylor said in a statement, calling the deal ” the best path forward for Twitter’s stockholders.”\n\nTwitter stock was up nearly 6% following the announcement of the deal, hovering around $51.84, just shy of the offer price. The deal is pending approval from shareholders and regulators.\n\nIn an internal message to employees obtained by CNN, Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal said he would hold an all-hands meeting with Taylor on Monday afternoon to answer questions about the deal. “I know this is a significant change and you’re likely processing what this means for you and Twitter’s future,” he said.\n\nWhat Musk means for Twitter\n\nMusk is both a high-profile Twitter user and a controversial one. He has more than 83 million followers on the platform, which he has used over the years for everything from sharing memes and discussing his companies to insulting politicians, spreading misleading claims about Covid-19 and making offensive remarks about the transgender community.\n\nMusk has repeatedly stressed in recent days that his goal is to bolster free speech on the platform and work to “unlock” Twitter’s “extraordinary potential.”\n\nIn his statement Monday, Musk said he wants to “make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans.” Separately, he said in a tweet Monday that he hopes “even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means.”\n\nStill, some industry experts worry that Musk’s desire for free speech on Twitter could mean rolling back some of the platform’s work to curb hate speech, misinformation, harassment and other harmful content. Others questioned whether Musk might restore former President Donald Trump’s account, which was removed early last year for violating Twitter policies against inciting violence following the Capitol Riot. Such a move could have significant ramifications for the upcoming 2024 US presidential election.\n\nWhile Twitter is smaller than some social media rivals, it has an outsized influence in the online and offline worlds because it is used by many politicians, public figures and journalists, and has sometimes acted as a model for other platforms in how to handle harmful content.\n\n“Do not allow Twitter to become a petri dish for hate speech, or falsehoods that subvert our democracy,” Derrick Johnson, president of the NAACP, said in a statement directed at Musk Monday following the deal.\n\nA new and uncertain era for Twitter\n\nIn the days since Musk’s initial bid, many following the company wondered whether Twitter would try to find another buyer, especially after the company put in place a poison pill to make it more difficult for Musk to acquire the company without its approval.\n\nBut CFRA senior equity analyst Angelo Zino said Monday that Twitter’s board more seriously considering Musk’s offer may have come “from the Board’s realization that an alternative bid from a ‘white knight’ may be difficult to come by, especially following the decline in asset prices from social media companies in recent weeks/months.”\n\nIt’s not clear whether Agrawal — who took over the CEO role from founder Jack Dorsey in November — will remain in the top job following the takeover. Musk previously tweeted a meme comparing Agrawal to former Soviet leader Joseph Stalin. Musk also said in his offer letter to buy Twitter that he does not “have confidence in management.”\n\nThe deal could, however, put an end to nearly a decade of chaos at Twitter as a public company, during which it has cycled through CEOs, grappled with an activist investor and struggled to ignite growth and successfully monetize its influential user base.\n\nAgrawal said in Monday’s statement that “Twitter has a purpose and relevance that impacts the entire world,” He added: “Deeply proud of our teams and inspired by the work that has never been more important.”\n\nCNN Business tech reporter Clare Duffy can be reached at clare.duffy@cnn.com.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/04/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/17/tech/twitter-elon-musk-timeline/index.html", "title": "Twitter takeover: A timeline of Elon Musk's bumpy road | CNN ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nA board seat accepted and then rejected. A stunning $44 billion takeover offer with uncertain financing. And a surprise early morning tweet putting the deal on hold, temporarily.\n\nEven by the standards of Twitter, a company that has known plenty of chaos and dysfunction in its history, the weeks-long effort by billionaire Elon Musk to buy the company has proven to be uniquely tumultuous – and there’s no clear end in sight.\n\nShould the deal go through, it would place the world’s richest man in charge of one of the world’s most influential social media platforms. The acquisition has the potential to upend not just Twitter itself but politics, media and the tech industry. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO has repeatedly stressed that his goal is to bolster what he calls “free speech” on the platform, by which he means all legal speech that complies with local laws in the markets where Twitter operates. He has also said he would reverse Twitter’s ban of former President Donald Trump.\n\nBut the attempt by Musk, a wildly successful entrepreneur with a history of erratic behavior, to buy Twitter has been viewed with some skepticism from the start. On the day he made his offer, Musk said: “I’m not sure I’ll actually be able to acquire it.” Some have questioned how he would finance the deal, especially as shares of Tesla (TSLA), which he’s partially using to back his financing of the Twitter deal, and the broader tech sector have declined in the weeks since.\n\nAfter Musk recently said he was temporarily pausing the deal so he could assess the amount of spam and fake accounts, it prompted speculation that the billionaire might be looking to renegotiate the deal – or back out of it entirely. His actions in the days that followed only reinforced that thinking.\n\nHere is a look back at the many twists and turns in one of the most high-profile tech deals in recent memory.\n\nJanuary 31: Musk begins building up his Twitter stake\n\nMusk starts quietly buying up Twitter shares, building his stake in the company. But it would be months before he disclosed this fact to the public.\n\nMarch 14: Musk’s Twitter stake tops 5%\n\nMusk’s stake in Twitter tops 5%, but that fact is not disclosed until the following month. Musk was obligated to disclose his stake within 10 days of crossing the 5% threshold, but waited 21 days to do so. During that time, he continued building up his stake.\n\nMarch 24: Asking whether Twitter should change\n\nThe billionaire begins to make pointed statements about the platform from his account. “Twitter algorithm should be open source,” he wrote, with a poll for users to vote “yes” or “no.”\n\nThe following day, Musk tweets out another poll to his followers: “Free speech is essential to a functioning democracy. Do you believe Twitter rigorously adheres to this principle?”\n\nA sign is posted on the exterior of Twitter headquarters on April 27, 2022 in San Francisco, California. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nMarch 26: Musk reaches out to Jack Dorsey\n\nMusk reaches out to Twitter cofounder and former CEO Jack Dorsey to “discuss the future direction of social media,” according to a company filing later put out by the company. The two tech founders are known to have a bit of a billionaire bromance on and off Twitter.\n\nApril 3: Twitter leadership meets to discuss Musk\n\nTwitter’s board and some of its leadership team meet with representatives from Wilson Sonsini, a law firm, and J.P. Morgan to discuss the possibility of Musk joining the company’s board, according a later securities filing. Dorsey is said to have told the board that “he and Mr. Musk were friends,” according to the filing.\n\nIn the meeting, the Twitter board discussed wanting Musk to agree to “‘standstill’ provisions”,” according to the filing. This would effectively “limit his public statements regarding Twitter, including the making of unsolicited public proposals to acquire Twitter (but not private proposals) without the prior consent of the Twitter Board.”\n\nApril 4: Surprise! Musk becomes Twitter’s largest shareholder\n\nMusk is revealed to be Twitter’s largest individual shareholder, with a more than 9% stake in the company.\n\nNews of the purchase sends shares of the social media company soaring more than 20% in early trading and kicks off a wave of speculation about how Musk might push for changes on the platform.\n\nApril 5: Musk agrees to join the board\n\nTwitter CEO Parag Agrawal announces Musk will join Twitter’s board of directors. “Through conversations with Elon in recent weeks, it became clear to us that he would bring great value to our Board,” Agrawal says in a post on Twitter.\n\nAs part of the appointment, Musk agrees not to acquire more than 14.9% of the company’s shares while he remains on the board. His term on the board is set to go through 2024, according to a regulatory filing.\n\nTwitter CEO Parag Agrawal (left) and former CEO Jack Dorsey in an undated photo. From Twitter\n\nApril 10: Just kidding. Musk ditches the board\n\nAgrawal announces that Musk has decided not to join the board after all. “I believe this is for the best,” Agrawal writes in a letter to the Twitter team.\n\nThe reversal opens the door for Musk to pursue a greater stake in the company – and frees him to tweet his many thoughts about the company.\n\nApril 14: Musk offers to buy Twitter and ‘unlock’ its potential\n\nMusk stuns the industry by making an offer to acquire all the shares in Twitter he does not own at a valuation of $41.4 billion. The cash offer represents a 38% premium over the company’s closing price on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed that he had become the company’s biggest shareholder.\n\n“I invested in Twitter as I believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe, and I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy. However, since making my investment I now realize the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form. Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company,” Musk writes in his offer letter. “Twitter has extraordinary potential. I will unlock it.”\n\nApril 15: The poison pill\n\nTwitter’s board of directors adopts a “poison pill” provision, a limited-term shareholder rights plan that potentially makes it harder for Musk to acquire the company.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk speaks during the official opening of the new Tesla electric car manufacturing plant on March 22, 2022 near Gruenheide, Germany. Christian Marquardt/Getty Images\n\nApril 21: Musk lines up $46.5 billion in financing\n\nMusk lines up $46.5 billion in financing for the deal, including two debt commitment letters from Morgan Stanley and other unnamed financial institutions and one equity commitment letter from himself, according to a regulatory filing.\n\nThe billionaire also reveals that he has not received a formal response from Twitter a week after his acquisition offer. He said he is “seeking to negotiate” a definite acquisition agreement and “is prepared to begin such negotiations immediately” — an apparent reversal from his statement in his acquisition offer letter that it would be his “best and final” offer.\n\nAlthough he is the richest person in the world, much of Musk’s wealth is tied up in Tesla stock, and some followers of the company speculate that it could be challenging for Musk to raise debt against the historically volatile stock.\n\nApril 25: Twitter agrees to sell itself to Elon Musk\n\nTwitter announces that it has agreed to sell itself to Musk in a deal valued at around $44 billion. At a conference later in the day, Musk describes his offer to buy Twitter in characteristically sweeping terms as being about “the future of civilization,” not just making money.\n\nAt an all-hands meeting that afternoon, Twitter employees raise questions about everything from what the deal would mean for their compensation to whether former US President Donald Trump would be let back on the platform.\n\nApril 29: Musk cashes out billions in Tesla stock\n\nFilings reveal Musk sold $8.5 billion of his Tesla stock in the three days after Twitter board agreed to the sale for an average of $883.09 per share. The filings did not disclose the reason for the sale, but Musk appeared to be raising funds to buy Twitter.\n\nTesla cars sit in a dealership lot on March 28, 2022 in Chicago, Illinois. Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nMay 4: With a little help from his billionaire friends\n\nMusk raises another $7 billion in financing for the deal. The new investors include Oracle founder Larry Ellison, cryptocurrency platform Binance and venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, according to a filing.\n\nMay 6: Musk’s lofty goals for Twitter, revealed\n\nMusk aims to increase Twitter’s annual revenue to $26.4 billion by 2028, up from $5 billion last year, according to a New York Times report, citing Musk’s pitch deck presented to investors. To achieve that lofty goal, Musk intends to bolster Twitter’s subscription revenue and build up a payments business while decreasing the company’s reliance on advertising sales, according to the report.\n\nMay 10: Musk says he would reinstate Trump’s account\n\nMusk confirms what many have assumed for weeks: he would reverse Twitter’s Trump ban if his deal to buy the company is completed.\n\n“I do think it was not correct to ban Donald Trump, I think that was a mistake,” Musk said. “I would reverse the perma-ban. … Banning Trump from Twitter didn’t end Trump’s voice, it will amplify it among the right and this is why it’s morally wrong and flat out stupid.”\n\nFormer President Donald Trump looks at his phone during a roundtable with governors on the reopening of America's small businesses, in the State Dining Room of the White House in Washington, June 18, 2020. Alex Brandon/AP\n\nMay 12: A partial hiring freeze and executive departures\n\nTwitter confirms to CNN Business that the platform is pausing most hiring and backfills, except for “business critical” roles, and pulling back on other non-labor costs ahead of the acquisition. In addition, Twitter says general manager of consumer, Kayvon Beykpour, and revenue product lead, Bruce Falck, are leaving the company.\n\nMay 13: Twitter deal ‘temporarily on hold’\n\nMusk tweets that the deal is on hold, linking to a Reuters report from nearly two weeks earlier, about Twitter’s most recent disclosure about its amount of spam and fake accounts. The figure cited in the report, however, is in line with prior quarterly disclosures.\n\n“Twitter deal temporarily on hold pending details supporting calculation that spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of users,” Musk tweeted.\n\nShares of the social media site plummet after Musk’s announcement, dropping more than 10% at market open. Two hours after announcing the hold, Musk says he remains set on purchasing Twitter. “Still committed to acquisition,” he wrote.\n\nLater in the day, Musk says his team is testing Twitter’s numbers and “picked 100 as the sample size number, because that is what Twitter uses to calculate <5% fake/spam/duplicate.”\n\nMay 14: Oops. NDA problems?\n\nMusk tweets out that Twitter’s legal team accused him of breaking a nondisclosure agreement when the billionaire revealed the platform’s sample size for automated user checks is allegedly just 100 users.\n\n“Twitter legal just called to complain that I violated their NDA by revealing the bot check sample size is 100! This actually happened,” wrote Musk.\n\nMay 16: Poop emoji\n\nThe standoff over bot accounts continues as Musk exchanges a series of tweets with Agrawal over the issue. After Agrawal carefully explains how Twitter attempts to combat and measure spam accounts, Musk responds with a poop emoji.\n\nMusk follows up with a somewhat more thoughtful question. “So how do advertisers know what they’re getting for their money?” Musk asked. “This is fundamental to the financial health of Twitter,” he added.\n\nMay 17: Musk says Twitter deal ‘cannot move forward.’ Twitter disagrees\n\nMusk announces that his acquisition of Twitter “cannot move forward” until he sees more information about the prevalence of spam accounts, claiming that the social media platform falsified numbers in filings. Without citing a source, he claims in a tweet that Twitter is “20% fake/spam accounts” and suggests Twitter’s previous filings with the SEC were misleading.\n\nLater in the day, Musk posts a poll to his Twitter followers: “Twitter claims that >95% of daily active users are real, unique humans. Does anyone have that experience?” before calling on the SEC to evaluate the platform’s numbers. “Hello @SECGov, anyone home?” Musk tweets, in an apparent attempt to get the regulator to look into the matter.\n\nIn a statement, Twitter says it remains “committed to completing the transaction on the agreed price and terms as promptly as practicable.” Later, the company says it intends to “enforce the merger agreement.”\n\nJune 6: A threat to walk away\n\nIn a letter to Twitter’s head of legal, Musk threatens to walk away from his purchase of the platform, alleging that Twitter is “actively resisting and thwarting his information rights” as outlined by the deal.\n\nIn the letter, an attorney for Musk accuses the social media company of breaching the merger agreement by not providing the data he has requested on Twitter spam bots, stating that the lack of information gives him a right “not to consummate the transaction” and “to terminate the merger agreement.”\n\nJuly 8: Actually trying to walk away\n\nMusk moved to terminate the acquisition agreement. A lawyer representing him claimed in a letter to Twitter’s top lawyer that the company is “in material breach of multiple provisions” of the deal over its alleged failure to provide all the data Musk says he needs to evaluate the number of spam and fake accounts on the platform.\n\n“For nearly two months, Mr. Musk has sought the data and information necessary to ‘make an independent assessment of the prevalence of fake or spam accounts on Twitter’s platform,’” the letter reads. “This information is fundamental to Twitter’s business and financial performance and is necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. … Twitter has failed or refused to provide this information.”\n\nTwitter was not having it.\n\n“The Twitter Board is committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with Mr. Musk and plans to pursue legal action to enforce the merger agreement,” Twitter board chair Bret Taylor said in a tweet Friday, echoing earlier statements by the company that it planned to follow through with the deal. “We are confident we will prevail in the Delaware Court of Chancery.”\n\nJuly 12: Twitter sues Musk\n\nTwitter sued the Tesla billionaire in Delaware court in an attempt to force him to complete the deal.\n\nThe 62-page lawsuit, sprinkled with memes, tweets and a poop emoji, effectively highlighted the bizarre spectacle of the deal from the start. The company paints Musk as a non-serious potential owner — alleging at one point that he has “disdain” for the company, and at another saying, “Musk’s strategy is … a model of bad faith” — while seeking to compel him to become its owner. (Twitter’s board has an obligation to its shareholders to try to see the deal through if they believe it is in their best interest. The dispute could also end in a settlement.)\n\nJuly 29: Save the date\n\nTwitter’s lawsuit against Musk over his move to terminate their $44 billion acquisition agreement will go to trial on Oct. 17 and run for five days, a Delaware judge ruled.\n\nThe decision came after Judge Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick, who is overseeing the case, previously ruled in Twitter’s favor that the proceedings could be expedited and take place in October. Twitter initially pushed for an October 10th start.\n\nMusk’s legal team had asked for the trial to take place in 2023. Twitter’s legal team argued it was necessary to expedite the case in order to limit the “harm” to its business and to ensure the deal can be completed before Oct. 24, the “drop dead” date by which the two sides had previously agreed to close the deal.\n\nPeiter \"Mudge\" Zatko, former head of security at Twitter, is sworn-in as he testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee on data security at Twitter, on Capitol Hill, September 13, 2022 in Washington, DC.

Zatko — who was Twitter’s head of security from November 2020 until he was fired in January — also alleged company executives, including CEO Parag Agrawal, have deliberately misled regulators and the company’s own board about its shortcomings.\n\nZatko claimed in his testimony that Twitter is extremely vulnerable to being penetrated and exploited by agents of foreign governments, as well as detailed some of the personal information Twitter collects on users and alleged that the company does not know where the majority of its collected data goes.\n\nDays earlier, a judge allowed Musk’s legal team to add arguments based on the whistleblower disclosure to its case.\n\nOctober 3: Musk wants Twitter at the full price?\n\nMusk sends a letter to Twitter proposing to complete the deal as originally signed for $54.20 per share, citing people familiar with the negotiations. News of the letter, revealed in a security filing the next day, sends Twitter stock surging more than 20%, approaching the deal price for the first time in months.\n\nSuch an agreement could bring to an end a contentious, months-long back and forth between Musk and Twitter that has caused massive uncertainty for employees, investors and users of one of the world’s most influential social media platforms.\n\nOctober 6: The clock is officially ticking\n\nMusk has until October 28 to close his acquisition of Twitter or face a trial that was previously delayed to allow both parties to close the deal, Judge McCormick rules.\n\n“If the transaction does not close by 5 p.m. on October 28, 2022, the parties are instructed to contact me by email that evening to obtain November 2022 trial dates,” the judge said in the order.\n\nOctober 27: Elon now owns Twitter\n\nMusk completes his $44 billion deal to buy Twitter, according to a source familiar with the matter.

Twitter declined to comment.\n\nThe deal’s closing removes a cloud of uncertainty that has hung over Twitter’s business, employees and shareholders for much of the year.

Andrew Harnik/AP/Kevin Dietsch/Patrick T. Fallon/Martina Albertazzi/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nMusk has said he plans to rethink Twitter’s content moderation policies in service of a more maximalist approach to “free speech.” The billionaire has also said he disagrees with Twitter’s practice of permanent bans for those who repeatedly violate its rules, raising the possibility that a number of previously banned, controversial users could reemerge on the platform.\n\nPerhaps most immediately, many will be watching to see how soon Musk could let former President Donald Trump back on the platform, as he has previously said he would do. Depending on the timing, such a move could have major implications for the upcoming US midterm elections, as well as the 2024 Presidential campaign.\n\nIn taking those steps, Musk could singlehandedly upend the media and political ecosystem, reshape public discourse online and disrupt the nascent sphere of conservative-leaning social media properties that emerged largely in response to grievances about bans and restrictions on Twitter and other mainstream services.\n\nEarlier this week, Musk visited Twitter’s San Francisco headquarters to meet with employees. He also posted an open letter to Twitter advertisers, saying he doesn’t want the platform to become a “free-for-all-hellscape where anything can be said with no consequences.”\n\nThe acquisition also promises to extend Musk’s influence. The billionaire already owns, oversees or has significant stakes in companies developing cars, rockets, robots and satellite internet, as well as more experimental ventures such as brain implants. Now he controls a social media platform that shapes how hundreds of millions of people communicate and get their news.\n\nA deal that went off the rails\n\nEven for Twitter, a company known for a certain amount of chaos over its history, the months-long deal process with Musk was turbulent.\n\nMusk, a prominent and controversial Twitter user, became involved with the company earlier this year when he built up a more than 9% stake in its shares. After announcing he had become Twitter’s largest shareholder, Musk accepted and then pulled out of an offer to sit on the company’s board.\n\nMusk then offered to buy Twitter outright at a significant premium, threatened a hostile takeover and signed a “seller-friendly” deal to buy the company that involved waiving due diligence.\n\n“This is not a way to make money,” Musk said in an on-stage interview shortly after making an offer to buy Twitter. “My strong intuitive sense is that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization.”\n\nMusk also pledged to “defeat the spam bots or die trying,” referring to the fake and scam accounts that are often especially active in the replies to his tweets and those of others with large followings on the platform.\n\nWithin weeks of the acquisition agreement, however, Musk began raising concerns about the prevalence of those same fake and spam accounts on Twitter and ultimately attempted to terminate the deal.\n\nMusk visited Twitter's San Francisco headquarters earlier this week before the acquisition closed to meet with employees. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nTwitter sued him to follow through with the agreement, alleging that Musk was using the bot argument as a pretense to get out of a deal for which he had developed buyer’s remorse. In the weeks after the deal was announced, much of the stock market, including social media companies, declined amid concerns about rising inflation and a looming recession. The downturn also hit Tesla and, in turn, Musk’s personal net worth.\n\nLegal experts widely believed that Twitter was on strong footing to have the deal enforced in court. Two weeks before the contentious legal battle was set to go to trial, Musk said he would follow through with the deal on its original terms after all. As the parties negotiated, Musk’s attorneys asked a judge to stay the legal proceedings, prompting pushback from Twitter, which feared that Musk might not stay true to his promise to close the deal.\n\nIn a sharp response, Twitter’s lawyers wrote that Musk had been attempting to exit the deal and “now, on the eve of trial, Defendants declare they intend to close after all. ‘Trust us,’ they say, ‘we mean it this time.’”\n\nDelaware Chancery Court chancellor Kathaleen St. Judge McCormick gave the parties until 5 p.m. on Oct. 28 to close the deal or face a rescheduled trial.\n\nWhat’s next for Twitter\n\nWith the deal drama out of the way, attention now turns to Musk’s plans for Twitter.\n\nBeyond the removal of Twitter’s CEO and other executives, Musk’s takeover could also usher in the return of some measure of influence over the company by founder Jack Dorsey, who stepped down as CEO in November and left its board in May. While Dorsey has said he will not formally return to Twitter, he has privately discussed the takeover with Musk and offered advice.\n\nMusk has also reportedly told prospective investors in the deal that he planned to get rid of nearly 75% of the company’s staff, in a move that could disrupt every aspect of how Twitter operates. He previously discussed dramatically reducing Twitter’s workforce in personal text messages with friends about the deal, which were revealed in court filings, and didn’t dismiss the potential for layoffs in a call with Twitter employees in June.\n\nAmong the changes Musk could make to Twitter is restoring the account of former President Donald Trump, who was banned from the platform following the January 6 Capitol attack in 2021. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nUnder Musk, Twitter may not have use for many of its existing staff. Musk has repeatedly made clear he would overhaul Twitter’s content moderation policies and bolster what he calls “free speech,” potentially undoing years of efforts from the company to address misinformation and harassment and to create “healthier” conversations on the platform.\n\nSuch a move could also have ripple effects across the social media landscape. Twitter, although smaller than many of its social media rivals, has sometimes acted as a model for how the industry handles problematic content, including when it was the first to ban then-President Trump following the January 6 Capitol riot.\n\nAnd in recent years, several alternative social networks have launched largely targeting conservatives who claim more mainstream services unduly restrict their speech. These services include Trump’s Truth Social and Parler, which Kanye West recently said he would acquire. While it’s unclear how far Musk could go in fulfilling his free speech dreams, any loosening of existing content moderation policies could effectively make Twitter, which provides a much larger audience, a more enticing service for some of the users who have fled to those smaller, fringe services. (Musk, however, could run into regulatory issues, especially in Europe, depending on how far he takes his efforts to loosen content restrictions.)\n\nApart from content moderation, Musk has also tossed out a wide range of other possible changes for the platform, from enabling end-to-end encryption for Twitter’s direct messaging feature to suggesting recently that Twitter become part of an “everything” app called X, possibly in the style of popular Chinese app WeChat.\n\nDespite his months-long attempt to get out of buying the company and his own recent remarks that he is “obviously overpaying” for it, Musk has tried to sound optimistic about Twitter’s potential.\n\n“The long-term potential for Twitter, in my view, is an order of magnitude greater than its current value,” he said on Tesla’s earnings conference call last week.", "authors": ["Donie O'Sullivan Clare Duffy", "Donie O'Sullivan", "Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/10/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/28/tech/elon-musk-twitter-deal-close/index.html", "title": "Twitter confirms completion of Elon Musk's $44 billion acquisition ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nElon Musk has completed his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter, the company confirmed in a securities filing Friday, putting the world’s richest man in charge of one of the world’s most influential social media platforms.\n\nThe company said the deal “became effective” on Thursday, as part of a filing notifying its intention to de-list from the New York Stock Exchange, a move that happened later on Friday.

Musk on Thursday fired CEO Parag Agrawal, CFO Neg Segal and policy head Vijaya Gadde, according to two sources familiar with the situation. He also fired Sean Edgett, Twitter’s general counsel, a source told CNN.\n\nDespite multiple news outlets confirming the changes Thursday night, Twitter staff had still not formally been informed of the changes as of Friday morning, two Twitter employees told CNN. “Employees are left feeling completely rudderless — half our leaders are gone, those who remain are silent, and we’re watching the platform go crazy with people either joyously awaiting more layoffs or pushing the bounds of what previously was allowed,” one Twitter employee told CNN Friday.\n\nIn a tweet Friday, Segal confirmed his departure from the company. “Thursday concluded 5 years @twitter,” he wrote. “I’m grateful for the opportunity to have worked with such an incredible group of people building the world’s town square for all of our stakeholders. The work isn’t complete, but we made meaningful progress.”\n\nMusk has said he plans to rethink Twitter’s content moderation policies in service of a more maximalist approach to “free speech.” The billionaire has also said he disagrees with Twitter’s practice of permanent bans for those who repeatedly violate its rules, raising the possibility that a number of previously banned, controversial users could reemerge on the platform.\n\nPerhaps most immediately, many will be watching to see how soon Musk could let former President Donald Trump back on the platform, as he has previously said he would do. Depending on the timing, such a move could have major implications for the upcoming US midterm elections, as well as the 2024 Presidential campaign.\n\nTrump said in a post on his social platform, Truth Social, on Friday that he is “very happy that Twitter is now in sane hands” following Musk’s takeover. “Truth Social has become somewhat of a phenomena,” he said. “It also looks and works better to my eye,” he said. Trump previously said he would remain on Truth Social rather than returning to Twitter, where he had tens of millions more followers.\n\nLater on Friday, Trump told Fox News in an interview, “I am staying on Truth. I like it better, I like the way it works, I like Elon, but I’m staying on Truth.”\n\nIn taking steps to change the platform, Musk could singlehandedly upend the media and political ecosystem, reshape public discourse online and disrupt the nascent sphere of conservative-leaning social media properties that emerged largely in response to grievances about bans and restrictions on Twitter and other mainstream services.\n\nEarlier this week, Musk attempted to ease some concerns about how he could change the platform.

Once the deal is complete, which is expected by this year, Twitter will become a privately held company.\n\n\"Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,\" Musk tweeted to his 84 million followers. \"I also want to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans.\"\n\nShares of Twitter rose more than 5% in afternoon trading Monday.\n\n“Twitter has a purpose and relevance that impacts the entire world,” its CEO Parag Agrawal said in a tweet. “Deeply proud of our teams and inspired by the work that has never been more important.”\n\nThe deal comes nearly three months after Musk started buying Twitter shares with his stake growing from 5% to more than 9% and serious overtures that he wanted to control the social media platform. Musk's acquisition also comes nearly five months after founder and CEO Jack Dorsey stepped aside as CEO and named Agrawal as his replacement.\n\nLate Monday, Dorsey tweeted his approval of Musk's taking over Twitter, saying he was happy that Twitter will \"continue to serve the public conversation\" around the world.\n\nWhile Dorsey said in principle that he doesn't \"believe anyone should own or run Twitter,\" as the platform \"wants to be a public good at a protocol level, not a company.\" But in terms of Twitter being an actual company, Dorsey said Musk is \"the singular solution I trust\" and as well as Musk's mission to \"extend the light of consciousness.\"\n\n\"Elon’s goal of creating a platform that is “maximally trusted and broadly inclusive” is the right one. This is also @paraga’s goal, and why I chose him,\" Dorsey said. \"Thank you both for getting the company out of an impossible situation. This is the right path...I believe it with all my heart.\"\n\nEarlier Monday, Musk tweeted, \"I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means.\" The tweet has received more than 1.4 million likes.\n\nLast week, Musk said he had lined up $46.5 billion in financing to buy Twitter and had been continuing to negotiate with the company.\n\nTWITTER UNDER ELON MUSK:What Twitter would look like if Tesla and SpaceX billionaire CEO was running it\n\nEXCLUSIVE:Asian women are shut out of leadership at America's top companies. Our data shows why.\n\nINFLATION'S IMPACT:This economist bucks conventional wisdom on curbing inflation. His solution isn't easy.\n\nMusk has criticized how strictly Twitter moderates content on its platform. “Free speech is essential to a functioning democracy. Do you believe Twitter rigorously adheres to this principle?\" he tweeted this month.\n\nEventually, Musk scooped up that 9% stake in the company earlier this month, which made him one of Twitter's largest shareholders. Twitter responded by announcing plans to have Musk join its board of directors. That deal would have prevented Musk from owning more than 14.9% of Twitter's outstanding stock for as long as he's a board member and for 90 days after.\n\nDays later, Agrawal tweeted that Musk had decided not to join the board. Musk then confirmed, in a regulatory filing, that he planned to acquire the company.\n\n“I invested in Twitter as I believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe, and I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy,” Musk said in the proposal. “However, since making my investment I now realize the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form. Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company.”\n\nDespite its cultural influence, Twitter, with an estimated 416 million weekly users as of April 16, according to data.ai, a mobile data and analytics platform, the platform has lagged behind social media rivals including the Meta-owned Facebook and Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok. Other experts have Twitter at around 200 million users, still far less than TikTok's 1 billion users, according to Backlinko.com.\n\nTwitter's lag includes being behind rivals in several key metrics including monthly active users and the number of weekly app downloads globally, data.ai, said.\n\n“Twitter is a struggling company,” Sara Silver, a business journalism professor at Quinnipiac University, said in a statement. “It lost money the last two years and was only profitable in two of the last five. This contrasts sharply with Facebook owner Meta, Alphabet’s Google, and other highly profitable social media platforms.\"\n\nSilver said Twitter's board had \"no choice\" but to take Musk's offer seriously. \"With no profits, Twitter could not raise its stock price enough to satisfy investors. This gives a hefty premium to shareholders of at least 35 percent over its price before the offer.\"\n\nAnd despite all of Musk's boasting about free speech and content moderation, he may have an opportunity to monetize a good product, said Callie Cox, an analyst for eToro, who has more than 25,000 Twitter followers.\n\n\"Profitability is what Twitter shareholders have been waiting for. New leadership could provide new thoughts on how to improve and monetize the platform,\" said Cox, who considers herself a \"power user\" on Twitter. \"And with such a high stake in the business, he could be under more pressure to perform.\"\n\nDELETE TWITTER? Here's a step-by-step guide to permanently remove your account\n\nWill Trump return to Twitter?\n\nIt's been widely speculated that, if Musk got control of Twitter and take the platform private, he would reinstate the accounts of certain voices, including former U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nBut Trump appears to be not interested.\n\n\"I am not going on Twitter, I am going to stay on TRUTH,\" Trump told Fox News before Musk's deal was announced. \"I hope Elon buys Twitter because he’ll make improvements to it and he is a good man, but I am going to be staying on TRUTH.\"\n\nTrump also told Fox News he will begin \"TRUTHing\" over the next week.\n\nTrump was suspended permanently not only from Twitter, but also from Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat following the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021. Twitter banned Trump, citing several of his tweets in connection to the deadly riot as inflammatory and warned of \"the risk of further incitement of violence.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in the nation's capital, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday that she would not comment on “a specific transaction” when asked about Musk’s purchase.\n\n“No matter who owns or runs Twitter, the president has long been concerned about the power of large social media platforms – the power they have over our everyday lives,” Psaki said.\n\nShe said the president has “long argued that tech platforms must be held accountable for harms they cause” and supports reforms to Section 230, the law that undergirds much of how social media operates in the U.S., and new antitrust reforms to require more transparency.\n\nPsaki declined to say whether the White House has concerns about whether Twitter under Musk’s leadership could reinstate Trump’s Twitter access or lead to the dissemination of more election disinformation.\n\n“At this point, we don't have any sense of what the policies will look like,” she said.\n\nHowever, NAACP President Derrick Johnson has a stern message for Musk if he considers letting Trump back on Twitter.\n\n\"Do not allow 45 to return to the platform. Do not allow Twitter to become a petri dish for hate speech, or falsehoods that subvert our democracy,\" Johnson said in a statement sent to USA TODAY. \"Protecting our democracy is of utmost importance, especially as the midterm elections approach. Mr. Musk: lives are at risk, and so is American democracy.\"\n\nAnd Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., apparently agrees. She tweeted Monday that Musk's acquisition of Twitter is \"dangerous for our democracy.\"\n\nEven Musk's space rival and fellow billionaire, Amazon and Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos tweeted something: \"Interesting question. Did the Chinese government just gain a bit of leverage over the town square?\"\n\nCox, the eToro analyst, said while she welcomes innovation, as a woman on Twitter, she's also experienced \"a good deal of harassment\" and have colleagues who have even received death threats. She hopes Musk will be able to curtail that.\n\n\"While one of Twitter’s strengths is the ability to curate, looser content moderation could threaten the safety of minority demographics,\" Cox said. \"Ultimately, a hostile platform could create a chilling effect on free speech, which is the opposite scenario Elon Musk is angling for.\"\n\nCongressman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, tweeted Monday before Musk's acquisition, \"How crazy will the Left go if they accept his bid?\"\n\nJordan later tweeted after the deal, \"Free speech is making a comeback.\"\n\nThe House Judiciary GOP's Twitter account echoed a similar sentiment: \"Elon. Twitter. Freedom.\"\n\nCongresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., whose personal account was permanently banned from Twitter for repeatedly violating the platform's misinformation policy for her tweets about COVID-19, said Monday on her congressional Twitter account that, \"I should get my personal Twitter account restored.\"\n\nHow will Musk deal affect Twitter users?\n\nExperts are still trying to figure out what Musk actually wants to do with Twitter.\n\nWedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives told USA TODAY on Monday thought that a deal would get done within the next 24 hours, if not sooner.\n\n\"It all came down to no other bidders or white knights emerging in the (Mergers and Acquisitions) process and Twitter's Board back was against the wall once Musk detailed his $46 billion in financing last week to get pen to paper on this deal,\" Ives said. \"We do not expect any major regulatory hurdles to the deal getting done as this soap opera now ends with Musk owning Twitter.\"\n\nIves added that the Twitter board bought some extra time with the \"poison pill\" but ultimately had to get to the negotiation table with Musk to get this deal done as \"the clock struck midnight on Twitter's history as a public company.\"\n\nScott Kessler, global sector lead for technology media at Third Bridge, said in a statement that “it seems that major changes are ahead for Twitter if Musk succeeds, but the specifics at this point are pretty lacking.\n\n\"Musk has tweeted about the importance of free speech and an 'edit button,'” Kessler added. \"He wants people with big Twitter followings to become more active on the platform. He favors monetization through subscriptions versus advertising.”\n\nAngelo Carusone, the president of Media Matters for America, a politically left-leaning nonprofit media watchdog group, said in a statement that Musk buying Twitter would be \"a victory for disinformation and the people who peddle it.\"\n\nCarusone believes that Musk could “unleash a wave of toxicity and harassment” and undo Twitter’s efforts to increase quality engagement and attempts to make the platform safer for users.\n\n“Handing Musk the reins to Twitter will undoubtedly unleash the conspiracy theories that the platform has attempted to squelch, and any attempt to use the platform for legitimate information sharing will be overshadowed by a toxic cesspool of misinformation,\" Carusone said.\n\nHe added, “The only thing worse than Twitter re-platforming the likes of Donald Trump and Alex Jones – as well as reversing course in dealing with disinformation and extremists – is the perverse pressure it’ll create on other major social media platforms, effectively igniting a race to the bottom.”\n\nContributing: Joseph Garrison, Scott Gleeson, Maria Jimenez Moya and The Associated Press\n\nFollow Brett Molina and Terry Collins on Twitter: @brettmolina23 and @terryscollins", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/13/tech/twitter-deal-on-hold-elon-musk/index.html", "title": "Elon Musk says his deal to buy Twitter is on hold | CNN Business", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nElon Musk said he is putting his bid to acquire Twitter (TWTR) on hold, weeks after agreeing to take the company private in a $44 billion deal.\n\n“Twitter deal temporarily on hold pending details supporting calculation that spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of users,” Musk tweeted on Friday.\n\nThe news initially sent Twitter shares down more than 20% in pre-market trading before the stock rebounded somewhat. Two hours after his first tweet, Musk posted that he is “still committed to acquisition.”\n\nIn his tweet about putting the deal on hold, Musk linked to a May 2 Reuters report about Twitter’s most recent disclosure about its spam and fake account problem.\n\nIn its quarterly financial report, released on April 28, Twitter estimated that fake or spam accounts made up fewer than 5% of the platform’s active users during the first three months of the year. Twitter noted that the estimates were based on a review of sample accounts and it believed the numbers to be “reasonable.”\n\nBut it acknowledged that the measurements were not independently verified and the actual number of fake or spam accounts could be higher.\n\nTwitter has had a spam problem for years, and the company has previously acknowledged that reducing fake and malicious accounts would play a key factor in its ability to keep growing. It’s unclear why Musk would back away from the deal because of the latest disclosure.\n\nA ‘circus’\n\nMusk turned “this Twitter circus show into a Friday the 13th horror show,” wrote tech analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities in a note to clients early Friday.\n\nMusk would owe Twitter a $1 billion breakup fee if he were to cancel the deal.\n\n“The Street will view this deal as 1) likely falling apart, 2) Musk negotiating for a lower deal price, or 3) Musk simply walking away from the deal with a $1 billion breakup fee,” Ives wrote. “Many will view this as Musk using this Twitter filing/spam accounts as a way to get out of this deal in a vastly changing market.”\n\nStocks — tech in particular — have been sharply lower since Musk and Twitter reached a deal on a purchase of the the company nearly three weeks ago.\n\nFlouting convention\n\nThe manner in which Musk announced the deal’s pause — in a tweet -— was also unusual, at least by normal corporate merger and acquisition standards.\n\nAcquirers of a company typically conduct due diligence, a review of the firm’s finances and proprietary information, before a deal closes. In that process, they may come across information that causes them to rethink the deal or its valuation, but typically such a revelation would be disclosed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n“Usually we’d see some sort of filing that would come first, an amendment to previous filings on the deal, that says, ‘we’ve uncovered some information in the process of due diligence and we’re reconsidering our acquisition,’” said Josh White, an assistant professor of finance at Vanderbilt University and a former financial economist for the SEC.\n\n“This happens as you get access to the books and access to proprietary information. What doesn’t normally happen is a tweet,” White said.\n\nThe unusual move may not be significant enough to warrant SEC action, White said, but it could draw the attention of Twitter’s lawyers. As part of the deal, Musk agreed to consult with Twitter before making any public statements about the deal, and to avoid making any tweets that “disparage the company,” according to filings with the SEC. Still, Twitter’s board will likely prefer the deal to go through because of its strong valuation compared to the company’s current stock price.\n\nBut if the deal falls apart, “I would expect Twitter’s current shareholders to potentially bring a lawsuit” saying Musk’s actions had damaged them by tanking the stock price, White added.\n\nTwitter did not return a request for comment on Musk’s Friday tweets.\n\nSkepticism from the start\n\nEven as Musk has worked to secure financing for the takeover, skepticism about whether the deal would go through has been swirling since Twitter’s board agreed to the offer on April 26.\n\nMusk said he would buy Twitter for $54.20 a share. But Twitter’s stock never approached that price, hovering below $50 for weeks. That was a sign investors were skeptical that Musk would ultimately make good on his offer.\n\nWall Street analysts weren’t convinced of Musk’s ability to buy Twitter, either — at least not at $54.20 a share. The consensus target price was below $52, and the vast majority put a “hold” rating on the company’s stock.\n\nPart of the problem has been Twitter’s connection to Tesla’s (TSLA) fate. Musk, Tesla’s (TSLA) CEO, was planning to borrow against part of his Tesla stake to finance the deal, but Tesla’s (TSLA) stock has been sinking fast alongside most other stocks this year.\n\nMusk’s sale of a significant number of Tesla shares to help finance his Twitter deal had also put pressure on the carmaker’s stock. Having already committed a big chunk of his Tesla shares elsewhere, he wasn’t left with much of a cushion should he need to pony up more funds to complete the Twitter takeover.\n\nIves said the news about the Twitter deal was good for Tesla (TSLA) shares, which roared 6% higher in premarket trading Friday. Shares of Tesla (TSLA), the world’s most valuable automaker, have lost about a third of their value since Musk disclosed he had taken a stake in Twitter.\n\nIn addition to selling $8.5 billion of his Tesla shares last month, or about 6% of his holdings, Musk was using his shares of Tesla as part of the collateral he needed to raise cash for the Twitter purchase. But the drop in the value of Tesla shares had raised doubts if he would be able to move forward with the financing of the Twitter deal.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal has also reported that the SEC and the Federal Trade Commission were both looking Musk’s purchases of Twitter earlier this year and whether he properly disclosed them.\n\nMusk’s plans for Twitter\n\nMusk had offered few details about his plans for the social media company, though he has often spoken out about bot accounts that promoted spam content. He also says the company has been too quick to remove accounts that violate its content-moderation rules.\n\nOn Tuesday, Musk made headlines by saying he would allow former President Donald Trump to return to Twitter once the takeover was complete. Trump’s account was permanently removed after his followers’ attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.\n\nEarlier this week Twitter confirmed that it is pausing most hiring and backfills, except for “business critical” roles, and pulling back on other non-labor costs. It also confirmed that two top executives, general manager of consumer Kayvon Beykpour, and revenue product lead Bruce Falck, were leaving the company.\n\nTwitter CEO Parag Agrawal sent a series of tweets Friday afternoon acknowledging the leadership shakeup at the company the previous day.\n\n“Some have been asking why a ‘lame-duck’ CEO would make these changes if we’re getting acquired anyway,” Agrawal said. “While I expect the deal to close, we need to be prepared for all scenarios and always do what’s right for Twitter. I’m accountable for leading and operating Twitter, and our job is to build a stronger Twitter every day.”\n\n-— CNN Business’ Clare Duffy and Allison Morrow contributed to this article.", "authors": ["David Goldman Chris Isidore Clare Duffy", "David Goldman", "Chris Isidore", "Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/05/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/19/tech/twitter-elon-musk-lawsuit-first-hearing/index.html", "title": "Elon Musk-Twitter dispute: Judge orders October trial for lawsuit ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nIn an early victory for Twitter, a judge on Tuesday ruled that the company’s lawsuit against Elon Musk over their $44 billion acquisition agreement should go to a five-day trial in October.\n\nThe decision came at the end of the first hearing in the case over whether to expedite the proceedings. When it filed the suit last week, days after Musk moved to terminate the deal, Twitter (TWTR) filed a motion to expedite the proceedings and requested a four-day trial in September. Musk’s legal team opposed the motion.\n\nTuesday’s hearing featured sharply worded arguments from both sides — including Twitter’s lawyer at one point referring to Musk as a “committed enemy” — setting the stage for what is almost certain to be a contentious legal battle.\n\nTwitter’s lead counsel William Savitt came out swinging against Musk at the start of the hearing as he argued in favor of a speedy trial. Savitt said the continued uncertainty hanging over the company from the outstanding deal and litigation “inflicts harm on Twitter everyday, every hour and every day.” He also pointed to what he described as Musk’s continued disparagement of Twitter, including on its own platform.\n\n“Musk has been and remains contractually obligated to use his best efforts to close this deal,” Savitt said. “What he’s doing is the exact opposite; it’s sabotage.”\n\nMusk lawyer Andrew Rossman pushed back saying that Musk “doesn’t have an incentive to keep this hanging for a long time,” noting that the billionaire remains one of Twitter’s largest shareholders. He also noted that Twitter did not sue Musk over his alleged breaches of the deal until after he moved to terminate the deal, suggesting that the company’s wait invalidated its desire for expedition. (The judge in her comments said Twitter’s timing was not “unreasonable.”)\n\nMusk’s team proposed that the dispute should go to trial early next year. “We’re not opposing expedition full stop, we’re not asking for years here,” Rossman said. “What we’re offering instead, Your Honor, is an incredibly rapid and sensible schedule.”\n\nFollowing each side’s argument, the judge overseeing the case, Delaware Court of Chancery chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick, said Musk’s side “underestimate the ability of this court … to quickly process complex litigation.”\n\n“The reality is that delay threatens irreparable harm [to Twitter] … the longer the delay, the greater the risk,” McCormick said in announcing the scheduling plan. She added that while few cases warrant a trial longer than five days, she would entertain a request from either side to extend the trial if necessary.\n\nEven with this early scheduling dispute, the stakes were high for Twitter. The company was already struggling to grow its user base and advertising business before Musk’s involvement, and now it and many other tech companies are pulling back on costs amid rampant inflation and fears of a recession. Twitter needs a swift resolution to the battle with Musk in order to limit the uncertainty for its shareholders, employees and customers, and any fallout for its business that could be exacerbated by costly, prolonged litigation.\n\nAlthough Tuesday’s hearing was largely a procedural one, it offered a look at how each side may approach what is likely to be a messy litigation process. It may also provide a glimpse as to how the judge overseeing the case is approaching the dispute.\n\n“There may be hints from what she asks and what she says, and what they say, during the hearing that may tell us something,” said Carl Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law.\n\nThe case has already hit a small snag: While the hearing was originally scheduled to take place in-person, McCormick sent a letter to the two parties on Monday alerting them that she tested positive for Covid-19 and would be moving the hearing to Zoom.\n\nLess than three months after the blockbuster acquisition deal was inked, Musk moved to terminate the agreement. He accused Twitter of breaching the deal by making misleading statements about the number of bot and spam accounts on the platform, and by allegedly withholding data Musk says he needs to evaluate the scale of the issue.\n\nTwitter hit back last week in a 60-plus-page lawsuit alleging that it is Musk who has violated the agreement. In the suit, Twitter suggested Musk is using bots as a pretext to try to exit a deal over which he now has buyer’s remorse, following the market downturn that has tanked Twitter shares, as well as those of Tesla (TSLA), which the billionaire is relying on in part to finance the deal.\n\nRossman on Tuesday called the idea that Musk’s concerns about bots are a pretext to exit the deal “nonsense.”\n\n“We have reason to believe, based on what we’ve seen so far, that the real numbers [of bots and fake accounts on Twitter] are significantly higher [than Twitter has publicly reported], with enormous implications for the long-term value of the company,” Rossman said. He added that Twitter’s claims that Musk is in breach of the deal are “manufactured in order to try to strip Mr. Musk of his rights claim that he can terminate the agreement.”\n\nTwitter has asked the court to compel Musk to complete the deal to buy the company. While many legal experts say Twitter likely has the stronger argument in the dispute, some also expect the company may end up settling with the billionaire if the case starts to drag on, in an effort to reduce the disruption to its business.\n\nAs with the dispute generally, Twitter and Musk were far apart on whether to have a speedy trial. In its motion, Twitter said the expedition is necessary to ensure the deal can be completed prior to the “drop dead” date of October 24 that the two sides previously agreed to close the deal by, and to “protect Twitter and its stockholders from the continuing market risk and operational harm resulting from Musk’s attempt to bully his way out of an airtight merger agreement.”\n\nIn a Friday court filing, Musk’s lawyers called Twitter’s request an “extreme expedition” and claimed that the dispute is “extremely fact and expert intensive, requiring substantial time for discovery.” They also claimed that the original agreement stipulated that drop-dead date would no longer apply if one party filed litigation over the deal, calling Twitter’s request “moot,” and asked that a 10-day trial be scheduled for on or after February 13, 2023.\n\nTwitter’s lawyer on Tuesday pushed back on Musk’s team’s claim that the discovery process would take months because it would require digging into the details related to the number of bot and fake accounts on the platform. The bot question is “emphatically and plainly not before the court in this case,” Savitt said.\n\n“Nothing in the merger agreement turns on that question, there is no representation or warranty in the merger that is related to how many false accounts there may be on Twitter,” Savitt said. He added that “Musk could have conducted diligence about this issue” prior to signing the deal but did not.\n\nMeanwhile, Twitter continues to take the steps necessary to proceed with the acquisition. The company on Friday sent a letter to shareholders inviting them to vote on the deal to sell Twitter to Musk for $54.20 per outstanding share at a special meeting on an undisclosed date and time later this year, according to a regulatory filing. Twitter’s board previously unanimously recommended that shareholders vote in favor of the deal, a position it reiterated in the letter.\n\nDespite Musk’s move to terminate the deal, “we are committed to closing the merger on the price and terms agreed upon with Mr. Musk,” the Friday letter states. “Your vote at the special meeting is critical to our ability to complete the merger.”", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/07/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/24/tech/elon-musk-twitter-acquisition-countdown/index.html", "title": "Elon Musk must close Twitter deal by end of this week or face trial ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nThe clock is ticking for Elon Musk to complete his deal to buy Twitter.\n\nThe billionaire Tesla CEO has until 5 p.m. ET on Friday to close his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter or face a trial that was previously delayed to allow both parties to close the deal.\n\nThe high-stakes countdown comes after a months-long battle over an acquisition that would put the world’s richest man in charge of one of the world’s most influential social media platforms, with vast potential impacts on the company’s employees, users and for online discourse generally.\n\nMusk in April agreed to buy Twitter (TWTR) for $54.20 per outstanding share and then, weeks later, sought to terminate the deal. He initially cited concerns over the prevalence of bots on the platform and later added claims from a company whistleblower. Twitter (TWTR) sued him to follow through with the acquisition.\n\nThe two sides had been in the midst of a contentious litigation process preparing for trial to begin on Oct. 17 when Musk told Twitter he wanted to move forward with closing the deal at the originally agreed upon price. The judge overseeing the case, Delaware Chancery Court Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick, gave the two sides until Oct. 28 to close the deal or face a November trial.\n\nIn the weeks since the litigation was paused, Twitter has appeared to continue to take steps toward closing the deal. Bloomberg last week reported that the company had frozen employees’ stock accounts in anticipation of the deal’s closing, and that lawyers for both Musk and Twitter were preparing paperwork to close the deal. Musk, meanwhile, told Tesla shareholders that he was “excited” about Twitter even as he admitted to “obviously overpaying” for it.\n\nBut there have been questions about whether the financing Musk had originally lined up to help fund the deal would come through as expected after he spent months disparaging the company and the overall market, including for social media stocks, has declined. Musk has turned to a mix of debt and equity financing for the deal, in addition to putting up his own money, much of it likely from sales of his Tesla shares.\n\nSome experts have suggested that Musk may need to sell billions of dollars worth of additional Tesla (TSLA) shares to fund the deal, a move that became easier for the CEO after the company reported quarterly earnings last week – not to mention more costly following a recent decline in the car maker’s share price.\n\nWith days to go before the deadline, there have also been some last-minute jitters among Twitter investors and employees.\n\nTwitter shares briefly dipped Friday morning following a Bloomberg report that Biden administration officials were in early discussions about possibly subjecting some of Musk’s ventures to national security reviews, including the planned Twitter takeover.\n\nHowever, asked by CNN, the administration pushed back on the report, which cited people familiar with the matter. “We do not know of any such conversations,” National Security Council Spokesperson Adrienne Watson said in a statement. Mergers and acquisitions experts have said that while such a review could complicate matters, it likely wouldn’t allow Musk to get out of the acquisition deal.\n\nSeparately, Twitter was forced to address concerns among its employees about the fate of their jobs after The Washington Post reported on Thursday that Musk told prospective investors in the deal that he planned to get rid of nearly 75% of the company’s staff. (Representatives for Musk did not respond to a request for comment on the report, which cited internal documents and unnamed people familiar with the matter.)\n\nFollowing the report, Twitter General Counsel Sean Edgett sent a memo to staff saying the company does “not have any confirmation of the buyer’s plans following close and recommend not following rumors or leaked documents but rather wait for facts from us and the buyer directly,” according to a report from Bloomberg. A Twitter spokesperson confirmed to CNN the authenticity of the memo.\n\nMusk previously discussed dramatically reducing Twitter’s workforce in personal text messages with friends about the deal, which were revealed in court filings, and didn’t dismiss the potential for layoffs in a call with Twitter employees in June.\n\nDespite his reported plans to gut the staff, and his own remarks that he is overpaying for the company, Musk has tried to sound optimistic about Twitter’s potential.\n\n“The long-term potential for Twitter, in my view, is an order of magnitude greater than its current value,” he said on the Tesla conference call last week. He has floated several possible product updates and suggested Twitter will become part of an “everything” app called x, possibly in the style of popular Chinese app WeChat.\n\nBut the most immediate change for users, if the deal goes through, could be limiting Twitter’s content moderation and restoring accounts that were previously banned from the platform, most notably that of former President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/10/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/26/tech/twitter-elon-musk-shareholder-vote/index.html", "title": "Twitter has set a date for its shareholders to vote on Elon Musk ...", "text": "1.

Earlier this month, Musk offered to buy Twitter at the original price of $54.20 a share. A Delaware Court of Chancery judge delayed the trial that had been set for Oct. 17 to give the two sides more time to reach a deal.\n\nDid Elon Musk overpay for Twitter?\n\nMusk has acknowledged he overpaid for Twitter.\n\n\"The $44 billion price tag for Twitter will go down as one of the most overpaid tech acquisitions in the history of M&A deals on the Street in our opinion,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a research note Thursday. He put the value of Twitter at closer to $25 billion.\n\n\"Although obviously myself and other investors are overpaying for Twitter right now,\" Musk recently said, \"the long-term potential for Twitter is an order of magnitude higher than its current value.\"\n\nWhy did Musk buy Twitter?\n\nOn a Tesla earnings call earlier this month, Musk said he was “excited about the Twitter situation.” He described Twitter as a platform with “incredible potential” that had “languished for a long time.”\n\nMusk has predicted he will double revenue in three years, though he has offered few specifics on how he would do that. He has said he would like to get away from Twitter's heavy reliance on advertising.\n\nAccording to Musk, Twitter could help accelerate his plans for X, “the everything app” that, like China’s WeChat, he envisions will combine messaging, video, payments and commerce.\n\nFor now, Twitter faces a shaky future.\n\nThe Musk deal will saddle Twitter with an estimated $13 billion of debt. Analysts say Twitter may have to make annual interest payments of more than $1 billion.\n\nMorgan Stanley and Bank of America were among the banks that provided debt financing for the Musk takeover. Equity investors included Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, Marc Andreessen and Oracle founder Larry Ellison.\n\nTwitter faces slowing economy, ad sales\n\nMusk clinched the Twitter deal as the long struggling company ran headlong into a business whipsaw: a struggling economy slowing demand for digital advertising.\n\nAlphabet said Tuesday that quarterly Google ad sales decelerated dramatically, creating a drag on profits. Facebook parent company Meta reported a similar drop in ad sales on Wednesday.\n\nTwitter, which relies on advertising for 90% of its revenue, has pushed to find other sources of revenue such as subscriptions. But those products like Twitter Blue have not gained much traction.\n\nThe deal comes at a time when Twitter is struggling to keep its most active users engaged, according to internal Twitter research viewed by Reuters. Heavy tweeters have been in decline since the start of the pandemic, a Twitter researcher wrote in a paper: “Where did the Tweeters Go?”\n\nTwitter braces for deep cuts under Musk\n\nTwitter’s previous management already planned to slash payroll by about $800 million and make deep cuts to infrastructure including data centers by the end of 2023.\n\nReports of more austere measures under Musk – including laying off 75% of the company’s 7,500 workers – circulated before the deal closed.\n\nFellow entrepreneur Jason Calacanis suggested cutting the number of Twitter employees to some 3,000, according to messages he and Musk exchanged.\n\nA dramatic workforce reduction could undercut Twitter’s ability to curb harmful content and safeguard users’ data.\n\n\"The easy part for Musk was buying Twitter,\" Ives said. \"The Herculean task will be fixing it in the years to come.\"\n\nWill Twitter bring back Trump, banned accounts?\n\nCritics of the deal say they fear Musk’s relaxed approach to content moderation will bring back extremist content and controversial figures banned for spreading conspiracy theories and hateful views including former president Donald Trump.\n\nMadison Avenue is worried. Kieley Taylor, global head of partnerships at GroupM, a leading ad-buying agency that represents blue-chip brands, told the Wall Street Journal that Trump's return would be a red line for some brands.\n\nIn a tweet addressed to Twitter advertisers Thursday, Musk said it’s “important to the future of civilization to have a common digital town square,” but it “obviously cannot become a free-for-all hellscape, where anything can be said with no consequences!”\n\nConservatives, who accuse Twitter and other mainstream social media platforms of selectively targeting conservatives and silencing their voices, celebrated the Musk deal, anticipating a swift return to the freer-flowing expression of Twitter's early days.\n\nHow Musk's Twitter could affect politics, midterms\n\nIn recent years, Twitter and other social media platforms have become more consequential, as have the people who run them, according to Joan Donovan, co-author of \"Meme Wars: The Untold Story of the Online Battles Upending Democracy in America.\"\n\nTech leaders are political gatekeepers who use social media ownership “as a proxy for political influence,” says Donovan, research director of Harvard Kennedy School’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy.\n\nWith no regulations governing the integrity of civic information, Musk’s ownership of Twitter could shift the political landscape.\n\n“Twitter is not a public space. It is run by a small group of people and, in this case, with Musk taking over, he’s turning content into culture wars. We are going to see battles over who gets to stay, who has to go and whose information is prioritized,” Donovan told USA TODAY.\n\n“Ultimately when we think about Twitter as a place for geopolitics, we are at the mercy of Musk deciding what kind of propaganda is going to flow through that platform and how it is going to be moderated.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/27"}]}

Wade on Friday, holding that there is no longer a federal constitutional right to an abortion.\n\nThe opinion is the most consequential Supreme Court decision in decades and will transform the landscape of women’s reproductive health in America.\n\nGoing forward, abortion rights will be determined by states, unless Congress acts. Already, nearly half of the states have or will pass laws that ban abortion while others have enacted strict measures regulating the procedure.\n\n“Roe was egregiously wrong from the start,” Justice Samuel Alito wrote in his majority opinion. “Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences. And far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue, Roe and Casey have enflamed debate and deepened division.”\n\nThe vote was 5-4 in favor of overturning Roe. In a joint dissenting opinion, Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan heavily criticized the majority, closing: “With sorrow – for this Court, but more, for the many millions of American women who have today lost a fundamental constitutional protection – we dissent.”\n\nRELATED: Justices spar over how Roe reversal puts precedents on gay rights and contraceptives at risk\n\nThe opinion represents the culmination of a decades-long effort on the part of critics of abortion seeking to return more power to the states. It was made possible by a solid six-member conservative majority – including three of Donald Trump’s nominees.\n\nAt least 21 states have laws or constitutional amendments already in place that would make them certain to attempt to ban abortion as quickly as possible, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which favors abortion rights. And an additional four states are likely to ban abortions as soon as possible without federal protections.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts did not join the majority, writing in a concurring opinion that he would not have overturned Roe but instead would have only uphold Mississippi’s law banning abortions after 15 weeks.\n\nBiden: Ruling casts a ‘dark shadow’\n\nPresident Joe Biden said Friday “the health and life of women in this nation are now at risk” after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and eliminated the constitutional right to an abortion.\n\n“It’s a sad day for the court and for the country,” Biden said, speaking from the White House, calling for Congress to codify the right to an abortion – something that’s unlikely given the split balance of power in the Senate.\n\n“It was three justices named by one president, Donald Trump, who were the core of today’s decision to upend the scales of justice and eliminate a fundamental right for women in this country. Make no mistake, this decision is a culmination of a deliberate effort over decades to upset the balance of our law,” Biden said.\n\n“It’s a realization of an extreme ideology and a tragic error of the Supreme Court in my view,” he added.\n\n“The court has done what it’s never done before, expressly take away a constitutional right that is so fundamental to so many Americans that had already been recognized. The court’s decision to do so will have real and immediate consequences,” he said.\n\nPolitical response is swift\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Pelosi calls Roe v. Wade ruling a 'slap in the face' to women 04:21 - Source: CNN\n\n\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the ruling “such an insult, a slap in the face to women.”\n\n“There’s no point in saying good morning, because it certainly is not one,” she said. “This morning the radical Supreme Court is eviscerating women’s rights and endangering their health and safety.”\n\n“Today the Republican-controlled courts achieve their dark, extreme goal of repealing a woman’s right to make their own health decisions.”\n\nFormer President Barack Obama criticized the decision, saying the high court not only reversed nearly 50 years of precedent but it “relegated the most intensely personal decision someone can make to the whims of politicians and ideologues – attacking the essential freedoms of millions of Americans.”\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence praised the ruling, saying the high court has given the “American people a new beginning for life” and commended the justices in the majority “having the courage of their convictions.”\n\n“Now that Roe v. Wade has been consigned to the ash heap of history, a new arena in the cause of life has emerged, and it is incumbent on all who cherish the sanctity of life to resolve that we will take the defense of the unborn and the support for women in crisis pregnancy centers to every state in America,” Pence added.\n\nSen. Susan Collins, the Maine Republican who voted to confirm Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch, said she objected to the decision.\n\n“This decision is inconsistent with what Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh said in their testimony and their meetings with me, where they both were insistent on the importance of supporting long-standing precedents that the country has relied upon.\n\nTrigger bans mean abortion is prohibited in several states\n\nIn at least seven states, state officials say that abortion bans can now be enforced.\n\nThree states – Kentucky, Louisiana and South Dakota – have so-called “trigger bans” that went into effect automatically upon the Supreme Court’s ruling. Ten other states have trigger bans with implementation mechanisms that occur after a set period or after a step taken by a state government entity.\n\nAmong the trigger-ban states in the latter category, Missouri has already made the move required to implement its ban on abortion, with state Attorney General Eric Schmitt announcing Friday that he had taken the step of certification laid out by Missouri law.\n\nIt’s likely that elsewhere in the country, state legislatures will soon be called back into session to pass strict abortion laws that previously would have run afoul of Roe.\n\nSimilar to leaked draft\n\nThe final opinion was strikingly similar to the draft written by Alito that was leaked earlier this year. It repeats his scornful language towards the original Roe v. Wade decision that enshrined abortion rights.\n\nLike the draft opinion, Alito included a list of cases that also rested on a right to privacy, as Alito asserted that Roe was distinct from those cases.\n\n“What sharply distinguishes the abortion right from the rights recognized in the cases on which Roe and Casey rely is something that both those decisions acknowledged: Abortion destroys what those decisions call ‘potential life’ and what the law at issue in this case regards as the life of an ‘unborn human being,’” Alito wrote, in a line that was also present in the draft.\n\nWhat’s new is Alito’s response to the dissent, jointly written by the three liberal justices. The dissent would not have been written at the time that the leaked draft was circulated around the court.\n\n“The dissent is very candid that it cannot show that a constitutional right to abortion has any foundation, let alone a ‘deeply rooted’ one, ‘in this Nation’s history and tradition.’” Alito wrote. “The dissent does not identify any pre-Roe authority that supports such a right – no state constitutional provision or statute, no federal or state judicial precedent, not even a scholarly treatise.”\n\nIn that four-page section, Alito said that the dissent’s failure “engage with this long tradition is devastating to its position.”\n\nDissent points to potential impact on women\n\nThe dissenters said women’s rights are under attack.\n\n“Whatever the exact scope of the coming laws, one result of today’s decision is certain: the curtailment of women’s rights, and of their status as free and equal citizens.”\n\nFriday’s opinion, the dissent said, “says that from the very moment of fertilization, a woman has no rights to speak of.”\n\n“Across a vast array of circumstances, a State will be able to impose its moral choice on a woman and coerce her to give birth to a child,” the liberal justices added.\n\nThe dissent also stressed how the decision will impact poor women who now will have to travel in order to obtain the procedure. “Above all others, women lacking financial resources will suffer from today’s decision.”\n\nThe dissent also lashed out at Justice Brett Kavanaugh for suggesting that the decision simply returns the abortion question to the states.\n\nAs the three liberal Justices wrote, “no language in today’s decision stops the Federal Government from prohibiting abortions nationwide, once again from the moment of conception and without exceptions for rape or incest. If that happens,” they explained, throwing Kavanaugh’s words back at him, “‘the views of [an individual State’s] citizens’ will not matter. The challenge for a woman will be to finance a trip not to ‘New York [or] California’ but to Toronto.”\n\nChallenge brought by Mississippi\n\nChampioned by supporters of abortion and long reviled by critics, Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973 establishing a constitutional right to abortion before fetal viability which most experts say occurs now at around 23-24 weeks of pregnancy. The decision was reaffirmed in 1992, in Planned Parenthood v. Casey.\n\nA majority of the court in that case replaced Roe’s framework with a new standard to determine the validity of laws restricting abortions. The court said that a regulation cannot place an “undue burden” on the right to abortion which is defined as a “substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability.”\n\nBefore the court was Mississippi’s Gestational Age Act, passed in 2018 but blocked by two federal courts, which allows abortion after 15 weeks “only in medical emergencies or for severe fetal abnormality” and has no exception for rape or incest. A district court blocked the law, holding that it is in direct violation of Supreme Court precedent legalizing abortion nationwide prior to viability, which can occur at around 23-24 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nA panel of judges on the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with the district court holding that in an “unbroken line dating to Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court’s abortion cases have established (and affirmed and re-affirmed) a woman’s right to choose an abortion before viability.” The court said states may “regulate abortion procedures prior to viability” so long as they do not ban abortion. “The law at issue is a ban,” the court held.\n\nMississippi appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, and after the justices agreed to hear the case, the state raised the stakes and argued that the justices should not only uphold the law but also invalidate Roe and Casey.\n\nMississippi Solicitor General Scott Stewart was blunt at oral arguments.\n\n“Roe vs. Wade and Planned Parenthood versus Casey haunt our country,” Stewart said. “They have no basis in the Constitution. They have no home in our history or traditions. They’ve damaged the democratic process. They poison the law. They’ve choked off compromise. For 50 years they’ve kept this court at the center of a political battle that it can never resolve and 50 years on, they stand alone. Nowhere else does this court recognize a right to end a human life.”\n\nSolicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar argued on behalf of the Biden administration in support of the clinics. She urged the justices to uphold precedent and avoid a ruling that would disproportionally harm women who have come to depend upon the decision.\n\n“For a half century, this Court has correctly recognized that the Constitution protects a woman’s fundamental right to decide whether to end a pregnancy before viability,” she argued. “That guarantee, that the state cannot force a woman to carry a pregnancy to term and give birth, has engendered substantial individual and societal reliance. The real-world effects of overruling Roe and Casey would be severe and swift.”\n\nShe added: “The court has never revoked a right that is so fundamental to so many Americans and so central to their ability to participate fully and equally in society.\n\nJulie Rikelman, a lawyer for Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the only licensed abortion clinic in Mississippi and Sacheen Carr-Ellis, the clinic’s medical director, told the justices that Mississippi’s ban on abortion “two months before viability” is “flatly unconstitutional under decades of precedent.”\n\nPublic opposed to overturning Roe\n\nA broad majority of Americans did not want to see Roe vs. Wade overturned, polling taken before the Supreme Court’s decision shows.\n\nIn a May CNN poll conducted immediately after the leak of the draft opinion, Americans said, 66% to 34%, that they did not want the Supreme Court to completely overturn its decision. In CNN’s polling dating back to 1989, the share of the public in favor of completely overturning Roe has never risen above 36%.\n\nIn the CNN poll, 58% of US adults said that, if Roe were overturned, they’d want their state to set abortion laws that were more permissive than restrictive. About half (51%) said they’d like to see their state become a safe haven for women who wanted abortions but couldn’t get them where they lived.\n\nBut not everyone was aware in advance how their own state would be affected. Of Americans living in states with trigger laws to immediately ban abortion after the overturn of Roe, only 45% realized that was the case, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll conducted in May. Another 42% living in those states were unsure what the impact of the ruling would be where they live.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Ariane De Vogue Tierney Sneed Chandelis Duster Devan Cole", "Ariane De Vogue", "Tierney Sneed", "Chandelis Duster", "Devan Cole"], "publish_date": "2022/06/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/06/24/supreme-court-abortion-mississippi-roe-wade-decision/9357361002/", "title": "Roe v Wade overturned by Supreme Court, ending national abortion ...", "text": "The 6-3 decision from the Supreme Court said Roe v. Wade was \"egregiously wrong from the start.\"\n\nThe court's three liberal justices dissented, lamenting \"fewer rights\" for Americans today.\n\nExperts say the fight over abortion now shifts to states. About half will likely ban the procedure.\n\nWASHINGTON – The Supreme Court ruled Friday that Americans no longer have a constitutional right to abortion, a watershed decision that overturns Roe v. Wade and erases a reproductive right the high court established nearly five decades ago.\n\nIn the most closely watched and controversial case to arrive at the Supreme Court in years, a majority of the justices – all of whom were appointed by Republican presidents – held that the right to end a pregnancy was not found in the text of the Constitution nor the nation's history. The decision set off a flurry of reactions from political leaders on the right and left, including President Joe Biden and members of Congress.\n\nAssociate Justice Samuel Alito wrote the opinion for a 6-3 majority upholding a Mississippi ban on most abortions after 15 weeks. There were five votes to overturn Roe v. Wade, because Chief Justice John Roberts wrote he would not have gone so far as to upend one of the court's most recognized precedents. The court's liberal justices dissented.\n\n\"Roe was egregiously wrong from the start,\" Alito wrote for the majority. \"Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences.\n\n\"It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people’s elected representatives.\"\n\nFuture:Where the abortion fight goes from here: Roe overruled but the battle will continue\n\nExplainer:What does overturning Roe mean? What we know about the Supreme Court's abortion ruling.\n\nRoberts:Chief Justice John Roberts facing test of leadership amid tense time at Supreme Court\n\nThe decision instantly shifts the focus of one of the nation's most divisive debates to state capitols: Republican lawmakers are set to ban abortion in about half the states, while Democratic-led states are likely to reinforce protections for the procedure. Access to abortion, in other words, will depend almost entirely on where a person lives.\n\n\"After today, young women will come of age with fewer rights than their mothers and grandmothers had,\" Associate Justice Stephen Breyer wrote in the dissent joined by the court's two other liberal justices. \"The majority accomplishes that result without so much as considering how women have relied on the right to choose or what it means to take that right away.\"\n\nThe decision will also play into the November midterm elections, in which control of Congress is up for grabs, though there are signs it may not be as salient for voters as other issues, such as inflation. In a USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll taken before the decision, even those Americans who opposed striking down the landmark decision said 2-1 that the economy will be more important to their vote in November.\n\n\"This fall, Roe is on the ballot,\" Biden said from the White House, adding that the decision \"casts a dark shadow over a large swath of the land.\"\n\nThough not unexpected, the court's decision hit like a political and cultural earthquake, reshaping the relationship between millions of Americans and the government. Though the opinion will be celebrated by conservatives, it will almost certainly lead to protests, lawsuits and charges from the left that the nation's highest court – ostensibly above the partisan fray – is just as political as the other branches of the federal government.\n\nThat's exactly what happened when a draft opinion in Mississippi's challenge to Roe v. Wade leaked May 2. The unprecedented breach of Supreme Court protocol, which showed how the conservative justices might overturn Roe, led to protests across the country. The opinion Friday appeared to closely track with the earlier leaked draft.\n\nLive updates:Roe v. Wade overturned; Aftermath of Supreme Court abortion decision\n\nAnti-abortion groups, which had pushed for Friday's outcome for decades, applauded the decision.\n\n\"Today marks an historic human rights victory for unborn children and their mothers and a bright pro-life future for our nation,” said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony SBA Pro-Life America. \"Every legislature in the land, in every single state and Congress, is now free to allow the will of the people to make its way into the law through our elected representatives.\"\n\nPoll:Furor over Roe v. Wade reversal likely won't rescue Democrats in midterms\n\nFallout:Supreme Court ruling poised to trigger maze of state abortion laws\n\nExperts say the decision may set off challenges to other rights that, like abortion, have been grounded in the 14th Amendment's guarantee of due process. Many of those have been taken for granted for years, such as the right to same-sex marriage, the right to interracial marriage and the right to access contraception.\n\nIn a concurring opinion, Associate Justice Clarence Thomas said the Supreme Court should now \"reconsider\" some of those other rights established by the high court. No other member of the court joined Thomas, and the court's majority opinion stressed that other rights were not at issue in the case.\n\nDemocrats and groups that support abortion rights decried the decision.\n\n\"Today, the Republican-controlled Supreme Court has achieved the GOP’s dark and extreme goal of ripping away women’s right to make their own reproductive health decisions,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a statement. \"Because of Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell, the Republican Party and their supermajority on the Supreme Court, American women today have less freedom than their mothers.\"\n\nThe opinion follows a decades-long movement by conservatives to overturn the high court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, which established a constitutional right to abortion. The effort to roll back that right was aided by President Donald Trump, who was elected in 2016 in part on a promise to name justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade. Over the course of a single term, Trump managed to put three conservative justices on the high court.\n\nAt issue in the case is a Mississippi law that bans most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy – earlier than had been permitted under the high court's previous decisions.\n\nJackson Women’s Health Organization, the last abortion clinic in Mississippi, challenged the state law in 2018, asserting it conflicted with Roe v. Wade and a subsequent case in 1992 that upheld Roe. A 7-2 majority in Roe v. Wade established a constitutional right to abortion and allowed people to exercise the right until the end of the second trimester.\n\nA subsequent decision in 1992, Planned Parenthood v. Casey, ended the trimester framework and allowed people to obtain an abortion until viability – the point when a fetus can survive outside the womb, or about 24 weeks into a pregnancy.\n\nTwo lower federal courts agreed with the clinic, citing Roe and Casey. Mississippi appealed, asking the Supreme Court not only to uphold its ban but also to do away with the constitutional right to abortion altogether. Because the issue is so divisive and personal, the state argued, it should be decided by state lawmakers accountable to voters rather than by federal courts whose jurists enjoy lifetime appointments.\n\nThe frenzy around the case, Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, had almost as much to do with the justices who are on the high court as it does with the Mississippi law. Conservatives enjoy a 6-3 majority on the court for the first time since the Roosevelt administration. Three of them were nominated by Trump: associate justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.\n\nMississippi had explicitly asked the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade, calling it \"dangerously corrosive to our constitutional system.\" That is a more aggressive position than the state took when it first brought the case to the court in 2020.\n\nFor years, the legal battle over abortion has focused on regulating the procedure, such as requirements that minors inform their parents before ending a pregnancy or requiring doctors performing the procedure to have privileges at nearby hospitals. For anti-abortion groups, the Dobbs case represented the first opportunity in decades to focus squarely on whether the procedure itself is constitutional.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/06/17/iowa-supreme-court-abortion-law-ruling-planned-parenthood-kim-reynolds/7646049001/", "title": "Iowa Supreme Court rules on abortion law, constitutional protection", "text": "The state Supreme Court on Friday overturned its 2018 decision that said Iowans had a fundamental right to abortion under the state constitution.\n\nFriday's ruling — coupled with the potential overturn by the U.S. Supreme Court of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that established a nationwide right to abortion — would give Iowa lawmakers significantly more latitude to pass and enforce restrictive abortion laws.\n\nThe Iowa Supreme Court's fractured decision came in a challenge over a 2020 law authorizing a 24-hour waiting period before an abortion. It was unclear Friday whether the decision means that the law, which had been enjoined by a district judge, will take effect. Representatives of Planned Parenthood of the Heartland, which challenged the law, said they are operating under the assumption it does.\n\nThe majority opinion said the court's previous ruling establishing a constitutional right to an abortion \"insufficiently recognizes that future human lives are at stake.” It sent the case back to a lower court for reconsideration.\n\nMore:Iowa lawmakers can't immediately ban abortion. Here's what they did instead.\n\nPlanned Parenthood in its challenge to the waiting period argued that the law's passage had violated procedural rules and that it was an unconstitutional burden on women seeking abortions.\n\nThe composition of the Supreme Court has shifted since the 2018 decision, with Gov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican, appointing four of the seven justices.\n\nMore:Read the Iowa Supreme Court's full opinion on abortion\n\nWhile rejecting the finding of a state constitutional guarantee of the right to abortion, Friday's decision did not say what the new standard should be.\n\n\"Although we overrule (the 2018 decision), and thus reject the proposition that there is a fundamental right to an abortion in Iowa’s Constitution subjecting abortion regulation to strict scrutiny, we do not at this time decide what constitutional standard should replace it,\" Justice Edward Mansfield wrote in the majority opinion.\n\nHow will the decision impact Iowa abortion laws?\n\nRepublican leaders in Iowa have repeatedly passed laws to impose waiting periods or forbid abortion much earlier in pregnancy than currently permitted, only to see those laws blocked by the courts.\n\nFriday's decision means anti-abortion lawmakers in Iowa will be less restrained, if at all, by state-level constitutional protections, which otherwise would have remained in place even if the Roe case is overturned.\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds celebrated the decision in a Friday morning statement.\n\n“Today’s ruling is a significant victory in our fight to protect the unborn. The Iowa Supreme Court reversed its earlier 2018 decision, which made Iowa the most abortion-friendly state in the country,\" Reynolds said. \"Every life is sacred and should be protected, and as long as I’m governor that is exactly what I will do.”\n\nFor the moment, Iowa lawmakers must still contend with Roe, which protects the right to an abortion before the fetus is viable outside the womb.\n\nBut if the U.S. Supreme Court adopts a leaked draft of a majority opinion in its upcoming decision, Roe will be reversed, giving individual states leeway to pass and enforce laws that limit abortions even in the earliest weeks of pregnancy.\n\nReynolds has declined to speculate about whether she will call lawmakers back to Des Moines for a special session on abortion.\n\nHouse Speaker Pat Grassley, R-New Hartford, said the decision \"is a positive step in our fight to protect the unborn.\" He did not offer specific legislative plans but reaffirmed the opposition of his caucus to abortion.\n\n\"As we work to understand the full impact of this decision, Iowans can be assured that Iowa House Republicans are strongly pro-life and remain committed to protecting the unborn and providing additional support for new mothers,\" Grassley said.\n\nDemocrats decried the ruling. House Minority Leader Jennifer Konfrst said it was a \"step backwards for Iowa families.\"\n\n\"Iowans should always have the final say in making their own health care decisions, including abortion, without interference from politicians,\" Konfrst, D-Windsor Heights, said in a statement.\n\nA spokesperson for the Iowa Attorney General's Office, which defended the waiting period law in court, declined to comment, saying the office was studying the ruling and preparing for further proceedings.\n\n'Keep working and keep pushing': Activists focused on next steps\n\nMaggie DeWitte, executive director of the anti-abortion group Pulse Life Advocates, waited with a cup of coffee for the decision to post on the Supreme Court website Friday morning. DeWitte said she felt anxious, but hopeful.\n\n\"What would happen if we got the ruling the way that we wanted? What would happen if we didn't?\" she said. \"I was praying for a favorable decision today.\"\n\nAllie Wampler and other volunteers with the Iowa Abortion Access Fund, a group that helps people pay for abortion procedures, also were watching the website. Wampler said everyone involved with the pro-abortion group felt \"very tense\" waiting for the decision.\n\n\"It was a very emotional and stressful morning for all of us,\" she said.\n\nActivists on both sides of the divide had anticipated Friday's decision for months. But after the ruling, they stayed focused on their plans to prepare for the Roe v. Wade decision and any upcoming legislative action in Iowa.\n\n\"When we see an end to abortion in our state, that's when we'll celebrate,\" DeWitte said. \"But until then, we have got to keep working and keep pushing until we can see all life protected in Iowa.\"\n\nFor Pulse Life Advocates and other members of the Coalition of Pro-Life Leaders, the focus is passing a constitutional amendment stating explicitly that the state constitution does not recognize a right to an abortion.\n\n\"Who's to say in the future this wouldn't happen again?\" she said. \"We would have no guarantee that future judges, on a whim, wouldn't decide that once again there was a fundamental right.\"\n\nThe constitutional amendment process is already underway. Iowa lawmakers approved language in 2021 that states the constitution does not \"recognize, grant, or secure a right to abortion or require the public funding of abortion.\" That language will need to pass the Iowa House and Senate again in 2023 or 2024. Then, Iowans would vote on the amendment in a general election.\n\nWampler and the Iowa Abortion Access Fund, meanwhile, plan to keep fundraising for abortion grants, educating people about reproductive justice and encouraging Iowans to vote. Wampler said the organization's work will continue, even if Iowa lawmakers restrict or ban abortion in the state.\n\n\"We will continue to get people the care they need, whether it means traveling out of state, and helping with lodging and helping with procedure costs,\" she said. \"We're not going to stop.\"\n\nMajority opinion rejects Planned Parenthood’s objections to law\n\nPlanned Parenthood challenged the 24-hour waiting period on several grounds, including that the Legislature, in adding the provision to another bill in the waning hours of the 2020 legislative session, violated the state constitution’s “single-subject clause” by combining unrelated bills under one heading. The group also argued the new law ran afoul of the 2018 Supreme Court decision. The district court in 2021 found for Planned Parenthood on both counts and blocked the law.\n\nMansfield, however, wrote that the law did not violate the single-subject clause. The bill to which the abortion rule was added restricted when courts could order a brain-dead child to be removed from life support, and Mansfield wrote that the laws could be joined under one heading because “both provisions related to state regulation of individual medical decision-making.”\n\nAs for whether the state should have been allowed to argue for the new law despite the 2018 Supreme Court decision, Mansfield wrote that “it would be unfathomable to say that issue preclusion prevents the State from asking us to revisit a broad principle of constitutional law.”\n\nWhy did the court rule its 2018 decision was wrong?\n\nMansfield wrote that “stare decisis,” or respect for precedent, does not block the court from reconsidering even relatively recent decisions, saying “we do not agree that every state supreme court decision is entitled to some minimum try-out period before it can be challenged.”\n\nHe wrote that he believed the court got it wrong in 2018, when he was on the dissenting side. Even other states that have recognized constitutional protections for abortion have done so in more limited fashions, he wrote, while he argued that Iowa’s 2018 decision went beyond even Roe v. Wade in the protection it afforded to abortion rights.\n\nHe also wrote that the 2018 decision diverged from Iowa’s historical and legal precedents and improperly waded into a divisive social and political debate.\n\n\"We agree with (the 2018 decision) that 'autonomy and dominion over one’s body go to the very heart of what it means to be free.' We also agree that 'being a parent is a life-altering obligation that falls unevenly on women in our society,’” wrote Mansfield. \"Yet, we must disapprove of (the 2018 case's) legal formulation that insufficiently recognizes that future human lives are at stake.”\n\nSplit court disagrees on best path forward\n\nWhile the decision strikes down the 2018 precedent, the justices were divided on what should replace it. Two justices wanted abortion to remain a constitutional right, while two others wanted to go further than the majority and remove nearly all legal impediments to abortion restrictions.\n\nOnly two justices, Dana Oxley and Thomas Waterman, joined Mansfield for the full majority opinion. Chief Justice Susan Christensen and justices Christopher McDonald and Matthew McDermott joined Mansfield’s opinion in parts. Justice Brent Appel, the sole Democratic appointee on the court, wrote a dissenting opinion, and McDermott and Christensen both filed partial dissents.\n\nMcDermott, joined by McDonald, agreed with Mansfield’s analysis of the law, but disagreed with the result. While Mansfield left it to the district court to determine the proper legal standard, McDermott wrote that the 24-hour rule and other abortion restrictions should be considered using the rational basis test, the most permissive standard courts can use in evaluating the constitutionality of a law.\n\nChristensen sided with Mansfield on the single-subject issue. But she argued that the 2018 decision should not be overruled, as did Appel in his opinion, saying the considerable turnover the court has seen in recent years should not result in complete reversal of recent precedent.\n\n“The fact that little has changed in the four years since (2018) is precisely why I cannot join the majority in holding (the 2018 decision) was so wrongly decided that we must already overrule it,” Christensen wrote.\n\nWhat does high-profile reversal mean for the court?\n\nBoth Mansfield and the dissenters acknowledged the concern that such a quick reversal on such a high-profile question could undermine public confidence in the legitimacy of the court.\n\nChristensen, one of the justices appointed since the 2018 decision, warned that the court was acting too quickly. Reversing a prior decision requires \"special justification\" beyond the belief that the prior case was wrongly decided, she wrote.\n\nThe decision also creates implementation concerns, she wrote, tasking a district court with reviewing the proper legal standard for abortion cases at the same time the U.S. Supreme Court is considering reversing Roe and the Legislature is working to amend the Iowa Constitution.\n\n\"Current state and federal constitutional abortion jurisprudence is like a game of Jenga, progressively becoming more unstable until it collapses,\" she wrote. \"... Flawed as the majority believes (the 2018 decision) to be, it at least untethered Iowa from the vulnerable federal standard to provide some sense of stability to Iowa’s abortion jurisprudence.\"\n\nA group of University of Iowa and Drake University law professors who filed a friend-of-the-court brief before the decision urged the majority to uphold the 2018 decision out of respect for precedent, which they characterized as necessary to show justices are not simply following their own policy preferences\n\nDisregarding precedent \"leaves a supreme court free to pick and choose the precedents it likes, calling into question the court’s integrity and legitimacy, making the Court’s decisions unpredictable, and disrespecting the rule of law.\" the professors argued.\n\nMansfield in his opinion noted multiple cases in recent years in which the Supreme Court has reversed itself, sometimes even faster than in this case. He dismissed the professors' concern that the court might appear to be motivated by policy goals rather than legal principles.\n\n\"We know that the professors do not share that cynical view, so why do they ask us to act in fear of it?\" he wrote. \"Shouldn’t we instead follow our solemn oaths to uphold the Iowa laws and constitution? In the end, court decisions should be — and we believe are — judged by the strength of their reasoning, not by the identity of the persons who wrote or joined them.\"\n\nKatie Akin is a politics reporter for the Register.

Wade: Supreme Court draft opinion that would overturn ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIn a stunning breach of Supreme Court confidentiality and secrecy, Politico has obtained what it calls a draft of a majority opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito that would strike down Roe v. Wade.\n\nThe draft was circulated in early February, according to Politico. The final opinion has not been released and votes and language can change before opinions are formally released. The opinion in this case is not expected to be published until late June.\n\nThe court confirmed the authenticity of the document Tuesday. It also stressed it was not the final decision.\n\nRELATED: Breaking down Samuel Alito’s draft opinion\n\nAccording to the draft, the court would overturn Roe v. Wade’s holding of a federal constitutional right to an abortion. The opinion would be the most consequential abortion decision in decades and transform the landscape of women’s reproductive health in America.\n\nIt appears that five justices would be voting to overturn Roe. Chief Justice John Roberts did not want to completely overturn Roe v. Wade, meaning he would have dissented from part of Alito’s draft opinion, sources tell CNN, likely with the court’s three liberals.\n\nThat would mean that the five conservative justices that would make up the majority overturning Roe are Alito and Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.\n\nRoberts is willing, however, to uphold the Mississippi law that would ban abortion at 15 weeks of pregnancy, CNN has learned. Under current law, government cannot interfere with a women’s choice to terminate a pregnancy before about 23 weeks, when a fetus could live outside the womb.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Roberts said he has ordered an investigation.\n\n“This was a singular and egregious breach of that trust that is an affront to the Court and the community of public servants who work here,” Roberts said. I have directed the Marshal of the Court to launch an investigation into the source of the leak.”\n\n“To the extent this betrayal of the confidences of the Court was intended to undermine the integrity of our operations, it will not succeed,” Roberts said. “The work of the Court will not be affected in any way. We at the Court are blessed to have a workforce – permanent employees and law clerks alike – intensely loyal to the institution and dedicated to the rule of law. Court employees have an exemplary and important tradition of respecting the confidentiality of the judicial process and upholding the trust of the Court.”\n\nAfter the draft was published, a crowd gathered outside the Supreme Court building Monday evening, as people came together to console one another and question what to do next.\n\nAt one point, the crowd began to chant, “Hey, hey, ho, ho, Samuel Alito’s gotta go.” “We will not go back.” “Abortion rights are under attack, what do we do, stand up fight back.” “Pack the courts.”\n\nPolitico’s publishing of the draft is unprecedented by the high court’s standards of secrecy. The inner deliberations among the justices while opinions are being drafted and votes are being settled are among the most closely held details in Washington.\n\n“This news is simply stunning for the Supreme Court as an institution,” said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law. “Not only is the result it portends – the overruling of Roe and Casey – a shockwave to our constitutional politics, but we have never seen a leak remotely like this from inside the Court, where we’re not just hearing what the result is going to be, but we’re seeing the draft majority opinion in advance. It’s hard to believe that the former doesn’t help to explain the latter, but it’s an earthquake in both respects.”\n\nThe case in question is Dobbs v. Jackson. It concerns a challenge to Mississippi’s 15-week ban on abortion and oral arguments were heard on December 1. The release of a final opinion in the case is expected later this Spring or early summer.\n\nIn the draft opinion, Alito writes that Roe “must be overruled.”\n\n“The Constitution makes no reference to abortion and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision,” Alito wrote. He said that Roe was “egregiously wrong from the start” and that its reasoning was “exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences.”\n\nHe added, “It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people’s representatives.”\n\n“That is what the Constitution and the rule of law demand,” he said, according to the draft.\n\nAlready nearly half of the states have or will pass laws that ban abortion, while others have enacted strict measures regulating the procedure.\n\nProcess of voting\n\nOral arguments in the case were held on December 1.\n\nUnder normal procedure, by the end of that week the justices would have met in their private conference to take a preliminary vote on the issue. They would have gone around the table in order of seniority discussing their take on the case. Roberts would have gone first, with Barrett last.\n\nAfter that initial tally, if Roberts was in the majority he would assign the majority opinion. Otherwise the most senior justice would have taken that responsibility. After that, draft opinions would go between chambers. In the past, justices have changed their votes and sometimes a majority opinion ultimately becomes a dissent.\n\nA reversal of Roe would leave abortion policy up to individual states and would likely produce a patchwork system where the procedure would remain largely available in Democratic-led states, while Republican-led states would pass extreme limits or outright bans on it.\n\nThe Dobbs case was perhaps the most anticipated case of the court’s term, and most court observers expected that the conservative majority was likely to scale back or outright overturn Roe’s holding. At oral arguments, Roberts was the only one of the six Republican appointees who signaled interest in exploring a narrower opinion that would have upheld Mississippi’s law but preserved some protections for abortion rights.\n\nBecause it is one of the court’s most high-stakes and contentious decisions, the anticipation was that the opinion would be among the final ones the court released at the end of its term in late June.\n\nRoe is the law of the land until the court formally issues its opinion.\n\n“Let’s be clear: This is a draft opinion. It’s outrageous, it’s unprecedented, but it’s not final. Abortion is your right – and it is STILL LEGAL,” Planned Parenthood said in a tweet following Politico’s reporting.\n\nDecades-long project of conservative legal moment\n\nOverturning Roe would be the culmination of a decades-long project of the conservative legal moment.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, when running for the White House in 2016, promised to appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe “automatically.” His nominee Kavanaugh replaced Justice Anthony Kennedy, who sided with the liberal justices in past abortion rights cases. Barrett replaced the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a Democratic appointee and abortion rights champion who died weeks before the 2020 election.\n\nCelebrated by supporters of abortion right and long reviled by critics, Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973 establishing a constitutional right to abortion before fetal viability, which most experts say occurs now at around 23-24 weeks of pregnancy. The decision was reaffirmed in 1992, in Planned Parenthood v. Casey. A majority of the court in that case replaced Roe’s framework with a new standard to determine the validity of laws restricting abortions. The court said that a regulation cannot place an “undue burden” on the right to abortion, which is defined as a “substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability.”\n\nAccording to a CNN Poll conducted by SSRS in January, most Americans oppose overturning Roe, with a majority saying that if the decision was vacated, they’d want to see their own state move toward more permissive abortion laws.\n\nJust 30% of Americans say they’d like to see the Supreme Court completely overturn its Roe vs. Wade decision, with 69% opposed – a finding that’s largely consistent both with other recent polling and with historical trends.\n\nStare decisis and overturning precedent\n\nIn the opinion, Alito also addresses the fact that Roe has been on the books for some 50 years. Although the court is loath to overturn precedent, Alito says it must do so. He said that the notion of “stare decisis” does not “compel unending adherence to Roe’s abuse of judicial authority.”\n\nHe said that instead of “bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue” Roe and a follow-on decision “have enflamed debate and deepened division.”\n\n“The inescapable conclusion,” Alito wrote, according to the draft, “is that a right to an abortion is not deeply rooted in the Nation’s history and traditions.”\n\nHe also said the decision was on a “collision course” with the Constitution “from the day it was decided.”\n\nAlito also pushed back on the notion that if the court were to overturn Roe it could lead the court to overturn other cases like Obergefell v. Hodges, that upheld the right to same-sex marriage. He said that what “sharply distinguishes” Roe from other cases is that “abortion destroys” potential life.\n\nThe court, Alito added, was not able to end the debate on abortion nearly a half century ago when Roe came down, so it should leave the issue to states.\n\n“This court cannot bring about the permanent resolution of a rancorous national controversy simply by dictating a settlement and telling the people to move on,” he wrote.\n\nIf Roe were overturned or fundamentally weakened, 21 states have laws or constitutional amendments already in place that would make them certain to attempt to ban abortion as quickly as possible, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which favors abortion rights.\n\nAn additional five states are likely to ban abortion as soon as possible without federal protections. As of April 2022, 536 abortion restrictions have been introduced in 42 states.\n\nDemocrats outraged, call to end filibuster\n\nPresident Joe Biden said a woman’s right to have an abortion is “fundamental” in his first statement on the issue Tuesday morning.\n\n“Roe has been the law of the land for almost fifty years, and basic fairness and the stability of our law demand that it not be overturned,” Biden said in a statement.\n\nSeveral Senate Democratic candidates immediately called for the elimination of the filibuster and passing legislation to protect abortion rights.\n\n“Democrats need to act NOW—end the filibuster, codify Roe, and defend reproductive freedom,” tweeted Wisconsin state Treasurer Sarah Godlewski, who’s running for her party’s nomination for Senate.”This fight is too urgent.”\n\n“Control of the Senate has never been more important: it’s time to end the filibuster, pass the Women’s Health Protection Act, and fight like hell to make sure all Ohio families are free to make these critical decisions without interference from politicians in Columbus or Washington,” added Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan, who’s favored to win his Democratic primary on Tuesday.\n\nThe push from the Democratic candidates and others is likely to fail, unless some incumbent senators change their minds. In the 50-50 Senate, Democrats need every vote to eliminate the chamber’s rules requiring 60 votes to advance most legislation. And Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona have repeatedly committed to protecting the filibuster, which sets up a 60-vote threshold that requires bipartisan cooperation to pass most legislation.\n\nIn February, Manchin also joined Senate Republicans in blocking the House-passed Women’s Health Protection Act that aimed to preserve access to abortion.\n\nIn a statement, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said overturning Roe would be “the greatest restriction of rights in the past fifty years – not just on women but on all Americans.”\n\n“Several of these conservative Justices, who are in no way accountable to the American people, have lied to the U.S. Senate, ripped up the Constitution and defiled both precedent and the Supreme Court’s reputation,” the leaders said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Tierney Sneed Ariane De Vogue Joan Biskupic", "Tierney Sneed", "Ariane De Vogue", "Joan Biskupic"], "publish_date": "2022/05/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/05/02/abortion-leaked-opinion-court-considering-overturning-roe-v-wade/9623699002/", "title": "Roe v.

Politico said the draft was circulated in February, about two months after oral arguments in the blockbuster case.\n\nIt's Amy with the latest news about abortion in the U.S.\n\nWhat is the legal case at issue?\n\nThe case is Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which centers around Mississippi's ban on most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Abortion rights advocates say allowing the ban to take effect would essentially overturn Roe by wiping away one of its central holdings: that women have a right to an abortion until viability, the point when a fetus can survive outside the womb, or about 24 weeks into a pregnancy.\n\nWhat will happen if Roe v. Wade is overturned? What states will ban abortion?\n\nIf the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, states would be free to make abortion illegal. Nearly half of the states already have restrictive abortion laws in place that would take effect immediately upon the ruling. Another 16 states and the District of Columbia have passed laws explicitly protecting abortion rights in case Roe v. Wade is overturned.\n\nWho will be most affected by a ban on abortion?\n\nWomen of color and other marginalized, low-income people will be most affected by an overturning of Roe v. Wade, health and policy experts said.\n\nHalf of U.S. states, concentrated in the South, Midwest and Plains, have restrictive abortion laws set to go into effect should the reversal take place. Experts say those who disproportionately have trouble accessing health care, often people of color, will be most impacted.\n\nMore than half of the nation’s Black population lives in the South, where women of color, including Hispanic women, make up a significant proportion. The Plains states also have a large Indigenous population. Days ago, the Oklahoma Legislature passed a six-week abortion ban similar to one adopted by Texas last year.\n\nIf Roe is overturned, people may travel hundreds of miles to get to states where abortions are still allowed. Younger and lower-income people may not be able to afford the cost of travel.\n\nCan President Biden, Congress protect abortion rights?\n\nWhile President Joe Biden and Democratic lawmakers vowed to use legislation to codify abortion rights, the Senate's filibuster remains an obstacle.\n\nIn effect, filibuster rules require 60 votes to end debate on legislation and move to a vote. Currently, the Senate is evenly divided 50-50, with Vice President Kamala Harris acting as a tie breaking vote.\n\nAs a result, many progressives are calling on the Senate to eliminate the filibuster.\n\nBiden did not say Tuesday when asked whether he would support eliminating the filibuster to try to codify Roe. v. Wade, but White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that question was misguided because there are not enough votes in the Senate to codify Roe v. Wade regardless.\n\nMore stories on abortion you should read:\n\n'It's a really scary time' : Anguish and anger erupted across the country Tuesday as abortion-rights advocates began flooding the streets, from the steps of the Supreme Court to New York, Nevada, Texas and California.\n\n: Anguish and anger erupted across the country Tuesday as abortion-rights advocates began flooding the streets, from the steps of the Supreme Court to New York, Nevada, Texas and California.

The Supreme Court was expected to release a decision in this specific case in about two months. But abortion-rights activists have been warning the court was leaning in this direction. That's in large part why the reporting by Politico is being taken so seriously.\n\nElizabeth Sepper, a University of Texas law professor who studies health law, said the leak could be posturing by one side or another, tempering expectations or floating a trial balloon. Still, she said the highly unusual leak is reverberating across the country.\n\n“I think the draft is a wakeup call. The end of abortion access for many Americans is not hypothetical. A majority of the Supreme Court has cast their votes against a longstanding constitutional right to autonomy and self determination,” she said.\n\nReport:Leaked draft Supreme Court opinion suggests majority may overturn Roe v. Wade\n\nWhat is Roe v. Wade?\n\nThe Supreme Court's landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision is credited with legalizing abortion nationwide.\n\nIn 1969, a pregnant woman under the pseudonym \"Jane Roe\" challenged the constitutionality of Texas abortion laws forbidding abortions in most cases. By a vote of seven to two, the Supreme Court ruled in her favor in the case, called Roe v. Wade, finding that laws criminalizing abortions violated the Fourteenth Amendment. The decision struck down many state abortion laws during a time when abortions under many circumstances were banned in most states.\n\nROE V. WADE EXPLAINER:What is Roe v. Wade and how could the Texas abortion law affect it?\n\nWhat does overturn mean? What does codify mean?\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court sets precedents, meaning they typically follow previous decisions in which they resolved conflicting interpretations of the law. But sometimes, courts choose to overturn precedent, rejecting a prior interpretation of the law in favor of a new one.\n\nTo codify something is to make it a code of law. Codifying Roe v. Wade means passing either a state of federal law that would affirm abortion rights. After news broke of the leaked Supreme Court draft decision, President Joe Biden called on Congress to pass legislation to codify abortion rights.\n\n\"We will need more pro-choice senators and a pro-choice majority in the House to adopt legislation that codifies Roe, which I will work to pass and sign into law,\" he said.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said he would hold a Senate vote on legislation to enshrine abortion rights, though the future of such a bill is entirely uncertain in the closely divided chamber.\n\n\"This is as urgent and real as it gets,\" he said. \"Every American is going to see on which side every senator stands.\"\n\nCan Biden, Congress protect abortion rights? What is a filibuster?\n\nWhile Biden and Democratic vowed to use legislation to codify abortion rights, the Senate's filibuster remains an obstacle.\n\nIn effect, filibuster rules require 60 votes to end debate on legislation and move to a vote. Currently, the Senate is evenly divided 50-50 with Vice President Kamala Harris acting as a tie breaking vote.\n\nAs a result, many progressives are calling on the Senate to eliminate the filibuster rules.\n\nBiden did not say Tuesday when asked whether he would support eliminating the filibuster to try to codify Roe. v. Wade, but White House press secretary Jen Psaki said regardless the votes in the evenly divided Senate to codify Roe. v. Wade aren't there, making any calls to eliminate the filibuster to pass abortion-rights legislation misguided.\n\nShe pointed to the Senate's 46-48 vote in March to defeat the Women’s Health Protection Act, which also sought to protect abortion rights, as an example.\n\n“I think it's important to note that there has been a vote on this. It failed,” Psaki said. “It did not have even 50 votes, which means even if the filibuster were overturned, there would have not been enough votes to get this passed.\"\n\nInstead, Democratic leaders have pointed to the November elections, hoping the issue will energize voters to elect “more pro-choice officials,\" Psaki said.\n\nWhat will happen if Roe v. Wade is overturned? What states will ban abortion?\n\nIf the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, states would be free to make abortion illegal. Nearly half of U.S. states already have laws in place that would take effect immediately upon a Supreme Court ruling. Another 16 states and the District of Columbia have passed laws explicitly protecting abortion rights if Roe v. Wade is ever overturned, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights research and policy organization.\n\n\"This is going to be an unprecedented earthquake in American life,\" said Amelia Bonow, founder of the Seattle-based national abortion access group Shout Your Abortion.\n\nWho is Samuel Alito? Who are the other Supreme Court judges?\n\nSamuel Alito was nominated to the Supreme Court by Former President George W. Bush in 2005. Since then, he has been a consistent conservative voice on the court and one the the court's most outspoken proponents of religious freedom.\n\nThe other current members of the U.S. Supreme Court include John Roberts, Clarence Thomas, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Roberts, a member of the court's conservative wing, serves as chief justice after being nominated by Bush in 2005.\n\nWHO IS SAMUEL A. ALITO?:What to know about the Bush-nominated Supreme Court justice\n\nHas the Supreme Court ever overruled past decisions?\n\nUsually, the Supreme Court doesn't revisit decisions, according to the principle known as \"stare decisis,\" a Latin phrase for \"to stand by things decided.\" In other words, the Supreme Court tends not to overrule past decisions, even if the composition of the court has changed.\n\nBut that's not a binding requirement, and the court has changed rulings, though rarely.\n\nOne of the most well-known rulings where the court reversed itself was the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education ruling, which struck down a 1896 ruling legalizing segregation under the \"separate but equal\" doctrine.\n\nConservatives have long targeted Roe to be overturned, and former President Donald Trump appointed three conservative justices to the bench — Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett — after promising to select candidates based in part on their willingness to revisit the decision.\n\nWhat did Roe v. Wade actually say?The landmark abortion rights ruling, explained\n\nWho would abortion bans in the US affect the most?\n\nAbortion-rights activists say banning the procedures will hurt people of color the hardest. People of color have the highest rate of getting abortions in the nation, so these Americans will likely have the hardest time with unwanted pregnancies or will be forced to raise children they cannot afford or didn't want.\n\nAdvocates also say abortion bans will harm poor Americans disproportionally because they will be less able to travel to states where abortion remains legal. Advocates have raised concern that some may instead turn to illegal abortions close to home, raising the risk of death for a pregnant person.\n\nDr. Stella Safo, a New York-based primary care physician and founder of Just Equity for Health, a company focused on equitable health care, called the drafted decision \"maddening.\"\n\n\"It won't stop people from getting abortions — it will stop people from getting safe abortions,” she said. “All the people who are minoritized historically in this country, and who are poor — it’s low-income women who are going to suffer the most from this and it's absolutely maddening.\"\n\nROE V WADE:Leaked abortion opinion by Supreme Court adds more fuel to already raging fire of debate\n\nWhat happens next on the Supreme Court abortion decision?\n\nWe wait. The court is expected to rule on this specific case in about two months. It's possible the court could rule differently than what the draft opinion says.\n\nIn a statement, the anti-abortion rights group National Right to Life said it was waiting for the actual decision: \"In response to the Politico article claiming to have a copy of the initial draft of the Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson, National Right to Life agrees with the statement of Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch who said, 'We will let the Supreme Court speak for itself and wait for the Court’s official opinion.'\"\n\nAbortion-rights groups have been gearing up for this fight for months and have vowed not to let state bans block access to abortions. They have been strengthening networks that help low-income people seeking abortions travel to states where it remains legal as well as providing access to abortion pills to induce medical abortions.\n\nWhat does this mean for future civil rights cases?\n\nLegal experts say the reasoning in this draft decision could lead the Supreme Court to overturn other civil rights protections, including gay marriage, and let states decide.\n\nDavid Lane, a Denver-based civil rights attorney, said the draft decision could prompt the creation of a new \"Underground Railroad\" where people have to travel across state lines to exercise civil rights they once enjoyed nationally.\n\n\"There are innumerable earthshaking events that could flow from this,\" Lane said. \"The damage that this could to do American civil liberties is incalculable.\"\n\nContributing: Joey Garrison and Dylan Wells, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/06/17/iowa-supreme-court-abortion/7658949001/", "title": "Iowa Supreme Court: Abortion is not protected in state constitution", "text": "The Iowa Supreme Court overruled a 2018 decision that protected abortion under the state constitution on Friday.\n\nWhile rejecting a constitutional guarantee of the right to abortion in Iowa, Friday's fractured decision did not say what the new standard should be.\n\nThe decision, coupled with the potential overturn of Roe v.

Wade, the 1973 decision that established a nationwide right to abortion — would give Iowa lawmakers significantly more freedom to pass and enforce restrictive abortion laws.\n\nThe Iowa Supreme Court's reversal came in a fractured decision that reverses a lower court's decision to block a 2020 law that put in place 24-hour waiting period before an abortion. The majority opinion said the Supreme Court's previous ruling establishing a constitutional right to an abortion \"insufficiently recognizes that future human lives are at stake.”\n\nThe ruling sends the case back to the lower court for reconsideration.\n\nSCOTUS decision:If Roe v.

Kim Reynolds, a Republican, appointing four of the seven justices.\n\nWhile rejecting a constitutional guarantee of the right to abortion, Friday's decision did not say what the new standard should be.\n\n\"Although we overrule (the 2018 decision), and thus reject the proposition that there is a fundamental right to an abortion in Iowa’s Constitution subjecting abortion regulation to strict scrutiny, we do not at this time decide what constitutional standard should replace it,\" wrote Justice Edward Mansfield, who penned the majority opinion.\n\nMore:Abortions in the US have increased for the first time in 30 years, new survey finds\n\nSplit court disagrees on best path forward\n\nWhile the Friday decision strikes down the 2018 precedent, the justices were divided on what should replace it. Two justices wanted abortion to remain a constitutional right in Iowa, while two others wanted to remove nearly all legal impediments to abortion legislation.\n\nOnly two justices, Dana Oxley and Thomas Waterman, joined Mansfield for the full majority opinion. Chief Justice Susan Christensen and justices Christopher McDonald and Matthew McDermott joined Mansfield’s opinion in parts. Justice Brent Appel, the sole Democratic appointee on the court, wrote a dissenting opinion, and McDermott and Christensen both filed partial dissents.\n\nThe fractured opinion shows the justices conflicted over how Iowa courts should proceed as they await the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court on the fate of Roe.\n\nHow will the decision impact Iowa abortion laws?\n\nRepublican leaders in Iowa have passed laws to impose waiting periods or forbid abortion much earlier in pregnancy, only to see those laws blocked by the courts.\n\nFriday's decision means anti-abortion lawmakers in Iowa will no longer need to contend with state-level constitutional protections, which would have remained in place even if the Roe case is overturned.\n\nGov. Reynolds celebrated the Iowa Supreme Court decision in a Friday morning statement.\n\n“Today’s ruling is a significant victory in our fight to protect the unborn. The Iowa Supreme Court reversed its earlier 2018 decision, which made Iowa the most abortion-friendly state in the country,\" Reynolds said. \"Every life is sacred and should be protected, and as long as I’m governor that is exactly what I will do.”\n\nIn Wyoming:Police looking for woman who tried to burn down lone Wyoming abortion clinic before it could open\n\nFor the moment, Iowa lawmakers must still contend with Roe, which federally protects the right to an abortion before the fetus is viable outside the womb.\n\nBut if the U.S. Supreme Court adopts a leaked majority opinion in the upcoming decision, Roe will be reversed, giving individual states leeway to pass and enforce laws that limit abortions even in the earliest weeks of pregnancy.\n\nFor subscribers:Online data, medical records could be used to put women in jail under new abortion laws\n\nReynolds has declined to speculate about whether she would call lawmakers back to Des Moines for a special session on abortion.\n\nHouse Speaker Pat Grassley, R-New Hartford, said the decision \"is a positive step in our fight to protect the unborn.\" He did not offer specific legislative plans, but reaffirmed his caucus's commitment against abortion.\n\n\"As we work to understand the full impact of this decision, Iowans can be assured that Iowa House Republicans are strongly pro-life and remain committed to protecting the unborn and providing additional support for new mothers,\" Grassley said.\n\nDemocrats decried the ruling Friday morning. House Minority Leader Jennifer Konfrst said it was a \"step backwards for Iowa families.\"\n\n\"Iowans should always have the final say in making their own healthcare decisions, including abortion, without interference from politicians,\" Konfrst, D-Windsor Heights, said in a statement.\n\nWhy did the court rule its 2018 decision was wrong?\n\nMansfield wrote that “stare decisis,” or respect for precedent, does not block the court from reconsidering even relatively recent decisions, writing that “we do not agree that every state supreme court decision is entitled to some minimum try-out period before it can be challenged.”\n\nAnd on the merits, Mansfield believes, the court got it wrong in 2018. Even other states that have recognized constitutional protections for abortion have done so in more limited fashions, Mansfield wrote, while he argues that Iowa’s 2018 decision went beyond even Roe v. Wade in the protection it affords to abortion rights.\n\nMansfield, who was in the minority against the 2018 decision, also wrote that the 2018 decision diverged from Iowa’s historical and legal precedents and improperly waded into a divisive social and political debate.\n\n\"We agree with the (the 2018 decision) that 'autonomy and dominion over one’s body go to the very heart of what it means to be free.' We also agree that 'being a parent is a life-altering obligation that falls unevenly on women in our society,’” wrote Mansfield, who was in the minority against the 2018 decision. \"Yet, we must disapprove of (the 2018 case's) legal formulation that insufficiently recognizes that future human lives are at stake.”\n\nFollow Katie Akin on Twitter at @katie_akin.

Trump. They can't stand that Americans love him.\"\n\n\"The idea that the FBI or any other law enforcement agency is raiding a former president’s house is stunning, period, – and unprecedented. Even for Trump,” said Matthew Dallek, a longtime presidential historian who has written extensively on modern-era politics and presidents.\n\n“If the FBI or any other federal agencies are raiding the former president’s home, I would presume it is for a very active criminal investigation, or investigations,” Dallek told USA TODAY. “The FBI raids homes typically for hardened criminals and mobsters.

The source did not characterize the law enforcement action as a raid, emphasizing that officials were notified in advance of the FBI's arrival.\n\nAs unprecedented as such action on a former president home is, Bradley P. Moss, a national security lawyer, said Trump’s handling of documents justified the search.\n\n“No one, not even Donald Trump, is above the law,” he says. “Properly marked classified documents were taken to Mr. Trump’s personal residence after he left office and were stored in an unsecured manner for months. That is a clear violation of the law.”\n\nLast month, it was disclosed that federal prosecutors had been questioning witnesses about the conduct of the former president as part of an inquiry into an effort to overturn the 2020 election, a person familiar with the matter said.\n\nThe action is part of a more aggressive review of attempts by the former president's allies to intervene in the election by substituting fake electors to tilt the vote in key states and to pressure former Vice President Mike Pence to block the certification of President Joe Biden's election.\n\nThe news in your inbox:Sign up for the OnPolitics newsletter here\n\nWhile the source said prosecutors have recently questioned witnesses about Trump, the person declined to describe the queries in detail.\n\nDOJ approval of FBI raid\n\nFormer FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe told CNN on Monday night that the search warrant issued for Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence would have been “planned out and reevaluated and legally examined” at the highest levels of the FBI and Justice Department.\n\n“I can't overemphasize how big of a deal this would have been within the Department of Justice and the FBI,” said McCabe. “This is not, you know, a couple of agents showing up at some judge’s door in the middle of the night to get an emergency warrant.”\n\n“This is something that would have been planned out and reevaluated and legally examined from every possible angle by the entirety of the leadership structure (of) both organizations,\" he said.\n\nCapitol attack:Pressure campaigns, predictable violence: What we learned from all eight Jan. 6 hearings\n\nTrump allies:Georgia election investigation heats up.

I witnessed it,” former Trump White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham told USA TODAY. “I saw him on, I don’t know, how many occasions ripping up documents, throwing some on the floor, ripping some up and putting them in his pocket, not ripping some of them up and putting them in his pocket.”\n\nGrisham watched Trump mishandle documents while they were on a plane together from Mar-a-Lago to Washington on their way to the Middle East.\n\n“Those could have been classified, or maybe they weren't. I don't know,\" she said. \"But it's still mishandling documents. Anything the president technically handles is considered sensitive.”\n\nLast month, federal investigators searched the home of former assistant attorney general Jeffrey Clark, who drafted a letter to officials in six states to overturn their election results. And authorities seized the cellphone of John Eastman, one of Trump's personal lawyers who developed a scheme to have then-Vice President Pence singlehandedly reject electors from states Joe Biden won.

The Justice Department declined to comment to CNN.\n\nA White House official said it was not notified about the search. President Joe Biden, a senior administration official said, was unaware of the search of Mar-a-Lago until after it was reported on the news.\n\nInvestigation into documents\n\nThe National Archives, charged with collecting and sorting presidential material, has previously said at least 15 boxes of White House records were recovered from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort – including some that were classified.\n\nIn early June, a handful of investigators made a rare visit to the property seeking more information about potentially classified material from Trump’s time in the White House that had been taken to Florida. The four investigators, including Jay Bratt, the chief of the counterintelligence and export control section at the Justice Department, sat down with two of Trump’s attorneys, Bobb and Evan Corcoran, according to a source present for the meeting.\n\nAt the beginning of the meeting, Trump stopped by and greeted the investigators near a dining room. After he left, without answering any questions, the investigators asked the attorneys if they could see where Trump was storing the documents. The attorneys took the investigators to the basement room where the boxes of materials were being stored, and the investigators looked around the room before eventually leaving, according to the source.\n\nA second source said that Trump came in to say hi and made small talk but left while the attorneys spoke with investigators. The source said some of the documents shown to investigators had top secret markings.\n\nFive days later, on June 8, Trump’s attorneys received a letter from investigators asking them to further secure the room where the documents were stored. Aides subsequently added a padlock to the room.\n\nIn April and May, aides to Trump at Mar-a-Lago were interviewed by the FBI as part of the probe into the handling of presidential records, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\n“It is a federal crime to remove classified documents wrongly. And so if you are filling out that affidavit and you have to list the crime, you can list that as the crime,” said Elie Honig, a former federal and state prosecutor and a CNN senior legal analyst.\n\nHonig told CNN’s Erin Burnett on “OutFront” that the timing of the search held with the longstanding department rule not to execute politically sensitive moves within 90 days of an election.\n\n“Today is just about 90 days out exactly from the midterms, I think maybe 91 or 92 days out. That policy, that may be a reason why they did it today because they want to stay clear of that if they’re interpreting that as a 90 day rule,” he said.\n\nMembers of GOP back Trump\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel claimed in a statement that Democrats “continually weaponize the bureaucracy against Republicans,” and a number of Republican lawmakers came to the former President’s defense on social media.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, wrote that he had “seen enough.”\n\n“Attorney General (Merrick) Garland: preserve your documents and clear your calendar.

The Department of Justice has reached an intolerable state of weaponized politicization,” the Republican leader wrote. “When Republicans take back the House, we will conduct immediate oversight of this department, follow the facts, and leave no stone unturned.”\n\nGOP Sen. Rick Scott of Florida said that “we need answers NOW. The FBI must explain what they were doing today & why.”\n\nBut the chair of the House Oversight Committee, which is investigating Trump’s handling of documents, called on the Justice Department to “fully investigate” the former President’s handling of information.\n\n“Presidents have a solemn duty to protect America’s national security, and allegations that former President Trump put our security at risk by mishandling classified information warrant the utmost scrutiny,” Democratic Rep. Carolyn Maloney of New York said.\n\n“Although details of today’s actions at Mar-a-Lago are still emerging, it is clear that the Department of Justice must fully investigate President Trump’s potentially grave mishandling of classified information.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Kaitlan Collins Kevin Liptak Katelyn Polantz Sara Murray Evan Perez Gaborr Dan Berman", "Kaitlan Collins", "Kevin Liptak", "Katelyn Polantz", "Sara Murray", "Evan Perez", "Dan Berman"], "publish_date": "2022/08/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/12/politics/trump-mar-a-lago-investigation/index.html", "title": "FBI took 11 sets of classified material from Trump's Mar-a-Lago ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe Justice Department removed 11 sets of classified documents from former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence while executing a search warrant this week for possible violations of the Espionage Act and other crimes, according to court documents unsealed and released on Friday.\n\nThe property receipt, which was also released on Friday, for Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home shows that some of the materials recovered were marked as “top secret/SCI” – one of the highest levels of classification.\n\nThe search warrant identifies three federal crimes that the Justice Department is looking at as part of its investigation: violations of the Espionage Act, obstruction of justice and criminal handling of government records. The inclusion of the crimes indicates the Justice Department has probable cause to investigate those offenses as it was gathering evidence in the search. No one has been charged with a crime at this time.\n\nThe warrant receipt didn’t detail the subject of these classified documents but did note that federal agents seized just one set marked “top secret/SCI.”\n\nAgents also took four sets of “top secret” documents, three sets of “secret” documents, and three sets of “confidential” documents, court documents show. In total, the unsealed warrant shows the FBI collected more than 20 boxes, as well as binders of photos, sets of classified government materials and at least one handwritten note.\n\nThe warrant, which was unsealed and released publicly following a federal judge’s order, was obtained by CNN ahead of its release. The moment marks an unprecedented week that began with the search – an evidence-gathering step in a national security investigation.\n\nSearch warrant reveals new details about scope of FBI probe\n\nWhile details about the documents themselves remain scarce, the laws cited in the warrant offer new insight into what the FBI was looking for when it searched Trump’s home, an unprecedented step that has prompted a firestorm of criticism from the former President’s closest allies.\n\nThe laws cover “destroying or concealing documents to obstruct government investigations” and the unlawful removal of government records, according to the search warrant released Friday.\n\nAlso among the laws listed is one known as the Espionage Act, which relates to the “retrieval, storage, or transmission of national defense information or classified material.”\n\nAll three criminal laws cited in the warrant are from Title 18 of the United States Code. None of them solely hinge on whether information was deemed to be unclassified.\n\nOne of the less-sensitive items taken from Trump’s resort, according to a the property receipt, was a document about pardoning Roger Stone, a staunch Trump ally who was convicted in 2019 of lying to Congress during its probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election. (Trump pardoned Stone before leaving office, shielding Stone from a three-year prison term.)\n\nIt’s unclear how the Stone-related document seized during the search is tied to the broader criminal probe into Trump’s potential mishandling of classified materials.\n\nDuring the search, FBI agents also recovered material about the “President of France,” according to the warrant receipt. The French embassy in Washington declined to respond Friday to the development.\n\nFBI agents searched ’45 Office’ at Mar-a-Lago\n\nThe court documents released Friday also offer new details about the search itself and revealed that FBI agents were only allowed access to specific locations within Mar-a-Lago as they combed Trump’s resort residence for potential evidence of crimes.\n\nThe judge authorized the FBI to search what the bureau called the “45 Office,” an apparent reference to Trump’s place in history as the 45th President. Agents were also permitted to search “all other rooms or areas” at Mar-a-Lago that were available to Trump and his staff for storing boxes and documents.\n\n“The locations to be searched include the ’45 Office,’ all storage rooms, and all other rooms or areas within the premises used or available to be used by FPOTUS and his staff and in which boxes or documents could be stored, including all structures or buildings on the estate,” the warrant says, using the acronym “FPOTUS” to refer to the Former President of the United States.\n\nThe FBI’s warrant application to the judge specifically said that federal agents would avoid areas being rented or used by third parties, “such as Mar-a-Lago members” and “private guest suites.” Trump owns the sprawling estate, and it is his primary residence as well as a members-only club and resort.\n\n“It is described as a mansion with approximately 58 bedrooms, 33 bathrooms, on a 17-acre estate,” FBI agents told the judge in their application, describing the Mar-a-Lago property.\n\nTrump did not oppose release of search warrant\n\nThe FBI search at the resort in Palm Beach, Florida, on Monday was followed by days of silence from the Justice Department, as is the department’s normal practice for ongoing investigations.\n\nThen on Thursday, Attorney General Merrick Garland announced that the department had moved to unseal the search warrant and two attachments, including an inventory list, but also stressed that some of the department’s work must happen outside of public view.\n\n“We do that to protect the constitutional rights of all Americans and to protect the integrity of our investigations,” Garland said, while explaining that he would not provide more detail about the basis of the search.\n\nTrump said in a late-night post on his Truth Social platform Thursday that he would “not oppose the release of documents” and that he was “going a step further by ENCOURAGING the immediate release of those documents.”\n\nThe court had instructed the Justice Department to confer with Trump about its request to unseal the warrant documents and set a Friday deadline to report back on whether he opposed their release.\n\nTrump’s team had contacted outside attorneys about how to proceed, and the former President’s orbit was caught off guard by Garland’s announcement.\n\nIn a pair of posts to Truth Social following Garland’s statement, Trump continued to claim that his attorneys were “cooperating fully” and had developed “very good relationships” with federal investigators prior to Monday’s search at Mar-a-Lago.\n\n“The government could have had whatever they wanted, if we had it,” Trump said. “Everything was fine, better than most previous Presidents, and then, out of nowhere and with no warning, Mar-a-Lago was raided, at 6:30 in the morning, by VERY large numbers of agents, and even ‘safecrackers.’”\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments.",

government documents were “likely concealed and removed” from a storage room at Mar-a-Lago as part of an effort to “obstruct” the FBI’s investigation into former President Donald Trump’s potential mishandling of classified materials, the Justice Department said in a blockbuster court filing Tuesday night.\n\nMore than 320 classified documents have now been recovered from Mar-a-Lago, the Justice Department said, including more than 100 in the FBI search earlier this month.\n\nTuesday’s filing represents the Justice Department’s strongest case to date that Trump concealed classified material he was keeping at Mar-a-Lago in an attempt to obstruct the FBI’s investigation into the potential mishandling of classified material.\n\nThe Justice Department revealed the startling new details as part of its move to oppose Trump’s effort to intervene in the federal investigation that led to the search of his Florida resort and his desire for a “special master” to be appointed to the

final page of the filing showing classified documents arrayed on the floor of Trump’s office – full of highly classified markings like “HCS,” meaning human intelligence sources – hammered home how sensitive the material Trump had taken was.\n\nAt issue is Trump’s compliance with a grand jury subpoena, issued in May, demanding that he turn over classified documents from Mar-a-Lago. Prosecutors said Tuesday that some documents were likely removed from a storage room before Trump’s lawyers examined the area, while they were trying to comply with the subpoena. The timeline is essential, because Trump’s lawyers later told investigators that they searched the storage area and that all classified documents were accounted for.\n\n“The government also developed evidence that government records were likely concealed and removed from the Storage Room and that efforts were likely taken to obstruct the government’s investigation,” prosecutors wrote. “This included evidence indicating that boxes formerly in the Storage Room were not returned prior to counsel’s review.”\n\nThe allegations came after the DOJ’s filing went into specific detail about actions from Trump’s team that the department implies were obstructive to its probe.\n\nIn the filing opposing Trump’s request, DOJ argues that the former president lacks standing over presidential records “because those records do not belong to him,” as presidential records are considered property of the government.\n\nThe Presidential Records Act makes clear that “[t]he United States” has “complete ownership, possession, and control of them,” the DOJ filing states.\n\nTrump has argued that his constitutional rights have been violated and that some of the documents seized earlier this month contain material covered by privilege – particularly executive privilege.\n\nThe Justice Department was ordered to submit the filing by Judge Aileen Cannon, who has already indicated she is inclined to grant Trump’s request for third party oversight of documents the FBI seized Mar-a-Lago.\n\nThe role of a special master is to filter out any materials seized in a search that don’t belong in the hands of investigators because of a privilege. Special masters have been used in high-profile cases before, but usually in cases where the FBI has searched an attorney’s office or home and there is a need to filter out materials concerning attorney-client privilege. Trump’s request has centered on the need to protect documents concerning executive privilege from his conduct as president.\n\nSignals from Cannon, a Trump appointee, that she is leaning toward appointing a special master in the Mar-a-Lago search have raised eyebrows among legal observers. For one, Trump filed his request for the appointment two weeks after the search of his Florida home, risking the potential that the Justice Department is already done with the bulk of its review. Secondly, Trump and the judge alike have pointed to civil rules concerning special master appointments, when the search warrant is arising in a criminal context.\n\nSince the August 8 search, a number of previously secret court filings the DOJ submitted to obtain the warrant have been made partially public in part because of a bid for transparency filed in court by several media organizations, including CNN.\n\nThose redacted documents have revealed that the search was connected to a DOJ investigation into alleged violations of the Espionage Act, criminal mishandling of government documents and obstruction of justice. According to an FBI affidavit that was released last week, an FBI review of 15 boxes retrieved by the National Archives from Mar-a-Lago in January found 184 documents bearing classification markings – some of them identified as particularly sensitive government documents.\n\nTrump, in seeking the special master, has stressed in court filings the lack of criminal enforcement in the Presidential Records Act, a Watergate-era law laying out the process for preserving presidential records. He did not mention the three criminal statutes the DOJ cited in its warrant documents. Trump’s lawyers have also emphasized his supposedly unfettered ability when he was president to declassify documents, though the statutes in question don’t require that the materials be classified.\n\nWednesday morning, Trump posted on his social media platform on Truth Social for the first time since the Justice Department filing and once again claimed to have declassified documents that were found at his Mar-a-Lago residence.\n\nIn one of his most recent posts, Trump appeared to comment on the photo of top-secret documents laid out on the floor, saying, “Terrible the way the FBI… threw documents haphazardly all over the floor,” and, “Lucky I Declassified!”\n\nIn other posts, he attacked the FBI and DOJ generally and said, “This is the time, after many years of lawbreaking & unfairness, to clean things up. All things for a reason. DRAIN THE SWAMP!!!” He repeated his false claims of a stolen election and said, “Our Country is going to hell!” He also claimed crowds are “already forming” for his rally on Saturday.\n\nTrump’s attorney limited what DOJ could look at during June visit\n\nA top Justice Department official contends that federal investigators were limited in what they could look through when visiting the resort in June – contrary to the Trump team’s narrative of total cooperation.\n\nTrump’s lawyer requested that the FBI come to the resort to pick up the documents after the Trump team had received a grand jury subpoena in May seeking any materials marked classified, according to the Justice Department.\n\nDOJ’s account also undermined claims by Trump and his allies that the former President had declassified the materials in question.\n\n“When producing the documents, neither counsel nor the custodian asserted that the former President had declassified the documents or asserted any claim of executive privilege,” the filing said. “Instead, counsel handled them in a manner that suggested counsel believed that the documents were classified: the production included a single Redweld envelope, double-wrapped in tape, containing the document.”\n\nIn the DOJ’s account, Trump’s lawyer said that all the remaining documents from Trump’s White House were being kept in the storage at Mar-a-Lago. “Counsel further represented that there were no other records stored in any private office space or other location at the Premises and that all available boxes were searched,” the filing said.\n\nProsecutors confirmed Trump’s assertion that the visiting DOJ and FBI officials were then allowed to visit the storage area.\n\n“Critically, however, the former President’s counsel explicitly prohibited government personnel from opening or looking inside any of the boxes that remained in the storage room, giving no opportunity for the government to confirm that no documents with classification markings remained,” the DOJ said.\n\nDOJ reveals grand jury proceedings related to Mar-a-Lago search happening in DC\n\nThe Justice Department confirmed that grand jury subpoenas had been issued in its probe, and that the grand jury that issued them had been empaneled in DC. The department included a copy of a May 11 subpoena for government records at Mar-a-Lago marked as classified that indicated the existence of the DC federal grand jury. Before making the subpoena public, the department on Monday got permission to do so from Chief Judge Beryl Howell in the DC District Court, according to a footnote in its brief.\n\nThe reference to Howell suggests that in addition to Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart and Cannon in Florida, a third judge is now involved in the DOJ’s probe.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Jeremy Herb Tierney Sneed Marshall Cohen Evan Perez Sara Murray", "Jeremy Herb", "Tierney Sneed", "Marshall Cohen", "Evan Perez", "Sara Murray"], "publish_date": "2022/08/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/08/12/maralago-search-warrant-live-updates/10306459002/", "title": "Trump Mar-a-Lago estate warrant unsealed by federal judge", "text": "The warrant authorizing federal agents to search former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence was unsealed Friday by a federal judge, after the Justice Department requested that it be made public.\n\nFederal authorities sought a range of highly sensitive documents, including 11 caches of classified materials, indicating that the federal investigation was examining possible violations of the Espionage Act, according to documents unsealed Friday.\n\nThe action came shortly after the Department of Justice wrote in a new court filing Friday that, after conferring with Trump's attorneys, the former president does not object to making the search warrant of his Mar-a-Lago estate public.\n\nBefore the document was released, details of what the FBI was looking for in its Monday search started to be reported, including that FBI agents who searched Trump's home retrieved boxes that included 11 sets of classified documents, said a person who has reviewed the documents.\n\nRead the search warrant:Read the FBI's search warrant for Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago property\n\n“Not only will I not oppose the release of the documents,” Trump said in a statement late Thursday, “I am going a step further by encouraging the immediate release of those documents.”\n\nDocument:Read the Justice Department's motion to unseal Trump Mar-a-Lago search warrant\n\nLatest developments:\n\n►FBI agents who searched Donald Trump's home this week retrieved boxes that included 11 sets of classified documents, said a person who has reviewed the documents.

William Leonard, the former head of the U.S. National Archives’ Information Security Oversight Office and the government's overseer of classification of records.\n\nThat is especially the case, he said, regarding nuclear weapons technology, covert operations, spying and military sources and methods and other government secrets that would be devastating if they fell into the wrong hands.\n\nGiven the freewheeling atmosphere and access to the public at Mar-a-Lago, a members only club, “If a foreign intelligence operatives haven't already attempted, if not succeeded in penetrating Mar Lago, I'd be very surprised, Leonard told USA TODAY. “It just boggles my mind in terms of how did we ever get to this point where, you know, we're concerned about the busboy catering wedding (at Mar-a-Lago) gaining access to nuclear secrets.”\n\n-- Josh Meyer\n\nWhat we know:What did the FBI look for – and find – when searching Trump's Mar-a-Lago home?\n\nFBI agents retrieved information classified top secret and sensitive\n\nAmong the trove of classified information retrieved was material designated at one of the highest levels of classification: Top Secret/SCI, or sensitive compartmented information.\n\nThe actual nature of the information was not detailed in the warrant, though the document indicated that FBI agents had recovered some 20 boxes of information.\n\nAccording to the warrant agents search a location known as the \"45 Office, all storage rooms, and all other rooms or areas within the premises used or available to be used” by the president and his staff.\n\n– Kevin Johnson\n\nDOJ warrant indicates Trump being investigated in with connection with statutes related to espionage, obstruction\n\nA search warrant reveals the Justice Department is investigating Donald Trump in with connection with statutes related to the Espionage Act and obstruction.\n\nAbout half the documents removed from Trump’s Florida estate were marked with the highest security classifications, and the warrant shows the former president is being investigated for possibly breaking three federal laws: removal or destruction of records, obstructing an investigation, and violating the Espionage Act.\n\nThe investigation stems from how Trump handled national security information and reached a fever pitch Monday when the FBI searched Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFBI agents found 11 sets of classified records, including some marked top secret.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nRead the search warrant on Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate\n\nDOJ says Trump does not object to making search warrant public\n\nThe Department of Justice wrote in a new court filing that, after conferring with former president Donald Trump's attorneys, he does not object to making the search warrant public.\n\nThe judge said Thursday that the government needed to serve Trump with its motion to unseal the search warrant and report back by 3 p.m. EDT.

Some 20 boxes of items were taken by the FBI.\n\nThe list, which is contained in a seven-page document that also includes the property search warrant, includes references to one set of documents deemed “Various classified/TS/SCI documents,” which is an abbreviation for “top secret/sensitive compartmented information,” according to the Journal. Agents also collected four sets of top secret documents, three sets of secret documents and three sets of confidential documents, according to the list obtained by the Journal.\n\nThe FBI did not seek access to search private guest rooms, but did ask for access to “the 45 Office” and “all storage rooms and all other rooms or areas within the premises used or available to be used by [the former president] and his staff and in which boxes or documents could be stored, including all structures or buildings on the estate,” the Journal reported.\n\n- Ella Lee\n\nTrump records investigation:From early red flags to the search at Mar-a-Lago\n\nFBI urges public to report suspicious activity following attempted Cincinnati breach\n\nAfter an armed man attempted to breach the FBI’s Cincinnati field office and a wave of anger directed against federal law enforcement following the search of Donald Trump’s Florida estate, the FBI urged the public Friday to report suspicious activity to authorities.\n\n“The FBI is always concerned about violence and threats of violence to law enforcement, including the men and women of the FBI,” the bureau said in a statement. “We work closely with our law enforcement partners to assess and respond to such threats, which are reprehensible and dangerous.\n\n“As always, we would like to remind members of the public that if they observe anything suspicious to report it to law enforcement immediately.\"\n\nThe suspect in the Ohio incident, who was later fatally shot in a standoff with police, may have been posting messages to the former president’s Truth Social site during the incident.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray defended the bureau Thursday against the increasing stream of threats, saying that “unfounded attacks on the integrity of the FBI erode respect for the rule of law and are a grave disservice to the men and women who sacrifice so much to protect others.”\n\n- Kevin Johnson\n\nTrump allies attack warrant - and Garland - before documents released\n\nThe paperwork isn't out yet, but Donald Trump supporters are already attacking the Mar-a-Lago search warrant as insufficient.\n\nTheir basic argument is \"nothing to see here\" – no matter what the documents say.\n\nTeam Trump also seems to be betting that the release will not include an affidavit that includes specific information about what the ex-president is accused of doing. They are also planning renewed attacks on Attorney General Merrick Garland.\n\n\"The expectations for the warrant should be tampered down,\" tweeted Rudy Giuliani, a former lawyer for Trump. \"To weigh the justification, if any, Garland must release the affidavit. Right now we are getting the 'run around.'\"\n\nTrump allies are likely seeking to take advantage of a familiar Catch-22: The government suspects someone of dealing in sensitive classified information, but don't want to detail it publicly because it could undercut national security.\n\nOther attorneys point out that, if the warrant is that meaningless, Trump could have released it days ago.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., another ally of Trump, tweeted: \"Attorney General Garland must release the information as to why a warrant was necessary, not what was taken ...

Earlier this year, officials from the National Archives and Records Administration, known as NARA, recovered 15 boxes of presidential documents from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nTrump’s lawyers previously worked with NARA to voluntarily turn over some documents, but the Mar-a-Lago search clearly indicates a new phase of the probe. Trump has denied all wrongdoing and claims the investigation is a politically motivated sham, intended to derail his potential bid to return to the White House.\n\nHere’s a timeline of the key moments from the blockbuster investigation.\n\nMay 2021\n\nAn official from NARA contacts Trump’s team after realizing that several important documents weren’t handed over before Trump left the White House. In hopes of locating the missing items, NARA lawyer Gary Stern reaches out to someone who served in the White House counsel’s office under Trump, who was the point of contact for recordkeeping matters. The missing documents include some of Trump’s correspondence with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, as well as the map of Hurricane Dorian that Trump infamously altered with a sharpie pen.\n\nFall 2021\n\nNARA grows frustrated with the slow pace of document turnover after several months of conversations with the Trump team. Stern reaches out to another Trump attorney to intervene. The archivist asks about several boxes of records that were apparently taken to Mar-a-Lago during Trump’s relocation to Florida. NARA still doesn’t receive the White House documents they are searching for.\n\nJanuary 2022\n\nAfter months of discussions with Trump’s team, NARA retrieves 15 boxes of Trump White House records from Mar-a-Lago. The boxes contained some materials that were part of “special access programs,” known as SAP, which is a classification that includes protocols to significantly limit who would have access to the information. NARA says in a statement that some of the records it received at the end of Trump’s administration were “torn up by former President Trump,” and that White House officials had to tape them back together. Not all the torn-up documents were reconstructed, NARA says.\n\nFebruary 9, 2022\n\nNews outlets, including CNN, report that NARA asked the Justice Department to investigate Trump’s handling of White House records and whether he violated the Presidential Records Act and other laws related to classified information. The Presidential Records Act requires all records created by a sitting president to be turned over to the National Archives at the end of their administration.\n\nFebruary 18, 2022\n\nNARA informs the Justice Department that some of the documents retrieved from Mar-a-Lago included classified material. NARA also tells the department that, despite being warned it was illegal, Trump tore up documents while he was president, and that senior officials in the Trump administration did not properly preserve their social media messages, draft tweets and deleted tweets.\n\nApril and May 2022\n\nOn April 7, NARA publicly acknowledges for the first time that the Justice Department is involved, and news outlets report that prosecutors have launched a criminal probe into Trump’s mishandling of classified documents. Around this time, FBI agents quietly interview Trump aides at Mar-a-Lago about the handling of presidential records as part of their widening investigation.\n\nApril 11, 2022\n\nThe FBI asks NARA for access to the 15 boxes it retrieved from Mar-a-Lago in January. The request was formally transmitted to NARA by President Joe Biden’s White House Counsel’s office, because the incumbent president controls presidential documents in NARA custody.\n\nApril 29, 2022\n\nThe Justice Department sends a letter to Trump’s lawyers as part of its effort to access the 15 boxes, notifying them that more than 100 classified documents, totaling more than 700 pages, were found in the boxes. The letter says the FBI and US intelligence agencies need “immediate access” to these materials because of “important national security interests.” Also on this day, Trump lawyers ask NARA to delay its plans to give the FBI access to these materials. Trump’s lawyers say they want time to examine the materials to see if anything is privileged, and that they are making a “protective assertion of executive privilege” over all the documents.\n\nMay 1, 2022\n\nTrump’s lawyers write again to NARA, and ask again that NARA postpone its plans to give the FBI access to the materials retrieved from Mar-a-Lago in January.\n\nMay 10, 2022\n\nDebra Steidel Wall, the acting Archivist of the United States, who runs NARA, informs Trump’s lawyers that she is rejecting their claims of “protective” executive privilege over all the materials taken from Mar-a-Lago, and will therefore turn over the materials to the FBI and US intelligence agencies. In a four-page letter, Wall says she reached this decision after consulting with top lawyers from the Justice Department and the White House Counsel’s office.\n\nMay 11, 2022\n\nThe Justice Department subpoenas Trump, seeking documents with classification markings that are still at Mar-a-Lago. Trump directs his staff to search for any remaining classified material, to comply with the subpoena, according to a lawsuit he later filed.\n\nMay 12, 2022\n\nNews outlets report that investigators subpoenaed NARA for access to the classified documents retrieved from Mar-a-Lago. The subpoena, which is part of the process to allow investigators to take possession of the documents from the NARA, is the first public indication of the Justice Department using a grand jury in its investigation.\n\nJune 2, 2022\n\nAccording to a lawsuit the former President later filed, Trump invites FBI officials to come to Mar-a-Lago to retrieve the subpoenaed materials.\n\nJune 3, 2022\n\nFour investigators, including a top Justice Department counterintelligence official, visit Mar-a-Lago seeking more information about classified material that had been taken to Florida. The four investigators meet with Trump’s attorneys and look around the basement room where the documents are being stored. Trump briefly stops by the meeting to say hello to the officials, but he does not answer any questions. During the meeting, the federal officials deal with the grand jury subpoena for some of the sensitive national security documents on the premises, and they take away the subpoenaed documents. At some point later in June, a Trump lawyer sends a letter to the Justice Department inaccurately asserting that there aren’t any more classified documents at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nJune 8, 2022\n\nTrump’s attorneys receive a letter from federal investigators, asking them to further secure the room where documents are being stored. In response, Trump aides add a padlock to the room in the basement of Mar-a-Lago.\n\nJune 24, 2022\n\nFederal investigators serve a subpoena to the Trump Organization, demanding surveillance video from Mar-a-Lago. Trump’s company complies with the subpoena and turns over the footage. CNN has reported that this was part of an effort to gather information about who had access to areas at the club where government documents were stored.\n\nAugust 8, 2022\n\nThe FBI executes a search warrant at Mar-a-Lago – a major escalation of the classified documents investigation. The search focused on the area of the club where Trump’s offices and personal quarters are located. Federal agents remove boxes of material from the property. The search was the first time in American history that a former president’s home was searched as part of a criminal investigation.\n\nAugust 11, 2022\n\nTrump sends a message through one his lawyers to Attorney General Merrick Garland, saying he has “been hearing from people all over the country about the raid” who are “angry,” and that “whatever I can do to take the heat down, to bring the pressure down, just let us know,” according to a lawsuit he later filed. Hours later, after three days of silence, Garland makes a brief public statement about the investigation. He reveals that he personally approved the decision to seek a search warrant, and that the Justice Department will continue to apply the law “without fear or favor.” Garland also pushes back against what he called “unfounded attacks on the professionalism of the FBI and Justice Department.” Garland also announces that the Justice Department will ask a judge to unseal some of the search warrant documents, for the sake of transparency.\n\nAugust 12, 2022\n\nFederal Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart approves the unsealing of the Mar-a-Lago search warrant and its property receipt, at the Justice Department’s request and after Trump’s lawyers agree to the release. The warrant reveals the Justice Department is looking into possible violations of the Espionage Act, obstruction of justice and criminal handling of government records, as part of its investigation.\n\nAugust 22, 2022\n\nTrump files a federal lawsuit seeking the appointment of a third-party attorney known as a “special master” to independently review the materials that the FBI seized from Mar-a-Lago. In the lawsuit, Trump’s lawyers argue that the Justice Department can’t be trusted to do its own review for potentially privileged materials that should be siloed off from the criminal probe.\n\nAugust 27, 2022\n\nFederal District Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee who is presiding over Trump’s civil lawsuit, announces her “preliminary intent” to appoint a special master to examine the seized Mar-a-Lago materials.\n\nSeptember 1, 2022\n\nFederal prosecutors clash with Trump’s lawyers at a high-stakes court hearing in Palm Beach, Florida, as part of Trump’s lawsuit seeking the special master appointment.\n\nSeptember 5, 2022\n\nIn a major ruling, Cannon grants Trump’s request for a special master to review the seized materials from Mar-a-Lago. She says the special master will have the power to look for documents covered under attorney-client privilege and executive privilege. The outcome is a major victory for Trump.\n\nSeptember 8, 2022\n\nThe Justice Department appeals Cannon’s decision in the special master case. Prosecutors also ask Cannon to temporarily block two key parts of her ruling while their appeal plays out: First, the part where she blocked the Justice Department from using any of the seized materials in their criminal probe while the materials were being reviewed by the special master, and second, the part of her ruling that required the Justice Department to hand over classified documents to the special master.\n\nSeptember 15, 2022\n\nCannon appoints senior Judge Raymond Dearie to serve as the special master and sets a November 30 deadline for the Brooklyn-based federal judge to finish his review of the seized materials. Cannon also rejects the Justice Department’s request to temporarily pause two key portions of her earlier ruling, which prosecutors claimed were hampering their ongoing criminal probe.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Marshall Cohen Hannah Rabinowitz", "Marshall Cohen", "Hannah Rabinowitz"], "publish_date": "2022/08/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/12/politics/fbi-threats-maralago-trump-search/index.html", "title": "FBI investigating 'unprecedented' number of threats against bureau ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe FBI is investigating an “unprecedented” number of threats against bureau personnel and property in the wake of the search of former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, including some against agents listed in court records as being involved in the recent search, a law enforcement source tells CNN.\n\nThe bureau, along with the Department of Homeland Security, also has issued a joint intelligence bulletin warning of “violent threats” against federal law enforcement, courts and government personnel and facilities.\n\nOn Friday, the names of the two agents who signed the search warrant paperwork circulated online. The names had been included in a version of the search warrant that was leaked prior to the official unsealing of the documents. The version released by the court redacted the agents’ names.\n\nOfficials at the FBI headquarters division responsible for the security of personnel also have observed efforts by online actors to publicly post – also known as “doxxing” – the personal information of other bureau employees, including those involved in the search of Trump’s residence, a law enforcement source tells CNN.\n\nUnlike other officers in the US intelligence community who operate undercover, the overwhelming majority of FBI employees operate in true name, the source noted, which makes those named in court filings pertaining to the search particularly vulnerable to nefarious online actors.\n\nThe heightened level of threats follows a high-profile week for the bureau in which agents executed a search warrant at Trump’s Palm Beach property as part of an evidence-gathering step in a national security investigation about presidential records, including classified documents, taken to Florida. The warrant, which was unsealed and released by a federal judge on Friday, revealed the Justice Department is looking into possible violations of the Espionage Act, obstruction of justice and criminal handling of government records, as part of its investigation.\n\nIn the days following the search, violent threats surfaced online, with posters writing, “Garland needs to be assassinated” – referencing Attorney General Merrick Garland, who “personally approved” the decision to seek a warrant – and “kill all feds.” Additionally, the biography and contact information of the federal magistrate judge who signed the search warrant was wiped from a Florida court’s website after he too became the target of violent threats.\n\nIn a separate incident Thursday, a man who was believed to be armed with an AR-15 rifle and a nail gun tried to breach the FBI’s Cincinnati field office. He was killed hours later after a standoff with authorities. Although the suspect’s motive has not yet been identified, he had been known to the FBI because he had an unspecified connection to the January 6, 2021, riot at the US Capitol, and because he had associates within a far-right extremist group, two law enforcement sources told CNN Friday.\n\nFBI Director Chris Wray addressed bureau employees’ safety in a memo distributed this week.\n\n“Let me also assure you that your safety and security are my primary concern right now. Security Division is working across the agency as we continue to stay vigilant and adjust our security posture accordingly,” Wray said in the statement reviewed by CNN.\n\nThe FBI Security Division in Washington has notified the bureau’s more than 38,000 employees nationwide to remain vigilant when operating in and around bureau facilities, two federal law enforcement sources told CNN.\n\nThe FBI declined to comment on any specific threats against bureau employees but told CNN in a statement that the bureau “is always concerned about violence and threats of violence to law enforcement, including the men and women of the FBI.”\n\n“We work closely with our law enforcement partners to assess and respond to such threats, which are reprehensible and dangerous,” the statement said. “As always, we would like to remind members of the public that if they observe anything suspicious to report it to law enforcement immediately.”\n\nBulletin warns of threats against authorities and government personnel\n\nOn Friday, the FBI and DHS issued a joint intelligence bulletin pointing to the increased threat landscape.\n\n“These threats are occurring primarily online and across multiple platforms, including social media sites, web forums, video sharing platforms, and image boards. The FBI and DHS would like to ensure that law enforcement, court, and government personnel are aware of the range of threats and criminal and violent incidents,” the bulletin reads.\n\nFriday’s joint intelligence bulletin notes an increase in violent threats online against federal officials and facilities, “including a threat to place a so-called dirty bomb in front of FBI Headquarters and issuing general calls for ‘civil war’ and ‘armed rebellion.’” It also states that the FBI and DHS have identified threats against specific individuals, including the federal judge who approved the Mar-a-Lago search warrant.\n\nDHS has been warning for more than a year that people will use political ideologies to justify acts of violence, and underscored in the latest warning the threat posed by domestic violent extremists being motivated by perceptions of government overreach and election fraud.\n\nIn June, for example, the DHS intelligence branch also warned law enforcement, first responders and private sector partners nationwide of potential domestic violence extremist activity in response to the Supreme Court’s decision on abortion.\n\nAfter the January 6 attack, alternative social media platforms became more popular among Trump supporters after companies like Facebook and Twitter banned Trump and some other prominent figures who spread election conspiracy theories.\n\nThose platforms, like Trump’s own Truth Social site, tout themselves as bastions of free speech, with looser rules and moderation, but that leeway can result in the proliferation of violent rhetoric.\n\nTalk of violence isn’t exclusive to the more fringe platforms, however. There was a surge in tweets Monday mentioning “civil war” – at some points more than one tweet a second, according to a CNN review of data from Dataminr, a service that tracks Twitter activity.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.", "authors": ["Josh Campbell Jessica Schneider Donie O'Sullivan Paul P.

No one is above the law,” said Lisa Curtis, who served as deputy assistant to the president and senior director for South and Central Asia on the National Security Council from 2017 to 2021.\n\nCurtis told USA TODAY that is “very disappointed with most Republican leaders who won't stand up for democracy in the United States and admit that January 6th has been enormously harmful to our country and its ability to influence global developments.”\n\n“The United States is no longer seen as an example of democracy for other countries to emulate,” said Curtis, who has more than 20 years of service in the U.S. government, including at the NSC, CIA, State Department, and Capitol Hill. “It's painful for me as I have spent the last 30 years of my career trying to promote our democratic ideals and practices overseas in places that desperately need democratic champions.”\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\nConstitutional and criminal law scholar calls on Trump to release the details of the search warrant\n\nConstitutional and criminal law scholar Neal Katyal, the former acting U.S. solicitor general, challenged Trump on Tuesday to disclose the contents of the court-approved search warrant so that the public can decide if the Justice Department has engaged in an abuse of power.\n\nKatyal, the Paul Saunders Professor at Georgetown University, said Trump could easily share the details of the warrant, since he was given a copy of it by the federal agents who executed the search, per U.S. policy.\n\n“Search of Trump abusive? Law enforcement leaves a copy of the search warrant, which itemizes what they are looking for and what laws were violated,” Katyal said in a tweet. “If Trump/RNC think this search signed off on by a fed judge is abusive & they have nothing to hide, release the warrant to the public.”\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\nMIKE PENCE REACTS TO MAR-A-LAGO SEARCH:'Deep concern' over Mar-a-Lago search, asks for 'full accounting' from Garland\n\nMonmouth poll: 41% of Americans favor charging Trump in Jan. 6\n\nMore than four-in-10 Americans believe former President Donald Trump should be charged with crimes related to his involvement in the Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021, according to a new poll published Tuesday.\n\nAccording to the Monmouth University poll, 41% of Americans say they favor charging Trump. Of that number, 73% identify as Democrats, 43% are Independent and just 3% were Republican.\n\nHowever, 34% said they oppose charging Trump, with 66% being Republican, 37% independent and 3% Democrat. A quarter of respondents said they are not sure whether Trump should be charged.\n\nA House committee has been investigating the Jan. 6 attack and held a series of eight televised hearings in June and July.\n\nMonmouth poll: 40% would support Trump in 2024\n\nAlso from the Monmouth poll, a combined 40% of Americans said they definitely or probably would vote for Trump if he ran for president again in 2024. But nearly half, 48%, of Americans said they definitely would not vote for Trump and 8% said they probably wouldn’t support the former president.\n\nThe poll was published a day after the FBI searched Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate. It was conducted by the Monmouth University Polling Institute from July 28 to Aug. 1, with 808 adults age 18 and older surveyed.

Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, on Tuesday urged the Justice Department to explain the nature of its search of former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home so that it would not become political fodder for Republicans.\n\n“It must be more than a search for inconsequential archives or it will be viewed as a political tactic and undermine any future credible investigation & legitimacy of January 6 investigations,” Cuomo said in a tweet.\n\nIn a second tweet, he added that the “bona fide nature” of the search could be used to discredit the House Jan. 6 committee’s investigation of the Capitol attack, which he said would be a “terrible disservice” to their work.\n\nCuomo resigned as governor after a New York Attorney General's Office report found he sexually harassed 11 women.\n\n– Ella Lee\n\nEx-AG Gonzales: Mar-a-Lago search recalls 2006 search of congressman’s office\n\nFormer Attorney General Alberto Gonzales said the Mar-a-Lago search recalled his 2006 decision to greenlight the FBI’s search of then-Rep. William Jefferson, D-La., Capitol Hill office, in the midst of a federal bribery investigation, the first time federal authorities searched a lawmaker’s congressional office.\n\n“Because of the historic nature of it, I wanted to be sure,” Gonzales said, describing how top officials, including then-FBI Director Robert Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty gathered to consider the action and its potential implications.\n\nThe reaction, as expected, unleashed a political firestorm.\n\nFacing the prospect that the White House might order the return of documents seized in the unprecedented search, Gonzales said that he and Mueller were prepared to resign. No such order was issues, but a federal appeals court ultimately ruled that the search to be unconstitutional.\n\n“There is a lot at stake here,” Gonzales said.\n\n- Kevin Johnson\n\nWATERGATE 'IN REVERSE'?:Historians and legal analysts pan Trump's claims and point to legal peril ahead\n\nMaloney among Dems defending FBI search of Trump's home\n\nAs Donald Trump and Republicans blast the FBI for its search of his Mar-a-Lago home, Democrats defended the search as an appropriate law enforcement action.\n\n“Presidents have a solemn duty to protect America’s national security, and allegations that former President Trump put our security at risk by mishandling classified information warrant the utmost scrutiny,\" said Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., chairwoman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform.\n\nMaloney, whose committee is also investigating Trump's handling of classified information, said \"it is clear that the Department of Justice must fully investigate President Trump’s potentially grave mishandling of classified information.\"\n\n- David Jackson\n\nFormer AG Gonzales: Search likely had approval from ‘the highest level’\n\nAlberto Gonzales, a former attorney general in the George W.

The search warrant pertained to both the handling of classified documents and the Presidential Records Act.\n\nThere was also suspicion, after months of discussion on the matter, that Trump representatives were not being completely truthful with investigators, the source said.\n\nThe Washington Post first reported on some of the details of the search.\n\nAs part of the FBI investigation, Justice Department investigators previously subpoenaed the Trump Organization for a copy of Mar-a-Lago’s surveillance tapes, a source familiar with the situation told CNN. The organization complied with the subpoena, which was first reported by The New York Times, and handed over the Mar-a-Lago surveillance tapes to investigators, the source said.\n\nBefore FBI agents arrived Monday at Trump’s private club and searched his residence, people around the former President had been under the impression that the probe into how he handled classified information had stalled, according to two sources familiar with the thinking.\n\nFor months, investigators had been looking into how Trump handled material taken with him when he left the White House after the National Archives referred the case to the Justice Department earlier this year. It remains unclear why those around the former President believed the investigation had stalled, but in June, his attorneys received a letter from investigators asking them to preserve the remaining documents in his possession “until further notice,” one source told CNN.\n\nThe concern arose after the former President had returned some 15 boxes of materials to the National Archives.\n\nA source familiar with Trump team deliberations said it will push an argument that Trump didn’t have any classified information at Mar-a-Lago because he declassified it when he was President.\n\nLegal analysts say the declassification procedure is a bit of a gray area when it comes to the president and producing proof. One former White House lawyer said the White House counsel would typically want to create a memo detailing the declassification for the president to sign, but that is not a requirement.\n\n“The president has wide latitude to declassify, and there’s no strict, formal procedure that must be followed,” CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig said. “So if Trump claims he declassified documents while in office, that could come down to a factual dispute and would turn on the strength of the evidence either way.”\n\nAfter leaving office, a former president no longer has the authority to declassify information.\n\nThis, of course, does not address the Presidential Records Act and the requirement that White House documents be preserved with the National Archives.\n\nOn Monday, federal agents removed boxes of material from the Palm Beach property.\n\nThe Mar-a-Lago search, which focused on the area of the club where Trump’s offices and personal quarters are located, marked a major escalation of the classified documents investigation. It was the first time in American history that a former president’s home was searched as part of a criminal investigation.\n\nThe Secret Service had about an hour heads up before the FBI executed the warrant, a source familiar with the situation told CNN. The Secret Service validated the search warrant, met up with FBI agents as they arrived, and ensured they had uninhibited access, but the Secret Service agents themselves did not help in the search, the source said.\n\nThe senior-most Secret Service person at the property served as the point of contact.\n\nTrump has denied all wrongdoing and claims the investigation is a politically motivated sham, intended to derail his potential bid to return to the White House.\n\nTop congressional Republicans have rushed to the former President’s defense, with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy warning of an oversight probe “when” Republicans take back the chamber in the midterm elections.\n\n“The Department of Justice has reached an intolerable state of weaponized politicization,” McCarthy said, warning Attorney General Merrick Garland to “preserve your documents and clear your calendar.”\n\nHouse Republicans briefly discussed the FBI search during a conference call on Tuesday, multiple sources told CNN, and top Republicans made clear that they want to get answers and a full accounting from the Justice Department.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details Tuesday.", "authors": ["Pamela Brown Kaitlan Collins Katelyn Polantz", "Pamela Brown", "Kaitlan Collins", "Katelyn Polantz"], "publish_date": "2022/08/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/09/politics/trump-mar-a-lago-search-explainer/index.html", "title": "Here's what's next for Trump after the FBI searched Mar-a-Lago ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe FBI search of former President Donald Trump’s residence in Florida on Monday signaled an extraordinary escalation of an investigation into the handling of certain documents from his presidency and raises questions about whether his legal exposure extends beyond whether he improperly took government records when he left the White House.\n\nWhat exactly the FBI was searching for and why is still unknown. But to obtain a search warrant, investigators would have had to show a judge that there was probable cause of a crime and that evidence of that crime was located at Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s Palm Beach resort.\n\nHere’s what to know about the legal significance of the search, which comes as Trump is preparing a potential 2024 presidential run, and what could come next:\n\nWhat would it have taken for the DOJ to have obtained the search warrant?\n\nTo get judicial approval for the search, investigators would have had to present to a judge a detailed affidavit that would establish that probable cause exists to believe that a crime had been committed and that that evidence of that crime exists in recent days at the property where the search is being sought.\n\nThe search warrant would have been filed under seal, meaning that its details are not publicly available at the moment (though they could become public in the future). The federal courthouse in West Palm Beach lists only one sealed search warrant application since June that was still not closed as of Friday, according to the court’s public register of cases.\n\nBut before prosecutors got to the point of asking a magistrate judge to approve the warrant, in order to move forward with a search that carried such historical and political significance, investigators would have had to obtain the OK from the highest levels of the Justice Department, legal experts told CNN.\n\nFormer DOJ officials told CNN that it was likely that, at the very least, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco would have had to have given the green light and that Attorney General Merrick Garland and/or FBI Director Chris Wray may have also been consulted.\n\n“Not only would the investigators have to suggest it, not only would a line prosecutor have to agree with it, but multiple layers of management would have had to approved of it – all the way up to the Attorney General,” Daren Firestone, a former DOJ attorney, told CNN.\n\nThe Justice Department has declined to comment.\n\nWhat does this mean for Trump’s legal exposure?\n\nTo take the extraordinary step of executing a search warrant on a former president’s home suggests investigators are looking at more than what the National Archives had previously recovered from Mar-a-Lago, according to legal experts.\n\nIn January, the National Archives retrieved 15 boxes of records from Mar-a-Lago, including materials that had been identified as classified, but activity around those boxes have been quiet since the spring.\n\n“I really don’t believe that the department would have taken such a significant step as pursuing a search warrant for the president’s residence about information they already had back,” Andrew McCabe, a former FBI deputy director and CNN contributor, said on CNN “Newsroom.” “There had to be a suspicion, a concern and indeed specific information that led them to believe that there were additional materials that were not turned over.”\n\nBefore the news of Monday’s search, a law known as the Presidential Records Act had been forefront of public speculation about Trump’s legal jeopardy as other investigatory steps were taken related to the handling of documents from Trump’s White House. That law – passed after Watergate to make clear that certain records from a presidency belong to the public and not the former office holder – is not a criminal statute and has been seen as relatively toothless law.\n\nA search warrant and the presence of the FBI signifies a criminal investigation. There are other record retention statutes that bring with them criminal penalties – such as the Espionage Act – but at this point it’s not clear what criminal statutes have been implicated in the Justice Department investigation.\n\nIt is a crime to destroy or remove federal records, or to mishandle classified documents. There are other federal laws that aim prevent the tampering of information during an investigation.\n\nEarlier this year, the Justice Department issued subpoenas for presidential materials including classified documents that the National Archives had previously retrieved. The FBI also interviewed Trump aides at Mar-a-Lago in the spring as part of the probe, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nFor investigators to escalate their probe with a search, “there would have to be something serious enough that would merit more than a slap on the wrist,” Firestone, now a partner at the DC-based firm Levy Firestone Muse, said.\n\nIt’s also notable that the DOJ hasn’t gone the route of civil litigation against the former president for how he handled the documents in question. Just last week, the Justice Department filed a civil lawsuit against former Trump White House official Peter Navarro, alleging that Navarro had violated the Presidential Records Act and seeking a court order compelling him to turn over emails from a private account that he used while working at the Trump White House.\n\nWhy now?\n\nThe search was executed two months after the previously unreported June 3 meeting between DOJ investigators and Trump’s attorneys at the resort. During the visit, reported by CNN on Monday, four investigators, including the chief of the Counterintelligence and Export Control Section, toured a basement where boxes of materials were being stored.\n\nFive days later, investigators sent Trump’s attorneys a letter asking them to further secure the room storing the documents, prompting aides to add a padlock to the room.\n\nFor the FBI to execute a search warrant two months later hints that the federal officials were not satisfied with what they saw on the visit or that they were not confident in the voluntary cooperation they were receiving from Trump’s team, some legal experts said. It’s possible federal officials also needed official sign off to repossess classified records.\n\n“The fact that the FBI learned Trump still had documents at [Mar a Lago] in June, and felt the need to come back two months later with a search warrant, indicates to me that the agency has evidence that Trump and his staff were holding onto additional classified records and not taking any steps to properly return them to the Archives,” Bradley Moss, a national security lawyer, told CNN in an email.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'Genius': Bash on Trump's political positioning after FBI search 03:04 - Source: CNN\n\nIt also may have taken months for the Justice Department to decide to do search and how it should go about it.\n\nWhen the FBI was leaving Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s team would have received a document akin to a receipt of what was taken. But DOJ can be as vague as it wants in that documentation.\n\nMore broadly, the Justice Department can keep large swaths of its investigation secret, as the Justice Department made clear in court filings Monday evening around its search of John Eastman, the former Trump lawyer who spearheaded plots to subvert the 2020 election.\n\nIn that filing – where the Justice Department was arguing against an Eastman request that January 6 investigators return devices seized from him in late June in New Mexico – prosecutors said there was no obligation for the Department to share with Eastman more details about the status of its probe.\n\n“The Government has no doubt that the movant would like to have full knowledge of the Government’s investigation and the ability to ‘engage [federal agents] in a debate over the basis of the warrant,” the filing said. “But the law only, and properly, requires a neutral magistrate judge to find probable cause to search for and seize any electronic devices on his person; it does not require that the person searched know the basis for the warrant.”\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nIt still not known how off guard Trump’s lawyers were with the FBI actions taken Monday and what Trump’s team has been arguing to the DOJ about the handling of the documents in previous interactions with investigators.\n\nTrump could take a pre-emptive legal step to challenge in court the way the FBI handled the search, perhaps with the goal of getting thrown out any evidence investigators had obtained or at least to try to get more information about what investigators in probing.\n\nBut without such court activity, the next steps of the investigation could very well continue in secret.\n\nCan Trump be barred from running for president if he is found to have violated records law?\n\nAnother law that may be implicated by the FBI’s search is one barring the willful concealment, removal or mutilation of government records. That law threatens as a punishment disqualification “from holding any office under the United States.”\n\nHowever, there are questions about the constitutionality of that law and its applicability to a Trump presidential run, if he were to be convicted under it.\n\nBecause the Constitution sets specific qualifications for presidential office – and lays out a separate impeachment process for disqualifying presidents from holding office in the future – some argue that Congress would not have the authority to enact such a statute that would apply to a presidential candidate.", "authors": ["Tierney Sneed"], "publish_date": "2022/08/09"}]}

Smith said twice during the incident, according to Elam, “Keep my wife’s name out of your f***ing mouth!”\n\nRock responded: “Oh, wow.”\n\nFor viewers at home, censors muted the verbal part of the exchange between Rock and Smith.\n\nThe theater went silent and Rock said, “That was the greatest night in the history of television.”\n\nRock declined to press charges, according to the LAPD.\n\nCNN has reached out to Smith’s publicist for comment.\n\nSean “Diddy” Combs took to the stage moments later and told Smith and Rock that they would settle things “like family” later.\n\nRoughly 40 minutes after the incident, Smith returned to the stage to accept the Oscar for best actor and apologized to the Academy and his fellow nominees for the incident, but did not mention Rock by name.\n\nHe tearfully accepted the award for his role as Richard Williams, the father of Venus and Serena Williams, in the film “King Richard.” Smith said Williams “was a fierce defender of his family.”\n\nSmith said, “I know to do what we do, you gotta be able to take abuse and have people talk people about you.

Those other instances were gaffes. This one felt like a disaster.\n\nWatching it was like being at a family reunion when an argument erupts and turns an occasion meant to be happy into a simmering mess of resentment and regret — and yet everyone has to keep smiling and pretend that nothing bad has happened because the cake hasn’t been served yet.\n\nIt all started when presenter Chris Rock made a crack aimed at Jada Pinkett Smith's shaved head. Rock said he couldn’t wait for “G.I. Jane 2,” a reference to the 1997 military drama that featured Demi Moore wearing a similar haircut.\n\nThose who follow celebrity news — and presumably that includes Rock — know that Pinkett Smith revealed four years ago that she has alopecia and recently appeared in an Instagram video talking about her hair loss in order to help other women cope with the condition.\n\nTaking offense at the joke, best actor nominee Will Smith walked onstage and right up to Rock and slapped him. Smith also yelled a bleeped-out warning for Rock to keep his wife’s name out of his mouth. Although Rock looked rattled afterward, he kept his composure and proceeded to present the documentary category.\n\nWill Smith and Chris Rock:Rock doesn't file police report after slap at the Oscars, LAPD says\n\nThe moment changed the dynamic of the entire evening, which was meant to be a celebration of life getting back to normal. (Remember last year’s scaled-back, widely panned Oscars held in a train station because of the pandemic?). In an instant, the award show turned into tense collective trauma that left many viewers scrambling for answers from social media.\n\nIf you were on Twitter last night, you know it transformed into a group therapy session for the dazed and confused.\n\nOscar winners 2022: Who won at the Academy Awards? See the full list\n\nSo much that takes place on award shows is contrived and comedic that viewers at first thought it was a prank. Maybe Rock and Smith had rehearsed how Rock would say something snide about Pinkett Smith and then Smith would pretend to strike him, after which they’d both laugh and hug it out.\n\nSoon enough, it was apparent that this was no staged gag. Tweets confirmed that the crowd inside the Dolby Theatre laughed uneasily at first, but then grew silent. Clips of uncensored feeds from Australia and other countries popped up in posts, giving a better angle of the confrontation and revealing Smith's words that got bleeped out.\n\nUSA Today books editor Barbara VanDenburgh wasn’t alone when she tweeted, “I’ve been watching the Will Smith slap on a loop like it’s the Zapruder film.”\n\nFor once, the reaction on Twitter wasn't cynical, but sincerely shocked. “I have never been more uncomfortable in my life,” wrote @goldengateblond. The stunned emotions were shared by the stars. “Everybody in these audience shots is visibly shell-shocked,” tweeted New Republic writer Matt Ford.\n\nTwitter felt like a real community for a minute or two, not a place where people try to score points with their comments and appear hipper than the room. There was no rush to escalate the situation. “Look … quarantine was hard on everybody,” posted Janelle James, who plays principal Ava Coleman on ABC’s “ Abbott Elementary.\" Her joke doubled as an essential truth.\n\nThe always spot-on comedian Roy Wood Jr. of “The Daily Show” suggested via tweet that Trevor Noah should host the upcoming Grammys behind check-cashing glass, adding, “It’s real out here fam.” This was humor spurred by anxiety, not gleeful schadenfreude over someone else landing in trouble.\n\nJust when things couldn’t get any more nail-bitingly nerve-wracking, they did. OMG, those on Twitter realized, Smith probably is going to have to give a speech. Will he talk about ... it? As expected, Smith was announced as the best actor winner for his powerful performance in “King Richard” as the father of Venus and Serena Williams. Once he took the stage, the meaning of the moment — as the superstar’s first Oscar win, and as another epic victory for the Williams family — was overwhelmed by the focus on whether he'd mention the slap.\n\nHe did, indirectly, saying he wanted to apologize to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which holds the awards, and to all of his fellow nominees. Smith didn't apologize to Rock. “I look like the crazy father, just like they said about Richard Williams! But love will make you do crazy things,\" he said.\n\nHis acceptance speech seemed spontaneous, honest and rambling as he tried to equate Richard Williams' fierce defense of his family with his actions toward Rock.\n\nAnd, having just claimed acting’s top prize, he said, “I hope the Academy invites me back.”\n\nOn the red carpet: A bald Jada Pinkett Smith turns heads with elaborate, emerald gown at 2022 Oscars. See the look\n\nOf course, a family fight rarely happens in a vacuum. Scuffles between relatives are usually rooted in past bad blood, and bad blood definitely exists between Rock and Smith, as several astute Twitter posts pointed out right away. Back in 2016, when Pinkett Smith announced she wouldn't be going to the Oscars to protest the lack of diversity, Rock, that year's host, slammed her with a cutting one-liner: “Jada boycotting the Oscars is like me boycotting Rihanna’s panties. I wasn’t invited.”\n\nSo what follows a heated family dispute? The ritual taking of sides. Twitter was dotted with posts slamming Rock for making a cheap joke, especially given that Pinkett Smith’s video reached millions of viewers with its message of confidence and courage about hair loss. There was sympathy, too, for Smith standing up for his wife, even if his timing and choice of response were flawed.\n\nOn the other hand, some tweets called for Smith to be banned from future Oscars for what some described as a display of toxic masculinity. In a now-deleted tweet, director Judd Apatow wrote: “He could have killed him.” Comedian Kathy Griffin, no stranger to controversy, wrote: \"Let me tell you something, it’s a very bad practice to walk up on stage and physically assault a comedian. Now we all have to worry about who wants to be the next Will Smith in comedy clubs and theaters.”\n\nOne of the most unexpected tweets came from historian Joanne Freeman, author of “The Field of Blood,” a scholarly chronicle of violence in the U.S. Congress in the pre-Civil War era. Freeman posted that an “open-handed slap isn't inviting a fight” and called it “not a threat (like a punch), but rather, an exclamation.”\n\nAdded Freeman, “And now I’m applying my skills as a historian to the friggin’ #Oscars. So 2022.”\n\nThis was the year when nobody seemed to care that much about the Oscars. With ratings going steadily downhill and movie theaters still recovering from their days in lockdown, there was a growing sense that only hard-core fans were interested in whether “Coda” could pull off an upset (it did) or whether the three women hosting would come together as a team (they did).\n\nInstead, 2022 will become the year that the Oscars took over the news cycle for days, maybe weeks. Little will be mentioned, or perhaps remembered, about Sunday night besides the Smith-Rock dustup.\n\nThe other winners certainly don’t deserve this. Neither do the inspiring subjects of “King Richard,” Venus and Serena Williams. And neither, to be honest, do all of the people who tuned in for a few hours of distraction and relief from the actual pressing problems of the day, including the Ukraine war.\n\nInstead of being entertained or enlightened, those of us who tuned in Sunday night left the Oscars feeling as if another dependable part of life had fractured. Fault lines and possible breaking points are everywhere around us these days, in politics, in public health, in the very weather conditions that make Earth habitable.\n\nEverything is awful, it is easy to argue. But not at the movies. Films remain a refuge, a place where artists can make sense of life, especially when they’re working at the level of Sunday night’s nominees and winners.\n\nAs best supporting actress winner Ariana DeBose of \"West Side Story\" said in her moving acceptance speech, “Even in this weary world that we live in, dreams do come true, and that's really a heartening thing right now.” We needed Sunday night's family celebration not to dissolve into anger after the two years we’ve just experienced. Instead, we left it feeling a little more stressed and dismayed. Maybe that’s the real slap in the face.\n\nContact Detroit Free Press pop culture writer Julie Hinds at jhinds@freepress.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/03/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/people/2022/08/29/chris-rock-invited-host-oscars-will-smith-slap/7927694001/", "title": "Chris Rock says he was invited to host the Oscars, scene of his slap", "text": "Chris Rock, the comedian who was famously slapped by actor Will Smith during the 2022 Academy Awards, said during his Sunday night show in Phoenix that he was asked to host next year’s award ceremony, an invitation he said he refused.\n\nRock also said during his show at Arizona Financial Theatre in downtown Phoenix that he had been offered the chance to do a Super Bowl commercial, but profanely said he refused that as well.\n\nRock compared returning to the Oscars like returning to the scene of a crime, referencing the murder trial of O.J.

What happened?\" the musician quipped, upon hearing a commotion in another room. \"Oh, I'm sorry. I heard mumbling, like another situation just happened. I was running for cover.\"\n\nThe incident caused quite a stir throughout the Dolby Theater – but, luckily, USA TODAY had eyes and ears on the red carpet, inside the audience, in the press room and, yes, even at the bars, where stars mixed and mingled.\n\nHere's what went down behind-the-scenes.\n\nWill Smith slapping Chris Rock draws laughs ... then dead silence\n\nSmith wasn't wearing a microphone when he jumped on stage to slap Rock in the face, after Rock, a former \"Saturday Night Live\" comedian, joked about Smith's wife Jada Pinkett-Smith's bald head. But the expletives he shouted at Rock after returning to his seat rang loud throughout the Dolby.\n\nThe crowd apparently thought it was a bit at first, laughing after the slap. But as Smith continued to shout at Rock, it became clear the exchange was no joke – and you could hear a pin drop in the audience.\n\nWill Smith apologizes to Oscars after hitting Chris Rock onstage: 'Love will make you do crazy things'\n\nThe second a commercial break hit, stars mobbed the Smiths. Tyler Perry and Denzel Washington were among the stars who spent time talking to the \"King Richard\" star, and Cynthia Erivo whispered in Pinkett-Smith's ear. Ariana DeBose also gave Pinkett-Smith a hug after the tense exchange, and Smith got hugs from Queen Latifah and Lupita Nyong'o. Best actress nominee Nicole Kidman and her husband Keith Urban also hugged the couple.\n\nSmith's publicist Meredith O'Sullivan also came over to confer with the actor privately for about 30 seconds.\n\nOscars 2022: 'CODA' wins best picture, Will Smith and Jessica Chastain take acting honors\n\nQuestlove dodges Will Smith question, 'King Richard' star skips press room\n\nThe slap was the talk of the press room, with a reporter immediately asking Questlove about the scuffle.\n\n\"I'm not talking about that,\" the musician-turned-director replied. \"We're very happy right now to accept this award.\"\n\nAfterward, an Academy employee asked reporters to keep the questions about the nominees. And the organization meant business, cutting off best actress winner Jessica Chastain before she could answer a reporter who asked what she thought of Smith's emotional best actor acceptance speech.\n\nAt the end of the night, an Academy employee informed reporters that Smith would not be coming backstage for questions.\n\nSuperstitious Jessica Chastain refused to touch Eddie Redmayne’s Oscar\n\nChastain literally jumped backstage and squealed happily about winning her first Oscar for “The Eyes of Tammy Faye.”\n\nChastain admitted she wouldn’t even hold her friend Eddie Redmayne’s Oscar (for “The Theory of Everything”) when she was visiting his home in London. That's because, Chastain said, she feared attracting some Oscar curse.\n\n“Everyone was like, ‘Oh look his Oscar’ and they all picked it up,” she said. “And I was like, ‘I can’t pick it up.’ I’m very superstitious. So this is the first time I have ever held an Oscar.\"\n\nChastain joins Octavia Spencer and Viola Davis as “The Help” stars who have won Oscars. She gave credit to the film's director Tate Taylor’s casting.\n\n“He fought for me to be on this film. I definitely wasn’t the obvious choice,” Chastain said. “It goes to show his respect and admiration for actresses. And you can see that in the careers of the women he put in the film.”\n\nKristen Stewart, Ariana DeBose trade style for comfort after red carpet\n\nStars, they're just like us. And while they may get dressed to the nines for the red carpet, they still love to kick back and get comfy when watching the show.\n\nKristen Stewart, a best actress nominee for \"Spencer,\" seized the best of both worlds by rocking stilettos for her red carpet photos – and immediately ditching them in favor of sheer socks and loafers for the show.\n\nDeBose took a similar approach. After winning the Oscar for best supporting actress for \"West Side Story,\" the Broadway-vet-turned-film-star discarded her flowing red train, allowing her to expertly zigzag between chairs in her pantsuit. She draped her cape elegantly over her seat beside her Oscar statue.\n\nStars schmooze and booze during commercial breaks\n\nYes, even celebrities lose their cool in the presence of other celebrities.\n\nDuring a commercial break, Stewart, still in her flats, ran across the audience to hug Chastain and her husband, Gian Luca Passi de Preposulo. DeBose also ran across the room, clutching her Oscar, to hug Jessie Buckley and snap a selfie with Daniel Kaluuya and her mother before collapsing back into her seat. Nyong'o also shared hugs with Benedict Cumberbatch and Diddy.\n\nMeanwhile, at the bar, Kourtney Kardashian held hands with her fiancé, Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker, and Queen Latifah exchanged air kisses with Tracee Ellis Ross before the start of the show.\n\nAs for the stars' drinks of choice? Best supporting actress nominee Kirsten Dunst opted for a margarita, while Jane Campion and Maya Rudolph sipped rosé.\n\nMila Kunis honors Ukrainians 'who find strength to keep fighting' during Oscars ceremony\n\nContributing: Andrea Mandell, Anika Reed and Bill Keveney", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/03/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/29/health/what-is-alopecia-areata-wellness/index.html", "title": "What to know about alopecia, the condition affecting Jada Pinkett ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nJada Pinkett Smith found herself at the center of conflict when her husband Will Smith slapped comedian Chris Rock at the Oscars ceremony March 27. Rock joked about Pinkett Smith’s shaved head – a look she has said is more than a style preference.\n\nPinkett Smith has shared publicly that she has alopecia areata, addressing her and other patients’ experiences during her June 1 episode of “Red Table Talk,” her Facebook Watch show. Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disease that causes hair loss on the scalp and elsewhere, according to the National Alopecia Areata Foundation. Hair follicles affected by the disease are mistakenly attacked by a person’s immune system, which stops hair growth.\n\nAlopecia areata begins with one or more small bald patches, typically on a person's scalp. Alex Papp/Adobe Stock\n\n“These affected follicles become very small, drastically slow down production and grow no hair visible above the surface for months or years,” according to NAAF.\n\nThe condition typically starts in childhood, with one or more small, round and smooth bald patches. But alopecia areata is different from male or female pattern hair loss, which is called androgenetic alopecia, the most common form of hair loss, said Dr. Brett King, an associate professor of dermatology at the Yale School of Medicine. Androgenetic alopecia happens when scalp follicles are hypersensitive to dihydrotestosterone, which is critical for most hair growth but detrimental to head hair growth.\n\nOver the past eight years since discovering a class of medicines called Jak inhibitors could treat this disease, King has “probably seen 700 or more (patients) with severe alopecia areata,” he said.\n\nSunday night’s events have sparked curiosity about the disease, which affects all genders and races – about 6.8 million people in the United States and 147 million people worldwide. Massachusetts Representative Ayanna Pressley and “Doctor Who” actor Matt Lucas have also publicly shared their experiences of dealing with alopecia areata.\n\nCNN spoke with King about alopecia areata and its causes, spectrum of severity, effects on daily life, and available treatments.\n\nThe following conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nCNN: What causes alopecia areata?\n\nDr. Brett King: There’s a genetic basis for the disease, meaning that people with alopecia areata often have a genetic predisposition to manifesting hair loss. But as with all diseases with a genetic predisposition, the factors that make the disease turn on or off are unclear. If you take identical twins who have the same genes, and one of them has alopecia areata, there’s only about a 50% chance that the other one develops it. So again, there are other factors that we don’t understand that make the disease turn on and off.\n\nIt has long been said that the disease is caused by stress, depression, anxiety or other environmental factors. But there’s not a lot of high-quality evidence of that. While stress may be an exacerbating factor for some, it’s not the cause.\n\nCNN: Are any other body parts affected?\n\nKing: Hair and nails are both made of keratin, a protein, which may explain why nails can be affected. When nails are affected, typically what you get are pits, as if somebody took a needle and poked a bunch of little indentations in the nail surface. Uncommonly, the nails become very rough and/or brittle and, rarely, there can be loss of nails.\n\nCNN: Does everyone with alopecia lose all their hair?\n\nKing: Most often, people with alopecia areata have a spot or a few spots of hair loss. It could be a dime- to a half-dollar-size spot. With treatment, and sometimes without treatment, these spots will often go away. In a handful of people, those spots may go away while new spots appear. Uncommonly – maybe in 10% to 25% of people with alopecia areata – those spots will, over the course of weeks or months or years, progress to severe hair loss or no hair.\n\nCNN: What influences case severity?\n\nKing: We don’t know what the factors are that make one person have only mild disease and somebody else have severe hair loss. It’s highly unpredictable, which is one of the things that make alopecia areata so menacing for those who suffer from it.\n\nCNN: Is alopecia hair loss permanent?\n\nKing: Hair loss is reversible in alopecia areata. In cases where hair is absent for too long, like more than 10 years, it may be permanent.\n\nCNN: What happens to hair loss over time?\n\nKing: Alopecia areata is unpredictable, and there’s no way to know if the spots of hair loss that go away today will not happen again for three months, three years or 30 years. What we can say with some confidence is that most people will have a manageable number of spots that will come and go. Last night I ran into someone who said she had a spot 30 years ago. She hasn’t had another spot since then, but she still has the ability to because it’s in her genes.\n\nCNN: What do people with alopecia tend to experience personally?\n\nKing: I don’t want to speak for everybody with alopecia areata, but I think I can for most people I’ve seen. For many people with alopecia areata, it feels like disfigurement. Imagine if you woke up today with parts or all of your eyebrows missing – would you have stopped by Starbucks? Or would you have hidden yourself and tried to find answers, thinking something was wrong with you?\n\nHair expresses individuality and sex. Just Google evolution – the top images are of the Neanderthal with head-to-toe hair. Over time we lost most body hair but retained head and facial hair. Evolution did that for a reason. The hair on our heads is important.\n\nSo, hair loss is devastating. You can cover up a few hairless spots, but not 30% or 100% scalp hair loss. You don’t look like yourself, and those who recognized you yesterday don’t today. Eyebrows are really important for facial recognition. And not only that, but what do people think you have? Every time you see a billboard with a hairless face or a woman wearing a scarf on her head, you instinctively think she has cancer and is undergoing chemotherapy. Historically, people have shamed others by shaving their heads. There’s a lot wrapped up in hair. With that severe distortion comes severe anguish.\n\nCNN: Are there any cures or treatments?\n\nKing: We can cure bacterial infections or a viral infection such as Covid-19. But we can’t cure alopecia areata just as we can’t cure any autoimmune diseases.\n\nWhat is a little bit different about alopecia areata is that we haven’t in the past had effective treatments, either. That changed with the report of a young man with severe alopecia areata who I treated with a medicine called tofacitinib, which belongs to a class of medicines called JAK inhibitors.\n\nHe regrew all his hair. I used this medicine because there was emerging science to show that JAK inhibitors could interrupt the pathological events leading to immune system attack on hair follicles. The report gave hope of effective treatment and led to interest in developing treatments for people suffering from alopecia areata in the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThere are now phase III clinical trials of JAK inhibitors in alopecia areata, which are showing tremendous promise. We are at the precipice of a historic event. For people who have severe alopecia areata, for the first time in history, there’s the possibility that we might be able to reverse their disease, make it better, restore normalcy.\n\nCNN: Do you have any words for people with alopecia areata?\n\nKing: Most of these people have been told that there’s no treatment, that they should be happy it’s not cancer, or that it’s ‘just hair.’ But now there’s hope of relief from this often awful disease. These treatments are going to change lives for many of these people. Your suffering is shared by many others and their families also. Find a dermatologist who can take the time to answer your questions and help you understand if these medicines might be helpful for you. But don’t take for an answer that ‘at least you don’t have cancer.’ Let’s keep going until there is effective treatment for everybody.", "authors": ["Kristen Rogers"], "publish_date": "2022/03/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2022/03/29/opinion-smith-should-use-his-voice-not-fist-educate-alopecia/7196043001/", "title": "My wife has alopecia. Show bald is beautiful with words, not a slap", "text": "Alopecia is no laughing matter. Comedian Chris Rock learned that the hard way at the 94th Academy Awards on Sunday night.\n\nBy now, most of us have seen \"the slap.\" Actor Will Smith stormed the stage and hit Rock, a presenter at the Oscars, in the face after the comedian made a joke about his wife Jada Pinkett Smith. \"Jada, I love you. 'G.I. Jane 2,' can't wait to see it,\" Rock quipped.\n\nActress Demi Moore famously shaved her head for her role in the film \"G.I. Jane\" and Pinkett Smith has a close haircut because she suffers from alopecia, an autoimmune disorder that causes hair loss. Pinkett Smith was visibly upset by Rock's wisecrack, which launched her husband on stage for the now-infamous confrontation.\n\nI can't defend or condone Smith's violent act, but I do understand his instinct to protect his wife in that moment better than most. You see, my wife Nichole suffers from alopecia, too, and there's been nothing funny about her struggle.\n\n\"Alopecia is by far one of the most difficult things that I have had to deal with,\" she said. \"No one knows the tears that I've cried, the insecurities that I continue to feel, the stares that I see and the comments that I hear.\"\n\nNo one except me. I've seen firsthand the emotional toll losing her hair patches at a time has taken. I've dried her tears, affirmed her beauty and held her hand – and even the razor and scissors – as she made the excruciating choice several years ago to shave off all of her hair.\n\nIt's heart-wrenching to watch someone you love in pain. So I can empathize with Smith's gut reaction to protect and defend his wife at all costs against the cruelty and insensitivity of others. Trust me, I've wanted to slap more than my fair share of wiseguys, too. But as Rock himself famously said during one of his stand-up comedy routines, \"There's a reason to hit everybody. You just don't do it.\"\n\nSmith missed a tremendous opportunity by using his fist instead of his voice to educate America and empower the millions of people afflicted with alopecia. The 6.8 million people in the U.S. and 147 million people worldwide who have, or will develop, alopecia during their lifetime should be the trending topic of conversation, not some beef between two Hollywood celebrities.\n\n\"For as much love and support Will thought he was showing Jada, violence is not the answer, education is,\" my wife said. \"Will Smith missed a great opportunity to not only support his wife, but to educate the world about what alopecia is and how it affects millions of people everyday.\n\n\"Millions of women, men and children deal with the daily battle of living with alopecia in a world that defines beauty standards by the hair on our heads,\" she said. \"Adults are judged and scrutinized by the decision to go bald, and children are bullied daily over a condition that they have no control over; some even committing suicide from the brutal treatment of others.\"\n\nMore media coverage is being given to the Oscars controversy than to stories like that of 12-year-old Rio Allred of Indiana who took her own life because she was being bullied because of having alopecia. Talk about a slap in the face.\n\nAs the editor-in-chief of Bald Life Magazine, Jamie Elmore has created a safe space for men, women and children to share their alopecia/hair loss stories. The first issue of the magazine featured a cover story on Massachusetts Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley who is a Cincinnati native and also suffers from alopecia.\n\n\"Unfortunately, society has enforced a lie that the narrow vision of beauty is reserved for only those who have a full head of hair,\" Elmore said.\n\nBut I know otherwise. My wife is the most beautiful and courageous person I know. I remember the first time she shaved her head and had to go to work the next day. At the time, she was working at South Avondale Elementary School. I could see the fear and worry in her eyes, the questions swirling in her mind, as she headed for the door.\n\nWhat will the kids say? How will the teachers and staff react? Will people be staring, pointing, laughing, talking behind my back?\n\nI half expected her to get to the door, think twice and not go. No one – especially me – would have blamed her. It was a huge step into a scary new world. But despite her concerns, she forged ahead. I wanted so badly to go with her, to cover and protect her, but I knew this was something she had to do for and by herself. I've never been prouder and have seen few things braver.\n\nShe would confess to me when she got home that night that she spent her first publicly bald day at work in her office, keeping a low profile and crying throughout. But with each passing day, she became more comfortable with her new look and soon had the confidence to start braving the hallways and classrooms of South Avondale again. And what she couldn't have known or anticipated was in the process, she was becoming an inspiration to other women – some of whom she knew – who had been suffering silently with alopecia.\n\n\"As a woman who has accepted and embraced my alopecia journey, being compared to G.I. Jane is taken as a compliment,\" Nichole said. \"I mean after all, she was bad, brave and yes, bald. However, I do understand that there are many people who are not as far as I am in their alopecia walk, including Jada Pinkett Smith.\n\n\"Maybe now, people will take the time to learn about and understand alopecia,\" she said. \"Maybe we will get a cure, or at least in the meantime, maybe we can be more kind, compassionate and empathetic towards one another.\"\n\nStories like my wife's deserve to be told, respected and celebrated. Chris Rock getting slapped on one of the world's biggest stages was unfortunate, but even more regrettable is that Smith squandered a chance to use an ugly moment to teach the world that bald is beautiful.\n\nOpinion and Engagement Editor Kevin S.
