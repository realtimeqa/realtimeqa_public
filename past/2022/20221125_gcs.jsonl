The only red wave this season is going to be if German Shepherd Commander knocks over the cranberry sauce,” Biden told an audience on the White House South Lawn.\n\nJustice, and perhaps a side of cranberry sauce, was served as Biden roasted the 2022 National Thanksgiving Turkey and an alternate, Chocolate and Chip. The president quipped that the two birds were part of “another flock hoping to come to Washington in 2024.”\n\nBaste on tradition, Biden designated Chocolate as the official National Thanksgiving Turkey, but both Chocolate and Chip were pardoned. The birds weigh in at 46 and 47 pounds, respectively, and were raised by National Turkey Federation (NTF) chairman Ronnie Parker near Monroe, North Carolina.\n\nAs he began his remarks on the crisp November morning, Biden joked he would keep it short because “nobody likes it when the turkey gets cold.”\n\nThe poultry of honor arrived in Washington, DC, over the weekend, where they gobbled up an opportunity to stay at the nearby Willard Hotel and ruffled some feathers as they trotted around a Sunday press conference.\n\nBiden made much ado about stuffing before heading to Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point in North Carolina, for a Friendsgiving dinner with service members and military families, part of first lady Dr. Jill Biden’s Joining Forces initiative. The Biden family will spend the Thanksgiving holiday in Nantucket, Massachusetts, where family discussions about the president’s political future and a 2024 run will begin in earnest.\n\nDespite the cornucopia of jokes cracked Monday, the turkey pardon comes as Americans are facing rising costs at their Thanksgiving tables. The American Farm Bureau’s annual survey found that the average price of Thanksgiving dinner is up 20% since last year due to high inflation, as well as supply chain disruptions and the war in Ukraine.\n\nThere was also the added challenge this year, the Department of Agriculture said in a memo, of a “highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), which resulted in the loss of over 50 million birds, including over 8 million turkeys.” The USDA, the memo said, worked with states and producers “to implement a comprehensive, collaborative, and all-hands-on-deck response to this outbreak and ensure there is an adequate supply of turkeys for the holiday season, successfully ensuring that everyone who wants a bird will be able to get one.”\n\nRumors of turkey pardons go back in presidential history as far as the Lincoln administration. Folklore has it that Lincoln’s young son asked his father to spare a pet turkey that was supposed to be part of their Thanksgiving dinner.\n\nThe NTF became the official turkey supplier to the first family in 1947 and the formal turkey presentation ceremony has been around since President Harry Truman. Truman was the first to accept a turkey from them – however, he did not spare the bird.\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - NOVEMBER 21: U.S. President Joe Biden pardons Chocolate, the National Thanksgiving Turkey, as he is joined by the 2022 National Turkey Federation Chairman Ronnie Parker on the South Lawn of the White House November 21, 2022 in Washington, DC. Chocolate, and the alternate, Chip, were raised at Circle S. Ranch, outside of Charlotte, North Carolina, and will reside on the campus of North Carolina State University following today's ceremony.

Even though President Gerald Ford pardoned President Richard Nixon, neither one of them decided to officially pardon any turkeys.\n\nTurkey pardoning became the norm in the White House in 1989 when President George H.W. Bush revived the tradition, now a staple of the White House holiday season.\n\nBiden’s most recent predecessors have peppered their pardons with turkey and other topical political puns.\n\nLast year, Biden pardoned Peanut Butter and Jelly as he acknowledged a return to Thanksgiving traditions amid the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n“Eventually, Peanut Butter and Jelly were selected based on their temperament, appearance and, I suspect, vaccination status,” the president joked. “Yes, instead of getting basted, these two turkeys are getting boosted.”\n\nFormer President Donald Trump poked fun at the impeachment inquiry in 2019, telling a crowd that the turkeys “have already received subpoenas to appear in Adam Schiff’s basement.”\n\nAnd former President Barack Obama employed his signature rhetoric: “I do – I want to take a moment to recognize the great turkeys who weren’t so lucky, who didn’t get to ride the gravy train to freedom. Who met their fate with courage and sacrifice and proved that they weren’t chicken.”\n\n“Yes, we cran,” Obama added.\n\nChocolate and Chip will retire to North Carolina State University in Raleigh, North Carolina, following their trip to the nation’s capital.\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Betsy Klein"], "publish_date": "2022/11/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/11/21/biden-pardon-thanksgiving-turkeys/10748191002/", "title": "President Biden pardons Thanksgiving turkeys Chocolate and Chip", "text": "WASHINGTON – The votes had been counted.

Agency head Suharyanto, who like many Indonesians only goes by one name, told reporters that another 1,083 people were injured in the 5.6 magnitude earthquake that hit Monday afternoon near the city of Cianjur. The temblor sent terrified residents fleeing into the streets, some covered in blood and debris, and caused buildings around the rural area to collapse.

Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes and four other members of the right-wing militia group face the most serious charges brought so far in relation to the attack on the Capitol, chief among them a seditious conspiracy charge. The Justice Department hasn't tried a seditious conspiracy case in a decade nor won a guilty verdict since 1995, when Islamic militants who plotted to bomb New York City landmarks were prosecuted. A guilty verdict could serve as a warning to government dissenters that violent acts against the U.S. will be punished. But an acquittal could undermine the Justice Department's narrative that the events of Jan. 6 endangered democracy — and embolden the militia movement.

But despite the staggering rates, experts say there is less awareness of Black women’s burden of the virus, which is associated with men who have sex with men. One in 9 women is unaware they have the virus, according to the CDC, and 57% of women who were diagnosed with HIV in 2018 were Black. Grassroots groups are working to change this with the help of a recent $8 million grant from ViiV Healthcare, a pharmaceutical company that makes the injectable HIV prevention drug Apretude.

He is attended to by Ukrainian soldiers who place him face down on the floor and apply first aid.\n\n“We got pinned down over here and everybody ran,” he tells the Ukrainian soldiers. “I fell down and lay there till evening. They came and took my captain and that was it. They said they’d come back for me but nobody came.”\n\nThe exchange was recorded by the reconnaissance team and shared with CNN. It offers a valuable insight into the grueling battle for the key southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, which culminated in a Russian withdrawal from a swathe of land on the west bank of the Dnipro river earlier this month, a major setback for the Kremlin’s war.\n\nThe Ukrainian unit says the Russian soldier was taken away to safety and his wounds tended to. But many of those sent here by the Kremlin have faced a very different outcome.\n\n“They had the big losses here,” the head of the reconnaissance unit Andrii Pidlisnyi tells CNN, reviewing this with some of the other footage he and his unit have collected over the past few months.\n\nThe 28-year-old captain, whose call sign is ‘Sneaky,’ has been living up to his name around Russian positions.\n\nHis forces have operated so close to enemy lines they say they could hear Russian soldiers talking, cooking or chopping wood. The unit identified targets both visually and using drones, and then relayed coordinates to Ukrainian artillery for targeting.\n\nAndrii Pidlisnyi, 28, reviews some of the footage he and his unit recorded while carrying out reconnaissance missions beyond enemy lines in Kherson. Vasco Cotovio/CNN\n\nThis unit includes some of the better-trained international volunteers that have arrived in Ukraine since the war began. Originally from the United States, Britain, New Zealand and Germany, alongside other European nations, these volunteers served their respective militaries in the past and some have previous experience fighting with Kurdish forces against ISIS in Syria.\n\nIn one drone video shared with CNN, Moscow’s soldiers are seen running into a trench while artillery shells rain down on them. The first salvos fall a little wide of the target. But the recon soldiers, using the drone, send minute adjustments to the gunners. Seconds later, plumes of smoke and dust erupt from the Russian bunkers and trenches.\n\nThe horror of being under such bombardment is driven home by the sight of Russian soldiers running through the dust, frantically, and in vain, seeking safety and cover as more and more high explosive shells erupt around them.\n\nThrough the summer and into the fall, this was the pattern of war on the Kherson front. The Ukrainian recon soldiers said that Russia had the edge in terms of number of guns – firing “80 shots to our 20,” Pidlisnyi says. But modern weapons from NATO and other Western allies sent to Ukraine then gave them the advantage in terms of accuracy. Eventually, after taking what Pidlisnyi guessed were “50%” casualties, the Russians retreated.\n\n“They lost a lot of people … because of our intelligence, because of our artillery and because of our rocket system, especially HIMARS and so on,” he says. “Before they retreated, they lost, in the last month alone, about 90 tanks.”\n\n“That’s a big loss for them, especially as they haven’t got too much new equipment to bring to the front,” the reconnaissance head adds.\n\n‘Months of frustration’\n\nThe jubilation that followed Ukraine’s success in pushing Russia east away from the West bank of the Dnipro River was a fairly new sentiment for Pidlisnyi and his men.\n\n“It was months and months of just frustration,” Jordan O’Brien says. The 29-year-old New Zealander says he flew across the globe to do his part “to stand up to bullies,” and has been fighting in the south of Ukraine as part of an anti-tank unit since June.\n\n“We were finding it hard to have any effect on the battlefield, it was very hard to actually get to a position where we could see Russian armor,” O’Brien says. “It was dug in real deep.”\n\nJordan O'Brien, 29, flew across the globe from his native New Zealand to help Ukraine \"stand up to bullies,\" in a reference to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Vasco Cotovio/CNN\n\nBriton Macer Gifford shares a similar view. “The last few months have been absolutely intense,” the 35-year-old Syrian war veteran says. “The Russians have employed just about every dirty tactic in the book, including massive bombardments of civilian areas. So it’s just incredibly dangerous, tiresome, soul-destroying.”\n\nRussian forces captured Kherson and the surrounding area in the first month of their invasion of Ukraine. They had time to dig in and fortify their positions, months before Kyiv announced a counter-offensive in the summer. Russia used heavy artillery to keep Ukrainian forces at a distance, intensifying its barrages shortly before it withdrew.\n\n“The last couple of weeks particularly have been quite intense because we’ve received a huge amount of artillery,” Gifford says. The unit survived but the pressure was immense. “If anything’s going to break you in this country, it’s going to be the artillery,” O’Brien adds. “Fortunately, everyone’s strong.”\n\nThe final few days\n\nPidlisnyi and his men were overcome with a sense of relief when they started hearing about a possible Russian retreat over the Dnipro.\n\n‘Sneaky’ says Moscow’s armies began their withdrawal from Kherson under the cover of darkness, from November 8 to November 9, moving their second and third defensive lines towards Kherson and nearby villages. Their first line of defense was the last to move in the morning, Pidlisnyi says, leaving behind several rows of landmines to cover their retreat, hoping to ambush and slow down Ukrainian forces.\n\nBy November 10, all Russian forces on the West bank had fallen back to near the Dnipro and started crossing to the East bank, Pidlisnyi says. By November 11, the withdrawal was complete, and confirmed by the Russian Defense Ministry on its official Telegram channel.\n\nBronx native Damien Rodriguez, the explosives expert of the unit, says he had trouble believing the Russians had simply picked up and left.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'This is what liberation looks like': Ukraine takes back Kherson 03:34 - Source: CNN\n\n“We heard rumors, but we weren’t sure,” the 41-year-old veteran of the Kurdish campaign against ISIS, Rodriguez says. “I didn’t really 100% believe until we got on the ground and seen that they all left the positions.”\n\nThe months-long struggle worth it all in the end, he says.\n\n“You see the villagers … you see everybody crying and thanking us for help … for helping liberate their village,” Rodriguez says. “It was the same as Syria when we were liberating villages from ISIS.”\n\n“The amount of people coming on the streets, It honestly felt like the Second World War … People throwing flowers at us and stuff. It was amazing,” Gifford adds.\n\nAfter chaotic retreats first from Kyiv and then from Kharkiv, the Russian Ministry of Defense claimed that the withdrawal from Kherson was a calculated decision, executed in a professional manner.\n\n“Not a single piece of military equipment or weaponry was left behind on the right bank,” the ministry also said.\n\nMacer Gifford, 35, fought alongside Kurdish soldiers against ISIS in Syria, but says the feeling of liberating Kherson reminded him of World War II. Vasco Cotovio/CNN\n\nBut ‘Sneaky’ and his unit dispute that account. Although Russian soldiers had roughly a week to prepare the withdrawal, they still left in a hurry.\n\n“We came with another intelligence unit to check out their positions and found that they ran very quickly from the first line and left a lot of stuff, documents and so on,” Pidlisnyi explains.\n\nVideo shared by the unit with CNN shows dozens of boxes of ammunition, military as well as personal documents. “They’ve left behind a huge amount of ordnance everything from anti-air, to grenades, to small arms,” Gifford says.\n\nThis was a welcome surprise for the men in the unit.\n\n“I was able to scavenge some really nice stuff because here in Ukraine, we could be better equipped, we’re low on, some of our ammo,” Rodriguez explains. “I use a drone and drop all types of payloads and I set booby-traps, so got some good detonators and extra grenades.\n\n“We call it a reallocation of resources,” he adds.", "authors": ["Vasco Cotovio Sam Kiley Peter Rudden Olga Konovalova", "Vasco Cotovio", "Sam Kiley", "Peter Rudden", "Olga Konovalova"], "publish_date": "2022/11/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/11/24/bidens-cabinet-election-certifications-5-things-know-tuesday/6391441002/", "title": "Biden's cabinet, election certifications, Trump's turkey pardon: 5 ...", "text": "Editors\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nBiden to introduce new hires in Delaware\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden was scheduled to introduce some of his personnel picks Tuesday at an event in Wilmington, Delaware.

All states must certify before the Electoral College meets on Dec. 14, and any challenge to the results must be resolved by Dec. 8.\n\nAdditional states imposing new COVID-19 limitations\n\nAs COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths continue to rise nationwide, on Tuesday, Nevada and Wyoming will join a lengthy list of states that have imposed some sort of new coronavirus-related order. Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak, who has practically begged residents to follow the state's mask-wearing and social distancing orders, strengthened the mandate by requiring face coverings during private gatherings indoors and outdoors, and limited businesses to 25% capacity. The new restrictions will be in effect for three weeks. For the first time since the spring, Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon has imposed new measures limiting indoor and outdoor gatherings. The governor did not announce a statewide face mask order despite a call from county health officers to enact one. Thirty-seven states – plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico – now require people to wear face coverings in public statewide, according to a list maintained by AARP.\n\nTrump will pardon turkey from Iowa\n\nPresident Donald Trump will pardon an Iowa bird on Tuesday at the White House. Turkey producers Ron and Susie Kardel of Walcott raised this year's \"presidential flock,\" including the two turkeys chosen to travel to Washington, D.C. One of the birds will be named the official Thanksgiving Turkey and the other will serve as an alternate. Both will then live out their days at Iowa State University and be available for public viewing starting at 10 a.m. on Dec. 5. This annual holiday tradition was made official in 1989 under former President George H.W. Bush.\n\nAnd the Grammy (nomination) goes to ...\n\nThe nominations for the 2021 Grammy Awards will be revealed via livestream Tuesday as Recording Academy Interim President Harvey Mason Jr. and a bevy of musicians will announce the hopefuls in more than 80 categories. Rapper Megan Thee Stallion is expected to see multiple nominations, including one in the highly competitive best new artist category. But as the Associated Press points out, she could have been nominated for more awards but the song \"WAP\" — which she collaborated with Cardi B on — wasn't submitted for nominations this year. Also, superstar Taylor Swift, fresh off winning her third consecutive artist of the year prize at the American Music Awards Sunday, should compete for the top prizes thanks to her latest album \"Folklore.\" The 63rd Grammy Awards are slated to air Jan. 31 on CBS.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/24"}]}

Here's everything you need to know to understand the ultimate display of the beautiful game.\n\nWhere is the next FIFA World Cup?The 2026 tournament is coming to a city near you.\n\nFollow every match: Live World Cup scores\n\nWhat is the World Cup?\n\nThe World Cup is international soccer’s – or football depending on where you live – flagship tournament that takes place every four years, where national teams compete to determine which country has the best soccer team in the world.\n\nThe competition dates back to 1930 in Uruguay. Twenty-one World Cups have been played – every four years since, only skipping tournaments slated for 1942 and 1946 because of World War II.\n\nIt's one of the most watched sports competitions globally. More than 3.5 billion viewers tuned into the 2018 World Cup in Russia, and 1.12 billion watched the final, according to the sport's governing body FIFA.\n\nThe reigning champion is France, which beat Croatia in the 2018 final. The tournaments have been dominated by teams from South America and Europe, where the sport is immensely popular.\n\nHuman rights:Migrant workers were deceived and died for Qatar's World Cup. Thousands want compensation\n\nIs the U.S. in the World Cup?\n\nYes. The United States Men’s National Team has never won a World Cup. But it goes into Qatar looking to unlock the promise of a young squad that is widely regarded as its most talented ever. Led by Christian Pulisic, a forward who plays for the English soccer club Chelsea, the team has several young players who compete for teams in the world’s top leagues in Europe.\n\nThe U.S., however, is dominant in the women's competition. The U.S. Women's National Team has hoisted 4 World Cup trophies since the competition started in 1991.\n\nWorld Cup live updates:France makes multiple changes vs. Tunisia; Mexico faces potential elimination\n\nHow were the 2022 teams selected as World Cup Qualifiers\n\nThe tournament is comprised of teams that qualify from each of FIFA’s six regional soccer confederations plus the host nation. In the lead up to the World Cup, each confederation holds “World Cup Qualifier\" matches.\n\nUEFA (Europe): 13 teams qualified.\n\nCONMEBOL (South America): 5 teams.\n\nCONCACAF (North, Central America and the Caribbean): 4 teams.\n\nAFC (Asia plus Australia): 5 teams.\n\nCAF (Africa): 5 teams.\n\nOFC (Oceania): 0 teams.\n\nIts teams play against each other for points – a win equals three points, draw equals 1 point and a loss equals no points. Generally speaking, the teams with the most points at the end of the qualifying period advance to the World Cup tournament where they represent their confederation. The number of teams each confederation sends varies, as do the particulars of the qualifying process.\n\nNot all confederations will be represented. And not all teams clinch a World Cup spot by racking up points in confederation play.\n\nThe Oceania Football Confederation, for example, will not be represented. The top team that emerged from its World Cup qualifying competition, New Zealand, lost a playoff against Costa Rica, which finished fourth in CONCACAF qualifying.\n\nThe playoff system allows some teams, like Costa Rica, that fell just short of initial qualification, a final shot of making it into the tournament by knocking out another team.\n\nThree European teams – Wales, Poland and Portugal – qualified after beating opponents in UEFA's playoff system.\n\nIn some cases, such as the CAF (Africa), the top 10 teams were pared down to the final five by playing two-match playoffs, called two-legged ties. The teams with the cumulative score over the two games earned a World Cup spot.\n\nHow can the USMNT advance at the WC?:Breaking down all the Group B scenarios.\n\nWorld Cup qualifying usually starts the year following a World Cup tournament and typically concludes a handful of months before the start of the next tournament.\n\nWhat are soccer's yellow card rules? How players get red cards, suspensions in World Cup\n\nHow were World Cup groups selected?\n\nThe tournament is split into eight groups (Groups A - H) of four teams. Each group was selected via random draw out of four pots in April. Teams were placed in pots based on their FIFA world ranking. The highest ranking teams went in the first pot and so on.\n\nThe United States Men’s National Team was in pot three and drew into Group B with England, Iran and Wales, which beat Ukraine in a playoff to sneak into the tournament.\n\nWhat happens if a World Cup game ends in a tie? FIFA extra time and penalty shootouts, explained\n\nHow do teams advance to the knockout stage of World Cup?\n\nTeams play one match against the other teams in their group and the top two teams with the most points from each group advance to the knockout stage.\n\nA victory equals three points.\n\nA draw equals one point.\n\nA loss equals no points.\n\nIf the top two teams are tied in points, the first place team is the team with a higher goal differential (the difference between how many goals a team conceded and scored in its games) or whichever team won the head-to-head matchup.\n\nThe first place team of a group goes on to play the second place team of another group (and vice versa) in the first knockout stage, also known as the round of 16. Then the number of teams gets cut to eight, then four in the next stage, then to two, who will play in the final on Sunday Dec. 18. A third place match between the losers of the semi-final games will be played the day before.\n\nWhy is the World Cup in November this year?\n\nIf 2022 was like any other World Cup year, the tournament would have taken place over the summer. But FIFA decided in 2015 the extreme heat of the Persian Gulf nation made it unwise to hold the tournament in the summer, so it decided to push it back in the winter.\n\nWho has won the most World Cups?\n\nBrazil is considered the most decorated football nation with its five World Cup trophies. The South American country consistently produces some of the world’s flashiest and talented players, including Pele, Ronaldinho and Neymar. Brazil is known for its fan-friendly “Jogo Bonito” (\"beautiful game\" in Portuguese) style of play that values creativity and individual skill on the pitch.\n\nThis year’s Brazilian side, led by Paris Saint Germain’s Neymar, is considered a favorite to win it all.

But, at Qatar 2022, alcohol is not as readily available.\n\nThat’s because two days before the start of the 2022 tournament, soccer’s world governing body FIFA confirmed a ban of alcoholic beverages at the eight stadiums hosting the World Cup.\n\nWhile some fans were pleased with the decision, others were left confused and frustrated – including 21-year-old student Arnov Paul-Choudhury from England.\n\n“It’s the World Cup, it’s football, you need to be able to drink around the stadium,” Paul-Choudhury told CNN Sport in Doha on the day of the announcement. “I just don’t think they’re doing the right things to attract fans.”\n\nFIFA President Gianni Infantino disagreed, saying fans would “survive” not being able to drink “for three hours a day” and, on the whole, he’s been proven right.\n\nOnce the World Cup got underway, CNN spoke to a number of fans about the booze ban and alcohol – or the lack thereof at stadiums – didn’t seem to be much of an issue for them.\n\n“I’d normally have a few beers, but I think everyone is just getting on with it,” England fan Nick Cottrill told CNN at the FIFA Fan Festival.\n\n“Everyone here is just really happy and there is so much negativity back home. It’s all running really well,” added Cottrill who was visiting Qatar with his father, Gary.\n\nThere was one potential downside about not being able to drink at stadiums, according to the Cottrills in that – from their experience – matches were a bit less boisterous, though that’s not necessarily been a bad thing.\n\n“Normally, so many people go over the top,” Gary Cottrill told CNN. “It’s fine to have alcohol, but those people who come for the sake of causing trouble and being obnoxious are being stopped from coming.”\n\nArgentina fans enjoy the atmosphere at the Souq Waqif in Doha. Peter Byrne/PA Images/Getty Images\n\nSourcing alcohol\n\nThe sale and consumption of alcohol has been a highly contentious issue since Qatar was first announced as the World Cup host 12 years ago.\n\nThe Muslim country is considered to be very conservative and tightly regulates alcohol sales and consumption.\n\nIn Qatar, it’s illegal to be seen drunk in public and those who violate this could face legal consequences.\n\nAccording to UK government advice on traveling to Qatar, drinking in a public place could “result in a prison sentence of up to six months and/or a fine up to 3,000 Qatar Rial ($824).”\n\nIn September, Qatar had said it would permit ticketed fans to buy alcoholic beer at World Cup soccer matches starting three hours before kick-off and for one hour after the final whistle, but not during the match.\n\nThen, two days before the first match, FIFA confirmed that no alcohol would be sold at the stadiums which will host the tournament’s 64 matches. Alcohol would only be served in designated fan parks and other licensed venues around Doha, FIFA said in a statement.\n\nSome fans can still consume alcohol at matches – albeit at a price. Supporters can purchase a Match Hospitality package, with prices ranging from $950 to $4,950 per match, for varying services, including alcohol.\n\nAlcohol is also available at licensed hotel restaurants and bars around Doha, and expatriates living in Qatar can obtain alcohol on a permit system, according to UK government advice.\n\nFans of Japan drink alcohol free beer during a match at Qatar 2022. Baptiste Fernandez/Icon Sport/Getty Images\n\nThe FIFA Fan Festival also sells Budweiser beer between 7 p.m. and 1 a.m meaning fans who want to drink absolutely can.\n\nBut for a lot of fans who have traveled thousands of miles to be in Qatar, alcohol refueling wasn’t the reason they’ve come to a World Cup.\n\n“That’s not what we’re here for,” US fan Deya Banisakher, 30, told CNN.\n\nBanisakher is in Doha to follow the US Men’s National Team (USMNT) with his partner, Mireya Jurado.\n\nLike many, the couple say the restrictions around drinking outside venues has had very little impact on their trip.\n\n“We’re here to watch the football matches, soak up the culture. The architecture is beautiful. We’re having a great time,” explained Jurado.\n\nThere is a notable family atmosphere in Qatar’s capital, with fans enjoying the city when they aren’t watching matches.\n\nSouq Waqif, an area of downtown Doha, is an area popular with fans and is frequently filled with thousands of people supporting different teams. Despite often being crammed into tight areas, interactions are invariably friendly between supporters.\n\nThis, of course, could still be the case with the presence of alcohol, but major soccer tournaments have previously been marred with fan violence and hooliganism so far unseen at Qatar 2022.\n\nNotably, the Euro 2020 final at Wembley was overshadowed by excessive alcohol and drug misuse, according to a report commissioned by the English Football Association.\n\nA safer World Cup?\n\nThe lack of alcohol around stadiums at Qatar 2022 has also reduced the risk of crowd-related problems escalating into major incidents, says one expert.\n\n“Let’s consider if you’re taking your family to watch a match,” Dr. Sean Mottaleb, a senior healthcare lead who works for the emergency, crisis and disaster preparedness team at Qatar 2022, told CNN.\n\n“Would you feel safe if you have somebody who is intoxicated sitting next to you and they don’t have that much control over their behavior?\n\n“I would say this event is not only for hardcore football fans, it’s for everybody. It’s for everybody around the world.

You eliminate that element.”\n\nThe World Cup finishes on December 18, meaning there is plenty of time for things to change.\n\nBut the feeling on the ground is that this World Cup has shown that soccer can be enjoyed without excessive alcohol.\n\nIf anything, there is bemusement among fans that the issue is getting so much attention back in their home countries when all they want to see is good action on the pitch.\n\nMottaleb said the next tournament – held across Mexico, US and Canada – may look to learn lessons from Qatar but, in truth, an alcohol ban in 2026 would be very unlikely.", "authors": ["Ben Church"], "publish_date": "2022/11/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/worldcup/2022/12/03/usa-usmnt-netherlands-world-cup-live-updates/10816570002/", "title": "USA vs. Netherlands World Cup recap: Sloppy defense proves ...", "text": "USA TODAY Sports Staff\n\nThe United States is out of the 2022 World Cup, losing 3-1 to the Netherlands on Saturday in the Round of 16, a third consecutive defeat at this stage of the tournament.\n\nThe Netherlands took an early lead and added a goal just before halftime, but Haji Wright pulled one back in the 76th minute for the Americans, only to have the Dutch come right back and score to essentially ice the game.\n\nIt's a disappointing end of the road for a young USMNT, which had failed to qualify for the 2018 tournament.

The U.S. squandered a few chances in the first half and careless defending helped the Dutch score their goals. It’s the third consecutive exit in the Round of 16 for the Americans (2010, 2014).\n\nThe Netherlands, who also failed to qualify in 2018, will face the winner of Argentina-Australia in the quarterfinals on Friday.\n\nFor the U.S., it’s back to the drawing board ahead of the Concacaf Gold Cup next summer.

Now, with a talented, young squad, that lift is a lot lighter.\n\n“Honestly, this team helps me so much to take the pressure off of me,” Pulisic said Thursday. “A couple years ago there were times maybe I felt I needed to do more. But with these guys, I don’t feel that way at all, to be honest. I know they have my back.”\n\nDOHA, QATAR — Al Khalifa is the one stadium that also has a track, which pushes the seats far back from the field. It's definitely taking away some of the pre-game energy, though the USMNT fans made themselves heard when Christian Pulisic was introduced.

The bug ran through the U.S. squad last week.\n\nNetherlands coach Louis van Gaal gave his team the day off on Thursday instead of running a typical 11-on-11 match.\n\n“I gave them a day of rest,” Van Gaal said Friday. “With this group, they communicate that to me. I listen to my players.”\n\nHe declined to elaborate on how many players are affected, but by abandoning the typical training schedule Van Gaal created speculation that at least six players are ill.\n\n“We are not going to elaborate on that,” he said. “But if it goes around in the group, it is worrying.”\n\nFrenkie de Jong has said a scratchy throat disrupted his ability to communicate during a victory over Qatar, and Marten de Roon told reporters he had a cold earlier this week.\n\n— Associated Press\n\nStandout defense, Christian Pulisic and plenty of stamina are important factors for the USMNT during Saturday's World Cup knockout game against the Netherlands.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports columnist Nancy Armour digs into what the U.S. must do to advance to its second quarter final appearance in 20 years.\n\nDon't miss a moment of the knockout rounds.

But the path to victory won't be easy with their increasing list of injuries.\n\nHere's who USA TODAY Network reporters think will come out champions (disclaimer: picks were made before the tournament started):\n\nThe USMNT is guaranteed at least $13 million in prize money from this World Cup, a figure that could rise to $17 million if they beat the Netherlands in Saturday’s round of 16 game. Thanks to the historic collective bargaining agreement reached in May between U.S. Soccer and its national teams, half that prize money will go to the U.S. women.\n\nThat's more than what the women's team earned in their last two championship runs...combined.\n\nSigns say \"yes.\"\n\nPulisic says, \"I’m doing everything in my power to be able to be out there on the field on Saturday.” The USMNT star was cleared to play Friday night, after he’d gone through training.\n\nPulisic came off at halftime against Iran with a pelvic contusion.

Commission approves World Cup ...", "text": "Hamilton County commissioners on Thursday agreed to host World Cup soccer matches in 2026, if Cincinnati is selected as a site.\n\nThat agreement will include at least $10 million in renovations to Paul Brown Stadium.\n\nThe three-member Hamilton County Board of Commissioners voted 2-0 to approve an agreement with FIFA and the Cincinnati USA Convention and Visitors Bureau to hold World Cup matches in 2026 in Paul Brown Stadium.\n\nCommissioner Alicia Reece abstained. Commissioners Stephanie Summerow Dumas and Denise Driehaus voted in favor. All are Democrats.\n\nDumas, the president of the Hamilton County Board of Commissioners, said the World Cup is worth the cost. The county knew going into the process it would cost something, she said.\n\n\"I would say why get on the field and play, and then you decide just to walk off?\" Dumas said on Thursday.\n\nIt's not a done deal yet.\n\nNow the region awaits the June 16 announcement from FIFA, the international soccer governing body that runs the World Cup, on which cities will get to host the World Cup. Paul Brown Stadium is up against 17 other stadiums across the country. At least 10 will be chosen.\n\nThe five-year effort to bring the World Cup to Cincinnati hinged on the approval of the Hamilton County commissioners. The business community, including the head of the Cincinnati USA Regional Chamber, urged commissioners to approve the contract.\n\nCo-FC Cincinnati CEO Jeff Berding called it a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. He attended the meeting Thursday but declined comment after the meeting, instead walking back into the commission chambers without speaking to reporters.\n\nThe World Cup is the largest sporting event in the world, with an estimated TV viewership of five billion people. Compare that to the audience of 110 million people who watched the Bengals in Super Bowl 2022.\n\nAn economic impact study from the University of Cincinnati estimated hosting a World Cup would bring $449 million in economic investment for the region and $4 million in tax revenue for the county.\n\nCincinnati hosting one of the largest sporting events in the world wasn't without concerns.\n\nWhat is the county obligated to do?\n\nThe 236-page agreement would obligate the county to make at least $10 million in renovations to Paul Brown Stadium. The county would have to convert it temporarily from a football field to a soccer pitch.\n\nThe county will have to make additional upgrades to the stadium that could total $40 million, said County Administrator Jeff Aluotto. But most of those improvements, including upgraded lighting, scoreboards and concessions, were already planned regardless of the World Cup, he said.\n\nThe county makes $5 million a year in capital improvements as required by the lease agreement between the Bengals and the county.\n\nThe stadium, owned by Hamilton County taxpayers, was built to host soccer matches too. But since the stadium opened in 2000, regulation-size soccer pitch dimensions have grown. So the field needed to be bigger, which will require cutting into concrete. It would cost $4 million to put in a new grass turf and drainage system and another $6 million to remove 1,800 seats to accommodate a soccer pitch.\n\nThe county has paid for stadium maintenance and improvements with the half-cent sales tax that paid for the stadium's construction. The sales tax would be the primary source used to fund the $10 million in improvements, Aluotto said on Thursday. The county would share costs with the business community on expenses outside of the stadium, Aluotto said.\n\nBerding said business owners and even the state are options to help with the field costs.\n\nThe business community has already pledged $35 million to $50 million to help cover expenses for other World Cup-related activities, like festivals or training facilities.\n\nWhy the short notice?\n\nReece criticized FIFA for sending the 257 pages of requirements over the Memorial Day weekend. That's not enough time to vet the agreement, she said.\n\n\"I do have tremendous concerns about a pattern of major deals coming in, rushed in and rushed out, that are complicated and have long-term economic effects,\" Reece said. She said that's not fair to the average resident.\n\n\"There’s only one group on the hook, the taxpayers of Hamilton County.\"\n\nDumas disputed that it was last minute. She said these requirements had been discussed for more than a year.\n\n\"It wasn’t all new stuff,\" Dumas said. \"We've been talking about FIFA for a while.\"\n\n\"Maybe you had this information,\" Reece said. \"I did not have it.\"\n\nWhere do the Bengals stand?\n\nAnother issue that wasn't resolved is where the Bengals stand on this. The Bengals did not respond to a message earlier in the week seeking comment.\n\nReece asked whether the Bengals were on board with the changes. Aluotto wouldn't say yes. He just said they have been part of the discussions and are aware of the changes.\n\nReece said she abstained until she saw more involvement and buy-in from other groups, including the Bengals and the state of Ohio and Kentucky.\n\nIn the end, the other two commissioners said the economic impact and exposure was too good to pass up.\n\nHosting a World Cup event would give Cincinnati positive, worldwide publicity, said Commissioner Denise Driehaus.\n\n\"This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,\" Driehaus said. \"This is something we’re not going to see again.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/04/football/usmnt-analysis-world-cup-2022-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "USMNT's youth and talent at Qatar 2022 bodes well for 2026 World ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe minute the final whistle blew on Saturday and the Netherlands knocked the United States Men’s National Team (USMNT) out of the World Cup, 2026 seemed much closer on the horizon than it had just a few hours previously.\n\nThe next World Cup – hosted primarily in the US, along with Canada and Mexico – is three-and-a-half years away, and hopes are already high for what the USMNT’s young, so-called ‘golden generation’ can achieve there after it showcased its talent in Qatar, despite crashing out in the round of 16 with a 3-1 defeat to the Netherlands.\n\nReaching the knockout stages of this tournament, most pundits determined beforehand, was achievable for the USMNT but not entirely expected – it had a 48% chance of exiting its group in Qatar, according to Nielsen’s Gracenote, a sports data company.\n\nBut, although this goal was achieved and the USMNT fell to the heavily favored Netherlands, its win over a determined Iran and draw with heavyweights England in the group stages had hinted at something more, some untapped potential to be drawn out later in this tournament.\n\nThe USMNT had the second-youngest squad in Qatar, while its group stage starting XIs were three of the four youngest starting XI in the tournament up until December 1, according to US Soccer. Indeed, the average age of the USMNT’s starting XI in the four matches it played was just 25 years, 139 days.

Claudio Villa/Getty Images\n\nBack home too, the country embraced its men’s football team in a way that it hadn’t before with photos of fans draped in American flags and decked out in red, white and blue shared across social media.\n\nAlmost 12 million viewers tuned into Fox Sports to watch the USMNT’s must-win match against Iran, making it the team’s most-watched group stage match at a men’s World Cup on US English language television, according to the broadcaster.\n\nMeanwhile, an average of more than three million viewers have watched the World Cup’s opening 31 matches, marking an increase of 44% since 2018, said Fox Sports.\n\n“We had a mission from the beginning. You know this four year journey changed the way the world views American soccer and I think with this tournament the performances that we put in I think we accomplished that,” said a tearful McKennie after the Netherlands defeat.\n\n“I’m very proud. We had a lot of doubts against us, many people thinking that we wouldn’t even make it out of the group. Obviously you know we didn’t want to be in this moment right now, not winning this game.\n\nLionel Messi of Argentina celebrates with teammates after scoring the first goal of the match against Australia on Saturday, December 3.

I think we’ll continue to do that.”\n\nThere are still some issues to address before 2026, evident before and exposed by the defeat to the Netherlands.\n\nThe USMNT scored just two goals during the group stage and mustered only one against the Netherlands, despite having seven attempts on target.\n\nIts defense, which had been so robust earlier in the tournament, conceded goals at key moments against the Netherlands – the first time the Dutch mounted a real attack, on the stroke of halftime, and just minutes after Haji Wright had scored to close the gap for the USMNT.\n\n“In the past three games, I’d say we defended the moments really, really well,” Adams said afterwards, according to ESPN. “And the three goals come from moments where we’re probably sleeping a little bit.”\n\nBut with another three years of preparation and another three years for its players to gain more experience, the USMNT can take plenty of positives from this tournament as it turns its focus towards a home World Cup in 2026.", "authors": ["Issy Ronald"], "publish_date": "2022/12/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/02/football/israeli-journalists-doha-mime-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Israeli journalists experience chilly reception at Qatar World Cup ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: A version of this story first appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here.\n\nJerusalem and Doha CNN —\n\nWhen special direct flights were announced from Tel Aviv to Doha for the FIFA World Cup, the scene at Ben Gurion airport was festive – the company chartering the flight brought out a cake festooned with Qatari and Israeli flags.\n\nBut Israeli reporters sent to cover the tournament say they’re experiencing a less than welcoming atmosphere.\n\nMoav Vardi, chief international correspondent for the Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation “KAN,” told CNN he was expecting some hostility from Palestinian and Arab fans – but not the level he has experienced in Qatar.\n\nMost Arab fans he tries to interview, Vardi says, will just turn away when they discover he is Israeli even if they had been having a friendly conversation beforehand. But a small and vocal minority is engaging in “violent verbal assaults,” Vardi said.\n\n“You are not welcome here, go away, there is only Palestine, there is no such thing as Israel, Israel does not exist,” Vardi said he’s told almost every day by football fans in Qatar.\n\nVardi said the impression he has gotten is that the “hatred and resentment” is not just about the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories. Rather “it’s about the very existence of Israel.”\n\nWhile he says he hasn’t felt physically threatened, KAN has removed its logo from his microphone, after he was recognized from encounters in Doha that had gone viral on social media.\n\nFormer Israeli football star, and now a commentator Eil Ohana posted a video showing a Qatari police officer driving him in a golf cart. After initially getting a shocked reaction from telling the policeman he is Israeli, he says instead that he was joking and that he is actually from Portugal. The police officer says he would have stopped the cart and kicked him off if the commentator was Israeli. When the commentator asked the driver why, he replied, “I’m Palestinian” and goes on to explain that Arabs cannot fly to Israel.\n\nVideos have gone viral in Israel and the Arab world showing football fans yelling at Israeli reporters, refusing to speak to them because of where they are from. Other videos show people hoisting Palestinian flags in the background of Israeli reporters’ live shots, taunting the reporters.\n\nWhile country flags are generally allowed at matches, clothing or banners with political statements – like LGBTQ rights or those supporting Iranian protesters – have at times led to fans being kicked out of stadiums. But some Arab attendees say the Palestinian cause, which Qatar officially supports, seems to be an exception – in one early match fans held up a giant Palestinian flag with the message “Free Palestine.”\n\nAccording to sources briefed on the matter, 8,000 Palestinians and 3,800 Israelis applied for World Cup tickets, although thousands more may have entered Qatar on secondary passports.\n\nIsrael and Qatar have no diplomatic relations – but under the FIFA rules, Israelis must be allowed to attend the tournament and a small, temporary Israeli consular team is in Doha to assist citizens, who have been advised by the Israeli foreign ministry to keep a low profile.\n\nOmar Barakat, the Palestinian national football team coach, told Reuters in Doha that he was encouraged to take Palestinian flags into matches. He said that he was only allowed by security to take an oversized flag into a stadium on revealing it to be a Palestinian flag. “It’s a political statement, and we’re proud of it,” he said.\n\nOn Wednesday, a football fan wearing a Tunisia shirt invaded the pitch with a Palestinian flag during a match between France and Tunisia. When he was apprehended by security personnel, crowds in the stand could be heard chanting “Palestine! Palestine!”\n\nFor Farah Hamam, a Palestinian-Jordanian football fan, some Arab fans’ refusal to engage with Israeli journalists reflects the Arab world’s frustration with “the continued atrocities taking place” against the Palestinian people. That was the “real sentiment” toward Israel “despite normalization efforts of Arab governments,” she told CNN.\n\n“For perhaps the first time in history, Arabs around the world are unapologetically showing their lack of patience with Israel,” she said.\n\nIsrael in recent years normalized relations with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco, a move that was seen as a major diplomatic feat for the nation and a way out of its regional isolation.\n\nTalal Hizami, a Saudi football fan at the World Cup, linked Arab attitudes toward Israelis in Doha to a pushback against Israel’s recognition by those states. “It’s a rejection of the normalization of Israel in the Middle East…. many Arab citizens see this as a betrayal,” he told CNN.\n\nHe said Israeli journalists may have mistakenly assumed that the normalization trend toward Israel in the Arab world “is a reflection of what the people of those nations feel towards them when in reality, many are extremely angered by it.”\n\nQatar’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and its Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC), the tournament organizers, didn’t respond to CNN’s requests for comment on the treatment of Israeli reporters or the display of political symbols at the World Cup.\n\nReacting to how he says he was treated by Arabs in Doha, Raz Shechnick, a reporter for the Israeli Yediot Ahronoth newspaper, posted a long Twitter thread in Hebrew about his experience, saying “I was always a centrist, liberal and open [with] a will to make peace above all. I always thought the problem was governments, the rulers, ours too. But, in Qatar I came to realize how hatred is present with people on the street. How much they want to wipe us off the face of the earth. To what extent everything related to Israel arouses intense hatred in them.”\n\nRoy Jankelowitz, a correspondent for the IsraelSport website, said he has not had as many problems in Doha but that he does not “go around walking with a microphone in Hebrew.”\n\n“As an Israeli, I understand that there may be a problem over here for people to accept that Israelis are here because of the fact that they do not know much about Israel. All they see is what the media, the local Arab media reports to them about Israel,” he told CNN. “All they see is, when they see something in Hebrew they think it is something bad.”\n\nJankelowitz said he’s taken the Israeli Foreign Ministry advice to all Israeli attendees to keep a low profile and does not necessarily tell fans he is from Israel unless he feels it is safe to do so.\n\n“You have to understand that you’re in an Arab country and not everybody likes you,” he said.\n\nBut not all Arabs in Doha agree that the football tournament is an appropriate place to show support for Palestinians. Munser Al Shibly a fan from Libya at the World Cup, told CNN it was “nice” to see fans support Palestinians but added that football should be “separate from politics… even if it’s the Palestinian cause.”\n\nVardi, the Israeli KAN reporter, said despite some hostility, he’s also had some fascinating interactions – like after being recognized while watching a match and being told to “go away” by one fan, a different fan from Saudi Arabia sitting near him turned and said, “Oh Israel? Why don’t you get rid of Iran for us please.”\n\nWith additional reporting by Nadeen Ebrahim, Celine Alkhaldi, Zeena Saifi and Mariam Dirar Alqasem.\n\nThe digest\n\nIranian security forces kill anti-government protester celebrating World Cup defeat, rights group says\n\nA man is reported to have been killed by security forces in northern Iran during public celebrations by anti-government protesters following the national football team’s defeat against the United States on Tuesday.\n\nBackground: Several videos were posted on social media Tuesday night showing people in cities across Iran, including in the capital Tehran, celebrating inside their homes and residential buildings after the US defeated Iran 1-0 in the World Cup. Demonstrations have rocked Iran for more than two months, sparking a deadly clampdown by authorities.\n\nWhy it matters: Football has become the latest arena for pro- and anti-regime Iranians to express their views. A source told CNN earlier that the families of Iran’s team had been threatened with imprisonment and torture if players failed to “behave” after they refrained from singing the country’s national anthem in an earlier game. Some Iranian activists had accused the players of whitewashing the government’s crimes.\n\nUS tells Turkey it opposes new military operation in Syria\n\nUnited States Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told his Turkish counterpart Wednesday that his country strongly opposes a new military operation in Syria and that he was concerned about Turkish airstrikes that threatened US personnel in the region.\n\nBackground: On Tuesday, the Pentagon said the US has reduced the number of patrols with the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) against ISIS in Syria as the SDF has said an invasion by Turkey seems “imminent.” It said the US has not redeployed forces in the region and has “no diminished capability” in the region.\n\nWhy it matters: Turkey has been warning for months about a potential incursion into Syria targeting Kurdish groups it opposes there. Both Russia and the US have stakes in the country. Last week, a Turkish airstrike against a base in northern Syria used by the US-led coalition to defeat ISIS threatened the safety of US personnel working in the area. The US has approximately 900 troops in Syria.\n\nISIS acknowledges the death of its leader, announces his successor\n\nISIS affiliate al-Furqan media published an audio message by the jihadist group’s spokesman announcing the death of its leader, who was appointed in March. It didn’t make clear who killed the group commander or where. ISIS announced his successor, who goes by the name Abu al-Husain al-Husaini al-Quraishi. Little is known about him, but the group described him as an “old fighter” without providing further details. Syria’s army took credit for his killing, Reuters cited state media as saying.\n\nBackground: The deceased leader was appointed by ISIS in March 2022 after US President Joe Biden announced the death of Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi in a military operation in the northwest of Syria.\n\nWhy it matters: Analysts have said that ISIS is in disarray. If the Syrian regime’s claims are true, the killing would a rare occasion where a top ISIS leader has been killed in a non-US-led operation.\n\nWhat to watch\n\nQatar’s Energy Minister Saad Al Kaabi told CNN’s Becky Anderson on Wednesday the country will not let politics affect business after it signed a deal to provide Germany with 2 million tons of LNG annually, starting in 2026.\n\nThis comes amid heightened tensions with Germany, which ramped up its criticism of Qatar ahead of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, questioning its human rights record and later opposing the Gulf country’s ban on the rainbow-colored armband.\n\nWatch the interview here:\n\nFootball isn’t the only story in Qatar, there’s big news off the pitch too.

World Cup 2026 will be like '80 Super Bowls,' FIFA ...", "text": "NEW YORK — FIFA president Gianni Infantino playfully warned this part of the world does not really know what’s coming in 2026.\n\n\"We often say it's like 64 Super Bowls, in terms of audience, right?\" Infantino said. “World Cup 26 is 80 Super Bowls, 80 incredible games, 80 finals.\n\nThursday's official announcement of the 16 host cities for the joint 2026 men’s World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico, shed a little light on what’s to come and where people will convene.\n\nRELATED: Costa Rica going to 2022 World Cup after defeating New Zealand\n\n\"These three countries will be upside down, flipped back again,\" Infantino said during an event to reveal the hosts. \"The world will be invading Canada, Mexico and the United States. They will be invaded by a big wake of joy and happiness.\"\n\nHe added 2026 will be \"much bigger\" than the last time the United States hosted the World Cup in 1994.\n\nFIFA and Concacaf — the Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football — narrowed 22 finalist locations to 16 cities that will host games in 2026.\n\nThat includes 11 U.S. cities: Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, Houston, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, New York/New Jersey, Philadelphia, San Francisco Bay Area and Seattle.\n\nThere will be three host cities in Mexico: Guadalajara, Mexico City and Monterrey; and two in Canada: Toronto and Vancouver.\n\nOne of the biggest surprises was Washington, DC not making the list. It will be only the second time in the men’s tournament history that a host nation's capital does not host a game. Bonn was the other capital city snubbed when West Germany held the competition in 1974. (In 2002, when Japan and South Korea held the tournament, the closest game to Tokyo was in Yokohama — a suburb of the city.)\n\nMISSED OPPORTUNITY: Why Nashville lost bid to host 2026 FIFA World Cup\n\n\"This was a very, very difficult choice,\" FIFA chief tournaments and events officer Colin Smith said. \"You can't imagine a World Cup coming to the U.S. and the capital city not taking a major role as well. So, we'll be engaging with all the cities that weren't chosen to host matches. There's still lots of other areas of cooperation and working together and celebration.\n\n\"We know what a fan fest on the National Mall would be like (on the) 250th anniversary of the U.S.A. on the Fourth of July.\"\n\nInfantino confirmed a fan fest will still be held in D.C., which combined its bid with Baltimore in April 2022 in an attempt to strengthen its hosting chances.\n\nUnited States Soccer Federation president Cindy Parlow Cone didn’t want to focus on the cities not selected Thursday, but rather celebrate the ones that will host games.\n\n\"This is an exciting day, right? One that we have been waiting for a long, long time to announce who are going to be the host cities,\" Parlow Cone said. \"And look, our nation's capital is very much going to be a huge part of this World Cup, even though they're not hosting games.\"\n\nAnd there will be another chance, if the U.S. hosts the women’s World Cup in 2027 or 2031. Parlow Cone said U.S. Soccer plans to bid for those tournaments, but is waiting on further guidance from FIFA.\n\nThe 1994 World Cup holds the record for highest attendance. About 3.58 million spectators watched, with an average match attendance of 68,991, according to U.S. Soccer.\n\nBoston, Dallas and San Francisco hosted games in 1994 and will again in 2026. But Los Angeles, Atlanta and New York could really compete for record crowds based on stadium capacities and their appeal as international hubs.\n\n\"This is really a luxury problem that we have (selecting a location for the final) that is probably unique to this part of the world.\" Infantino said. \"We have cities here that are not just important cities in America, but global capitals.\"\n\nIn Los Angeles County, matches will be held at the splashy SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, which opened in 2020 to the tune of $5.5 billion. The venue has a 70,000-person capacity and is home to the NFL's Los Angeles Rams and Chargers. It also hosted the most recent Super Bowl in February.\n\nThe LA metropolitan area is no stranger to record soccer crowds. The Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California hosted the 1999 women’s World Cup final in front of 90,185 people. The attendance set the world record for a women’s sporting event for nearly 23 years.\n\nThe record was broken this year. In March, 91,553 fans packed Camp Nou in Barcelona to watch the UEFA Women's Champions League quarterfinal between FC Barcelona and Real Madrid.\n\nMercedes-Benz Stadium has also become a soccer hub. The Atlanta venue has superb appeal thanks to an investment from owner Arthur Blank. Major League Soccer’s Atlanta United has experienced early success by winning the MLS Cup in 2018 in its second season.\n\nAtlanta United holds the league's attendance records for a regular-season match (72,035, March 2018 vs. D.C. United), MLS All-Star game (72,317, August 2018 vs. Juventus) and for single-game attendance (73,018, December 2018 vs. Portland Timbers for the 2018 MLS Cup final). It also owns a Campeones Cup record (40,128, August 2019 vs. Club América).\n\nNew York/New Jersey is a host with a particular edge at nabbing the 2026 World Cup final because MetLife Stadium, home of the NFL’s New York Giants/Jets has a capacity of 82,500.\n\nBut the location for the culmination of the tournament has not yet been determined.\n\n\"We haven't even started that process,\" Concacaf president Vittorio Montagliani said. \"We've been laboring at the last four years of venue visits to get to this point. There'll be a whole other process to pick — and it's not just the final, there's a lot of big matches, knockout matches and the opening match.\"\n\nFIFA and Concacaf will have to consider multiple factors, including the impact of travel across an entire continent, with multiple time zones and weather conditions.\n\nThe 2026 World Cup will be the first hosted by three countries.

But just two days before researchers were set to leave the island, Jordan Boersma, postdoctoral researcher at Cornell Lab of Ornithology and co-leader of the expedition team, was going through camera footage when he was \"stunned\" to see the bird walking right past the camera.\n\n“After a month of searching, seeing those first photos of the pheasant-pigeon felt like finding a unicorn,\" John C. Mittermeier, director of the lost-birds program at American Bird Conservancy, said in a statement. \"It is the kind of moment you dream about your entire life as a conservationist and birdwatcher.\"\n\nThe discovery comes after some members of the research team tried to find the bird in 2019 but could not find any traces of it.\n\nThe researchers credited their success to local hunter Augustin Gregory, who had told them he had seen the ground-dwelling bird in an area with steep ridges and valleys and heard its calls.\n\nThe team then went into a dense forest area of the island, where they placed a camera on a 3,200-foot- high ridge near a river, where the image was captured.\n\nSerena Ketaloya, a conservationist from Milne Bay, Papua New Guinea, said local communities were \"very excited\" at the news because many people hadn't seen or didn't know about the bird until the research team arrived on the island.\n\n'No one has ever seen one on Cape Cod':Rare bird sighting a sensation in Massachusetts\n\nMeet the one-of-a-kind 'tanabeak': Researchers identify new songbird hybrid in Pennsylvania\n\nNot much is known about the black-naped pheasant-pigeon.

The team hopes to return to Fergusson Island to check the species' population.\n\n\"The reason I care, why I think we should all care, is that this bird has meant something and continues to mean something to the local people,\" Boersma said. \"It’s part of their legends and culture.

Security camera footage captured the mountain lion emerging from the bushes onto a residential street and pouncing on Piper, a chihuahua mix.\n\nPiper was one of two dogs – both on leashes – being walked by an unnamed dog walker, according to KTLA. “I felt the tug and I heard Piper squeal,” the dogwalker told KTLA. “I turn around and I just saw a face. I didn’t know what it was.”\n\n“It was like a two- or three-second struggle,” said the man. “He had Piper in his mouth. He didn’t growl at all. I didn’t even hear him. I never had a chance.”\n\nThe National Park Service told CNN in an email that, based on video footage and tracking data, the mountain lion that killed the chihuahua was P-22, one of several mountain lions that the agency tracks with GPS collars.\n\nP-22 is an 11-year old male mountain lion weighing around 123 pounds, according to the National Park Service website. He spends most of his time within Griffith Park.\n\nAnd this isn’t the first time P-22 has made headlines: The mountain lion was also suspected to have killed a koala at the Los Angeles Zoo in 2016, the agency said.\n\nThe park service told CNN they were not aware of any other incidents involving mountain lions attacking leashed pets in the Los Angeles area, although studies have identified similar incidents in other cities.\n\nThe agency noted that the attack occurred after sunset, when big cats are most active, and that mountain lions are “opportunistic hunters.” P-22 is still actively hunting deer, coyotes and other more typical mountain lion prey, they added.\n\n“There is no evidence that preying on pets is related to an increased chance of an attack on a person, either in mountain lions, or in other urban carnivores such as coyotes,” the service said in an emailed statement to CNN. “Mountain lion attacks on humans are exceedingly rare, although they do occur.”\n\nThey advised pet owners to keep their pets inside and stay alert when outside. If you encounter a mountain lion while walking your pet, you should keep the pet close, make yourself large, make noises and not run, the park service said.\n\nDaniel Jimenez, Piper’s owner, told KTLA he is “devastated” by the loss of his dog. “My wife and I got Piper in 2014,” said Jimenez. “We rescued her and she was just the sweetest dog.”\n\nJimenez told KTLA that he doesn’t blame the mountain lion, but wants other pet owners to use caution when walking their pets, especially after dark.\n\n“I don’t want anything bad to happen to P-22,” he said. “I just want people to be safe out there so that nothing like this happens again.”\n\nThere are around 100 mountain lions, also called cougars, pumas, or catamounts, that make their home in the Santa Monica Mountains, according to the National Park Service. The big cats are threatened due to habitat fragmentation from roads and other developments, which lead to vehicle collisions and increased inbreeding as they are unable to move freely in and out of their area.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story incorrectly identified KTLA as a CNN affiliate.", "authors": ["Zoe Sottile"], "publish_date": "2022/11/20"}]}

Naomi Biden, Biden’s oldest granddaughter, married Peter Neal on the White House South Lawn on Saturday.\n\nOne day following the nuptials, Biden will mark his spot in American history as the only octogenarian president, a numerical milestone that shines a spotlight on a primary issue plaguing Biden with his opponents: his age. Despite a spate of recent wins – better-than-projected midterm elections for Democrats, a relatively gaffe-less trip to Egypt and Asia, and a lackluster presidential announcement from his old rival, Donald Trump – Biden cannot shake being the oldest commander-in-chief America has ever had.\n\nBut a glossy wedding of two twenty-somethings, kicking off a fresh life chapter with music and dancing and revelry, could put a youthful spin on the 80th birthday weekend. Two people familiar with the planning of the wedding say it was not a coincidence Naomi Biden’s wedding weekend coincides with the president’s day – noting the “age issue” is never something Biden wants to highlight.\n\n“The wedding gives some cover,” says one of the people.\n\nThe wedding, which CNN is told includes the extended Biden clan on the guest list, as well as friends and family of the couple, also marks a kickoff of sorts for the tight-knit Bidens to begin earnest discussions over whether Joe Biden should run for a second term.\n\nShortly after the wedding, Jill Biden and Joe Biden will travel to Nantucket, Massachusetts, for the Thanksgiving holiday; Christmas follows quickly on its heels, as the clock ticks toward Biden’s need to say whether he will be in for 2024, or out. Both the president and the first lady have said they will weigh the pros and cons of a second run, something Biden has previously said he “intends” to undertake.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden attend the wedding of Peter Neal and Naomi Biden Neal, Saturday, November 19, 2022 on the South Lawn. Adam Schultz/White House\n\nA family affair\n\nThe wedding itself consists of three parts, a person familiar with the planning told CNN. The ceremony, which was set to begin at approximately 11:15 am ET and ended at 11:50 am, took place on the South Lawn – a location that hadn’t previously been used for a White House wedding. There was no tent, the source had confirmed earlier, which made for a chilly outdoor morning, with the temperature at 39 degrees. Guests arrived early Saturday morning to the White House complex, where they were all administered Covid-19 tests, two people familiar told CNN. They were given blankets and shawls at their seats to keep warm.\n\nPresident Joe Biden celebrates his 80th birthday, blowing out the candle on his coconut birthday cake with first lady Jill Biden, Naomi Biden, her husband Peter Neal and other Biden grandchildren on Sunday, November 20, 2022. Flotus/Instagram\n\nAccording to two people familiar with the wedding details, the bride’s parents, Hunter Biden and Kathleen Buhle, walked her down the aisle. As Naomi Biden walked down the aisle, the band played “Bitter Sweet Symphony” by The Verve. The bride wore a long-sleeved gown with a veil and train, designed by Ralph Lauren, the same sources said.\n\nJoe Biden escorted Neal’s two grandmothers – Paulita Neal and Betty Thum – down the aisle to their seats, a source said. The president then turned back and did a “classic Biden jog” up the aisle, according to the source, to meet the first lady and walk her down the aisle to their seats.\n\nThe program, which was seen by CNN, listed Naomi’s sister Finnegan James Biden as her maid of honor and her sister Roberta Mabel Biden, also known as Maisy, and Katherine Elizabeth Neal as bridesmaids. The groom’s best man was his brother Robert Eliot Neal, and groomsmen were listed as Joseph Robinette Biden IV and Charles W. Gerdts.\n\nPeter’s father, Dr. William Neal, who was accompanied by vocalists, sang a song during the ceremony, the source said. There was also a reading of the poem “I Carry Your Heart With Me” by E.E. Cummings, which was read by Amy D’Amato.\n\nThe bride and groom wrote their own vows for the ceremony, according to the source.\n\n“It has been a joy to watch Naomi grow, discover who she is, and carve out such an incredible life for herself,” the president and first lady said in a statement released by the White House on Saturday. “Now, we are filled with pride to see her choose Peter as her husband and we’re honored to welcome him to our family. We wish them days full of laughter and a love that grows deeper with every passing year.”\n\nNotable attendees included former Sens. Chris Dodd of Connecticut and Ted Kaufman of Delaware, and Secretary of State Tony Blinken and his wife, Evan Ryan, who has served as White House Cabinet secretary.\n\nFollowing the exchange of vows, a smaller, family-and-wedding-party-only luncheon took place in the White House.\n\nThe celebration continued Saturday night, with approximately 325 guests – more than attended the ceremony – invited to the White House for dancing and dessert. The black-tie reception began at approximately 7:30 pm ET and was scheduled to end at midnight.\n\nThe president and first lady mingled with guests, according to two people in attendance who spoke to CNN under the condition of anonymity to protect relationships. Guests were asked to relinquish their cell phones, the sources said.\n\nA massive, seven-tier wedding cake was positioned in the Blue Room, and Naomi Biden and her husband Peter Neal used a small ladder to climb up and cut into an upper tier. Guests were given slices of the cake as parting gifts – a tradition that Tricia Nixon, Lynda Johnson and Luci Johnson all did at their White House receptions.\n\nDessert stations were set up in the State Dining Room, and a large band was playing on a stage erected in the East Room.\n\nThe bride wore a strapless Reem Acra dress, according to the two people; she was also scheduled to change into a second party dress later in the evening.\n\nThe grandchild closest – literally – to her grandfather\n\nIn a way, Naomi Biden, 28, experienced a White House wedding thanks in large part to her own gumption. Biden, an associate at the Washington, DC, law firm Arnold & Porter, pushed her grandfather to run the first time.\n\nThough the patriarch, Joe Biden has always included his larger family circle, including his five oldest grandchildren when weighing life choices. His sensitivity to their feelings, and the invasive nature of a nasty political battle weigh heavy on his mind.\n\n“I don’t think there’s been any decision, no matter how big or small, that we haven’t decided as a family,” said Naomi Biden in a video interview played at the 2020 Democratic National Convention.\n\nThough typically called by the elder Biden family members, it was Naomi Biden who convened the most critical, in-person, all-hands-on-deck family meeting, the one that would have the most impact on Joe Biden’s future. Biden was concerned – they, however, were not.\n\n“He thought we were calling a meeting sort of to discuss whether or not we wanted him to [run,] but really were calling it to be like, ‘Get in that race! Hurry up!’” said Naomi Biden. In the years since, it has been Naomi who has been most publicly vocal on her social media channels about Democratic issues, and championing her grandfather. On November 12, she tweeted, “Democracy wins in the Senate. Never think your vote doesn’t matter.”\n\nNaomi is also the grandchild closest – literally – to her grandparents. She and Neal, 25, a recent University of Pennsylvania Law School graduate who works at Georgetown University Law Center on National Security, moved into the White House last August, a person familiar with the living arrangements tells CNN.\n\nThe close proximity to the couple’s wedding site only increased their involvement in the planning. Jill Biden was primarily the person involved in the wedding planning, CNN is told, working with wedding planner Bryan Rafanelli, founder of Rafanelli Events. Rafanelli is no stranger to whipping up fantastical parties at the White House; he oversaw seven State Dinners during Barack Obama’s presidency, including the final of the administration for Italy, which included a tent with a glass ceiling on the South Lawn and a performance by Gwen Stefani.\n\nHe also planned and orchestrated the wedding of Chelsea Clinton in 2010.\n\nA Rafanelli-produced wedding is not an inexpensive endeavor. The price tag for many of his events starts at around $300,000 and can go into the millions of dollars. “Consistent with other private events hosted by the First Family and following the traditions of previous White House wedding festivities in prior Administrations, the Biden family will be paying for the wedding activities that occur at the White House,” Jill Biden’s communications director, Elizabeth Alexander, told CNN.\n\nNaomi Biden’s parents, who divorced in 2017, have each written memoirs about struggles in their relationship, many of which involved Hunter Biden’s yearslong struggle with addiction.\n\nNeal’s family is from Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where the couple was engaged in September 2021. (The engagement ring includes the band of Neal’s grandmother’s engagement ring and was designed by a DC jeweler, a person with knowledge of its construction told CNN.)\n\nPresident Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden attend the wedding of Peter Neal and Naomi Biden Neal on Saturday, November 19, 2022, on the South Lawn of the White House.

Reuters In pictures: A history of White House weddings Prev Next\n\nThe social event of the White House this year\n\nNaomi Biden’s choice of a Ralph Lauren as the designer of her wedding dress was not a total surprise; several fashion insiders previously contacted by CNN had speculated that the job had gone to Lauren, perhaps the most iconic American fashion designer alive today.\n\nJoe Biden is partial to Lauren’s suits, having worn one on Inauguration Day, and Jill Biden has also been photographed wearing the label. In March, Naomi and her sister Finnegan, 23, and Neal, attended Ralph Lauren’s Fall 2022 fashion show in New York City, which sparked most of the chatter that she will wear the designer for at least one of her wedding looks. The White House did not comment on the dress speculation, but two people familiar told CNN the bride would wear two different wedding looks, one for the ceremony and one for the reception.\n\nDespite several protestations from the White House Correspondents’ Association, asking that media coverage be allowed as the wedding is taking place at the people’s house, the White House was adamant that the bride and groom wanted privacy for their nuptials.\n\nFloral garlands of white roses and other blooms were hung from the Truman Balcony, and woven along the staircases down to the South Lawn; large matching wreaths and a floral arch surround the entrance to the Diplomatic Room. It is only the 19th wedding to ever take place at the White House, the last one was for Obama’s chief photographer, Pete Souza, who in 2013 was married in the Rose Garden.\n\nThe last presidential daughter to celebrate a wedding at the White House was Jenna Bush in June 2008. Bush held her wedding and reception months prior at the Bush family’s Texas ranch, but her father, George W. Bush, hosted approximately 600 guests at the White House for his daughter’s second reception.\n\nBut the scope and scale of the Biden wedding most correlates with that of Luci Johnson, who held her reception in the East Room after marrying Patrick Nugent, and Lynda Johnson, who in 1967 married Charles Robb in the East Room of the White House. Tricia Nixon in June 1971 married Edward Finch Cox under a flower-laden white gazebo erected in the Rose Garden. All of these weddings were media catnip, with newspapers printing the recipes for the 6-feet tall wedding cakes.\n\nPieces of the Johnson daughters’ and Nixon’s cakes were sent to the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.

There was also the lukewarm political support his slightly younger predecessor, Donald Trump, received when he announced his recent decision to run for president in 2024.\n\nBut Biden has not been able to shake voters’ apprehensions about his age, with rhetorical gaffes and literal stumbles at times reinforcing concerns about his health and mental acuity.\n\nBiden would be an unprecedented 86 years old by the end of his second term if he were to run and win his reelection. By comparison, some of the oldest past living presidents still had years on Biden – Trump left office at the age of 74 and Ronald Reagan left office after his two terms at 77 years old.\n\nThe president, for his part, maintains that voters concerned about his age should see his record of accomplishments since taking office.\n\n“Well, they’re concerned about whether or not I can get anything done. Look what I’ve gotten done,” Biden told CNN’s Jake Tapper in October. “Name me a president in recent history that’s gotten done as much as I have in their first two years.”\n\nBiden said last month that while he has not made a formal decision about running for reelection in 2024, it is his “intention” to do so. But he’s long said it’s a decision both he and his family will decide on together. And Saturday’s wedding marks a kickoff of sorts for the tight-knit Bidens to begin earnest discussions over whether their patriarch should seek a second term.\n\nAnd the president isn’t the only Washington power reckoning with pressures to bow out.

Former president to celebrate ...", "text": "Associated Press\n\nATLANTA — Jimmy Carter, already the longest-living U.S. president in history, will celebrate his 98th birthday Saturday with family and friends in Plains, the tiny Georgia town where he and his wife, 95-year-old Rosalynn, were born in the years between World War I and the Great Depression.\n\nThe 39th president’s latest milestone comes as The Carter Center, which the Carters established together after their one White House term, marks 40 years of promoting democracy and conflict resolution, monitoring elections, and advancing public health in the developing world.\n\nJason Carter, the former president's grandson now leading the Carter Center board, described his grandfather, an outspoken Christian, as content with his life and legacy.\n\n“He is looking at his 98th birthday with faith in God’s plan for him,” the younger Carter, 47, said, “and that’s just a beautiful blessing for all of us to know, personally, that he is at peace and happy with where he has been and where he’s going.”\n\nCarter Center leaders said the former president, who survived a cancer diagnosis in 2015 and a serious fall at home in 2019, already has enjoyed reading congratulatory messages sent by well-wishers around the world via social media and the center's website. But Jason Carter said his grandfather is mostly looking forward to a simple day that includes watching his favorite Major League Baseball team, the Atlanta Braves, on television.\n\n“He’s still 100% with it, even though daily life things are a lot harder now,” Jason Carter said. “But one thing I guarantee. He will watch all the Braves games this weekend.”\n\nJames Earl Carter Jr. won the 1976 presidential election after beginning the campaign as a little-known one-term Georgia governor. His surprise performance in the Iowa caucuses established the small, Midwestern state as an epicenter of presidential politics. Carter went on to defeat President Gerald Ford in the general election, largely on the strength of sweeping the South before his native region shifted heavily to Republicans.\n\nAre people listening?:Elton John, more stars return to the White House under Biden\n\nA Naval Academy alumnus, Navy officer and peanut farmer, Carter won in no small part because of his promise never to lie to an electorate weary over the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal that resulted in Richard Nixon’s resignation from the presidency in 1974. Four years later, unable to tame inflation and salve voter anger over American hostages held in Iran, Carter lost 44 states to Ronald Reagan. He returned home to Georgia in 1981 at the age of 56.\n\nThe former first couple almost immediately began planning The Carter Center. It opened in Atlanta in 1982 as a first-of-its-kind effort for a former president. The stated mission: to advance peace, human rights and public health causes around the world. Carter won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002. He traveled internationally into his 80s and 90s, and he did not retire officially from the board until 2020.\n\nSince opening, the center has monitored elections in 113 countries, said CEO Paige Alexander, and Carter has acted individually as a mediator in many countries, as well. Carter Center efforts have nearly eradicated the guinea worm, a parasite spread through unclean drinking water and painful to humans. Rosalynn Carter has steered programs designed to reduce stigma attached to mental health conditions.\n\n“He’s enjoying his retirement,” said Alexander, who assumed her role in 2020, about the time Jason Carter took over for his grandfather. But “he spends a lot of time thinking about the projects that he started and the projects that we’re continuing.”\n\nIan soaks the Carolinas:Ian's death toll likely to grow as crews sift through destruction in Florida: Live updates\n\nAlexander cited the guinea worm eradication effort as a highlight. Carter set the goal in 1986, when there were about 3.5 million cases annually across 21 countries, with a concentration in sub-Saharan Africa. So far this year, Alexander said, there are six known cases in two countries.\n\nIn 2019, Carter used his final annual message at the center to lament that his post-presidency had been largely silent on climate change. Jason Carter said the center's leadership is still exploring ways to combat the climate crisis. But he offered no timetable. “We won't duplicate other effective efforts,” Carter said, explaining that one of the center's strategic principles is to prioritize causes and places that no other advocacy organizations have engaged.\n\nOn elections and democracy, perhaps the most unpredictable turn is that Jimmy Carter has lived to see the center turn its efforts to the home front. The center now has programs to combat mistrust in the democratic process in the United States. Carter Center personnel monitored Georgia's recount of U.S. presidential ballots in the state in 2020 after then-President Donald Trump argued the outcome was rigged. Multiple recounts in Georgia and other states affirmed the legitimacy of Joe Biden’s victory.\n\n“Certainly, we never thought we would end up coming home to do democracy and conflict resolution around our elections,” Jason Carter said. “(But) we couldn’t go be this incredible democracy and human rights organization overseas without ensuring that we were adding our voice and our expertise ... in the U.S.”\n\nAhead of the U.S. midterm elections, the center has asked candidates -- regardless of party -- to sign onto a set of fair election principles, including committing to the peaceful transfer of power. Among those who have signed commitments: Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, and his Democratic challenger Stacey Abrams.\n\nCarter himself has mostly retreated from politics. For years after his 1980 defeat, Democrats steered clear of him. He enjoyed a resurgence in recent election cycles, drawing visits from several 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls and, in 2021, from President Joe Biden, who in 1976 was the first U.S. senator to endorse Carter’s presidential bid. With inflation now at its highest levels since the late 1970s and early 1980s, some Republicans are bringing up Carter again as an attack line on Biden and Democrats.\n\nJason Carter said the former president reads and watches the news daily, and sometimes accepts calls or visits from political figures. But, he added, the former president isn’t expected to appear publicly to endorse any candidates ahead of November.\n\n“His people that he feels sort of the closest connection with now are the folks in Plains, at his church and other places,” Jason Carter said. “But, you know, his partner No. 1, 2 and 3 is my grandma, right? He has outlived friends and so many of his advisers and the people that he accomplished so much with in the past, but they’ve never been lonely because they’ve always had each other.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/10/01/former-president-jimmy-carter-celebrates-96th-birthday/5877397002/", "title": "Former President Jimmy Carter celebrates 96th birthday", "text": "Bill Barrow\n\nAssociated Press\n\nATLANTA — Former President Jimmy Carter marks his 96th birthday Thursday, the latest milestone for the longest lived of the 44 men to hold the highest American office.\n\nCarter planned to celebrate at his home in Plains, Georgia, with his wife of 74 years, Rosalynn Carter, according to a spokeswoman for the Carter Center in Atlanta.\n\nThe 39th president, in office from 1977-81, has largely receded from public view amid the coronavirus pandemic and his own health challenges due to a series of falls in 2019. He previously survived a dire cancer diagnosis in 2015. Yet Carter remains a quiet force in politics at home and, through his post-presidential Center, in public health and human rights advocacy around the world.\n\nCarter on Tuesday endorsed his fellow Democrat, the Rev. Raphael Warnock, in one of two competitive Georgia U.S. Senate races this fall. Carter’s announcement aligned him with another former president, Barack Obama, and other party power brokers in backing Warnock over Democrat Matt Lieberman, whose father was the party’s 2000 nominee for vice president.\n\nThough Carter remained neutral in Democrats’ 2020 presidential primary he fielded calls and visits from multiple candidates. Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter, now 93, recorded audio addresses for Democrats’ virtual national convention urging the election of nominee Joe Biden, who was a young senator from Delaware when Jimmy Carter won the presidency in 1976.\n\n'He was a kindred spirit':Bob Dylan talks friendship with Jimmy Carter in 'Rock & Roll President' documentary\n\n“Joe Biden was my first and most effective supporter in the Senate,” Carter told the convention. “For decades, he’s been my loyal and dedicated friend.”\n\nCarter also gained new attention recently upon death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Carter is the only president since 1850 not to make a single Supreme Court nomination, but he reshaped the lower courts with a record number of nominations of women and non-white jurists, Ginsburg being the most notable.\n\nIn 1980, Carter tapped Ginsburg, then the nation’s most accomplished civil rights attorney, for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, considered the nation’s second highest court. She was the second woman Carter nominated for the D.C. Circuit, setting her up for a promotion to Supreme Court 13 years later.\n\n“He looked around at the federal judiciary and he said, ‘You all look like me, but that’s not how the great United States looks,’” Ginsburg said to a Fordham University Law School forum in 2016.\n\nPerhaps most notable among Carter’s 2020 election maneuvering is the Carter Center for the first time designating the United States as a “backsliding” democracy. The Center announced after the Democratic convention that it would devote resources to ensuring free and fair U.S. elections this fall. The Carters founded the Center in 1982, two years after he lost his re-election bid to Republican Ronald Reagan.\n\nJimmy and Rosalynn Carter:Longest-married presidential couple celebrate 74th anniversary\n\nThe Center has monitored more than 110 elections in 39 countries since 1989, but it was a striking development for the institution to turn its focus to Carter’s home country, the world’s leading democratic superpower since World War II. The development comes as President Donald Trump repeatedly casts doubt on the integrity of the U.S. voting system, regularly firing off a cascade of mistruths about the voting process and asserting that the system is “rigged” against him.\n\nAs recently as a Tuesday night debate against Biden, Trump refused to say he’d accept the results and said he’d urged his supporters “to go into the polls and watch very carefully, because that’s what has to happen.”\n\nExplaining the decision to monitor a U.S. election, a Carter Center statement said “backsliding” democracies are “often characterized by polarization, a lack of public trust, ethnic or racial divisions and injustice, and fears that election results won’t be seen as credible or could trigger violence.”\n\nCarter has not recently addressed Trump’s statements directly and, according to a spokeswoman, is not granting interviews ahead of the election. But Carter said last September during his last annual town hall at the Carter Center that it would “be a disaster to have four more years of Trump.”\n\nMore:Jimmy Carter's pastor picked to lead Trump's prisoner reentry effort\n\nSiding with Biden over Trump isn’t surprising for a Democratic former president, but it does involve Carter ignoring one of his own recent observations about the presidency. Weeks before his 95th birthday last year, Carter alluded to the advanced ages of several candidates at the time. Trump, 74, would be the oldest president ever inaugurated for a second term. Biden, 77, would the oldest sitting president in history, reaching 82 near the end of a prospective first term.\n\n“I hope there’s an age limit,” Carter said jovially at his town hall when asked whether he’d run again. Then he turned more serious: “If I were just 80 years old, if I was 15 years younger, I don’t believe I could undertake the duties I experienced when I was president.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/10/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2021/12/31/betty-white-dies-celebrities-mourn-legendary-star-reactions/9063701002/", "title": "Betty White dead: 'SNL,' Robert Redford, Anderson Cooper mourn", "text": "Staff reports\n\nThe entertainment world is sharing its shock and grief at the loss of Hollywood legend Betty White, who died Friday at 99.

In a statement on Thursday, Biden urged the United States to “remain vigilant against this pandemic and do everything we can to save as many lives as possible.”\n\nCovid-19 cases have been trending up in almost every state; the country is now averaging more than 70,000 new cases per day, according to Johns Hopkins University. Pediatric cases are on the rise too – up 69% from two weeks ago, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n\nEven hospitalizations, a lagging indicator, have been increasing slowly: They’re up in more than half of states (including most of the Northeast and Midwest) compared with last week and as of Thursday morning stand at more than 20,000 – levels last seen at the end of March.\n\nThe White House is warning that if Congress doesn’t provide additional resources for testing, treatments and vaccines, the country will be ill-prepared for a surge this fall or winter, when it says the country could see 100 million new Covid-19 infections. That’s just one possibility for the seasons ahead, and the White House hasn’t released specific modeling to support that number. But if it happens, that’s almost a third of the entire US population. For context, seasonal flu causes illness in 9 to 41 million Americans – that’s 3% to 11% of the population – every year, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAnd even Fauci felt the need to clarify his earlier remarks. “We’re not over the pandemic. Don’t let anybody get the misinterpretation that the pandemic is over, but what we are in is a different phase of the pandemic,” he said in a telephone interview with CNN a few days after his original comments.\n\n“A phase that’s a transition phase, hopefully headed toward more of a control where you can actually get back to some form of normality without total disruption of society, economically, socially, school-wise, et cetera,” he said.\n\nSo which is it: Are we headed back to life as usual or are we headed toward another wave of infections?\n\nAbsolute numbers vs. trendlines\n\nI want to return to the analogy of the country as my patient, as I have done several times during the pandemic.\n\nIf I had to describe the current situation, I’d say it’s like my patient has checked out of the hospital – a bit weak, still being monitored carefully and receiving outpatient care.\n\nAnd now, as the rising case numbers indicate, they’ve spiked a fever, developed a sore throat and are starting to feel all-around miserable.\n\nThe big question is, will they get better with time, or is this a harbinger of more bad things to come?\n\nWhile it’s true that the numbers are nowhere near as dire as they were with the Delta or original Omicron surges – which saw an average of more than 166,000 and more than 807,000 daily new cases at their respective peaks – these insidious increases in cases and hospitalizations reveal a trendline. In medicine, trendlines are often more telling than the absolute numbers themselves: They’re important to spot because they show us where the patient is headed. And right now, the trendline is moving in a risky direction.\n\nSo it seems that we’re now in a watchful waiting phase with my patient to see what happens next.\n\nThe patient in the next bed\n\nAnother way to predict which way my patient may be headed is to look at another patient with the same malady, but who is a little further along in their disease course. In this case, we can look to South Africa.\n\nThe news isn’t exactly encouraging: Recently, the health minister cautioned that the country may be entering its fifth Covid-19 wave.\n\n“We’ve been expecting… that probably middle of May… or even early in June, we may enter the fifth wave [of Covid-19],” Joe Phaahla said during an April 29th news conference. The wave is being driven by two new Omicron subvariants, BA.4 and BA.5; its unclear whether the illness caused by these new subvariants is more or less severe than earlier ones.\n\nFormer White House Coronavirus Task Force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx, who has been carefully tracking the situation in South Africa, foresees my patient’s health following a similar trajectory.\n\n“I know that another surge is coming and will be coming across the world,” Birx said during a Washington Post Live discussion at the end of April. That’s because, Birx said, approximately 50 to 60% of the South African population is infected during each surge fueled by a new variant – a pattern that repeats itself every four to six months. Birx said this shows “there’s no protection, and there’s no long-lived natural immunity.”\n\nTo be sure, infection-acquired immunity can be very protective, but with SARS-CoV-2, there is so much difference between variants that a recent infection with one variant may provide little protection against the next.\n\nMy patient, America, is still grappling with Omicron subvariant BA.2, according to the latest variant tracking estimates from the CDC. But a subvariant of BA.2 – called BA.2.12.1 – is quickly gaining traction, especially in the Northeast, and now makes up just over 40% of cases.\n\nBirx is not the only one who thinks my patient is headed for a bumpy ride.\n\nDr. Peter Marks, director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the US Food and Drug Administration, said on Monday he is “a little concerned” about the direction of the pandemic and predicts a “modest peak” in the next month.\n\nDr. David Dowdy, an associate professor in the department of epidemiology at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, thinks my patient already may be surging.\n\n“I think it’s important for us to realize that in some ways, we are already in the midst of a surge,” he said during a news briefing on Tuesday.\n\n“There are indicators that the amount of transmission happening in this country right now, while not the same as it was this past winter, is at the levels that we were seeing during the Delta wave … But what we’re not seeing are the same rise in hospitalizations and deaths – so, we’re seeing a small uptick but not the same tremendous rise that we’ve seen with some of these previous waves.”\n\nIt’s all about the immunity\n\nThe problem all comes down to waning immunity, both from natural infection and from vaccines, including boosters.\n\nAccording to data from the CDC released in late April, almost 60% of adults and 75% of children have antibodies indicating that they’ve been infected with SARS-CoV-2. But that doesn’t necessarily translate to protection from the next variant.\n\nAnd it’s fair to say that waning immunity is also true for vaccines. Estimates show the amount of protection against infection hinges on many factors – including the age and health status of the recipient, the type of vaccine a person received and the variant that’s circulating. But protection fades after a few months.\n\nA CDC task force presented data in late April showing that two doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine are only 30% effective against Omicron two to four months after the shots. That number is higher, 63%, with three doses of an mRNA vaccines, either Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna. But both numbers are lower than the initial protection the vaccines provided.\n\nThe good news is that getting re-boosted helps. A new study, also out of the UK and published Monday in The Lancet Infectious Diseases, found that a fourth dose of an mRNA vaccine provided a “substantial” boost to immunity at similar or even better levels than a third dose, when given about seven months after a first booster shot\n\nOf course it’s important to keep in mind, even though vaccines may not protect against infection by new subvariants very well, they are still very good – though not perfect – at greatly lowering the risk of hospitalization and death. These are the outcomes we all want to avoid and what vaccines are designed to do. In fact, the overall risk of dying from Covid-19 is about five times higher for unvaccinated people than it is for those vaccinated with at least their primary series, according to the CDC.\n\nThat said, waning effectiveness and higher transmission rates have led to an increase in the share of Covid-19 deaths among vaccinated people. According to CDC data, about 40% of Covid-19 deaths in January and February were among vaccinated people, compared with 25% during the height of the Delta wave in the second half of September.\n\nBut only about 15% of deaths in February were among those vaccinated and boosted. As has been the case throughout the pandemic, those age 65 and older face the highest risk.\n\nAnother way of looking at the numbers, according to a CNN analysis, is that people vaccinated with only their initial series faced about three times greater risk of dying (after adjusting for age) than those who also got their booster shot.\n\nAs for hospitalizations, CDC data from December and January (when Omicron was dominant) show that getting boosted was 90% effective at preventing that outcome, compared to 57% for those who only got the primary series and were six months or more past their last shot.\n\nDoctors’ orders: Get boosted\n\nAll of these statistics underscore how critical it is to get boosted.\n\nA senior Biden administration official told CNN Monday that all adults in the United States should get a booster, noting that it’s the best way to protect oneself.\n\nBut that’s not happening. According to the CDC, currently in the US, just over 220 million people – 70% of the eligible population (ages 5 and up) – are fully vaccinated, that is, they’ve received their primary series. But only 101.4 million – 46% of the fully vaccinated – have gotten their first booster. And only about 10 million people have received a second booster, which is authorized for people 50 and older, as well as those who are 12 and older and who are immunocompromised.\n\nThe senior Biden administration official noted that Covid case numbers are currently highest in the Northeast – states that have a relatively large percentage of the population boosted, which has kept hospitalizations and deaths relatively low – and expressed concern that when cases pick up steam in the South, where the percent of people boosted is much lower, there will be a jump in hospitalization rates and deaths.\n\nThe FDA’s Marks agrees boosting is the way to go. “It’s really important that we try to get the Americans who have only received two doses to get that third dose,” he said. “That may make a difference moving forward here, and it may particularly make a difference now that we’re coming into yet another wave of Covid-19.”\n\nDowdy, from JHU, said getting boosted is especially important for those at greatest risk. “So those whose immune systems are weak, those who are older, to make sure that you’ve been vaccinated, boosted and gotten that second booster or additional shots,” he said.\n\n“We’re starting to see also that the older population and the immunocompromised populations are again accounting for a larger and larger fraction of people in the hospital and people dying. So those boosters are very important,” he added.\n\nDon’t throw caution to the wind\n\nWhile the country – my patient – is in a watchful waiting phase to see how their illness progresses, there are other small steps we, as individuals, can still take to mitigate risk. And by that I mean following the common sense public health measures we’ve been talking about for the last two years: putting on a high quality mask, especially in crowded indoor spaces; increasing ventilation where possible; and, now more than ever, keeping an eye on the local conditions.\n\nLet me share a personal example. My mom’s 80th birthday was this past weekend, and we decided not to have a big celebration because we’re still not comfortable gathering a bunch of octogenarians together in a room. We gathered as a family – but it was a much smaller group.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWhat struck me was, if my mom (or any of her friends) were to be exposed, the likelihood of being hospitalized or dying is very low because she’s vaccinated and boosted. But as a virologist friend of mine said, it is still likely to be the worst viral illness she has ever had in her life, and she’d be miserable. And who wants to go through that at 80, or at any age?\n\nPlus, there’s always the worry about long Covid, with its long list of lingering and sometimes devastating effects.\n\nAs expert after expert has said, we have to accept – my patient has to accept – that Covid-19 is not going away; we’re all going to be living with this virus for a long time. This is our new normal; we will adapt to this as we have adapted to so many of the changes to our daily lives brought by the passage of time.\n\nWe have the tools to survive; it’s up to each of us to decide if and how to use them.", "authors": ["Dr. Sanjay Gupta"], "publish_date": "2022/05/12"}]}

Los Angeles Angels two-way star Shohei Ohtani pounded out the game's first hit on Kershaw's first pitch.\n\nFramber Valdez of Houston got the win, tossing a scoreless third inning.\n\nAL starter Shane McClanahan of Tampa Bay gave up two runs and four hits. The first-time All-Star, who owns a MLB-leading 1.71 ERA, had allowed four hits or fewer in his last seven starts.\n\nMcClanahan combined with 10 other pitchers on the five-hitter. Emmanuel Clase struck out the side in the ninth to earn the save. Austin Riley’s single in the eighth was the NL’s only hit after the first inning.\n\nFacing 11-game winner Tony Gonsolin of the Dodgers, Stanton's impressive 457-foot, two-run shot landed in the left-field pavilion, not far from where the L.A. native watched games as a youngster.\n\nIt ended his career 0 for 7 skid in the game and at 111.2 mph, it was the hardest-hit homer in an All-Star Game tracked by Statcast. Also scoring was José Ramírez, tying the game 2-all.\n\nFour pitches later, Buxton went deep to give the AL a 3-2 lead against a clearly frustrated Gonsolin, who took the loss.\n\nOhtani led off for the AL as the designated hitter. Interviewed moments before the start, the Japanese superstar admitted he was going to swing. He cracked a 91-mph fastball into center field on the first pitch.\n\n“I was definitely swinging a hundred percent,” Ohtani said through a translator. “Kershaw has really good command.”\n\nHis hit snapped an 0 for 8 streak as a hitter against Kershaw. Last year, Ohtani was the starting pitcher and led off as the DH in the AL’s 5-2 win at Denver. He didn’t pitch this year so he can start Friday in the Angels’ first game after the break at Atlanta.\n\n“I mean, you can’t throw the first pitch of an All-Star Game as a breaking ball,” Kershaw said. “You kind of had to give him a heater there, I think just for everything. Had to do it.”\n\nBut the three-time NL Cy Young Award winner had the last word. Kershaw fired a pickoff throw to first that caught Ohtani off the bag.\n\n“Honestly, I didn’t know quite know what to throw yet. Sometimes I throw over there for a second to be convicted with the pitch,” Kershaw said. “I wasn’t trying to pick him off. I was trying to delay the game for a bit, but it worked out.”\n\nThen Yankees slugger Aaron Judge went down swinging. After Rafael Devers walked, Vladimir Guerrero Jr. grounded into a fielder's choice, and Kershaw walked off to applause from the appreciative crowd.\n\n“I tried to take a minute at the beginning to take it all in and look around, which I usually never do,” Kershaw said. “It kind of calmed everything down for me and then I had a lot of fun.”\n\nThe NL wasted no time in taking its first 2-0 lead in 10 years. Styling in yellow spikes and alternate yellow and red sleeves, Ronald Acuña Jr. led off the bottom of the first with a ground-rule double to left and scored on Mookie Betts' single. Paul Goldschmidt hit a solo homer with two outs.\n\nIn between runs, AL second baseman Andrés Giménez made a defensive stop on Manny Machado and followed with a dazzling behind-the-back toss to shortstop Tim Anderson, who threw to first to complete the double play.\n\nA sellout crowd of 52,518 filled Dodger Stadium two years after the third-oldest ballpark in the majors was supposed to host before the game was canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHERE’S TO YOU, MS. ROBINSON\n\nDodgers outfielder Mookie Betts, with all of the other All-Stars bunched behind him, led the crowd in sending out 100th birthday wishes to Rachel Robinson. On his 1-2-3 count, the crowd and players shouted “Happy birthday, Rachel!” The widow of Jackie Robinson didn’t travel from her home in New York. She visited Dodger Stadium in April on Jackie Robinson Day to mark the 75th anniversary of her husband breaking baseball’s color barrier with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947. Jackie Robinson’s achievement was honored with on-field comments by Oscar-winning actor Denzel Washington and a presentation on the video boards.\n\nFIRST PITCH\n\nBacked by a mariachi band, Dodgers great Fernando Valenzuela tossed out the ceremonial first pitch. Fittingly, first-time All-Star Alejandro Kirk of Toronto served as catcher. Kirk and Valenzuela were both born in Mexico. Fernandomania gripped the Dodgers in 1981, when the left-hander won Rookie of the Year and the Cy Young Award in helping LA win the World Series.\n\nFASHION CRITICS\n\nThe reviews were mostly negative for the second straight year on the All-Star uniforms. The AL wore dark gray uniforms that blended into plate umpire’s black shirt and dark gray pants. The NL wore all-white uniforms. Both had gold lettering. Fans were critical on social media, with “atrocious” a frequent critique. Last year, MLB went away from wearing traditional jerseys, which met with heavy online criticism.\n\nMIC’ED UP MANOAH\n\nAlek Manoah, Toronto’s expressive right-hander, wore a microphone and earpiece while pitching the second inning, engaging in an entertaining conversation with Fox analyst and Hall of Famer John Smoltz. “How hard am I throwing?” Manoah asked early. He also sought scouting reports on Joc Pederson and Acuña Jr. Manoah did fine, striking out three and also plunking Jeff McNeil with a pitch. A lot of players were mic’ed up. Fans heard Yankees teammates Aaron Judge and Stanton talking back and forth while playing the outfield, and Yankees batterymates Nestor Cortes and Jose Trevino talking while working together.\n\nTHE SHIFT IS STILL ON\n\nDodgers first baseman Freddie Freeman batted in the third to the now familiar chants of “Freddie! Freddie!” Even in the exhibition game, an extreme shift was on and he was thrown out from right field. Home Run Derby champion Juan Soto got thrown out by the third baseman playing much closer to second base to end the fifth. Next season, the shift is going away.\n\nTAKING IT EASY\n\nHall of Fame announcer Vin Scully, the voice of the Dodgers for 67 years before retiring in 2016, watched the game from his Los Angeles home. The Bronx-born 94-year-old began calling games when the franchise was located in Brooklyn and followed the team west ahead of the 1958 season.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe regular season resumes with six games on Thursday, including Aaron Judge, Stanton and the Yankees playing a doubleheader at Houston. The Yankees own the best record in the majors at 64-28. Jose Altuve, Yordan Álvarez and the Astros have the second-best mark in the AL at 59-32. Also, it will be Freeman, Betts, Trea Turner and the Dodgers, topping the NL at 60-30, hosting the Giants.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/tigers/2022/05/01/detroit-tigers-game-score-vs-los-angeles-dodgers-time-tv-radio/9605571002/", "title": "Detroit Tigers drop series finale, 6-3, to Dodgers: Game thread replay", "text": "Detroit Tigers (7-13) vs. Los Angeles Dodgers (13-7)\n\nWhen: 4:10 p.m. Sunday.\n\nWhere: Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles.\n\nTV: Bally Sports Detroit.\n\nRadio: WXYT-FM (97.1) (Tigers radio affiliates).\n\n• BOX SCORE\n\nWeather forecast: Sunny, low 70s.\n\nProbable pitchers: Tigers LHP Eduardo Rodriguez (0-1, 5.03 ERA) vs. Dodgers RHP Walker Buehler (2-1, 2.55).\n\n[ Tigers' Javier Báez wins as Dodgers villain: 'He loves being that guy' ]\n\nTigers lineup:\n\n1.

(It’s only the second time the Tigers have even had a shot at it; they won the second game of the June 2005 series only to drop the rubber match, 3-1.)\n\nFor that to happen, the Tigers will likely need a repeat of Saturday night’s victorious formula: Five or so strong innings by the starter (former 27th-round pick Beau Brieske gave up a leadoff homer, then shut out the Dodgers the rest of the way) followed by four innings of shutdown relief by the bullpen. In short, it would be a good time for left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez to continue his streak of quality starts (six innings, three or fewer earned runs), which sits at two. The Tigers lost both, but Rodriguez took no-decisions, with 11 strikeouts and three walks over 12 innings combined.\n\nSATURDAY'S VICTORY:Tigers get big nights from Beau Brieske, Javier Báez in 5-1 win over Dodgers\n\nThe Tigers could also use something resembling a repeat of their output at the plate from Saturday, when they scored more than three runs for just the sixth time in 20 games this season. The big mover was Javier Báez, who went 2-for-4 with a double and two RBIs. The good news for the Tigers: Báez has arguably the best track record on the roster against today’s starter, Walker Buehler (who finish fourth in NL Cy Young voting last season). The bad news: Because it’s Báez, it’s a bit of a hit-or-miss history. In 13 at-bats against the righty, he has three hits — a double and two home runs – and three strikeouts. The Tigers’ other primary import from the NL, Tucker Barnhart, is 3-for-9 against Buehler in his career with one double.\n\nThe Tigers have the day off Monday, followed by a two-game series at Comerica Park on Tuesday-Wednesday against the Pittsburgh Pirates. (With a 7:10 and 1:10 p.m. starts, that’s 18 innings of baseball in approximately 18 hours.) The Dodgers, meanwhile, get Monday off to prepare for a visit from their hated rivals, the San Francisco Giants, but maybe they’ll be looking ahead to that series rather than focusing on finishing off the Tigers.\n\nROSTER DEADLINE:Tigers must cut two players Monday.

The Nationals got MacKenzie Gore, Luke Voit and four prospects in exchange for the next 2½ years of Soto’s career.\n\nAmong a flurry of moves before clock struck 6 p.m. ET, the Atlanta Braves landed reliever Raisel Iglesias, the Blue Jays got two-time All-Star Whit Merrifield and the Phillies made a deal for starter Noah Syndergaard.\n\nCatch up on everything that happened Tuesday:\n\nPreviously-unvaxxed Whit Merrifield going to the Blue Jays\n\nThe Royals sent utility man Whit Merrifield to the Blue Jays just minutes before Tuesday’s trade deadline, even though the two-time All-Star was unvaccinated against COVID-19 and had to miss Kansas City’s trip to Toronto last month.\n\nMerrifield drew the ire of Royals fans when, prior to their trip to Toronto, he said: “Something happens and I happen to get on a team that has a chance to go play in Canada in the postseason, maybe that changes.”\n\nMerrifield is making $7 million this season and is due $2.75 million next season along with a $4 million bonus for spending fewer than 110 days on the injured list in 2022. He has an $18 million mutual option for 2024 with a $500,000 buyout.\n\nToronto, which began Tuesday with a three-game lead over Tampa Bay for the AL’s top wild card, was missing outfielder George Springer in the lineup for the third time in the last four games against the Rays due to a right elbow injury.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nPhillies get old rival Noah Syndergaard\n\nPhiladelphia brought in a familiar face to strengthen its rotation, trading for Los Angeles Angels right-hander Noah Syndergaard. The Angels will get outfielder Mickey Moniak and prospect Jadiel Sanchez in the deal.\n\nSyndergaard, who pitched for the Mets from 2015-2021, signed a one-year deal with Los Angeles in the offseason after declining New York's qualifying offer.\n\nMoniak gets a fresh start with a new organization after he was selected by Philadelphia with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2016 amateur draft. The 24-year-old Moniak is a .129 hitter in 47 career games.\n\nEarlier in the day, the Phillies also acquired outfielder Brandon Marsh (Angels) and reliever David Robertson (Cubs).\n\nPhiladelphia sent minor league pitcher Ben Brown to the Chicago Cubs for the 37-year-old Robertson, one of the top relievers on the market ahead of the trade deadline. The Phillies got Marsh from the Angels in exchange for catching prospect Logan O’Hoppe.\n\nPhiladelphia is fighting for one of three NL wild cards. It hasn’t made the postseason since 2011.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nBraves beef up bullpen with Raisel Iglesias\n\nThe defending champions made a deal to solidify the back end of their bullpen right before the buzzer, landing reliever Raisel Iglesias in a trade with the Angels. Los Angeles is getting lefty Tucker Davidson and righty Jesse Chavez in return.\n\nThe 32-year-old Iglesias received Cy Young votes last season and signed a four-year $58 million extension with the Angels this past offseason. His 3.17 FIP (4.04 ERA) suggest that he's been unlucky so far in 2022. Iglesias joins closer Kenley Jansen and lefty A.J. Minter in the late innings for the Braves, who dealt reliever Will Smith earlier in the week.\n\nOther MLB trade deadline deals\n\nYankees, Cardinals swap Jordan Montgomery and Harrison Bader\n\nMinutes before Tuesday’s 6 p.m. MLB trade deadline, the Yankees cleared roster space in an unanticipated manner.\n\nLefty starter Jordan Montgomery was shipped to the St. Louis Cardinals for center fielder Harrison Bader, who is currently on the injured list due to plantar fasciitis.\n\nThe left-handed Montgomery, 29, was having a solid season, posting a 3.69 ERA in 21 starts.\n\nBader, 28, a right-handed hitter, was batting .256 with a .673 OPS in 72 games, with 15 stolen bases in 17 attempts.\n\n– Pete Caldera, NorthJersey.com\n\nEric Hosmer heading to Red Sox on roller-coaster day\n\nOriginally part of San Diego's package in the Juan Soto trade, veteran first baseman Eric Hosmer utilized his no-trade clause to nix a deal to Washington before the Padres ended up trading him to the Red Sox.\n\nThe Red Sox are sending pitching prospect Jay Groome to the Padres in exchange for Hosmer and prospects Corey Rosier and Max Ferguson. Hosmer is due $39 million from 2023-2025 and Boston will also receive cash in the deal\n\nPadres get Brandon Drury in latest deal\n\nSan Diego followed up on the Soto trade by making a move for Reds utilityman Brandon Drury, who was enjoying a career year in Cincinnati with 20 HR and 59 RBI in 92 games.\n\nThe 29-year-old has played all four infield positions this year – primarily third base – and has experience in the outfield. Drury could get at-bats at designated hitter the Padres' new-look lineup with Soto and first baseman Josh Bell.\n\nThe Reds are getting 18-year-old shortstop prospect Victor Acosta, the Padres' sixth-ranked prospect (after the Soto trade) according to MLB.com.\n\nTwins make move for Reds righty Tyler Mahle\n\nWith two of the best pitchers available on the trade market, the Cincinnati Reds opted to boost their farm system. The Reds traded right-handed starting pitcher Tyler Mahle to the Minnesota Twins for a group of three prospects Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe prospects include infielder Spencer Steer, left-hander Steven Hajjar and third baseman Christian Encarnacion-Strand. Steer is the headliner, rated No. 4 in the Twins' organization by Baseball America. Hajjar is rated No. 11 and Encarnacion-Strand is ranked No. 14.\n\nMahle had a 5-7 record and a 4.40 ERA in 19 starts with the Reds this season, striking out 114 and walking 39 in 104 1/3 innings. He made two starts ahead of the trade deadline after a stint on the 15-day injured list with a right shoulder strain.\n\nIt’s the second time the Reds have traded a starting pitcher to the Twins this season. They swapped Sonny Gray for pitching prospect Chase Petty in March.\n\n– Bobby Nightengale, Cincinnati Enquirer\n\nDavid Robertson to close for Phillies\n\nSeemingly always in the market for bullpen help, the Philadelphia Phillies struck a deal with the Chicago Cubs for closer David Robertson.\n\nAn All-Star in 2011 with the New York Yankees, Robertson made only 19 appearances from 2019-21 because of injuries. However, he's rebounded in a big way with the Cubs this year, posting a 2.23 ERA with 14 saves.\n\nClass A right-hander Ben Brown, 22, goes to Chicago in the deal.\n\nNL East contenders set to add outfielders\n\nThe Philadelphia Phillies have struck a deal to land outfielder Brandon Marsh from the Los Angeles Angels. In return, the Angels receive catching prospect Logan O'Hoppe, FanSided's Robert Murray reports.\n\nMarsh, 24, is a speedy outfielder who can fill the Phillies need in center. However, he has the highest strikeout rate of any qualified hitter in the majors this season at 36.2%.\n\nMeanwhile, the New York Mets are acquiring outfielder/first baseman Darin Ruf from the San Francisco Giants in exchange for veteran third baseman J.D. Davis and prospects, according to Joel Sherman of the New York Post.\n\nRuf, who has a .886 OPS vs. left-handers this season, gives the Mets a right-handed complement to lefty sluggers Dan Vogelbach and Tyler Naquin, who were also acquired just before the deadline.\n\nDodgers acquire OF Joey Gallo from Yankees\n\nOne of the surest bets of this year's trade deadline was that the New York Yankees would part ways with outfielder Joey Gallo, whom they acquired to much fanfare at last year's trade deadline.\n\nHowever, in Gallo's one year in the Bronx, he has gone from an All-Star and Gold Glove defender to a struggling part-timer. In 140 games in pinstripes, he has produced a .159/.291/.368 slash line with 25 home runs and a whopping 194 strikeouts.\n\nIn a recent interview, Gallo was quite candid about his struggles, both physically and mentally, in New York.\n\nOnce the Yankees picked up left-handed hitting outfielder Andrew Benintendi from the Royals, Gallo's days were clearly numbered.\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers have agreed to send 23-year-old Class AA right-hander Clayton Beeter to the Yankees for Gallo, according to multiple media reports.\n\nBeeter is the Dodgers' No. 15 prospect, according to MLB.com.\n\nBlue Jays bolster bullpen in deal with Marlins\n\nThe Toronto Blue Jays added a pair of relievers for the stretch run, acquiring right-handers Anthony Bass and Zach Pop from the Miami Marlins for shortstop prospect Jordan Groshans.\n\nBass has been outstanding this season, with a 1.41 ERA, 0.94 WHIP and just one home run allowed over 44 ⅔ innings. Pop has split time between Miami and Class AAA Jacksonville. They'll provide depth behind closer Jason Romano.\n\nGroshans, a top-100 overall prospect entering this season, has struggled at Class AAA Buffalo, posting a .250/.348/.296 slash line with one home run in 279 plate appearances.\n\nJuan Soto trade to Padres now official\n\nThe San Diego Padres are making a huge statement in their bid to reach the World Series by landing the trade deadline's biggest prize, agreeing to acquire All-Star outfielder Juan Soto and first baseman Josh Bell from the Washington Nationals.\n\nIn return, the Nationals receive first baseman Luke Voit, left-hander MacKenzie Gore and a package of four prospects, shortstop C.J. Abrams, outfielders Robert Hassell III and James Wood, and right-hander Jarlin Susana.\n\nANALYSIS: Padres show they're all-in with Soto, Hader acquisitions\n\nVeteran first baseman Eric Hosmer was originally part of the Nationals' haul for Soto and Bell -- however, he has a limited no-trade clause that prohibited him from being traded to several teams, including the Nationals, without his permission.\n\nHowever, Voit was later added to the trade so it could be finalized.\n\nEarlier this season, the Soto turned down a record-breaking 15-year, $440 million contract offer to stay with the Nationals. Even though the deal would have been the largest in baseball history, it would only average $29.33 million per year -- making him the 20th highest-paid player in annual value.\n\nTwins pick up Orioles closer Jorge Lopez\n\nDesperate for bullpen help, the Minnesota Twins have acquired 2022 AL All-Star Jorge Lopez from the Baltimore Orioles.\n\nThe O's will receive left-hander Cade Povich, right-handed reliever Yennier Cano and additional low-level prospects in exchange for the 29-year-old Lopez.\n\nIn by far the best season of his seven-year career, Lopez has made the transition from struggling starter (3-14, 6.07 ERA in 2021) to lights-out closer -- converting 19 of 23 save chances and pitching to an ERA of 1.68 in 44 appearances.\n\nThe Twins have gone through several closers after trading 2021 All-Star Taylor Rogers to the Padres this spring. Emilio Pagan leads the team with nine saves, but has blown six other save chances and has an ERA of 4.75. Five other Twins relievers have picked up at least one save.\n\nFantasy winners and losers (so far) from deadline deals\n\nMLB teams aren't the only ones looking to improve their rosters at the trade deadline. In the upcoming issue of USA TODAY Sports Weekly, Steve Gardner offers his winners and losers from a fantasy standpoint. Here are a few of each:\n\nWINNERS\n\nSP Luis Castillo, Mariners. Somehow, Castillo managed to put up a 2.86 ERA and 1.07 WHIP with Cincinnati – in one of the most homer-happy ballparks in the majors. In Seattle, he’ll have a much more neutral home park and a better defense behind him. The schedule helps as well with the M's having 25 games left against sub-.500 division opponents the Angels, Rangers and A's -- and none against the first-place Astros.\n\nRP Devin Williams, Brewers. MLB saves leader Josh Hader's fantasy value wasn’t going to change whether or not he changed teams. Once he did though, going from the Brewers to the Padres, Williams’ immediately becomes a top-10 fantasy closer in Milwaukee. Possibly top five. (The Orioles' Felix Bautista gets a similar boost in value with Jorge Lopez traded to Minnesota.)\n\n1B Trey Mancini, Astros. Mancini was one of the hitters most impacted by the Orioles moving the left field wall back 30 feet this season. After hitting 14 homers at Camden Yards a year ago, Mancini had just five there this season (one of them of the inside-the-park variety). Hitting fly balls at a career-high rate, the Crawford Boxes in Houston, by comparison, should seem like just a short pop fly away for Mancini.\n\nLOSERS\n\nSP Frankie Montas, Yankees. With the Mariners landing Castillo first, the Yankees made a strong and successful push for the No. 2 starting pitcher on the market. Montas’ 4-9 record belies his excellent 3.18 ERA and 1.18 WHIP. However, he has taken full advantage of the spacious Oakland Coliseum this season. Over 12 starts in Oakland, Montas has a 2.06 ERA; in seven starts on the road, his ERA is over 5.00.\n\nOF David Peralta, Rays. Primarily a platoon hitter, Peralta shouldn’t see much of a change in his role playing primarily against right-handers. However, the AL East is the toughest division in the majors and the Rays like to tweak their lineups more than most teams. The Rays also acquired outfielder Jose Siri on Monday and should have Manuel Margot and Harold Ramirez coming back off the injured list soon.\n\nFantasy managers in AL- and NL-only leagues. This could change with a flurry of activity on deadline day. But as the final 24 hours of trading began ticking down, the number of inter-division deals was disappointingly small. Perhaps the possibility of a Juan Soto trade has kept a number of other deals on hold. No matter the reason, hoarding one’s FAAB dollars until the last minute in hopes of grabbing a superstar from the opposite league seems to be yet again a dangerous gamble.\n\nPadres front-runners in Soto sweepstakes?\n\nThe San Diego Padres are now seen by multiple observers as the \"most motivated\" team to put together a package for Juan Soto, in the words of The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal.\n\nThey have several high-level prospects -- including shortstop C.J. Abrams and outfielder Robert Hassell III -- which would be essential to creating a package the Nationals would accept.\n\nBarry Svrluga of the Washington Post goes even further, calling the Padres the \"most likely landing spot\" for Soto. In addition, he says the Padres could also acquire first baseman Josh Bell as part of a Soto deal.\n\nWhat makes the Padres different from the other rumored suitors for Soto is that they might have a bit more trouble getting him to sign a long-term extension before he becomes a free agent at the end of the 2024 season. That's because they already have two huge contracts already on the books in Fernando Tatis (14 years, $340 million) and Manny Machado (10 years, $340 million). However, Machado's contract does allow him to opt out after the 2024 season.\n\nAccording to USA TODAY's Bob Nightengale, the Padres wouldn't necessarily have to deplete their farm system for years to come if they acquired Soto. They could always trade him for more top prospects before he becomes a free agent.\n\n5 biggest trades from Monday\n\nYankees land Frankie Montas, have improved everywhere\n\nThe New York Yankees have been sitting atop the baseball world all season, but were much more worried about their team than they ever publicly revealed.\n\nSo, what did they do?\n\nThey grabbed Oakland A’s ace Frankie Montas on Monday when they couldn’t get Cincinnati Reds ace Luis Castillo. They passed on Brewers All-Star closer Josh Hader, who went to San Diego, but turned around and acquired Oakland closer Lou Trivino in the Montas trade. They acquired Cubs rookie reliever Scott Effross, too. They’re out on the Juan Soto sweepstakes, but acquired Andrew Benintendi from the Kansas City Royals last week.\n\n– Bob Nightengale, USA TODAY Sports\n\nBrewers think they can still win without Josh Hader\n\nThe Milwaukee Brewers let teams know early in July that four-time All-Star closer Josh Hader was available, believing they could still win the NL Central without him, but warned the asking price would be steep.\n\nWell, they soon will find out if they’re correct in their assessment, trading Hader to the San Diego Padres on Monday for closer Trevor Rogers, starter Dinelson Lamet, pitching prospect Robert Gasser and outfield prospect Esteury Ruiz.\n\n\"Trading good players on good teams is difficult, and that certainly is the case with Josh,\" Brewers president David Stearns said. \"We also recognize that to give our organization the best chance for sustained competitiveness, to avoid the extended down periods that so many organizations experience, we must make decisions that are not easy.\"\n\n– Bob Nightengale, USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe 2022 Tigers weren't supposed to be sellers. How it all went wrong.\n\nThere was a time, not too long ago, when the Detroit Tigers envisioned a much different approach at the 2022 trade deadline — 6 p.m. Tuesday, less than two hours before they play the Twins in Minnesota.\n\nOn paper, the Tigers were lined up to compete. But on the field, due to myriad injuries and poor performances, the Tigers have the third-worst record in the AL, and the offense — averaging 3.21 runs per game — is one of the worst in baseball history.\n\n\"I'm just trying to make sure our guys realize we put ourselves in this situation,\" manager A.J. Hinch said. \"We have to deal with the consequences of the stress, anxiousness, curiosity and the reality that, if I was on the outside and I had a contending club, I would have a few pieces that I would want here, too.\"\n\n– Evan Petzold, Detroit Free Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2022/10/13/snell-dodgers-padres-nlds-at-petco-park-should-be-insane/50833743/", "title": "Snell: Dodgers-Padres NLDS at Petco Park should be 'insane'", "text": "AP\n\nSAN DIEGO (AP) — The atmosphere at Petco Park will be absolutely electric Friday night when Blake Snell and the San Diego Padres face Tony Gonsolin and the rival Los Angeles Dodgers in the first playoff game at the downtown ballpark with fans in the stands in 16 years.\n\nThe Padres put a jolt into the NL Division Series when they won 5-3 at Dodger Stadium on Wednesday night to even the best-of-5 series at 1-1. That assured them of two straight home games at the park that has been hopping pretty much every night during this season of big expectations.\n\n“Yeah, I expect it to be pretty insane, which I’m really excited about,” Snell said Thursday before the Padres had a late-afternoon workout. “I really wanted to see what postseason baseball would be here in San Diego and at Petco.”\n\nThe only way the Padres assured themselves of getting at least one home game this postseason was to beat the New York Mets on the road in the wild-card round, which they did 2-1.\n\n“I know when we beat New York, I saw the fans were going crazy, so I’m really excited to see what they’ve got, see what they bring, and hopefully we get a couple wins and can see them go even crazier,” Snell said. “I’m definitely really excited about it.”\n\nIf the Padres beat the Dodgers on Friday night in front of a sellout crowd, hometown hero Joe Musgrove will pitch the potential clinching Game 4 on Saturday night.\n\nSnell has pitched in the playoffs at Petco Park before, making three starts with Tampa Bay in the AL bubble following the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, without fans in the stands. He faced the Dodgers twice in the World Series that year, including the ill-fated Game 6 when Rays manager Kevin Cash pulled him with the lead. The Rays lost the game and the series.\n\nSnell moved on a few months later when he was traded to San Diego.\n\n“This has always been one of my favorite ballparks to play in, so I cherish it a lot more being that now we’ll have fans and it’s San Diego fans and it’s in San Diego. I like that a lot more,” the left-hander said.\n\nSnell, who won the 2018 AL Cy Young Award, has also moved on from that World Series start.\n\nAsked what he remembered about that night, he said: “I knew that question was coming. That was inevitable. Yeah, it was one of my best starts. I’ll keep it at that. Two years ago, man. I’ve got to flip that page, read a different book, learn, get better.”\n\nWednesday night’s win was huge because the Dodgers have dominated the Padres going back to mid-2021, including going 14-5 this year and outscoring San Diego 109-47. The 111-win Dodgers won the NL West, finishing 22 games ahead of the Padres and earning home-field advantage through the World Series.\n\n“It’s a different team,” Snell said about this year’s Dodgers lineup. “They’ve got Freddie Freeman, they’ve got Trea (Turner). It’s just a whole different team than two years ago. They’re a lot better, I think. They’ve gotten pieces that have made them a lot stronger hitting-wise.”\n\nThe Padres were carried offensively all year by All-Star Manny Machado. They finished 89-73 without superstar shortstop Fernando Tatis Jr., who was on the cusp of returning from a broken wrist when he was suspended 80 games by MLB on Aug. 12 after testing positive for a performance-enhancing drug.\n\nThe Padres won a home wild-card series against St. Louis in 2020, minus fans. The last time the Padres played in front of a packed Petco Park in the playoffs was 2006, when they lost both home games in the NLDS before the Cardinals finished off a 3-1 series win in St. Louis.\n\nSan Diego’s leadoff batter and left fielder that year was Dave Roberts, who’s in his seventh season helming the Dodgers.\n\nThe Dodgers have won nine straight series against the Padres. San Diego hasn’t won a playoff series in a full season since the 1998 NL Championship Series against the Atlanta Braves.\n\nSnell can have a hand in changing that.\n\n“There’s no better time to be great than right now,” said Snell, who was 8-10 with a 3.38 ERA in an up-and-down regular season.\n\nGonsolin, an All-Star who went 16-1 with a 2.14 ERA in the regular season, opposed Snell in Game 6 of the World Series two years ago. He’s not concerned about a loud crowd.\n\n“Yeah, we’re fortunate enough to play here at Dodger Stadium, and we get 45-, 50,000 people every night when we play,” Gonsolin said during a video conference with the media. “Can’t imagine it’s any more loud than that. Yeah, I’m excited to go out there and throw strikes.”\n\nRoberts said Gonsolin should be good for 75 pitches and that Dustin May and Andrew Heaney could follow him. Gonsolin was sidelined for much of the final 1 ½ months with a strained right forearm. He returned on Oct. 3, pitching two innings.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2016/03/06/keys-winning-al-pennant/81395840/", "title": "First look: Keys to winning the AL pennant", "text": "USA TODAY Sports\n\nWith baseball’s spring training in full throttle, USA TODAY Sports examines the four keys to winning the American League pennant for each team. A look at the AL, in alphabetical order:\n\n***\n\nBaltimore Orioles\n\n1. Solid corners: The tandem of first baseman Chris Davis and third baseman Manny Machado packs a punch. The Orioles re-signed Davis to the largest contract in franchise history, locking up their cleanup hitter at $161 million over seven years. He led the majors with 47 home runs last season and has 159 over the last four seasons. Machado, 23, is maturing into a perennial All-Star. He played every game last season, and his plate discipline has improved greatly.\n\n2. Improved rotation? The late addition of Yovani Gallardo filled a gap. In 2015, no starter won more than 12 games, and the four returning (right-handers Chris Tillman, Kevin Gausman, Ubaldo Jimenez and Miguel Gonzalez) combined to go 36-40 and relied heavily on the bullpen. Gallardo, 30, has logged at least 180-plus innings in each of his last six seasons and could become the staff ace. Manager Buck Showalter expects a breakout season from Gausman.\n\n3. Gold Gloves: The Orioles have some of the most sure-handed gloves up the middle of the field with catcher Matt Wieters, shortstop J.J. Hardy and center fielder Adam Jones. Each is healthy and has won multiple Gold Gloves. Last season, the O’s had the fewest errors in the American League. And with two-time Gold Glove winner Machado at third and Korean Hyun Soo Kim playing in left field, the Orioles expect to field a better defensive team.\n\n4. Foreign import: Kim, 27, is coming off stellar 2015 campaign in the Korea Baseball Organization in which he hit a career-high 28 home runs. He should provide stability in left and at leadoff. Kim brings a much-needed left-handed bat to the lineup and has a high on-base percentage.\n\nScott Boeck\n\n***\n\nAL grades: Which team had the best offseason?\n\nBoston Red Sox\n\n1. Bounce-backs by Ramirez and Sandoval: Signed for a combined $173 million in free agency during the 2014 offseason, neither Hanley Ramirez nor Pablo Sandoval produced as expected last year. That was a major reason why the Red Sox finished last in the AL East for the second year in a row and third time in four years with a 78-84 record. GM Ben Cherrington was replaced as head of baseball operations by Dave Dombrowski. Ramirez will try to make the conversion to first base after struggling moving to left field from third base last season. Weight issues have dogged Sandoval throughout his career, and he might be heavier this spring.\n\n2. Price living up to his price: Dombrowski made a big strike by signing free agent LHP David Price to a seven-year, $217 million deal in December. Price gives Boston the No. 1 starter it has lacked since trading Jon Lester during the 2014 season. Last season, Price helped the Toronto Blue Jays win the AL East crown, led the league in ERA and finished second in Cy Young Award voting.\n\n3. Fine farewell by Big Papi: DH David Ortiz announced on Nov. 18, his 40th birthday, he would retire after this season. He has at least 30 homers and 100 RBI in each of the last three seasons while posting an outstanding .913 on-base-plus-slugging percentage in that span. Injuries are a concern, but Ortiz played in 146 games in 2015, his most since 2011.\n\n4. Continued Kimbrel excellence: The Red Sox traded four prospects to the San Diego Padres for closer Craig Kimbrel. They look for Kimbrel to continue his elite performance in the AL after compiling 244 saves and a 1.63 ERA in 225 games with the Atlanta Braves and the Padres in his first six seasons.\n\nJohn Perrotto\n\nBoston's ambassador David Ortiz 'ready to pass the torch'\n\n***\n\nChicago White Sox\n\n1. In Todd we trust: The White Sox were last in the American League in 2015 in runs, home runs and slugging percentage, leading general manager Rick Hahn to trade for Todd Frazier. The veteran third baseman was fourth in the NL with 35 home runs for the Cincinnati Reds, so problem solved, right? The White Sox need Frazier to take control of the cleanup spot and provide better protection for Jose Abreu.\n\n2. Straight A’s: Adam LaRoche and Avisail Garcia don’t need to be stars but do need to be better than last season. LaRoche, with a .634 on-base-plus-slugging percentage in 484 plate appearances, gets another chance, but that’s because he’s making $13 million and the White Sox could not trade him or find a suitable replacement. LaRoche, 36, has a track record of success, unlike Garcia. He’s 24, and although he was a highly regarded prospect with the Detroit Tigers, Garcia has never put together a full season to justify those expectations. He was underwhelming last season. Garcia says he has changed his swing, but he’ll have to turn that into more production to repeat last year’s 600 plate appearances.\n\n3. Rounding out rotation: Left-handers Chris Sale, Jose Quintana and Carlos Rodon could be one of the top starting trios in baseball. But what follows them is less certain. Six years ago, John Danks and Mat Latos were among the game’s most dynamic pitchers. They’ll need to recapture some of that success.\n\n4. High five: The White Sox have been rebuilding the last few years, so manager Robin Ventura has avoided the hot seat. Not so in 2016. Entering his fifth season leading the White Sox, he has a team that many — on the South Side and elsewhere — expect to contend in the AL.\n\nPeter Barzilai\n\nWhite Sox counting on Todd Frazier, Brett Lawrie to kick-start offense\n\n***\n\nCleveland Indians\n\n1. Lindor avoids sophomore slump: SS Francisco Lindor did not post eye-popping stats at Class AAA Columbus last season, hitting .284 with two home runs and a .752 on-base-plus-slugging percentage in 59 games. Yet the Indians thought he was ready when they promoted him June 14 and he proved them right by finishing second in the AL rookie of the year voting. Lindor, 22, also stabilized the defense while playing with a sense of confidence that belies his age. The Indians hope to contend in the AL Central after going 81-80 last season, and Lindor’s continued improvement would go a long way toward keeping them in the race.\n\n2. Starting rotation dominates: Corey Kluber, who won the AL Cy Young Award in 2014, leads a rotation filled with power arms and includes fellow right-handers Carlos Carrasco, Danny Salazar and Trevor Bauer. All four have the stuff to dominate in any given start. The Indians got plenty of trade offers in the offseason but refused them all as they think the rotation is the backbone of the team and gives them the best chance to win.\n\n3. Smooth recovery for Dr. Smooth: Left fielder Michael Brantley will begin the season on the disabled list as he recovers from surgery on his left shoulder in November. The Indians don’t expect Brantley to be ready until at least May 1. Veteran Rajai Davis was signed to a one-year, $5.25million free agent contract to be the fill-in.\n\n4. Some pop from Napoli: Mike Napoli was signed to a one-year, $7million contract as a free agent to help provide punch to a lineup that was 18th in the majors in runs scored (4.16). He also should upgrade the defense by allowing Carlos Santana to become a full-time designated hitter.\n\nJohn Perrotto\n\n***\n\nDetroit Tigers\n\n1. Step forward for Norris: No, the Tigers aren’t expecting Daniel Norris to replace David Price, at least from the standpoint of innings pitched, strikeouts and the polish one expects from a Cy Young Award winner. But it’s crucial that Norris, the centerpiece of the package Detroit received for Price at the July trade deadline, hold down a spot in the middle of the rotation. Norris, 22, had a whirlwind year, starting in the Toronto Blue Jays rotation, getting sent down April 30 and then traded to the Tigers three months later. All while knowing offseason treatment for thyroid cancer was imminent. But Norris pitched well in eight starts with the Tigers. It should be all systems go this season.\n\n2. Designated health: Signing Justin Upton gives Detroit a scary lineup — and a very right-handed one. The exception in the middle of the order: switch-hitting DH Victor Martinez. Entering the second season of a four-year, $68 million contract, Martinez is coming off an injury-plagued season in which his on-base-plus-slugging percentage dropped from a league-best .974 to a career-worst .667. At 37, a season somewhere in between would go a long way toward balancing the Tigers lineup.\n\n3. New bully: After years of malfunctions, a revamped bullpen must be as good as it looks on paper. The key: New closer Francisco Rodriguez defying time and again posting a walks and hits per innings pitched near the 0.93 mark he produced over two seasons with the Milwaukee Brewers.\n\n4. Big brain on Brad: Managers grow with time. In Year 3, we should get a good idea of Brad Ausmus’ ceiling. Improved in-game acumen might make a difference in what should be a hard-fought division.\n\nGabe Lacques\n\n***\n\nHouston Astros\n\n1. Singleton stepping up: The Astros signed first baseman Jon Singleton to a five-year, $10 million contract in 2014, but he has hit .171 with 14 home runs and a .621 on-base-plus-slugging percentage in 114 games. The 24-year-old is being counted on to blossom this year, as a path to a starting job was cleared when Chris Carter, who hit 90 homers over three seasons with Houston, was not tendered a contract. The Astros are counting on Singleton to help them get back to the playoffs after they made their first postseason appearance since 2005.\n\n2. Giles closing it out: Finding a hard-throwing reliever became a priority after the Astros blew a late three-run lead in Game 4 of the division series vs. the Kansas City Royals in October and wound up losing the series in five games. So the Astros shipped five players to the Philadelphia Phillies in a December trade for right-hander Ken Giles, and they think the 25-year-old can become a premier closer. Giles makes the bullpen deeper, as Luke Gregerson, last season’s closer, will move back into a setup role with Will Harris and Tony Sipp, who was re-signed to a three-year, $18 million deal.\n\n3. An encore by Keuchel: Lefty Dallas Keuchel won the AL Cy Young Award last season while blossoming into an ace. In additional to being a 20-game winner, he went 15-0 at home at hitter-friendly Minute Maid Park and won his second consecutive Gold Glove, topping American League pitchers with 53 assists.\n\n4. An encore by Correa: Carlos Correa, 21, the first overall pick in the 2012 draft, made his big-league debut June 8. Despite playing in 99 games, he led all shortstops in homers and was the first Astros player to be rookie of the year since Jeff Bagwell in 1991.\n\nJohn Perrotto\n\n***\n\nKansas City Royals\n\n1. Keep the line moving: Their 2015 mantra also works as a bigger-picture rallying cry — carry over the cohesion, timely hitting and excellent defense that were hallmarks of the Royals’ consecutive runs to the World Series. After winning it all and bidding farewell to a few key parts, it’s incumbent on the core of All-Stars Eric Hosmer, Mike Moustakas, Lorenzo Cain, World Series MVP Salvador Perez, Alex Gordon and Alcides Escobar to maintain good health and productivity.\n\n2. Eiland fever: Pitching coach Dave Eiland has received his share of credit for turning hurlers Jeremy Guthrie and Ryan Madson into viable contributors. In 2016, there’s no obvious reclamation project, but Ian Kennedy might prove an interesting pupil. The right-hander received a five-year, $70 million contract, even though he gave up 31 home runs and posted a 4.28 ERA for the San Diego Padres. If Eiland can smooth the rough edges, the rotation could be deep.\n\n3. The right combo: Speed and defense are the Royals’ calling card, and they should get both out of the right-field platoon of Jarrod Dyson and Paulo Orlando. But will the duo hit enough? Orlando had a .269 on-base percentage in 251 plate appearances last year. Dyson, 31, has a lifetime .320 OBP. Will they benefit or be exposed by greater exposure?\n\n4. Good vibrations: The brotherhood that has developed on this mostly homegrown squad is striking. But the kids — and their salaries — are growing up. The club might renegotiate Perez’s now famously below-market contract. Other core members are locked into two-year deals, with most hitting the market after 2017. Will the closing window spark urgency or create distractions?\n\nGabe Lacques\n\nRoyals� Salvador Perez's mom carjacked days before extension\n\n***\n\nLos Angeles Angels\n\n1. Find the right rotation mix: Garrett Richards and Jered Weaver are locks for the rotation, and the same goes for C.J. Wilson if he avoids any setbacks in returning from left shoulder surgery. That leaves Andrew Heaney, Hector Santiago, Matt Shoemaker, Tyler Skaggs and Nick Tropeano for the final two spots. Heaney is a favorite for the No. 4 slot after a strong finish to 2015. Santiago struggled in the second half but should be the No. 5 with a decent spring training. Skaggs is returning from Tommy John elbow surgery, and Shoemaker and Tropeano are depth arms.\n\n2. Get Albert Pujols healthy:After offseason foot surgery, the 36-year-old says he expects to be ready for opening day. That might be optimistic. The Angels need him to contribute. Although he hit 40 home runs last year, Pujols had the lowest batting average and on-base percentage of his career. With six years and $165 million left on his contract, the deal could go from bad to worse quick if he is slow to return to full strength.\n\n3. Speaking of the lineup:\n\nC.J. Cron looked primed for a breakout in 2015 but struggled early and was sent to the minors. He eventually came around but was never a consistent force. He enters spring training with the expectation that he’ll bat fifth or sixth and perhaps start the season at first base if Pujols is not ready or needs to DH.\n\n4. And finally the rest of the lineup: The Angels need a lot to go right with their lineup after Mike Trout and Kole Calhoun. Newcomers Yunel Escobar, Andrelton Simmons, Daniel Nava and Craig Gentry are not impact players at the plate, but they’ll need to get on base and keep the lineup rolling over to ensure the Angels score enough runs this season.\n\nPeter Barzilai\n\n***\n\nMinnesota Twins\n\n1. Sano knowing right field: Miguel Sano made such a big impact last season after being called up from Class AA Chattanooga (Tenn.) and making his big-league debut July 2 that he was named the Twins’ MVP. Though a third baseman in the minors, Sano will be asked to play right field after South Korean slugger Byung Ho Park was signed as a free agent in the offseason. The Twins think Sano, 22, is athletic enough to be adept in right field despite being 6-4 and 260 pounds. The bigger question, though, is whether Sano’s defense will affect his hitting, because he has a chance to be a superstar.\n\n2. Continued rotation improvement: Twins starters had a 4.14 ERA last season, which ranked 16th in the majors, and helped Minnesota go 83-79 following four consecutive seasons with at least 92 losses. The Twins were last in starters’ ERA in 2012 and 2013. If the rotation, led by RHs Ervin Santana, Phil Hughes and Kyle Gibson, takes another step forward this season, the Twins could earn their first postseason berth since 2010.\n\n3. A healthy Perkins: Closer Glen Perkins is a three-time All-Star, but he is a question mark after being limited to 11 games, four saves and a 7.32 ERA in the second half of last season while bothered by neck and back pain. RHs Kevin Jepsen and Trevor May throw hard and should provide a strong bridge from the starters, but neither is a sure thing if needed to close.\n\n4. A Buxton breakout: CF Byron Buxton was the consensus pick as baseball’s top prospect entering last season. But he struggled in a 46-game trial and was sidelined for 21/2 months by a sprained left thumb. But he is 22, and the Twins think he can spark a potentially explosive offense from the leadoff spot.\n\nJohn Perrotto\n\n***\n\nNew York Yankees\n\n1. Sustained veteran success: This is not a young team. Seven of their nine starting position players are over 30. This is a team, however, made up of veterans who are still able to produce at a high level. Alex Rodriguez, 40, had a resurgent year, hitting his most home runs since 2008. Chase Headley, 31, bounced back with 150 hits. Brian McCann, 32, tied a career high in RBI last year. The Yankees have a few key young pieces, but this lineup is made up of aging stars.\n\n2. Masahiro Tanaka’s durability: The Yankees’ $150 million man hasn’t been completely forthright about his injuries since arriving in 2014. He has missed time the last two years and required offseason surgery for a bone spur in his elbow that team officials didn’t know about until the October procedure. Tanaka is their ace, and when healthy he’s nearly lights out. The Yankees need to keep Tanaka healthy for a full season.\n\n3. Get past division contenders: Last year the Yankees were 38-38 against their division rivals. Perhaps more worrisome is that they were 15-23 against the Blue Jays (first place) and the Orioles (third place). The Jays are going to have the best lineup in the league this season, the Red Sox added pitching and will be contenders again and the Orioles will bring back most of their 2015 squad. The East will be the AL’s toughest division.\n\n4. Betances and Miller: New closer Aroldis Chapman has been suspended for the first 30 games stemming from a domestic violence incident. He chose not to appeal the ruling and won’t be eligible to return until May 9. The Yankees will turn again in the first month to Andrew Miller, who had 36 saves last season. Dellin Betances, as dominant as Miller last season, could fill in, too.\n\nMichael Stern\n\nIn Aroldis Chapman case, MLB acted decisively, even without all the answers\n\n***\n\nOakland Athletics\n\n1. The rotation: Sonny Gray is the locked-in No. 1 guy for the A’s, but after him there are a bunch of injury risks. Jesse Hahn had elbow and forearm problems last season but should be healthy. Kendall Graveman is coming off an oblique injury that shut him down in August. Rich Hill will be 36 when the season starts and has been mostly a reliever but will get a shot at a starting job. Chris Bassitt missed time with a shoulder injury. There are lots of question marks and health concerns.\n\n2. Efficiency at the top: Jed Lowrie is slotted to fill the second spot in the batting order behind Billy Burns. Neither Lowrie nor Burns will hit for power, but they get on base and don’t strike out. The centerpiece of any Billy Beane team is efficiency and on-base percentage, and Lowrie and Burns will make contact and get on base. With them starting off the order efficiently, it should set things up nicely for Josh Reddick.\n\n3. Doolittle’s health: Closer Sean Doolittle was an All-Star in 2014 but in 2015 had two trips to the disabled list with shoulder injuries. Without Doolittle, Oakland had 25 blown saves, about half of their opportunities. The A’s brought in Ryan Madson as insurance, but Doolittle needs to return to his 2014 form (89 strikeouts in 62 2/3 innings) to ensure that their save percentage improves from last season’s 52%.\n\n4. Overachieve: The A’s have made a living taking average and slightly above-average players and getting to the playoffs. This year is no different. Oakland’s farm system has a few key pieces, but they are a year or two away. This year the A’s need to do what they’ve always done. Gray, the only true star, is surrounded by role players who need to peak to put the A’s in contention.\n\nMichael Stern\n\n***\n\nSeattle Mariners\n\n1. Veterans must produce: Seattle has the third-oldest team in baseball, and its stars are some of the older players on the squad. This season, the Mariners’ success depends on the heart of the order: Robinson Cano, 33; Nelson Cruz, 35; and Adam Lind, 32. If the three sluggers can find their form, Seattle could be in decent shape.\n\n2. Late-game lock down: Seattle blew 26 saves last season, and its bullpen went 21-36. It had the sixth-worst ERA in the majors at 4.15 and opponents hit .258. The situation wasn’t looking great, so the front office focused on the bullpen this offseason. The projected closer is newcomer Steve Cishek, who is a huge question mark. In seven opportunities early last season for the Miami Marlins, he blew four saves. His strikeouts were way down. He must return to form to lock down the ninth, which Seattle struggled with in 2015.\n\n3. Back up King Felix: Felix Hernandez is the ace of this rotation, but he needs backup. That could come from Taijuan Walker. In his first full season in the majors he went 11-8, finishing strong. After a rocky start Walker went 9-2 holding opponents to a .241 batting average. Newcomer Wade Miley could make an impact. The five-year starter has made a living off of eating innings, pitching more than 190 in each of the last four seasons. But he will have to find his control. His strikeouts were down, and he has averaged about three walks per nine innings in his career.\n\n4. Cruz’s health: Cruz is coming off two of his best years of his career, but has always been injury-prone. He has stayed on the field recently which has led to two years in a row with more than 40 homers, but in 10 years he has started 150 games only three times. He has to stay healthy.\n\nMichael Stern\n\n***\n\nTampa Bay Rays\n\n1. Matt Moore’s strong return: Last season Moore struggled in his return from Tommy John elbow surgery before being demoted. Before his demotion, Moore went 1-3 with an 8.78 ERA, and batters hit .372 against him. He spent time at Class AAA Durham (N.C.) where he was able to get his strikeout stuff back, striking out 12.9 hitters per nine innings. When he came back in his final six starts, he held opponents to a .237 average and struck out 29 in 36 1/3 innings. The Rays will need to rely on their pitching, and Moore’s strong return is crucial.\n\n2. Lock down the ninth: After being selected to his first All-Star Game, Brad Boxberger had a rocky second half, going 0-5, blowing four saves and posting a 4.33 ERA. He struggled with control, walking 32 in 63 innings and threw five wild pitches. Boxberger needs to prove he was the pitcher of 2014 (14.5 strikeouts and 4.7 hits allowed per nine innings) if the Rays want to win.\n\n3. Get runners home: The Rays generated the sixth-fewest runs in the majors in 2015 despite having an average number of hits and batting average. Rays starters received the second-lowest run support in the majors. Tampa Bay was able to get runners on, but they were unable to get them in. There’s no question this lineup is the weakness of the Rays, and pitching will not be able to carry them if they get no run support.\n\n4. Production from the catcher: Curt Casali will get the first shot at the starting job, but Rene Rivera and Hank Conger are waiting in the wings. None have shown promise with a bat. Rivera got a shot last year starting 87 games, but he hit .178 while striking out 86 times. Conger hit .229 with the Houston Astros. Casali hit 10 homers in 38 games in 2015.\n\nMichael Stern\n\n\n\n***\n\nTexas Rangers\n\n1. Desmond finding a home: After a long and frustrating winter, free agent Ian Desmond finally found a home, days after the club’s first-full workout. The twist? The former All-Star shortstop will move to the outfield. After Josh Hamilton’s knee injury, Desmond will play left field while Hamilton recovers. Desmond, who played his entire seven-year career at shortstop, has started one of his 927 career games in the outfield. “As far as swallowing my pride and moving to the outfield, that’s not going to be a problem,” he said.\n\n2. Darvish returning: The Rangers expect Yu Darvish to return from Tommy John elbow surgery around mid-May or early June. He has shown great progress in his first workouts, and the Rangers think he will return to All-Star form. The right-hander, who has 680 strikeouts in 83 starts, last started a game Aug.9, 2014.\n\n3. Staying healthy: For the second consecutive season, the Rangers were hit with the injury bug. They lost more than 1,400 games to the disabled list in 2015 — the most of any club. There were 26 different disabled list stints that included several key players including Darvish, Derek Holland, Adrian Beltre and Delino DeShields, yet the Rangers managed to win the AL West. The return of Darvish and Holland should give the rotation a huge lift — especially for one that used 12 starters.\n\n4. Hamels time: Cole Hamels, 32, was acquired at midseason from the Philadelphia Phillies and will assume the No.1 spot in the rotation. He went 7-1 with a 3.66 ERA with the Rangers in 2015. The trade for the three-time All-Star helped the Rangers rally from an eight-game deficit in the division Aug. 2. This time the Rangers get a full season with Hamels.\n\nScott Boeck\n\nRangers' Yu Darvish anxious to return, take next step in rehab process\n\n***\n\nToronto Blue Jays\n\n\n\n1. Pitching: The Blue Jays have one of the most potent lineups in baseball, but after losing David Price they have a huge hole in their rotation. They will rely on budding star Marcus Stroman to be the ace, but he’s unproven. He has one full year in the majors after being out most of last year with a torn anterior cruciate ligament. In that one season, Stroman had good numbers, going 11-6 in 1302/3 innings and striking out 111, but not ace-caliber numbers. The combination of aging R.A. Dickey and boom-or-bust Marco Estrada doesn’t elicit fear in opposing batters. If the Blue Jays want to win, they’ll need Stroman to lead an aging rotation.\n\n2. Health of stars: Jose Bautista and Edwin Encarnacion will be 35 and 33, respectively. Bautista has a history of injuries (wrist and hip), and Encarnacion missed time with an injury in 2014. The Blue Jays have begun discussing extensions with both sluggers, but 2016 will be a defining year. Both need to stay healthy to make sure the Blue Jays’ strength, their power, stays around.\n\n3. Win on the road: The Blue Jays were lights out at home last season, going 53-28. On the road they played like a .500 team. Away from Rogers Centre their team ERA skyrocketed from 3.22 to 4.41. Dickey was 9-3 at home while striking out 74, but he went 2-8 on the road, where opponents hit .296 against him. If they want to win the AL East, the Jays need to be able to beat teams on the road with more consistent pitching.\n\n4. Success against AL East: The Blue Jays are in arguably the AL’s best division. Last season Toronto won by going 42-34 against the division, including 13-6 vs. the second-place Yankees, who have a chance to threaten Toronto for the top spot this season.\n\nMichael Stern\n\nTroy Tulowitzki still seething over Rockie exit from Denver", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/03/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nhl/red-wings/2022/05/06/1997-detroit-red-wings-anaheim-mighty-ducks-game-3-stanleytown/9673787002/", "title": "Road to Stanleytown: Mighty sweet victory in Game 3 puts 1997 Red ...", "text": "Gene Myers\n\nSpecial to Detroit Free Press\n\nIn the spring of 1997 — a quarter-century ago — the Detroit Red Wings embarked on their quest to end a 42-year Stanley Cup drought.\n\nThe Free Press has commemorated that historic quest with a new book: “Stanleytown: The Inside Story of How the Stanley Cup Returned to the Motor City After 41 Frustrating Seasons.”\n\nDay 21: May 6, 1997\n\nThe backstory: Gordie, we’re not in Hockeytown anymore! The Western Conference semifinals shifted to Southern California for Game 3 and that meant 10:30 p.m. face-offs, warrior princesses and new heroes. Could the Red Wings put a three-games-to-none stranglehold on the Mighty Ducks? Could a Wings-Ducks game consist of only 60 minutes? Could Slava Kozlov and Doug Brown continue lighting the lamp? All three answers turned out to be yes — but the next morning’s water cooler conversation and sports-talk radio focused just as much on a wardrobe malfunction years before the term gained popularity and long before the explosion of social media.\n\n[ Red Wings face roster decisions: Debating who stays and who goes in 2022 ]\n\nFollow every game: Live NHL Scores\n\nGame 3: With their beaks against the wall, the Ducks built a two-goal lead in the first period — the first two-goal lead in the series — and for a switch, the Wings were the ones wailing about the officiating. The Ducks’ mostly quiet superstars — Paul Kariya at 11:19 and Teemu Selanne at 12:09 — scored 5-on-3 power-play goals. It all started at 9:34, when Vladimir Konstantinov committed an obvious tripping penalty. No problem there. But 62 seconds later, referee Bill McCreary slapped goalie Mike Vernon with a high-sticking penalty. Vernon skated to the ref, chewed him out and received a 10-minute misconduct. Kariya scored soon after on a one-timer from an impossible angle over Vernon’s stick-side shoulder. On the ensuing face-off, Nicklas Lidstrom raised his gloves and stick high on Selanne as he cruised along the boards. The Wings bench went nuts when Lidstrom was hit with a high-sticking penalty with 1:02 left on Vernon’s minor. Coach Scotty Bowman motioned that Selanne took a dive. Soon after, Kariya fed Selanne for a 2-0 lead, and the frenzied fans at the Pond quacked up. The night’s dramatics were only getting started. Kozlov, whose goal ended Game 2 in the third overtime, scored on a power play at 15:47. He won a battle along the boards, got off a shot, collected the rebound and fired it high past Mikhail Shtalenkov. In the second period, Ted Drury, after missing Game 2 with a nerve injury, restored the Ducks’ two-goal lead. But with the fans chanting “USA! USA!” as the Russians swarmed during a power play, Kozlov blasted a shot off a Duck and Igor Larionov poked the carom home. At 16:28, Brown tied it at 3 by scoring in his second straight game. The Wings outshot the Ducks, 23-6, in the period. And the onslaught continued in the final period. Sergei Fedorov got behind defenseman Dan Trebil, one of the rookie’s several costly mistakes, and beat Shtalenkov at 3:34. About 20 seconds later, Fedorov hit Kozlov with a pass, and he finished off a 90-foot breakaway with a backhand move. It was Kozlov’s fifth goal in his last five games. The Wings had their first two-goal lead and before long a three-game lead.\n\nWorth noting: Free Press headline: Mighty sweet. … Kozlov (two goals, one assist), Fedorov (one goal, two assists) and Konstantinov (three assists) posted three-point nights. … “I’m so happy for Kozzie,” Larionov said, “because he was struggling all season long. He was kind of in the doghouse, but lately he has played the best hockey I’ve ever seen him play in Detroit. It’s hard for a young guy sometimes. I just told him this is the time to play the great hockey he can play.” … Bowman started with a new superstar line: Brendan Shanahan-Fedorov-Steve Yzerman. But a few shifts later the Russian Five were back together. … Grinder Joe Kocur didn’t play after he lost an edge early in the first period and crashed back-first into the boards. … Brown, 32, played only 49 regular-season games and none in the first round against St. Louis. His world changed against the Ducks. During a break in the series, he even caught a foul ball at Dodger Stadium. “You just keep waiting for your chance,” Brown said. “You have to keep believing in yourself and working hard. You try to practice and show the coaches what you can do and hope your number is called. It’s awful sitting out.”\n\nGAME 2:Slava Kozlov ends classic marathon in 3OT\n\nGAME 1:Surprise hero lifts Wings over Ducks in OT\n\nOff the ice: Years before Janet Jackson’s “wardrobe malfunction” at the Super Bowl, the Stanley Cup playoffs endured its version before Game 3. New Zealand actress Lucy Lawless, star of the syndicated “Xena: Warrior Princess” television show, wore a revealing costume with an Uncle Sam motif to sing the national anthem. This was how Steve Schrader reported the aftermath in the Free Press: “How revealing? As she hit the final notes of the anthem, Lawless threw open her blue blazer and, well, spilled out of the top of her strapless red costume for all of the television audience to see. The next day, Lawless pleaded ignorance during an interview with Dick Purtan on WOMC-FM (104.3). ‘You mean I’ve been flashing on national TV?’ she said. “I am horrified. It did not really come down, did it? Only a little popped out? Big deal.’ When Purtan’s crew described the incident in detail for her, Lawless said, ‘Oh, you lie. … I don’t need that kind of publicity. I get plenty of attention as it is. That costume was too damn small. My mother will cry.”\n\nFamous last words: Ducks coach Ron Wilson remained irked that the Wings fired his father, Larry, and an uncle, Johnny, as coaches back in the day. Wilson pointed out he was born one month after the Wings won their last Stanley Cup in 1955. (Johnny was a left wing on that team, but he was dealt with Tony Leswick, Glen Skov and Benny Woit to Chicago after the season, a trade that produced almost nothing for the Wings.) “They haven’t won a Cup since I was born,” Wilson said. “Maybe that has something to do with it. Maybe that’s an omen. We just want to make sure it keeps going.”\n\nRelive the glory: The Free Press has crafted a 208-page, full-color, hardcover collector’s book with fresh insights and dynamic storytelling about the 1996-97 Wings.

From established stars Manny Machado and Eric Hosmer to one of MLB's top farm systems, the future is bright.\n\nOn the pitching side, the midseason acquisition of Mike Clevinger gives them a legitimate ace to go along with Dinelson Lamet and Chris Paddack, with top prospects MacKenzie Gore, Luis Patiño, Ryan Weathers and Adrian Morejon waiting in the wings.\n\nPrediction: Next title in 2022\n\n2. Seattle Mariners (44 years, 0 titles)\n\nPerhaps the most disappointing fact for Mariners fans is that they had ace Felix Hernandez for 15 seasons and never once made the playoffs. Current GM Jerry DiPoto is known for his unending appetite for making trades (and never really making much progress), but it does look like there's a pretty solid foundation at long last.\n\nOf their key players, only 3B Kyle Seager is over 30. Young infielders J.P. Crawford and Evan White are AL Gold Glove finalists. CF Kyle Lewis is the favorite for AL Rookie of the Year. And in the minors, the M's have two of the game's top-five overall prospects in OFs Julio Rodriguez, 19, and Jarred Kelenic, 21 -- who should both be ready to contribute next season. Pitching, however, remains an issue.\n\nPrediction: Next title in 2027\n\n3. Cleveland Indians (72 years since last title in 1948)\n\nThe Indians came oh-so-close to winning it all in 2016, needing only a victory in Game 6 or 7 at home to close out the Cubs. With a young core and outstanding pitching, it looked like they'd be back fairly soon. Even though top starters Corey Kluber, Trevor Bauer and Clevinger are no longer in Cleveland, Shane Bieber has emerged as the team's ace of the future.\n\nThe big question for the Indians is what happens to All-Star shortstop Francisco Lindor, who becomes a free agent after the 2021 season. Will they trade him and start rebuilding? Or will they make one last push for a championship?\n\nPrediction: Next title in 2030\n\n4. New York Mets (34 years since last title in 1986)\n\nThe Mets are seemingly close to getting a new ownership group in place. That change could make a greater impact than anything they might be able to do on the field for the next few years.\n\n1B Pete Alonso, OF Michael Conforto and SS Amed Rosario are solid building blocks, but the Mets may have missed the window to challenge for a title while Jacob deGrom and Noah Syndergaard are at the height of their powers. The farm system doesn't look like it's going to be much help for a while.\n\nPrediction: Next title in 2035\n\n5. Detroit Tigers (36 years since last title in 1984)\n\nThe Tigers had quite a run under manager Jim Leyland, especially from 2011-13 when they reached the ALCS all three years and won it once. But a lack of reliable relief pitching always seemed to be the Achilles heel that kept the Tigers from winning it all.\n\nFormer AL MVP Miguel Cabrera powered the Tigers offense during those good times, but he's now a shell of his former self as the team has begun rebuilding. Cabrera is still under contract through at least 2023 -- so it might take a while to get everything back on track. When they do, it will likely be on the strength of a talented core of young starting pitchers: Casey Mize, Matt Manning, Tarik Skubal and Beau Burrows.\n\nPrediction: Next title in 2037\n\n6. Milwaukee Brewers (52 years, no titles)\n\nThe Brewers have made the postseason for three consecutive years, a first in franchise history. But a closer look at where they've finished in the NL Central during those years -- first, second, fourth -- reveals a disturbing trend.\n\nThey broke the bank for MVP Christian Yelich, signing him through 2028, so the challenge will be finding ways to build around him. We've already seen how difficult that's been for the Los Angeles Angels and their superstar, Mike Trout. 2B Keston Hiura and RPs Josh Hader and Devin Williams have yet to turn 27, but Milwaukee will need a greater infusion of young talent to get Yelich that title.\n\nPrediction: Next title in 2039\n\n7. Texas Rangers (60 years, no titles)\n\nThe Rangers lost back-to-back World Series in 2010-11 and haven't won a playoff series since. In 2020, they moved into a brand-new stadium and finished with the worst record in the American League.\n\nThe old open-air Globe Life Park was hitter-friendly. The new retractable-roof Globe Life Field seemed to favor the pitchers. There's a metaphor in there somewhere. Until the Rangers figure out their identity, they're likely stuck in the middle.\n\nPrediction: Next title in 2045\n\n8. Pittsburgh Pirates (41 years since last title in 1979)\n\nNo team's fanbase has been tortured more than the Pirates'. And it's not even close. There was a brief blip of contention from 2013-15 when they made the postseason (however briefly), but for the most part it's been continuous suffering ever since young Barry Bonds left town in 1992.\n\nThe Tyler Glasnow/Austin Meadows-for-Chris Archer trade sent the franchise into a downward spiral and will continue to haunt the Pirates for years. Maybe decades. There's no loaded farm system like the Padres and Mariners have. There's no former MVP to build around. There's no new ownership group waiting in the wings. But at least there's a gorgeous ballpark.\n\nPrediction: Next title in 2060\n\nFollow Steve Gardner on Twitter @SteveAGardner.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/10/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/columnist/bob-nightengale/2022/09/25/mlb-playoffs-chance-trade-deadline-disappointments-shine/8109823001/", "title": "MLB playoffs are chance for trade deadline disappointments to shine", "text": "PHOENIX — The San Diego Padres should have clinched a playoff berth by now, maybe even scaring the Los Angeles Dodgers with their prized trade-deadline acquisitions.\n\nThe New York Yankees should have a deep starting rotation, all set to overcome the Houston Astros in the playoffs.\n\nThe Minnesota Twins should have clinched the AL Central and be selling playoff tickets.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/bucks/2021/04/29/fifty-years-after-bucks-nba-title-milwaukee-waits-another/7158216002/", "title": "The 1971 title was great, but it's been a half century of Milwaukee ...", "text": "NOTE: This story was updated on Jan. 18, 2022, to make it free for all readers.\n\nAnd then what happened?\n\nIt's a popular internet jest today, attached to highlight video clips or celebration of a small success that was followed by a bigger letdown. The Bucks win a game by 25, but a basketball Twitter account is fawning over a violent dunk by an opposing player? Fine. \"And then what happened?\"\n\nFifty years after the Milwaukee Bucks won the 1971 NBA title, sports fans in Milwaukee have been facing some variation of that question ever since. Heck, Milwaukee sports teams have only been in the championship round of major pro sports twice since the Bucks crushed the Baltimore Bullets, 4-0, for the championship, and one of those was back in 1974.\n\nIt's been a half-century of quiet. We're cursed or something, right?\n\nFollow every game: Live NBA Scores\n\nIf we're talking all major pro sports and considering only championships, Milwaukee's length of wait is behind only San Diego and Buffalo, whose last titles came with the 1963 and 1965 AFL championships.\n\nSacramento hasn't won a crown in men's major sports since the Kings arrived in 1985, although the Sacramento Monarchs won the WNBA title in 2005.\n\nCharlotte hasn't had a title since pro sports arrived with the Hornets in 1988. That's likewise true for Orlando, which hasn't won a title since the Magic joined the NBA in 1989.\n\nIn MLB, only one older franchise (Texas Rangers, founded in 1961) has yet to win a World Series, and only two (Cleveland, last winning in 1948) have faced a longer overall drought than the Brewers.\n\nIn the NBA, five franchises have faced longer droughts than Milwaukee's 49-year wait: Sacramento (69 years, dating to its days in Rochester), Atlanta (62), Phoenix (never in 52 years) and the Los Angeles Clippers (never in 50 years).\n\nFor those unfamiliar, here is our story of woe.\n\nOK, we probably should acknowledge the Packers first\n\nWe're probably not fooling anyone when we complain about lack of sports success. Sure, the Green Bay Packers play two hours to the north (unless it's a Gold Package game day, then it's a lot more than two hours), but they represent one of the most recognizable and successful franchises in pro sports, and Milwaukeeans love the Packers.\n\nWhile Packers fans have gotten antsy that the haul isn't more substantial, Green Bay has hoisted four Lombardi trophies, and two since that 1971 Bucks title. The franchise has made nine NFC championship games since 1995 alone, with so many divisional titles in that stretch (14) that it barely registers to anyone when it happens.\n\nIn 1970, the Milwaukee Brewers arrived in town, mending some of the wound left behind when the Milwaukee Braves left town after 1965. The Braves won the 1957 World Series title and didn't endure a losing season in 13 years. Surely, the Brewers would ascend to those heights at some point, right?\n\nAt the same time, the Bucks had one of the biggest names in pro basketball (Lew Alcindor then, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar shortly thereafter), and he didn't even turn 24 years old until late in the championship season. Surely this was just the start of something special. Bob Dandridge and Lucius Allen were 23, Greg Smith and Dick Cunningham 24, Jon McGlocklin 27. Sure, Oscar Robertson was 32, but he wasn't slowing down.\n\nThe question wasn't when the Bucks would win another championship. It was how many.\n\nThe encore years go wrong for the Bucks\n\nThe Bucks still won 63 games in 1971-72 but couldn't get past the Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference finals. Jerry West was hurt in 1971 when the teams met in the same spot; he wasn't this time, and Jim McMillian had blossomed into a major contributor.\n\nIn 1972-73, Milwaukee won 60 games and was absolutely stunned by the 47-35 Golden State Warriors in the conference semifinals. Maybe Milwaukee would win only two or three titles instead of, like, eight?\n\nMilwaukee got back to the NBA finals in 1974, going 8-1 against the Lakers and Bulls heading into the finals against Boston. Abdul-Jabbar hit a famous skyhook to beat the Celtics at the Boston Garden in double overtime of Game 6. But when the series shifted back to Milwaukee, Boston toppled the Bucks, 102-87.\n\nRobertson wound up retiring.\n\nSpeaking of wounds that took a long time to heal, Abdul-Jabbar asked to leave town shortly before the 1975 season, believing he and the Milwaukee environment weren't compatible. We had just started Summerfest, too, and the Domes had been completed if you like, you know, plants.\n\nThe deal got completed after the year to send him to the Lakers, where Abdul-Jabbar won five more NBA championships and set a record for career scoring that still hasn't been broken. The Bucks haven't been back to the finals since.\n\nMeanwhile, the summers weren't much better\n\nThe Bucks got a solid return in the Abdul-Jabbar deal but mostly became a sub-.500 team in the short term.\n\nAt least they tasted championship-caliber play. The Brewers still weren't close during their first eight seasons in town. But then came 1978. General manager Harry Dalton took the reins and acquired MVP candidate Larry Hisle. Mike Caldwell was a Cy Young candidate. Manager George Bamberger and \"Bambi's Bombers\" became a thing.\n\nThe Brewers won 93 games in 1978 and 95 in 1979. Those are playoff-caliber numbers today, but at that point, you basically had to win 100 to get to the ALCS. They finished 6½ games out — in third place — in 1978. Eight games out in 1979. A full 17 out in 1980 despite a quality 86-win season. A breakthrough was coming, but it was hard-earned.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bucks clawed their way back to relevance. In the first full year under coach/scientist Don Nelson, the \"Green and Growing Bucks\" reached the conference semifinals, kicking off a 10-year run in which the Bucks reached the conference semis or finals nine times. Nellieball had arrived!\n\nMarques Johnson, Sidney Moncrief, Junior Bridgeman, Bob Lanier, Brian Winters, Mickey Johnson and Quinn Buckner all on the same team!\n\nBut Milwaukee simply couldn't break through. Philadelphia — a recurring annoyance — won Game 7 of the 1981 Eastern Conference semifinals, 99-98, and brought a 60-win Milwaukee season to an end. Philly got Milwaukee again in 1982 and 1983 before Boston got honors in the 1984 conference finals. The Bucks won 59 games in 1984-85, but the 76ers rudely swept Milwaukee away in the conference semis.\n\nOh, and Michael Jordan showed up. Milwaukee may have gotten past him as a rookie in the 1985 playoffs (that was our favorite part of \"The Last Dance\"), but the Eastern Conference was eventually going to belong to our southern neighbors.\n\nThe closest call for a Milwaukee title since Kareem\n\nThe Brewers' breakthrough came in the second half of a strike-shortened 1981 season. Rollie Fingers was MVP and Cy Young, although the Yankees got the best of the Brewers in the divisional series format, 3-2.\n\nStill: Cecil Cooper, Robin Yount, Ted Simmons, Ben Oglivie, Jim Gantner, Gorman Thomas, Paul Molitor, Caldwell and Pete Vuckovich all on the same team!\n\nHarvey Kuenn took over as Brewers manager early in the 1982 season and Harvey's Wallbangers got to work, winning 95 games and holding off the Orioles on the last day of the regular season to win the American League East.\n\nBut in September, Fingers was injured and missed the rest of the year.\n\nThey defeated the Angels anyway in a thrilling five-game AL Championship Series. Milwaukee was headed to its first World Series, then took a 3-2 lead in the final showdown with the Cardinals.\n\nThe Brewers needed to win only one more game in St. Louis to bring the title home. But the Cardinals won Game 6, 13-1, and Game 7, 6-3. The Brewers got a parade anyway, which is more than you can say for the Bucks in 1971.\n\nBut the Brewers haven't been back to the World Series since.\n\nAt least the Bucks finally dismissed the 76ers in a seven-game Eastern Conference semis in 1986, and then again in the 1987 first round, 3-2. Too bad the otherworldly Celtics were waiting both times.\n\nBy 1988, Milwaukee had a new arena for the Bucks, but Don Nelson was gone. \"I feel that I am the Milwaukee Bucks,\" he said during a 1987 interview with the New York Daily News, and that didn't sit well with owner Herb Kohl. Nelson resigned, and Del Harris took over.\n\nThe Bucks lost in the Eastern Conference semis in 1989, then didn't win another playoff series until 2001. For seven seasons from 1991-1998, Milwaukee didn't reach the playoffs at all.\n\nThe '90s weren't great on the diamond, either\n\nThe Brewers' tour through the mid-to-late 1980s included several unremarkable seasons and one crazy \"Team Streak\" campaign in 1987, which featured a no-hitter, a legendary winning streak to start the year, Paul Molitor's hitting streak and Teddy Higuera dominating. It still wasn't a playoff year.\n\nIn 1992, Milwaukee briefly snapped back to life with a 92-win season but finished four games out of the playoffs. The next 12 Brewers seasons were sub-.500, and Milwaukee couldn't take advantage of an expanded MLB playoff system adopted in 1994.\n\nThe construction of a new stadium with a retractable roof was marred by a tragic crane collapse that killed three workers and delayed the opening of Miller Park a year, to 2001.\n\nNew home in 2001, but same struggles\n\nThe new stadium's opening, coupled with a pretty fun Bucks team in 2001, briefly gave Milwaukee its sports buzz again. The Bucks, led by coach George Karl and the \"big three\" of Ray Allen, Glenn Robinson and Sam Cassell, finally won the franchise's first playoff series since 1989, then won a seven-game thriller over Charlotte to get into the finals against ... aw, man, it's Philadelphia again.\n\nThe series went seven games and ended with a controversial suspension and notable foul disparity. Philadelphia and star point guard Allen Iverson won the seventh game.\n\nThe Bucks were on the cusp of another 17 years without a playoff series win, including eight first-round exits. In that stretch, Milwaukee did occasionally get high lottery picks, but players such as Andrew Bogut (No. 1 in 2005), Yi Jianlian (No. 6 in 2007), Joe Alexander (No. 8 in 2008), Brandon Jennings (No. 10 in 2009), Jabari Parker (No. 2 in 2014) and Thon Maker (No. 10 in 2016) never achieved superstar status, or in most cases, anything resembling it. Bogut became a rock-solid contributor for seven seasons and borderline all-star, but injuries derailed his career.\n\nThe Bucks were treading water. At least they drafted this teenager from Greece in 2013 with a very hard-to-pronounce last name. He might turn out.\n\nThe Brewers are back, baby!\n\nIn 2008, the Brewers were finally back in the playoffs after a 26-year drought. With the midseason acquisition of CC Sabathia and the 1-2 punch of Prince Fielder and Ryan Braun in the lineup, the Brewers were good enough to get back into the playoffs. A dramatic win over the Cubs on the final day of the season gave the Brewers 90 wins and a wild-card berth.\n\nThe playoffs themselves ... ugh. Can we please be done with Philadelphia?\n\nThe Brewers weren't done there, though. In 2011, Milwaukee won the division for the first time since 1982, then won a heart-stopping fifth game of the divisional series over Arizona. The Brewers were so close to the World Series! But St. Louis, the team that toppled Milwaukee's dream in 1982, interrupted the ride again with a six-game win in the NLCS.\n\nFinally, both are good at the same time\n\nIn 2018, both the Bucks and Brewers had MVPs on their roster.\n\nThe Brewers acquired Christian Yelich before the 2018 season, and all he did was win the National League MVP award and help the Brewers win another division title (defeating the Cubs in Game 163) and an NLCS berth (that again ended in heartbreak, a seven game loss to the Dodgers).\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo blossomed into a superstar for the Bucks. He was a force by 2018, even though the Bucks lost in seven games to the Celtics in the opening round of the playoffs. Under new coach Mike Budenholzer and in the new Fiserv Forum in 2018-19, the team won 60 games. Giannis won MVP, the Bucks won their first two playoff series and then took a 2-0 lead on Toronto in the Eastern Conference Finals. That's where another fun ride ended.\n\nToronto won the series (and the subsequent championship). Though Giannis was an MVP again the following year and the Bucks again had the best record in the league, Milwaukee couldn't get out of the Eastern Conference semifinals against Miami.\n\nThe team appears willing to sacrifice regular-season success for postseason preparation in 2020-21, and Giannis has signed to stay in Milwaukee (meaning he wasn't going to follow in Abdul-Jabbar's footsteps). But Milwaukee remains on the lookout for its first finals trip since 1974.\n\nYelich, who finished second in the MVP voting in 2019, was injured late in the season and missed the wild-card game, a gut-wrenching loss to eventual World Series champion Washington that featured an eighth-inning collapse.\n\nBut he, too, signed to stay long term in Milwaukee before the 2020 season, which was marred by a pandemic, a dramatically shortened schedule and overall offensive struggles for the Brewers, even though they did manage a playoff spot with a losing record.\n\nPlus, Milwaukee has still had its triumphs.\n\nThe Milwaukee Wave indoor soccer team won its first league championship in 1998 and has racked up six more since, including the 2019 crown.\n\nThe Milwaukee Admirals hockey team won the 2004 Calder Cup and the USHL title in 1976.\n\nHeck, even in 2020, the Milwaukee Milkmen independent baseball team won the championship in the fledgling American Association of Professional Baseball.\n\nMoreover, while the Brewers' offensive struggles have continued into the earliest days of the 2021 season, they're still off to a good start as they seek to continue an unprecedented run of postseason appearances. Perhaps this is also, in fact, the Bucks' year to break through.\n\nWe'll see what happens.\n\nJR Radcliffe can be reached at (262) 361-9141 or jradcliffe@gannett.com.

It’s a shocking development at Hollywood’s biggest company.\n\nBob Chapek, who replaced Iger in 2020 as CEO, is stepping down immediately.\n\n“We thank Bob Chapek for his service to Disney over his long career, including navigating the company through the unprecedented challenges of the pandemic,” Susan Arnold, Chairman of the Board for Disney, said in a statement on Sunday night. “The Board has concluded that as Disney embarks on an increasingly complex period of industry transformation, Bob Iger is uniquely situated to lead the Company through this pivotal period.”\n\nInvestors cheered the news, sending Disney shares up 9% Monday after the stock has lost roughly 36% of its value this year.\n\nThe announcement, while surprising to the media industry, comes at a time of great evolution for Disney. The company is coming off a lackluster earnings report that showed growth for its streaming endeavors. However, that came at a great cost. Disney’s streaming business lost $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter. That report sent Disney’s stock tumbling after a year of sluggish-to-bad performance.\n\nChapek’s short tenure\n\nChapek guided Disney through the pandemic, one of the most tumultuous periods in the company’s nearly 100-year history, but ultimately Disney decided that its future was in better hands with Iger.\n\nAway from the pandemic, Chapek had a short but bumpy tenure as the head of Disney. Chapek, who served as chairman of Disney Parks, Experiences and Products before taking over for Iger, found himself dealing with issues regarding pay with Scarlett Johansson, one of the company’s biggest stars, as well as Disney’s battles with Florida, and its own employees, regarding the state’s controversial bill restricting certain LGBTQ topics in the classroom.\n\nThat, in particular, was a flashpoint for Chapek’s stint at Disney. In March, he was forced to apologize for his silence on Florida’s controversial bill after initially declining to comment on it.\n\n“Speaking to you, reading your messages, and meeting with you have helped me better understand how painful our silence was,” Chapek wrote in a letter to employees.\n\nChapek spent weeks doing damage control, telling employees that Disney was “increasing our support for advocacy groups to combat similar legislation in other states” and that the company is “hard at work creating a new framework for our political giving that will ensure our advocacy better reflects our values.”\n\nHis public stance was in stark contrast to Iger, who took a public stance against the Florida bill.\n\n“A lot of these issues are not necessarily political,” Iger told CNN host Chris Wallace in March. “It’s about right and wrong. So, I happen to feel and I tweeted an opinion about the ‘Don’t Say Gay’ bill in Florida. To me, it wasn’t about politics. It is about what is right and what is wrong, and that just seemed wrong. It seemed potentially harmful to kids.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'It's about right and wrong': Ex-Disney CEO on why he spoke out about bill 01:55 - Source: CNN\n\nIger returns\n\nIger has an almost mythical status as the leader of Disney (DIS). He spent 15 years as CEO and was instrumental in acquiring major brands like Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm, the home to Star Wars. Iger also closed the $71 billion deal to buy most of 21st Century Fox and kicked off the streaming revolution at Disney (DIS) with the creation of Disney (DIS)+ in November 2019.\n\nHe stayed on as executive chairman directing the company’s creative endeavors, then officially left the company — after nearly 50 years — at the end of last year.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Bob Iger: Disney buying Twitter 'would've been irresponsible' 01:49 - Source: CNN Business\n\nDisney said Sunday that Iger has agreed to serve as CEO for two years with “a mandate from the Board to set the strategic direction for renewed growth and to work closely with the Board in developing a successor to lead the Company at the completion of his term.”\n\nThe move is also surprising since Chapek just renewed his contract. The company’s board of directors unanimously voted to extend Chapek’s contract as CEO for another three years, the company said in June. Chapek’s new contract began in July and was set to run until 2025.\n\nAlso, it appeared that Iger was set in retirement with his legacy as one of Disney’s most notable and successful CEOs. Now, he’s back.\n\n“I am extremely optimistic for the future of this great company and thrilled to be asked by the Board to return as its CEO,” Iger said in a statement Sunday. “Disney and its incomparable brands and franchises hold a special place in the hearts of so many people around the globe — most especially in the hearts of our employees, whose dedication to this company and its mission is an inspiration.”\n\nIger added that he is “deeply honored to be asked to again lead this remarkable team, with a clear mission focused on creative excellence to inspire generations through unrivaled, bold storytelling.”\n\n–CNN’s Jordan Valinsky contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Frank Pallotta"], "publish_date": "2022/11/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/30/media/bob-iger-disney-successor/index.html", "title": "Bob Iger's biggest challenge at Disney: Finding the next Bob Iger ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nBob Iger has a lot on his to do list in his second round as Disney’s CEO.\n\nThe 71 year-old newly unretired executive has to make the company’s costly streaming business profitable, jump start its floundering stock price and restore the magic in Disney’s culture after Bob Chapek’s tumultuous tenure. And he’s got to do it in just two years.\n\nHis greatest challenge? Finding the next Bob Iger.\n\nWhen Iger stunned the media world last week by returning to the company he led for 15 years, the announcement came with a mandate. Disney (DIS) said that he not only has to “set the strategic direction for renewed growth” at the company, but also has “to work closely with the Board in developing a successor to lead the Company at the completion of his term.”\n\nThe latter is arguably more difficult. There’s no clear heir apparent to Disney’s media kingdom. And despite being one of Disney’s most successful CEOs, Iger —who previously pushed back a planned retirement before stepping down and anointing Chapek in 2020 — doesn’t have the best track record when it comes to succession plans.\n\nLooking through Disney’s executive ranks, there are a lot of contenders, but it’s hard to say who is the best fit. The job has a big learning curve for whoever takes it and it’s not even two weeks into Iger’s new tenure. He just stepped foot on Disney headquarters Monday.\n\nBut someone has to take over. That person could of course come from outside the company, but here’s a list of some potential contenders currently at Disney.\n\nJosh D’Amaro\n\nLet’s start with Josh D’Amaro, chairman of Disney’s Parks, Experiences and Products, who took over that role from Chapek when he became CEO. D’Amaro has been with Disney since 1998 and currently leads one of the company’s core businesses.\n\nD’Amaro is well known (and even beloved) by Disney park enthusiasts. This helped him avoid a lot of the criticism regarding the parks, including rising prices, that fans aimed at Chapek.\n\nBut Iger and the board may be hesitant to select another chairman of Parks to head the entire company given the experience with Chapek.\n\nAlan Bergman\n\nAlan Bergman, chairman of Disney Studios Content, has been with the company since 1996 and was president of Disney Studios from 2005 to 2019.\n\nThe run of blockbusters from Marvel, Pixar and Star Wars over the last decade has his imprint on it, but can Bergman bring that success to the broader company?\n\nDisney’s problems are bigger than just producing quality and creative content right now (even though Iger thinks that is very important), so Bergman may not be the best fit.\n\nChristine McCarthy\n\nChristine McCarthy, the company’s Chief Financial Officer, has been with Disney since 2000, and could be a candidate if Iger and the board are looking for someone more financially focused.\n\nWhat Disney needs more than anything right now is to get its stock price back up, and that means making its streaming business profitable. The company also may want a leader who can look holistically at the cost structure of the entire company.\n\nBut as Matthew Belloni pointed out in Puck this week, McCarthy has “no creative experience,” and was “Chapek’s right-hand for three years.” That could hinder her chances rather than help.\n\nJimmy Pitaro & Dana Walden\n\nThere also are two executives from Disney’s TV side: Jimmy Pitaro, chairman of ESPN and Sports Content, and Dana Walden, chairman of Disney General Entertainment Content.\n\nMaybe Iger sees the future in one of these two since he himself came from the TV side at ABC, and Pitaro and Walden have both proven to be steady leaders in their roles.\n\nBut Pitaro, who has been at Disney since 2010, leads ESPN, which is losing cable subscribers, and was the focus of concern from Dan Loeb — an activist investor who has argued that the company should spin off the sports network.

The other candidates have been seeped in Disney’s culture much longer.\n\nThe next Bob Iger\n\nIs it even possible to replace Bob Iger?\n\nThat will be one of the most pressing questions of his next two years. It’s tremendously difficult to find someone to lead Disney because it’s not really like any other company.\n\nDisney is a lifestyle brand, beloved by millions around the world, and it sets the tempo for the entire media industry.\n\nSince its 1923 founding, Disney has had a fair share of charismatic leaders who could mix magic with money-making even in the shadow of its founder and namesake.\n\nNow, the board and Iger have to find someone who can not only push the company into its next 100 years, but also maintain and build on Iger’s legacy.", "authors": ["Frank Pallotta"], "publish_date": "2022/11/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/21/media/iger-disney-fix/index.html", "title": "Can Bob Iger fix Disney? | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nBob Iger is returning to Disney as CEO, retaking the reins of a company that’s very different from the one he led when he stepped down as chief executive in February 2020.\n\nWith $1.5 billion in streaming losses last quarter alone, park fans unhappy, sinking cable networks like ESPN dealing with cord cutting, and a moribund stock price, Iger has his work cut out for him.\n\nDisney’s problems are vast, and fixing them all may not be possible, particularly in the two years that Iger said he’d dedicate to the company in his return to the C-suite.\n\nBut If anyone can bring back the magic to the Walt Disney Company, the company believes Bob Iger may be uniquely qualified to do it.\n\nStreaming\n\nIn a shocking move, Bob Iger is returning as Disney's CEO. Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nThe first priority: the streaming business.\n\nDisney’s streaming service — which includes ESPN+, Hulu and most importantly, Disney+ — had been the most vital part of the company’s vast media kingdom. It served as a life raft for Disney in the early days of the pandemic — one of the most tumultuous periods in the company’s history — and grew to 100 million subscribers in just 16 months. Now, that business has become an anchor that’s weighing it down.\n\nThe company reported earlier this month that Disney+ exceeded Wall Street’s expectations for subscriber growth. But that came at a great cost for the company: Disney said its streaming business lost $1.5 billion in the quarter, news that sent Disney’s stock tumbling.\n\nThe days of “growing streaming at any cost” are over for Wall Street, and now Iger and the rest of Disney’s leadership have to prove to investors that its streaming business can achieve profitability while also continuing to grow.\n\nThis more than anything else is what will move the needle on Disney’s stock, which is down roughly 40% for the year.\n\n“He needs to refocus streaming, as well as other parts of the company, back to the core Disney consumer,” Trip Miller, a Disney investor and managing partner at hedge fund Gullane Capital Partners, told CNN Business. “This consumer is family-friendly, global and multi-generational. That’s the beauty of Disney, right? It’s not just kids, it’s not just adults. When it’s working, it can be everybody.”\n\nThat refocusing effort is easier said than done, especially considering that other parts of the company are not as solid as they used to be.\n\nESPN and movies\n\nDisney's streaming efforts are deeply important to the company's bottom line. Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images\n\nDisney’s media networks are struggling as cord cutting accelerates and once lucrative outlets like ESPN lose viewership. That has hurt Disney’s entire business.\n\nThis was a major point of contention for Dan Loeb, the activist investor and Third Point CEO who made headlines in August when he suggested “a strong case can be made that the ESPN business should be spun off to shareholders with an appropriate debt load.”\n\nLoeb eventually had a change of heart, but the point was made: streaming is the new frontier for Disney, and Iger needs to prove that it can make money while Disney’s legacy networks continue to shrink.\n\nAs for the company’s studio entertainment, when Iger stepped down in early 2020, it came after a year in which Disney had seven films make $1 billion each at the global box office. Compare that to this year, which has had just two movies make $1 billion each at the global box office across all studios, according to Comscore (SCOR).\n\nThat fall shows how much streaming and the pandemic severely disrupted the movie industry. Although recovering, box office sales continue to underperform the year before the pandemic.\n\nNow, Disney is trying to figure how big releases from signature brands like Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm fit in a new theatrical ecosystem.\n\nCulture and image\n\nIger has to fix not just financial miscues but also cultural ones at Disney. Jesse Grant/Getty Images for Disney\n\nIger also has to correct the symbolic miscues that his successor — and now predecessor — Bob Chapek made during his run.\n\nChapek did a good job overseeing the parks unit during a pandemic. But once the Covid restrictions were lifted, the company raised prices and launched new initiatives, such as the pricy Genie+ system, that sparked the ire of Disney’s deeply loyal guests, many of whom felt they were being price gouged.\n\nDisney’s delicate internal culture and brand also took some hits during Chapek’s tenure.\n\nThe CEO found himself dealing with a pay dispute involving Scarlett Johansson, one of the studio’s biggest stars, that spilled into public view. Then there was Disney’s battles with Florida politicians, and its own employees, regarding the state’s controversial law restricting the discussion of certain LGBTQ+ topics in classrooms.\n\nThat, in particular, was a flashpoint of Chapek’s stint at Disney. In March, he was forced to apologize for his silence on the bill after initially declining to publicly comment on it.\n\nUltimately, Disney’s board moved on from those PR bumps and Chapek’s contract was renewed in July until 2025. Yet, the damage was arguably done to Disney’s brand.\n\nDisney’s brand image is vital to its success, portraying an aura of a magical, family-friendly cultural institution.\n\nIger made his first moves as CEO on Monday by reorganizing Disney’s content distribution structure.\n\nThe CEO said in a memo to employees that Kareem Daniel, the chairman of Disney’s Media and Entertainment Distribution unit, will be leaving the company.\n\nAs for Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution, Iger notes in a memo to employees that “without question, elements of DMED will remain, but I fundamentally believe that storytelling is what fuels this company, and it belongs at the center of how we organize our businesses.”\n\nDisney created the new Media and Entertainment Distribution group in 2020, putting Daniel, who was formerly the president of Disney’s consumer products, games and publishing division, in charge. That unit was in charge of monetizing content via distribution and ad sales. The group also oversaw the operations of the company’s streaming services like Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+.\n\nWhy Iger can do it\n\nIger has his hands full with Disney, which is facing many issues, but has a track record unrivaled in the media world. Richard Harbaugh/Disneyland Resort/Getty Images\n\nIn the end, the Disney board decided to bring Iger back because of his long track record of success that has earned him an almost mythical status as the only person who can lead the company. In its statement reintroducing Iger as CEO, Disney said he was “uniquely situated to lead the company through this pivotal period.”\n\nIger was instrumental in forming the modern Disney. He oversaw the acquisition of major Disney brands, including Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm, and he closed the $71 billion deal to buy most of 21st Century Fox. He also kicked off the streaming revolution at the company with the creation of Disney+ in November 2019.\n\nHollywood insiders viewed Iger’s previous CEO tenure as one of the greatest in Hollywood history.\n\nThe mere fact that he’s back at the helm helped calm investor’s nerves: Shares jumped 6% higher Monday.\n\n“Psychologically, him just being back is a boost to investors and the team at Disney,” Miller said. “With Iger they know what to expect, which is a focus on excellence and a love for the brand. I doubt he’s coming back for money at this point. He’s coming back for legacy and the company itself.”\n\nOver the years, Iger’s “decision-making and strategic positioning — which ignored the Street’s often incorrect short-term focus — would ultimately separate Disney from the media pack,” said Michael Nathanson, a media analyst at MoffettNathanson, in a note to investors Monday.\n\nNathanson added that Iger’s “communications skills and his ability to stay focused and honestly optimistic in the face of structural challenges provided a constant ballast in the roughest of media waters.”\n\n“We believe investors will value the transparency and return Disney some of its long-lost magic with a stronger narrative driving the stock higher again,” he wrote.\n\nBut Iger’s past successes will not guarantee Disney’s future recovery. Hollywood is rapidly evolving, and Disney’s problems are being felt industry-wide.

Disney board chair Susan Arnold thanked Chapek for his leadership during “the unprecedented challenges of the pandemic.”\n\nShe said directors believed Iger was “uniquely situated” to guide the entertainment behemoth during “an increasingly complex period of industry transformation.” Iger, 71, led Disney for 15 years as it absorbed Pixar, Lucasfilm, Marvel and Fox’s entertainment businesses, then launched its Disney+ streaming service.\n\nIger said in the statement that he was “thrilled” to return and “extremely optimistic” about Disney’s future.\n\nHe's back:Here's everything we know so far about Bob Iger's return as Disney CEO\n\nThe real deal:What Disney fans can expect with Iger's return and Bob Chapek's departure\n\n“I am deeply honored to be asked to again lead this remarkable team, with a clear mission focused on creative excellence to inspire generations through unrivaled, bold storytelling,” Iger said.\n\nHollywood’s creative community had grumbled about Chapek’s cost-cutting measures and sometimes blunt approach to talent, while theme park regulars had been unhappy with price hikes.

Now he’s saying “Goodbye, Disney (DIS).”\n\nChapek’s rocky two-and-a-half year tenure at the head of the entertainment giant had a few wins. He navigated the Covid-19 pandemic, which shuttered theme parks around the world and halted film production, grew Disney+’s subscriber base and held his ground against an activist investor.\n\nBut Disney made the surprise announcement Sunday that its revered former CEO Bob Iger is making a return as the head of the company.\n\nChapek, who served as chairman of Disney Parks, Experiences and Products before taking over for Iger, will be stepping down immediately.\n\nWhy? Chapek’s downfall arose, at least in part, out of his bungled response to Florida’s controversial Parental Rights in Education bill, dubbed the “Don’t Say Gay” bill by critics. His decisions had far-reaching effects on both Disney’s reputation and on the company’s “favored nation” status in the state.\n\nEarly this year, Disney faced mounting criticism for not taking a public stance on the bill. The law bans educators from discussions about sexual orientation and gender identity in some classrooms.\n\nChapek ended up igniting a political firestorm — despite his initial efforts to keep the company out of politics. (Iger had publicly condemned the bill on Twitter).\n\nLackluster response\n\nChapek addressed the issue in an email to staff but refused to issue a public statement against it in March. He defended that decision saying corporate statements “do very little to change outcomes or minds” and can undermine “more effective ways” of implementing change.\n\nChapek’s response marked a change in tone for Disney, which had previously been led by an outspoken CEO who had famously considered running for president.\n\nThe backlash was immediate, both within the company and in the public. Disney employees began staging walkouts, saying Chapek’s statements “utterly failed” to grasp the threat to LGBTQ communities.\n\nLater that same week, Chapek apologized for his public silence on the bill. In a letter to employees, the CEO said the issue was not just about “a bill in Florida, but instead yet another challenge to basic human rights …You needed me to be a stronger ally in the fight for equal rights and I let you down. I am sorry.”\n\nAn apology too late\n\nChapek’s attempt to keep Disney out of politics quickly backfired. While the company began bracing for further walkouts and protests from progressives, Chapek’s eventual response led to a full blown battle between two Florida giants: the Walt Disney Company and the state’s Republican governor, Ron Desantis.\n\nDeSantis quickly ripped Disney after Chapek’s public condemnation, calling the company a “woke corporation” with questionable business interests in China during a private event.\n\nDisney is the main driver of Florida’s massive tourism industry and the state’s largest private employer. Before the public condemnation, Chapek told shareholders he had called Desantis to express his “disappointment and concern.”\n\nHe also announced a pause in political contributions in Florida (the company had previously donated $50,000 to DeSantis’ bid for reelection).\n\nThe feud eventually led to the Florida legislature revoking Disney’s special status to operate as an independent quasi-government around its Orlando-area theme parks.\n\nThe bill states the special designation, which also gives Disney significant tax advantages, won’t dissolve until June 2023. The Reedy Creek Improvement District, the entity that manages the Disney properties, argued it can’t be dissolved until Florida pays off its bond debts, essentially saying the special district can continue to operate as normal.\n\nIger vs Chapek\n\nThe fallout over the LGBTQ legislation created a rift between Iger and Chapek. CNBC reported that several Disney employees called Iger “to express their disappointment in Chapek.”\n\nIn June, it seemed that Chapek wasn’t going anywhere despite the public missteps – Disney announced a three year contract extension that would run into 2025.\n\n“Disney was dealt a tough hand by the pandemic, yet with Bob [Chapek] at the helm, our businesses — from parks to streaming — not only weathered the storm, but emerged in a position of strength,” Disney board chair Susan Arnold said in a statement, adding he was the “right leader at the right time.”\n\nDespite the public controversies and feuds, Chapek was dealt a lifeline with Disney+. The service’s subscriptions skyrocketed during the pandemic, and totaled more than 137 million at the time of Chapek’s contract extension.\n\nBut now economic uncertainty is looming over corporate America, and Chapek recently announced a hiring freeze and job cuts to manage costs, Reuters reported.\n\nStreaming success wasn’t enough to save Chapek’s tenure or his reputation, as the company lost $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter.\n\nInvestors celebrated Iger’s return as CEO, sending Disney shares up nearly 7% Monday after dropping roughly 38% this year.\n\n– CNN’s Frank Pallotta, Steve Contorno, Jamiel Lynch, Chris Boyette and Eric Levenson contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Ramishah Maruf"], "publish_date": "2022/11/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/07/12/fact-check-these-11-ceos-stepped-down-during-covid-19-pandemic/5392136002/", "title": "Fact check: These 11 CEOs stepped down during COVID-19 ...", "text": "The claim: Nineteen big-name CEOs stepped down during the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nWith the world’s eyes on the ever-evolving COVID-19 pandemic, some fear that other big news stories have slipped between the cracks.

He has been with Disney for nearly three decades, previously serving as chairman of Disney Parks, Experiences and Products before replacing Iger.\n\nChapek also served as chairman of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, during which he helped open the Shanghai Disney Resort; and introduced Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge at Disneyland Resort and Walt Disney World Resort.\n\nChapek was the seventh CEO in Disney's 100-plus year history.\n\nWho is Bob Iger?\n\nIger has been with Disney for more than 45 years, becoming CEO in 2005 and then chairman in 2012.\n\nIger's first run as CEO is legendary for Disney. During the 15-year period, he helped close deals to acquire Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm (owners of Star Wars) and 21st Century Fox, which returned the film rights of the X-Men to Marvel.\n\nThose acquisitions helped Disney's streaming service Disney+ flourish as one of the top streaming media platforms. After relinquishing the CEO role to Chapek, Iger stayed on as chairman until December 2021.\n\n\"Mr. Iger has the deep respect of Disney’s senior leadership team, most of whom he worked closely with until his departure as executive chairman 11 months ago, and he is greatly admired by Disney employees worldwide – all of which will allow for a seamless transition of leadership,\" said Disney board chairman Susan Arnold in a statement.\n\nDriving this Thanksgiving? Here are some ways to save on gas\n\nWhy is Chapek out?\n\nChapek took over right before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. While it benefited Disney+, as many people stayed home and streamed movies or TV shows, the pandemic also closed down Disney parks for an extended period.\n\nAlthough Disney+ has made significant subscriber gains, it's losing money. Last quarter, Disney's direct-to-consumer business, which includes Disney+, incurred operating losses near $1.5 billion.\n\nPrice changes for Disney+ will take effect next month. The standard plan will go up to $10.99, along with the introduction of a new, lower-cost tier with ads.\n\n\"Amidst an incredibly competitive streaming market for users’ attention and dollars, Iger’s top challenge will be to increase subscriber value without breaking the bank and compromising content quality,\" said Mike Proulx, vice president and research director for Forrester.\n\nMeanwhile, earlier this year, Disney was involved in a political feud with Florida over the state's \"Don't Say Gay\" bill, which would limit instruction on gender identity and sexual orientation in grades K-3.\n\nChapek issued a statement against the bill after some employees and shareholders criticized him for staying silent.\n\n\"Speaking to you, reading your messages and meeting with you have helped me better understand how painful our silence was,\" Chapek said earlier this year. \"It is clear that this is not just an issue about a bill in Florida, but instead yet another challenge to basic human rights.\"\n\nChapek also fired Peter Rice, the chairman of Disney General Entertainment Television, among the most highly regarded television executives in the industry.\n\nDisney shares have plunged this year from a peak of $157.83 in January to $91.80 as of Friday's close, a 42% drop.\n\nHow much will Iger make?\n\nIger's annual compensation package is valued at $27 million each year he's back, according to a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThat includes a $1 million base salary, a $1 million target bonus and stock awards with a $25 million target value.

First, investors are thrilled to have him once again reigning over the Magic Kingdom. Disney’s shares ended Monday up more than 6% on a day that the Dow Jones was slightly down. Second, Iger is moving fast — not even waiting a full 24 hours to announce sweeping changes — to dismantle Chapek’s reorganization of the company.\n\nThe speed at which Iger is hurtling is especially remarkable given that Disney’s board only made its overture for Iger to return to the embattled company on Friday. “It literally started Friday and ended Sunday,” a person with knowledge of the matter told CNN, adding that Iger “felt a sense of obligation to go back because he really does care about the company.”\n\nNow he’s already calling big plays.\n\nA version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here.\n\nIn a Monday evening memo sent to employees of Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution, a key organ of the company created by Chapek that frustrated some creatives, Iger announced that Kareem Daniel, the division’s chief and a Chapek ally, would “be leaving the company.”\n\nIger also announced the entertainment giant will be undergoing a broader transformation with him back at the helm. “Over the coming weeks, we will begin implementing organizational and operating changes within the company,” Iger wrote to employees. “It is my intention to restructure things in a way that honors and respects creativity as the heart and soul of who we are.”\n\nIger added that he had asked Dana Walden, Alan Bergman, Jimmy Pitaro, and Christine McCarthy to “work together on the design of a new structure that puts more decision-making back in the hands of our creative teams and rationalizes costs.” Iger said the goal “is to have the new structure in place in the coming months.”\n\nOutside Iger’s reorg of Chapek’s reorg, the Disney chief could also unwind another key decision made by Chapek that is just weeks from taking effect: Disney+’s price hike. Iger launched Disney+ at a mere $6.99 a month and, as CNBC’s Alex Sherman reported, his strategy was to “slowly raise prices over time.” Chapek, however, ditched that modus operandi earlier this year when he spiked the price to a whopping $10.99 a month.\n\nLooking further into the future, bigger questions abound: What will Disney look like when Iger’s two-year deal is up? How will Iger position and reshape the company for the digital age? Could he make a move to shed ABC and the broadcast division? Or perhaps execute a mega-deal to eat a company like Netflix? Or will Disney itself be eaten by a Big Tech giant such as Apple?\n\nOne source at a top talent agency pointed out that the biggest question Iger will have to answer is how he “tops his last run as CEO.”\n\n“The world is a much more complicated place than it was a few years ago and it is going to be hard to live up to the reputation he built as the most formidable media CEO ever,” the source said. “And he’s going to have a short runway to pleasing Wall Street, his staff, creative partners, and the audience.”\n\n“So much for going out on top.”", "authors": ["Oliver Darcy"], "publish_date": "2022/11/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/04/tech/elizabeth-holmes-rise-and-fall/index.html", "title": "The rise and fall of Elizabeth Holmes: A timeline | CNN Business", "text": "CNN —\n\nMore than three years after Elizabeth Holmes was first indicted and nearly four months after her trial kicked off, the founder and former CEO of failed blood testing startup Theranos was found guilty on four out of 11 federal fraud and conspiracy charges.\n\nThe verdict comes after a stunning downfall that saw Holmes, once hailed as the next Steve Jobs, go from being a tech industry icon to being a rare Silicon Valley entrepreneur on trial for fraud.\n\nA Stanford University dropout, Holmes – inspired by her own fear of needles – started the company at the age of 19, with a mission of creating a cheaper, more efficient alternative to a traditional blood test. Theranos promised patients the ability to test for conditions like cancer and diabetes with just a few drops of blood. She attracted hundreds of millions of dollars in funding, a board of well-known political figures, and key retail partners.\n\nBut a Wall Street Journal investigation poked holes into Theranos’ testing and technology, and the dominoes fell from there. Holmes and her former business partner, Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani, were charged in 2018 by the US government with multiple counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. (Both pleaded not guilty.)\n\nHere are the highlights of the rise and fall of Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos.\n\nMarch 2004: Holmes drops out of Stanford to pursue Theranos\n\nHolmes, a Stanford University sophomore studying chemical engineering, drops out of school to pursue her startup, Theranos, which she founded in 2003 at age 19. The name is a combination of the words “therapy” and “diagnosis.”\n\nSeptember 2009: Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani joins Theranos as Holmes’ right-hand man\n\nBalwani joins as chief operating officer and president of the startup. Balwani, nearly 20 years her senior, met Holmes in 2002 on a trip to Beijing through Stanford University. The two are later revealed to be romantically involved.\n\nSeptember 2013: Holmes opens up about Theranos; announces Walgreens partnership\n\nA decade after first starting the company, Holmes takes the lid off Theranos and courts media attention the same month that Theranos and Walgreens announce they’ve struck up a long-term partnership. The first Theranos Wellness Center location opens in a Walgreens in Palo Alto where consumers can access Theranos’ blood test.\n\nThe original plan had been to make Theranos’ testing available at Walgreens locations nationwide.\n\nSeptember 2014: Holmes named one of the richest women in America by Forbes\n\nHolmes is named to the magazine’s American billionaire list with the outlet reporting she owns a 50% stake in the startup, pinning her personal wealth at $4.5 billion.\n\nElizabeth Holmes speaking onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt on September 8, 2014 in San Francisco, California. Steve Jennings/Getty Images\n\nDecember 2014: Theranos has raised $400 million\n\nTheranos has raised more than $400 million, according to a profile of the company and Holmes by The New Yorker. It counts Oracle’s Larry Ellison among its investors.\n\nJuly 2015: Theranos gets FDA approval for Herpes test\n\nThe FDA clears Theranos to use of its proprietary tiny blood-collection vials to finger stick blood test for herpes simplex 1 virus – its first and only approval for a diagnostic test.\n\nOctober 2015: Theranos is the subject of a Wall Street Journal investigation; Holmes hits back\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports Theranos is using its proprietary technique on only a small number of the 240 tests it performs, and that the vast majority of its tests are done with traditional vials of blood drawn from the arm, not the “few drops” taken by a finger prick. In response, Theranos defends its testing practices, calling the Journal’s reporting “factually and scientifically erroneous.”\n\nA day later, Theranos halts the use of its blood-collection vials for all but the herpes test due to pressures from the FDA. (Later that month, the FDA released two heavily redacted reports citing 14 concerns, including calling the company’s proprietary vial an “uncleared medical device.”)\n\nOne week after the Journal report, Holmes is interviewed on-stage at the outlet’s conference in Laguna Beach. “We know what we’re doing and we’re very proud of it,” she says.\n\nHolmes speaking at a Wall Street Journal technology conference in Laguna Beach, California on October 21, 2015. Glenn Chapman/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAmid the criticism, Theranos reportedly shakes up its board of directors, eliminating Henry Kissinger and George Shultz as directors while moving them to a new board of counselors; the company also forms a separate medical board.\n\nNovember 2015: Theranos and Safeway partnership falls short\n\nSafeway, which invested $350 million into building out clinics in hundreds of its supermarkets to eventually offer Theranos blood tests, reportedly looks to dissolve its relationship with the company before it ever offered its services.\n\nJanuary 2016: Federal regulators take issue with Theranos’ California lab; Walgreens pulls back\n\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) sends Theranos a letter saying its California lab has failed to comply with federal standards and that patients are in “immediate jeopardy.” It gives the company 10 days to address the issues.\n\nIn response, Walgreens says it will not send any lab tests to Theranos’ California lab for analysis and suspends Theranos services at its Palo Alto Walgreens location.\n\nMarch 2016: CMS threatens to ban Holmes, Balwani from lab business\n\nCMS threatens to ban Holmes and Balwani from the laboratory business for two years after the company allegedly failed to fix problems at its California lab. Theranos says that’s a “worst case scenario.”\n\nMay 2016: Balwani steps down; Theranos voids two years of blood tests\n\nBalwani departs. The company also adds three new board members as part of the restructuring: Fabrizio Bonanni, a former executive vice president of biotech firm Amgen, former CDC director William Foege, and former Wells Fargo CEO Richard Kovacevich.\n\nTheranos voids two years of blood test results from its proprietary testing devices, correcting tens of thousands of blood-test reports, the Journal reports.\n\nJune 2016: Holmes net worth revised to $0; Theranos loses its largest retail partner\n\nForbes revises its estimate of Holmes’ net worth from $4.5 billion to $0. The magazine also lowers its valuation for the company from $9 billion to $800 million.\n\nWalgreens, once Theranos’ largest retail partner, ends its partnership with the company and says it will close all 40 Theranos Wellness Centers.\n\nJuly 2016: Holmes is banned from running labs for two years\n\nCMS revokes Theranos’ license to operate its California lab and bans Holmes from running a blood-testing lab for two years.\n\nAugust 2016: The company unveils ‘miniLab’ device\n\nHolmes tries to move past recent setbacks by unveiling a mini testing laboratory, called miniLab, at a conference for the American Association for Clinical Chemistry. In selling the device, versus operating its own clinics, Theranos seeks to effectively side-step CMS sanctions, which don’t prohibit research and development.\n\nOctober 2016: Theranos investor sues the company; Theranos downsizes\n\nTheranos investor Partner Fund Management sues the company for $96.1 million, the amount it sunk into the company in February 2014, plus damages. It accuses the company of securities fraud. Theranos and Partner Fund Management settled in May, 2017, for an undisclosed amount.\n\nThe company also lays off 340 employees as it closes clinical labs and wellness centers as it attempts to pivot and focus on the miniLab.\n\nNovember 2016: Walgreens sues Theranos\n\nWalgreens sues the blood testing startup for breach of contract. Walgreens sought to recover the $140 million it poured into the company. The lawsuit was settled August, 2017.\n\nJanuary 2017: More layoffs, followed by a failed lab inspection\n\nTheranos downsizes its workforce yet again following the increased scrutiny into its operations, laying off approximately 155 employees or about 41% of staffers.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that Theranos failed a second regulatory lab inspection in September, and that the company was closing its last blood testing location as a result.\n\nApril 2017: Theranos settles with CMS, and Arizona AG\n\nTheranos settles with the CMS, agreeing to pay $30,000 and to not to own or operate any clinical labs for two years.\n\nTheranos also settles with the Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich over allegations that its advertisements misrepresented the method, accuracy, and reliability of its blood testing and that the company was out of compliance with federal regulations governing clinical lab testing. Theranos agrees to pay $4.65 million back to its Arizona customers as part of a settlement deal.\n\nMarch 2018: Holmes charged with massive fraud\n\nThe SEC charges Holmes and Balwani with a “massive fraud” involving more than $700 million from investors through an “elaborate, years-long fraud in which they exaggerated or made false statements about the company’s technology, business, and financial performance.”\n\nThe SEC alleges Holmes and Balwani knew that Theranos’ proprietary analyzer could perform only 12 of the 200 tests it published on its patient testing menu.\n\nTheranos and Holmes agree to resolve the claims against them, and Holmes gives up control of the company and much of her stake in it. Balwani, however, is fighting the charges, with his attorney saying he “accurately represented Theranos to investors to the best of his ability.”\n\nMay 2018: “Bad Blood”\n\nReporter John Carreyrou, who first broke open the story of Theranos for the Wall Street Journal, publishes “Bad Blood,” a definitive look at what happened inside the disgraced company. Director Adam McKay (who directed “The Big Short”) secures the rights to make the film, starring Jennifer Lawrence as Holmes, by the same name.\n\nJune 2018: Holmes and Balwani indicted on criminal fraud charges\n\nHolmes and Balwani are indicted on federal wire fraud charges over allegedly engaging in a multi-million dollar scheme to defraud investors, as well as a scheme to defraud doctors and patients. Both have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMinutes before the charges were made public, Theranos announced that Holmes has stepped down as CEO. The company’s general counsel, David Taylor, takes over as CEO.

Later, in August 2021, unsealed court documents reveal Holmes is likely to claim she was the victim of a decade-long abusive relationship with Balwani. The allegations led to the severing of their trials. His trial is slated to begin in 2022.\n\nDecember 2020: Holmes’ criminal trial delayed til 2021\n\nInitially set to begin in July 2020, Holmes’ criminal trial is further delayed til July 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nMarch 2021: Holmes’ pregnancy further delays trial\n\nNews surfaces that Holmes’ is expecting her first child, once more further delaying her criminal trial.

Ethan Swope/Getty Images\n\nAugust 2021: Holmes’ criminal trial begins with jury selection\n\nMore than 80 potential jurors are brought into a San Jose courtroom for questioning over the course of two days to determine if they are fit to serve as impartial, fair jurors for the criminal trial of Holmes. A jury of seven men and five women is selected, with five alternatives.\n\nDecember 2021: Jury begins deliberating her fate\n\nAfter three months of testimony from 32 witnesses, the criminal fraud case of Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes makes its way to the jury of eight men and four women who will decide her fate. The jury would go on to deliberate for more than 50 hours before returning a verdict.\n\nJanuary 2022: Holmes found guilty on four of 11 federal charges\n\nHolmes is found guilty of one count of conspiracy to defraud investors as well as three wire fraud counts tied to specific investors.

Amanda Seyfried stars as Holmes and Naveen Andrews plays Balwani. Their romantic and professional relationship features prominently in the show.\n\nFollowing delays due to Holmes’ prolonged trial then a surge of Covid-19, jury selection for Balwani’s trial gets underway.

According to the filing, Rosendorff did not interact with Holmes but did speak to her partner Billy Evans, who recounted the exchange in an email to Holmes’ lawyers shortly after.\n\n“His shirt was untucked, his hair was messy, his voice slightly trembled,” Evans wrote about Rosendorff. According to Evans’ email, Rosendorff “said when he was called as a witness he tried to answer the questions honestly but that the prosecutors tried to make everybody look bad.”\n\nThe former Theranos lab director also “said he felt like he had done something wrong,” Evans wrote.\n\nOctober 2022: Rosendorff takes the stand again\n\nRosendorff takes the stand again to address concerns from Holmes’ defense team and their claims he had shown up at her home after the trial concluded asking to speak with her and expressed regrets about his testimony.\n\nAt the hearing, Rosendorff reaffirmed the truthfulness of his testimony at Holmes’ trial and said that the government did not influence what he said.\n\nNovember 2022: Request for new trial is denied\n\nA federal judge denies Elizabeth Holmes’ request for a new trial, according to court filings, paving the way for the founder of failed blood testing startup Theranos to be sentenced later in the month.", "authors": ["Sara Ashley O'Brien"], "publish_date": "2022/01/04"}]}

As a reminder, borrower balances have effectively been frozen since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, with no payments required on most federal student loans since March 2020.\n\n“We’ve been talking daily about this, and I can tell you the American people will hear within the next week or so from the President and the Department of Education on what we’re going to be doing around that,” Cardona told NBC’s Chuck Todd on “Meet the Press.”\n\nHe did not elaborate, saying he would not get ahead of the announcement. “I don’t have any news to announce today,” Cardona said.\n\nHere’s what you need to know.\n\nWhat is Biden weighing?\n\nCNN has learned that White House officials have been weighing – and leaning toward – the cancellation of up to $10,000 in student loan debt per borrower tied to an income threshold. The plan, according to multiple sources familiar with the discussions, is designed to offer the forgiveness to individuals who earn less than $125,000 per year.\n\nIn addition to that baseline of student loan debt forgiveness for individuals who fall under a certain income level, administration officials have also recently discussed the possibility of additional forgiveness for specific subsets of the population, according to sources familiar with internal discussions in the administration.\n\nSome Democratic lawmakers and advocates have been calling on Biden to broadly cancel up to $50,000 in student loan debt per borrower, although the President has said he would not consider that number.\n\nHow severe is America’s student debt problem?\n\nBorrowers hold $1.6 trillion in outstanding federal student loan debt, more than Americans owe in either credit card or auto loan debt.\n\nAbout 54% of borrowers with outstanding student loan debt owed less than $20,000 as of March 2021, according to the College Board\n\nAbout 45% of the outstanding debt was held by the 10% of borrowers owing $80,000 or more.\n\nWhat’s the downside of broad forgiveness?\n\nWhile broad student loan debt cancellation could deliver financial relief to millions of Americans, the implications of such a significant policy move are complicated, CNN’s Katie Lobosco writes.\n\nAnd on its own, the action would do nothing to bring down the cost of college for future borrowers or help those who have already paid for their degrees.\n\nHow does the Supreme Court come into this?\n\nA recent decision from the high court limiting the Environmental Protection Agency’s ability to fight the climate crisis could complicate Biden’s authority to cancel federal student loan debt.\n\nThat’s because the court’s ruling – along with those in other recent cases on eviction moratoriums and Covid-19 vaccination mandates – signaled that the justices may be inclined to constrain federal agencies’ authority to make significant policy changes if that power is not explicitly laid out by Congress.\n\nHow has Biden addressed student debt to this point?\n\nAs Lobosco has reported, the President has largely taken a targeted approach to student debt relief.\n\nFor example, earlier this month, the Department of Education said it would cancel $3.9 billion in student loan debt for 208,000 students who attended the now-defunct for-profit ITT Technical Institute. That brings the total amount of loan discharges approved under Biden to nearly $32 billion.\n\nBiden has also temporarily expanded the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which forgives the debt of government and nonprofit workers after 10 years of payments, and made changes to income-driven repayment plans, bringing millions of borrowers closer to forgiveness.\n\nWhat do Americans think of student loan forgiveness?\n\nAs might be expected, attitudes toward student debt relief are sharply divided along partisan and generational lines.\n\nA majority of Democrats in a May CNN poll (56%) – and an even wider majority of self-described liberals (69%) – said the government is doing too little on student loan debt, while only a third of Republicans and self-described conservatives alike said the same.\n\nSeventy percent of adults younger than 35 said the government is doing too little, a figure that dropped to 50% among those in the 35-49 age bracket, and 35% among those age 50 or older.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information Monday.", "authors": ["Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/08/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2022/11/17/student-loan-forgiveness-isnt-dead-heres-narrow-path-forward/10712059002/", "title": "Student loan forgiveness isn't dead. Here's the (narrow) path forward", "text": "The president's plan for student loan forgiveness for millions of borrowers remains stuck in the courts.\n\nCongress could forgive student debt, but with split power in the next session, the chances of success are unlikely.\n\nThe Education Department, meanwhile, is weighing extending the payment pause, among other options.\n\nPresident Joe Biden’s plan for mass student loan forgiveness is at the mercy of federal judges, which means borrowers’ hopes for relief are also on hold.\n\nThe legal delay comes at the same time as the end of a freeze on student loan bills approaches, leaving borrowers with questions about whether they will be expected to resume payments in 2023 without wider debt relief.\n\nThe Education Department and the White House would not say publicly whether there are plans to extend the payment pause or what alternatives they were considering beyond using the president’s executive authority to cancel student loan debt.\n\nBut in a recent court filing, Education Department Undersecretary James Kvaal wrote that without wider debt cancellation, the agency expects a \"historically large increase in the amount of federal student loan delinquency and defaults as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\" He wrote that the agency was “examining all available options” to address that concern, though he warned the cost might be high.\n\nWhat's next? US judge strikes down student loan forgiveness plan\n\n“The Department estimates that if it temporarily extends the existing COVID-19 pandemic payment and interest accrual pause for federal student loan holders, it will cost taxpayers several billion dollars a month in unrecovered loan revenue,\" Kvaal wrote.\n\nKvaal didn’t expand in his filing on what the other options might be, but there are only so many forms debt relief might take. Congress could cancel debt on its own, though with Republicans claiming a majority in the House after the midterm elections, that option seems unlikely even given Democrats’ hold on the Senate.\n\nMore food on the table, paying off debts:How the student loan payment pause changed people’s lives\n\nThe Education Department has canceled billions in debt through its existing relief programs, but there are limits to who qualifies for those programs, and they often require borrowers to make years of payments before seeing relief.\n\nThe Job Creators Network Foundation and six conservatives states have brought separate legal challenges that hobbled the president's plan for mass debt relief, though the administration has said it will fight the challenges in court.\n\nAssociate Justice Amy Coney Barrett has twice dismissed emergency appeals from other groups seeking to temporarily halt the president’s plan while the litigation continues, but she did so without comment and without referring the requests to the full court, where conservatives hold a 6-3 majority.\n\nMore:With student loan forgiveness in legal limbo, Feds bet on other debt relief options\n\nWill the president extend the pause on student loan payments?\n\nThe administration could extend the payment pause again, though federal officials said the most recent extension would be the final one.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump first suspended payments in March 2020. The moratorium also set interest rates at zero percent and came with guidance to loan servicers to stop trying to collect on overdue debts.\n\nIn legal limbo:How to prepare now that student loan forgiveness likely isn't coming anytime soon\n\nIn the past, the administration has given borrowers just a few weeks' notice before extending the pause. And Biden and the Education Department described the most recent moratorium renewal as the final extension.\n\nPrevious extensions have given those in debt a few extra months of wiggle room, but borrowers have consistently told USA TODAY the uncertainty of paying their student loans weighed on them during the pause.\n\nIt’s unclear how long another extension might last, but a suite of new federal policies that could make it easier for borrowers to access the department’s student loan forgiveness plans go into effect on July 1, 2023.\n\nEven before the announcement of Biden’s mass debt relief plan, Republicans had been clamoring for payments to resume. And unlike the debt forgiveness plan, the moratorium applies to everyone with a federal student loan regardless of how much they earn. Biden’s plan for relief is limited to borrowers making less than $125,000 a year – or $250,000 for married couples.\n\nBorrowers' advocates also have started raising the possibility of extending the payment pause.\n\nThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has estimated the moratorium costs about $50 billion annually. What’s more, borrowers in repayment plans that require set amounts of payments are receiving credits during the moratorium, effectively reducing what they have to pay the federal government.\n\nCould Congress pass student loan debt forgiveness?\n\nCongress does have the authority to cancel student loan debt. But Republicans will have a majority in the House and Democrats will control the Senate, which makes the possibility of consensus on forgiving student loans narrow in the next session of Congress. In addition, Republican lawmakers have been vocal about their opposition both to the president's plan for forgiveness and the moratorium.\n\nRep. Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, the Republicans' leader on the House's education committee, described the president's plan as a \"illegal student loan bailout.\"\n\n\"Republicans will continue fighting this president’s abuse of the executive pen, including his attempt to keep 40 million borrowers in repayment limbo and forcing taxpayers to foot the bill,\" Foxx said. \"The department simply cannot continue to kick this can down the road.\"\n\nSome Democratic lawmakers, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, introduced legislation in 2019 that would cancel huge swaths of student debt for millions of borrowers. But those efforts never materialized into wider forgiveness.\n\nWarren, when asked about a potential path forward via Congress, instead said the president's \"legal authority is clear, and these judges should stop playing politics and get out of the way.\"\n\n\"While Republican officials want to keep Americans crushed under student loans, Democrats are committed to delivering student debt relief for millions of hardworking Americans,\" Warren said.\n\nAnother challenge for congressional action? Not all Democrats are in favor of the current plan for mass student debt cancellation including recently reelected Sens. Michael Bennett of Colorado and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, who have said the administration shouldn't cancel student loan debt without wider reforms to how the country pays for higher education. That puts legislation squeaking through during the current lame duck session of Congress in doubt.\n\nWhen asked whether the White House would pursue action through Congress during an interview Sunday on NBC’s \"Meet the Press,\" White House senior adviser Anita Dunn sidestepped the question, saying the administration believes the “program will be upheld.”\n\n“The 26 million people in this country who have already applied for the student debt relief, working people, people who are just looking for, as the president would say, a little breathing room,” Dunn said, “and the Republicans are trying to stop this. And we are going to fight for it.”\n\nCould Biden's plan survive the courts?\n\nYes, the Biden administration still has legal avenues to push its plan through the courts. The administration has appealed the ruling of U.S. District Judge Mark T. Pittman in Texas, who struck down the president's plan.\n\nThe administration also can appeal the ruling out of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit, which had separately blocked the plan. In that case, a panel of three judges, two appointed by former President Donald Trump, temporarily halted the debt relief and noted that loan repayments were already on pause. (Pittman was also appointed by Trump.)\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Monday that the administration will continue to fight the lawsuits.\n\n“We are confident in our legal authority for the student debt relief program and believe it is necessary to help borrowers most in need as they recover from the pandemic,” Jean-Pierre said. “The administration will continue to fight these baseless lawsuits by Republican officials and special interests and will never stop fighting to support working and middle class Americans.”\n\nThe White House has not indicated a plan beyond the appeals, however.\n\nIt's not immediately clear if or when the Supreme Court would take up the cases. It's also unclear if the cases would be decided on the court's emergency docket or if the justices might reach to the underlying questions raised by the suits, which could keep the program in legal limbo for even longer.\n\nIs the Education Department still canceling student loans through other programs?\n\nYes, the agency has signed off discharging more than $38 billion for roughly 1.7 million borrowers through existing debt relief plans since Biden took office. It also approved canceling about $15 billion in debt for more than 247,000 borrowers in a program meant to benefit public service workers. On Friday, the agency shared updated figures showing discharges were approved for roughly 360,000 borrowers in the program, representing about $24 billion in student loan debt as of the end of October.\n\nSeparately, a U.S. District Judge in California this week approved an agreement between the Education Department and borrower advocate groups. They had sued in connection to the department's slow processing of debt relief applications for borrowers who said they had been defrauded by their university. That settlement is expected to erase nearly $6 billion in student loan debt for roughly 200,000 borrowers.\n\nIs student debt relief still available?:Yes, here's how feds are erasing debt through existing forgiveness programs\n\nThe administration will also conduct a one-time review of borrowers paying down their debts via income-driven repayment plans. Under these initiatives, borrowers are supposed to have their debts forgiven after 20 to 25 years of making payments.\n\nThe Biden administration has said it expects borrowers to receive credits for past payments that may have erroneously been declared ineligible. In practice, that means the review probably will result in more borrowers receiving student loan forgiveness.\n\nThe Education Department also is expected to introduce a new income-driven repayment plan that would lower how much borrowers pay every month.\n\nAnd Thursday, the Education Department and the Department of Justice shared a new process meant to create, “transparent and consistent expectations” for borrowers seeking to discharge their debts via bankruptcy. The requirements for erasing student loan debt via this process are high, and few with student loan debt have historically accessed the relief. In fact, the federal government had fought against cases where bankruptcy judges had agreed to wipe out borrowers’ debt.\n\nUnder the new process, the Justice Department may recommend that certain people have their student loans discharged through bankruptcy.\n\nContributing: Rebecca Morin\n\nContact Chris Quintana at (202) 308-9021 or cquintana@usatoday.com.

The feds then capitalize the unpaid interest, that is, they add it to borrowers’ principal balance. At that point, the loan is often larger than what a borrower first took out. The federal government also has capitalized interest after borrowers paused their loan payments.\n\nThe Education Department estimated it charged nearly $22 billion in interest capitalization in fiscal year 2019 alone. (No new interest has been charged on federal student loans since March 2020 thanks to a pause on student loan payments because of the pandemic.)\n\n“It accelerates balance growth and it’s really confusing,” said Sarah Sattelmeyer, a project director studying student loans at New America, a left of center think tank. “So getting rid of it is a win-win.”\n\nThe administration intends to do away with that practice almost entirely, one of many changes to the student loan program formalized in recent weeks. The changes come as a federal district judge in Texas struck down the president's broad plan for student debt forgiveness on Thursday. The Education Department has stopped taking applications for the one-time debt relief, though the administration has said it's working to overturn the judge's ruling. About 26 million people had already applied, and the administration said it was ready to erase the debt of 16 million people.\n\nLatest news:Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals puts Biden's student loan debt forgiveness plan on hold\n\nMore:US judge in Texas halts President Biden's student debt forgiveness plan; appeal filed\n\nAt the same time, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals is considering a request from six conservative states to block the plan, and it's unclear when it will issue its ruling. But the states already have indicated they will appeal to the Supreme Court if they don't receive a favorable ruling.\n\nRegardless of what happens with the wider debt relief plan, Sattelmeyer said the new regulations are likely to make it easier for borrowers to navigate paying their student loans and protect students from predatory colleges.\n\nWhat does debt relief mean to borrowers? Debt forgiveness will change the lives of some borrowers, but fall short for others\n\nThese changes don’t necessarily come with the multibillion dollar price tag of the wider debt relief plan – though they could be expensive – and they won’t touch every borrower. However, put together, they have the potential to ease paying student loans for hundreds of thousands of Americans in the years to come.\n\nThat is, if a friendly president remains in office.\n\nMany of these changes rely on the federal government using the expanded authority that comes with a national emergency. Others have navigated a complicated and esoteric rule-making process that is heavily subject to the whims of the current administration.\n\n“They have not wasted any time or opportunity to make changes that are really beneficial to student loan borrowers,” said Betsy Mayotte, the head of the Institute of Student Loan Advisors, a group that offers free advice in repaying student loans. “They’ve taken advantage of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. A lot of consumers don’t understand that.”\n\nThe one-time debt relief plan makes borrowers earning less than $125,000 annually – or $250,000 for couples, eligible for up to $20,000 in student loan forgiveness. It’s widely expected to benefit roughly 40 million borrowers. As of November 3, about 26 million people had applied for relief.\n\nWhat will student loan forgiveness cost? Biden's student loan relief plan will cost US about $400 billion, CBO estimates\n\nThe federal government has frozen student loan payments since March 2020. As part of that, the feds also set interest rates at zero percent and told collection agencies to stop trying to recoup overdue debts. The administration previously encouraged borrowers to apply for relief by mid-November to receive the debt relief before the payment pause ends.\n\nTo that end, the administration continues to urge borrowers to apply and has said the Education Department will “process discharges when we are able to do so and you will not need to reapply.”\n\nHow is the administration forgiving student loans in 2022?\n\nThe recent changes don't face the legal scrutiny of wide-ranging debt relief, yet. Starting July 1st, 2023, borrowers who are disabled won't have to have their earnings reviewed for three years after they claim relief. Those who attended a school that closed suddenly will have their debt forgiven automatically after a year. The Education Department also streamlined a debt forgiveness program geared toward public service workers and simplified the process for qualifying for relief through income-driven repayment plans.\n\nIn addition, the administration has said it will discharge the debts of tens of thousands of students who attended predatory institutions like Corinthian Colleges and ITT Technical Institute. And the new rules will make it easier for borrowers to sue universities that defrauded them.\n\nPreviously, borrowers generally had to apply for relief individually through the so-called borrower defense rule. The time-intensive and bureaucratic process has left many behind. As of September more than 392,000 applications were awaiting review by the Education Department. The new rule bars institutions from requiring students to sign non-arbitration clauses and allows legal services groups to take on their cases in class-action suits.\n\nAdvocates for students ripped off by predatory institutions, including the National Student Legal Defense Network, have long been pushing for the administration to adopt this practice.\n\nITT Tech students to receive debt relief:Former students to get $4 billion in federal loan forgiveness\n\nThese changes mean “students will now have an opportunity to hold predatory schools accountable,” said Aaron Ament, president of the National Student Legal Defense Network.\n\nAt the same time, the Education Department is set to forgive an additional $6 billion in student loan debt for borrowers who already applied for debt relief under the borrower defense program. That relief will depend on a judge’s approval of a settlement agreement between a group of student borrower advocates representing nearly 200,000 students and the Education Department. The final hearing was Wednesday, and the judge will issue a written decision on that case within a week.\n\nThe borrower advocates sued the administration under former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos because of the department’s delay in processing tens of thousands of applications for relief. The final agreement will grant debt relief to students who attended one of dozens of universities – including the University of Phoenix, Grand Canyon University and DeVry University – and had applied for debt relief via the borrower defense rule before June 20, 2022.\n\nThe federal government still has to decide how to handle borrower defense applications for students who attended a university not included in the settlement list.\n\nDo income-driven repayment plans qualify for student loan forgiveness?\n\nAlong with the mass debt relief plan, Biden recently unveiled its plans for a new income-driven repayment program. It will reduce borrowers’ payments to 5% of their discretionary income. The lowest rate offered now is 10%, though it can vary depending on a borrower's specific plan.\n\nthe federal government lowers the borrowers’ expected payment to match their wages, though doing so extends the life of the loan, often to 20 or 25 years from the standard 10-year repayment period. Nothing prevents them from paying off their debt more quickly, however.\n\nWhat is discretionary income?:And why it matters in student loan repayment\n\nBorrowers who make 10 years of payments will have their debts erased so long as their balance is below $12,000. The proposed changes would also cover borrowers’ unpaid interest so long as they make their monthly payments. The exact details of that plan are still being developed, and the administration is expected to release them in the coming weeks.\n\nRepublicans including Rep. Virginia Foxx, the ranking member on the House’s committee on education, question the proposal and have requested a full cost of what the income-driven plan would cost.\n\nAt the same time, the Education Department plans to conduct a review of payments under income-driven repayment programs that could mean the erasure of some borrowers' balances. Those who have been paying on their loans for 20 to 25 years through these plans at some point will receive automatic forgiveness, even if they’re not enrolled in such a plan now.\n\nThis review hasn’t attracted nearly the same level of attention as the president’s attempt at broad forgiveness, but of all the regulatory changes, Mayotte said, the income-driven waiver has the potential to affect the most borrowers.\n\nIt depends, she said, on how far back the department goes back when reviewing payments. The feds could start in 1994, when the first income-driven plan was introduced. But Mayotte said the agency hadn’t specified a date, which could mean they’re considering all borrowers for the review.\n\nAs of the third quarter of 2022, there were roughly 9 million federal borrowers who are 50 years or older, and about 1.5 million of them were enrolled in an income-driven repayment plan. It's unclear how many have been making payments for more than 25 years.\n\nWhat has changed and who qualifies for Public Service Loan Forgiveness\n\nOne of the department’s most touted accomplishments is the revamp of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness. Top department officials have repeatedly described previous versions of the program as broken. But the agency has said more than 236,000 borrowers with $14 billion in debt have been approved for forgiveness thanks to the changes announced in October 2021.\n\nThe program promises debt relief to borrowers who work in the public service sector for 10 years while making payments on their student loans. The Education Department is supposed to discharge the debt after a decade, but many borrowers found it was nearly impossible to access relief. When Biden took office, only a few thousand had ever had their debt forgiven through the program, according to the Education Department.\n\nWant student loan forgiveness? Millions of jobs qualify for updated program — and yours might be one of them.\n\nThe increase in borrowers qualifying comes thanks to loosening some of the strict eligibility requirements that had been associated with that plan. For example, borrowers had to ensure they had the right type of loan and that they were enrolled in a qualifying income-driven repayment plan.\n\nThe waiver, which expired Oct. 31, 2022, allowed for all kinds of past payments to count toward a borrowers’ eventual forgiveness.\n\nHowever, the Education Department says borrowers still have time to take advantage of some of the waiver's flexibility. The agency will count past payments toward a borrowers' eligibility for forgiveness through the same one-time review for income-driven repayment plans.\n\nBorrowers with commercially held FFEL loans looking to benefit from the relief will need to consolidate their debts into a federal Direct Loan by May 1.\n\nAnother key change: Borrowers will have to show they currently work in a qualifying public service job to qualify for the debt relief. Those jobs include public school teachers and firefighters, but also government employees and attorneys for nonprofits. (Under the waiver, loan holders only had to prove they had worked in a qualifying job at some point in the past.)\n\nIs that student loan phone call a scam? How to avoid scammers and get debt relief safely\n\nAnd starting July 1, 2023 the government will permanently loosen many of the program’s most restrictive requirements. Payments later than 15 days, for example, will now count toward the total required for forgiveness. Borrowers who pause their payment obligations due to cancer treatment, military service or economic hardship will receive credit for the months they miss. Previously, borrowers who consolidated their Direct Loans would lose all progress they had made toward debt relief.\n\nHow will the Education Department handle student loans?\n\nAll told, the changes made to the department’s current student loan relief programs has meant tens of billions in discharged debt, though that is only a fraction of the hundreds of billions that could be canceled as part of the president’s broad one-time loan forgiveness plan. The regulatory changes are likely to last longer and be available to borrowers who may not benefit from one-time debt relief, including future students.\n\nSome changes, like the Public Service waiver, are possible thanks to the 2003 Heroes Act, which allows the Education Secretary to modify student loan payment requirements during national emergencies.\n\nBut the forward-looking policy changes emerged via a complicated process known as negotiated rulemaking. It’s a lengthy ordeal that requires months of public comments and discussions from groups that may be affected by the rules. And the Education Department is required to craft its rules around student loans via this approach.\n\nSattelmeyer said when Congress passes laws, it can’t account for every permutation of what that law looks like. Negotiated rulemaking, though, allows federal agencies to interpret the intentions of lawmakers.\n\nWho's saying what about Title IX? How schools will treat sexual misconduct is changing.\n\nThe next administration has the ability to undo the rules. The DeVos administration, for example, altered the criteria associated with the borrower defense from the Obama-era and some of the protections tied to the anti gender-discrimination law, Title IX. It’s also the process through which the Biden administration will have to go through to get its new income-driven repayment plan approved.\n\nA more permanent change to how borrowers repay their student loans would require an act of Congress, but with Republicans poised to win the House, and possibly the Senate, that day is likely years away.\n\nContact Chris Quintana at (202) 308-9021 or cquintana@usatoday.com.

Today a look at Biden and Xi's meeting at the G20, plus, the latest on Biden's now-frozen student loan forgiveness program, and a look at human rights being rolled back in Iran and Afghanistan.\n\n♦\n\nThe G20 Summit in Bali kicked off with a meeting between President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping yesterday.

The latest move crushes the hopes of 26 million Americans who have applied for the relief and discourages millions more who were eligible. To find out more on what this latest court decision means and what happens next, I'm joined now by USA TODAY higher education reporter, Chris Quintana. Chris, thanks for being here.\n\nChris Quintana:\n\nMy pleasure. Thanks for having me.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo what was this latest Federal Appeals Court decision?\n\nChris Quintana:\n\nYeah, so that's actually coming out of the 8th Circuit, and so that is related specifically to a case known as Nebraska v. Biden. That is six conservative states, Nebraska being one of them, who brought a legal challenge against the Biden Administration's plan to cancel billions in student loan debt for millions of borrowers. There are a handful of legal challenges to the plan right now. The 8th Circuit, a panel of three judges, upheld the injunction that was requested.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right. Where does the Student Loan Forgiveness Program stand now? Can people still apply?\n\nChris Quintana:\n\nYeah. So if you haven't applied for the President's Student Loan Forgiveness Plan, you can't apply at this time. The administration says they are trying to work through the courts and to get it overturned, but they're not currently taking applications. Now, if you previously applied, the administration still has your information, and so they say they have applications for 26 million people and they're ready to forgive the debt of 16 million of those folks as well. So it is kind of a situation for borrowers who are kind of on the fence or curious. The only thing you can really do at this point is to wait.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd what happens next? Will the Biden administration appeal to the Supreme Court?\n\nChris Quintana:\n\nIt depends slightly on different cases. For a while, people had been following Nebraska v. Biden. The government shutting down the application window, that actually came from this Texas case, right? And so it is kind of a challenge for borrowers to kind of track this all the way through. But where I'm paying attention at this point is I am specifically looking at this 8th Circuit ruling and seeing kind of what the administration does as far as filing an appeal to the Supreme Court. I think that is probably where we're going to see the most action most immediately.\n\nThere's certainly a potential. The Supreme Court has combined cases in the past. I don't know that there's any indication or sense that that's where people are moving right at this moment, but just to say that looking at the lines, Congress could potentially act. They have the authority to potentially decide on student loan debt.\n\nThe wider debt relief plan is kind of locked up in courts right now. We see that. But the Education Department has been trying to cancel debt through a lot of its other relief programs. So I'm thinking the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, there are still some flexibilities associated with that. They're also looking at tweaking the income-driven repayment plans and that sort of thing. So I can appreciate for borrowers feeling perhaps a sense of not sure knowing what to do next, but just to say that there are potentially other options available for them.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYou can read more from Chris with a link in today's episode description.\n\n♦\n\nHuman rights are being rolled back in Iran with a protestor sentenced to death. That comes as Sharia law is being implemented in Afghanistan. Producer PJ Elliott spoke with Marty Flax, director of the CSIS Human Rights Initiative to find out more on what's happening in these two countries.\n\nPJ Elliott:\n\nMarty, thanks so much for joining me. We have two big stories coming from the Middle East. One is that a hijab protestor in Iran was given the death penalty and the supreme leader in Afghanistan ordered full implementation of Sharia law. Now, I know that these may seem unrelated, but from a human rights standpoint, they're certainly tied to each other. I want to start in Iran. Can you talk about the trials and what the protestors were found guilty of?\n\nMarty Flax:\n\nA number of protestors who are facing trial were found guilty, as you said, some of them on charges of actually committing violence and others for participating in the protests. Obviously, none of these trials have been what we would consider to be free and fair trials, and that's why you see US officials, European officials, and others come out in condemnation of those verdicts.\n\nPJ Elliott:\n\nSo what about Afghanistan. Why is the supreme leader calling for full implementation of Sharia law now?\n\nMarty Flax:\n\nSo what happened in Afghanistan is really the culmination of more than a year of the Taliban reimposing, the same oppressive policies that they put in place the first time they were in power in Afghanistan 20 years ago, starting from limiting girls' education all the way to restricting the ability of women to work or even go out in public without a full covering head to toe and without, in some cases, being accompanied by a male relative. This Taliban, when they came into power a year ago, claims that they were going to behave differently, that they had a different view, and in every opportunity they have chosen the more repressive path.\n\nPJ Elliott:\n\nMarty, thank you so much for your time. I really appreciate your insight into these stories.\n\nMarty Flax:\n\nAbsolutely. Thanks for having me.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nTens of thousands of academic employees across the University of California's 10 campuses walked off the job yesterday. They're demanding better pay and benefits in what union leaders say could be the largest work stoppage that public university system has ever faced. Unions representing some 48,000 educators say they want significant pay raises and childcare subsidies to afford the cost of living in some of the country's most expensive cities. The strike threatens to disrupt classroom and lab instruction across the state's university system just weeks before final exams.\n\nOrganizers from the United Auto Workers, which represents the involved employees, say they've set no end date for the work stoppage. Union representatives say they're seeking pay that'll take workers out of so-called \"rent burden.\" That's defined by the federal government as having to pay at least a third of your salary toward rent. The average annual pay is about $24,000 a year for student employees at UC schools. They're looking for minimum annual based salaries of $54,000.\n\nBeyond higher pay and childcare help, strikers are demanding better healthcare, public transit passes, lower tuition costs for international scholars, and better disability accessibility. According to the UAW Union, this could be the largest higher education strike in US history.\n\n♦\n\nSperm counts are down all over the world. From 1973 to 2000 counts dropped by 1.2% every year. From 2000 to 2018, that decline was 2.6%. For more, health reporter Karen Weintraub joins me now. Karen, thanks for being here.\n\nKaren Weintraub:\n\nThanks for having me.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo you wrote about a study that looked at these sperm counts globally. What did it find?\n\nKaren Weintraub:\n\nWe knew a couple years ago, there was a study from the same group in 2017 that said that sperm counts were dropping in the US and the other parts of the Western world. Now we know they're also dropping in the global south. We don't know why, but the fact that it's dropping everywhere suggests that it's something that's affecting men across the world.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right, Karen, what's the impact on fertility on the whole?\n\nKaren Weintraub:\n\nSo we don't really know, but probably it's not too dramatic yet. Don't worry at this point. It may be that it's just taking a little bit longer for people to have the one, two, or three kids they want to have. In Israel where some super religious people want to have 10 or 12 children, they may not be able to make it to that number, but most people will be able to have the number of children they want, just maybe not as quickly as they want to.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd what can men do, if anything, to boost their sperm count?\n\nKaren Weintraub:\n\nBasically, anything that makes you healthy, makes your sperm and fertility healthy. So eating well, sleeping well, exercise, not smoking, not drinking to excess. The other warning that they give is to avoid really hot environments. So don't go in saunas or hot tubs, that kind of a thing.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYou can find Karen's full story in today's episode description.\n\nAnd you can find 5 Things every morning on your podcast app of choice.

The pause had been scheduled to end on Dec. 31, but that date was coupled with plans for mass debt relief. In a video message posted on Twitter, Biden defended his plan for far-reaching student debt forgiveness and said the extension of the moratorium was a way to address the ongoing legal challenges. \"I'm confident that our student debt relief plan is legal. But it’s on hold because Republican officials want to block it,\" he said. The exact end of the pause is uncertain. The Education Department said payments would start two months after litigation concludes or the mass debt relief program has been implemented.

Trump asked the high court on Oct. 31 to intervene in his battle with the House Ways and Means Committee over access to six years of his returns. The battle over the tax returns dates back years: Democrats in 2019 sought copies from the Treasury Department after Trump flouted tradition by declining to release them as a candidate in 2016.

Wade, corporate giants from a range of industries pledged to provide support and financial assistance for employees — and, in some cases, their dependents — seeking abortions in states that outlaw the procedure.\n\nThe court’s decision to roll back the nearly 50-year-old landmark ruling, which protected the federal, constitutional right to an abortion, is expected to transform the landscape of reproductive health in America, leaving abortion policy up to individual states and paving the way for numerous states to pass new abortion restrictions. As of Friday afternoon, state officials in at least seven states said that new abortion bans can now be enforced.\n\nMillions of people seeking abortions could soon be forced to travel across state lines to access the procedure, adding to the cost of an already often expensive healthcare service. For many, employers’ benefit packages may be the only way they can afford an abortion.\n\nIn response, corporations, some with headquarters or offices in Republican-controlled states, are taking action. Companies such as Citigroup (C), Salesforce (CRM) and Match Group (MTCH) first promised financial support to employees seeking abortions in affected states after a draft version of the opinion leaked in May. Many more followed suit on Friday. Some, including Bumble and Lyft, also previously said they would donate to organizations that support women’s rights, such as Planned Parenthood and Fund Texas Choice.\n\nCorporate America is increasingly being drawn from the political sidelines on the abortion issue in response to pressure from investors, customers and employees. Companies are also struggling to attract and retain talent, and worry about the impact these states’ anti-abortion laws could have on their workers.\n\nHere are some of the prominent companies offering expanded assistance to staff in states curtailing abortion care.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) extended its financial support for “critical healthcare,” including abortions and gender-affirming care, to include coverage for travel expenses for such services, after the draft opinion overturning Roe was first leaked.\n\nApple\n\nThe company’s existing benefits package allows employees to travel out of state for medical care if it is unavailable in their home state, according to an Apple (AAPL) spokesperson.\n\nMeta\n\nThe tech giant intends to offer travel expense reimbursement “to the extent permitted by law” for employees seeking out-of-state health care and reproductive services, according to a spokesperson. “We are in the process of assessing how best to do so given the legal complexities involved,” the Meta spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nYelp\n\nYelp’s existing healthcare plan for US employees pays for women, family members and partners to travel out of states with strict abortion laws, such as Texas and Oklahoma, which ban abortions after 6 weeks.\n\n“This ruling puts women’s health in jeopardy, denies them their human rights, and threatens to dismantle the progress we’ve made toward gender equality in the workplaces since Roe,” Jeremy Stoppelman, co-founder of Yelp (YELP), said in a statement Friday. “Business leaders must step up to support the health and safety of their employees by speaking out against the wave of abortion bans that will be triggered as a result of this decision, and call on Congress to codify Roe into law.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Why this company will cover travel and health care for employees seeking an abortion 02:59 - Source: CNN\n\nDisney\n\nDisney (DIS) employees who are unable to access medical care in one location will be given affordable coverage to access the same care in another location, according to a company spokesperson. The benefit covers family planning and pregnancy-related decisions.\n\nUber\n\nUber (UBER)’s US insurance plans already cover reproductive health benefits, including abortion and travel expenses to access healthcare. The rideshare company will also reimburse any drivers sued under state law for providing transportation to a clinic through the app, according to an Uber (UBER) spokesperson.\n\nNetflix\n\nThe streaming company offers travel reimbursement coverage for US full-time employees and their dependents who need to travel for healthcare treatments including abortions and gender-affirming care, a Netflix (NFLX) spokesperson told CNN. The company provides a lifetime allowance of $10,000 per employees (or their dependents) per service.\n\nBumble\n\nBumble (BMBL), a female-driven dating app, said Friday that it will support its employees’ ability to access “the healthcare services they need,” including abortion care. A Bumble (BMBL) spokesperson added that the company will donate to the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas and Planned Parenthood Federation of America.\n\n“Abortion is healthcare, and healthcare is a human right. We are deeply troubled by the Supreme Court decision,” the spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nMatch Group\n\nDating app company Match Group (MTCH) in October established a partnership with Planned Parenthood Los Angeles to provide abortion access for its Texas employees and their dependents. The company is currently considering expanding that benefit to all its US staff, including remote employees in states with trigger laws that may soon ban abortions, according to a Match spokesperson. Match healthcare plans also help to cover travel and lodging costs for employees who need to travel to receive care, the spokesperson said.\n\nBox.com\n\nBox.com will cover employee travel and medical expenses incurred by employees while seeking reproductive services.\n\nLevi Strauss\n\nThe denim company said through The Levi Strauss Foundation that it is providing grants to the Center for Reproductive Rights, Afiya Center and ARC-Southeast which provides direct assistance to women and communities in need of care. The company previously said that under its benefits plan, employees can be reimbursed for travel expenses for services not available in their home state, including abortion. Part-time staff and others who aren’t included in the company’s benefits plan are also eligible for reimbursement, it said.\n\nComcast-NBC Universal\n\nComcast (CCZ) has an existing healthcare travel benefit for all employees that covers up to $4,000 per trip, up to three trips per year, with a maximum coverage cap of $10,000 per year. The amount paid out depends on the type of health care procedure, but abortion care is covered, according to the company.\n\nWarner Bros Discovery\n\nWarner Brothers Discovery, which owns CNN, on Friday expanded healthcare benefits options to include expenses for employees and their covered family members who need to travel to access abortions and other reproductive care, according to a company spokesperson.\n\nCondé Nast\n\nThe media company said Friday it will reimburse travel and lodging for employees who need abortion, infertility or gender-reaffirming services and cannot obtain them locally. CEO Roger Lynch said in an internal memo the Supreme Court decision was a “crushing blow to reproductive rights” and said the most powerful way the company can respond is through its content and journalism.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\n\nJPMorgan (JPM) on Friday said that its health care benefits have long covered abortion care. And starting in July, abortion will be included in the company’s health care travel benefit that covers services that can only be obtained far from home, according to spokesperson Joseph Evangelisti.\n\nNike\n\nThe sportswear company said in a statement that it covers travel and lodging expenses in situations where healthcare services are not available close to home, according to a statement Nike (NKE) released Friday.\n\n“No matter where our teammates are on their family planning journey — from contraception and abortion coverage, to pregnancy and family-building support through fertility, surrogacy and adoption benefits — we are here to support their decisions,” the statement reads.\n\nStarbucks\n\nThe coffee company is providing employees enrolled in its healthcare plan a medical travel benefit to access an abortion, according to a public letter to employees by Sara Kelly, Starbucks (SBUX) acting executive vice president of partner resources.\n\n“We all need to process this in our own way, and as you do, here is what I want you to know: no matter where you live, or what you believe, we will always ensure you have access to quality healthcare,” Kelly said in the letter.\n\nDick’s Sporting Goods\n\nFor employees who live in a state that restricts abortion access, Dick’s will provide up to $4,000 in travel expense reimbursement to travel to the nearest location where care is legally available, the company said in a statement Friday. The benefit will be provided to any employee, spouse or dependent enrolled in its medical plan, along with one support person.\n\nKroger\n\nThe grocer’s healthcare package includes travel benefits of up to $4,000 to facilitate access for reproductive healthcare services, including abortion and fertility treatments, according to a Kroger (KR) spokesperson.\n\nAlaska Airlines\n\nAlaska Airlines said in a statement that it has always provided travel reimbursements for “certain medical procedures and treatments if they are not available where you live.”\n\n“Today’s Supreme Court decision does not change that,” it said.\n\nGoldman Sachs\n\nGoldman Sachs (FADXX) on Friday extended its healthcare travel reimbursement policies to include all medical procedures, treatments and evaluations, including abortion services, in areas where a provider is not available near to where its employees live, a benefit that will be effective July 1, according to an internal memo obtained by CNN.\n\nZillow\n\nZillow (Z) said in a statement Friday that its health benefits cover a wide range of reproductive health services, including abortions. The company said that as of June 1, its health plan has been updated to include a reimbursement of up to $7,500 “each time significant travel is necessary to access health care, including reproductive services.”\n\nHP\n\nThe technology company said in a statement that its existing healthcare plan covers a “wide range of reproductive health services,” including abortion and related travel costs.\n\nHPE\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprise, which spun off from HP several years ago and moved its headquarters earlier this year from Silicon Valley to Texas, offers a medical plan that covers out of state care, including abortions and related travel expenses, according to a company spokesperson.\n\n“Restricting a woman’s ability and choices in obtaining health care is inequitable and harmful to the advancement of women,” HPE CEO Antonio Neri said on Twitter Saturday.\n\nAcccenture\n\nAccenture’s existing healthcare plan includes “a full range of reproductive healthcare benefits” and travel assistance for “covered medial services” that are not located within 100 miles of an employee’s residence, a company spokesperson told CNN.\n\nChobani\n\nThe yogurt company updated its healthcare policy for employees in May, following the leak of the draft opinion on Roe, to cover transportation and lodging expenses for any employee or dependent (as well as one caregiver) who needs to travel to receive specialized healthcare, including abortions. The policy also includes reimbursement for childcare costs incurred from the travel, according to a memo Chobani COO Kevin Burns sent to employees in May, which was shared with CNN.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy Jennifer Korn", "Clare Duffy", "Jennifer Korn"], "publish_date": "2022/06/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/11/23/scotus-rejects-trump-army-vet-hero-talks-club-q-shooting-5-things-podcast/10761982002/", "title": "SCOTUS denies Trump request to block tax returns, Club Q hero ...", "text": "On today's episode of the 5 Things podcast: Supreme Court denies Donald Trump request to block release of tax returns\n\nUSA TODAY Supreme Court correspondent John Fritze explains what happens next.

I'm Taylor Wilson and this is 5 Things you need to know Wednesday, the 23rd of November 2022. Today the Supreme Court has a decision on former President Donald Trump's fight for releasing his tax returns. Plus we look at whether mass layoffs will continue and how an Army veteran helped stop the gunman in the Colorado LGBTQ club shooting.\n\n♦\n\nThe Supreme Court yesterday declined a request from former President Donald Trump to block the release of his tax returns to a House Committee seeking them. It's the latest legal setback the former president has gone through from a court that he helped to shape. For more, producer PJ Elliott spoke with USA TODAY Supreme Court correspondent John Fritze.\n\nJohn Fritze:\n\nYeah. I mean, this is a battle that goes back to at least 2019 when Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee had requested these records, six years of tax returns from former President Donald Trump. And so House Democrats sought this when Trump was still president.\n\nPJ Elliott:\n\nSo what does this mean for the former president? Will he actually turn these over to the House Committee or are we looking at more appeals from his lawyers?\n\nJohn Fritze:\n\nSo it's important to note here that it's actually the Treasury Department that has them and is going to turn them over. So I think the question is timing a little bit, right, since this litigation came onto the Supreme Court, the political landscape has really shifted. Trump has announced he will run for reelection again in 2024, so that's one big thing. And House Republicans have taken over that chamber in the midterm election and they have said affirmatively that if they had control of the Ways and Means Committee, they would drop this request.\n\nPJ Elliott:\n\nJohn, is there any significance that the three justices that Trump put on the bench didn't dissent?\n\nJohn Fritze:\n\nI mean, I think it's interesting that this is of course a conservative court and we've seen the court move more and more to the right over the past several years. But despite that, and despite the fact that as you note, Trump named three of the justices to this court, Trump has not had very good luck at the Supreme Court, at least not post-presidency. The court has repeatedly, over and over, turned him down on some of these requests.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYou can find a link to John's full story in today's show notes.\n\n♦\n\nWorkers have been dealing with mass layoffs in recent weeks from the tech sector to the news media business and fears of a looming recession continue. To get a better understanding of the unemployment outlook heading toward the end of the year, I'm now joined by USA TODAY money reporter, Elisabeth Buchwald. Elizabeth, thanks for being here.\n\nElisabeth Buchwald:\n\nThanks for having me.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo Elizabeth, do we expect this trend to continue in the coming months?\n\nElisabeth Buchwald:\n\nYeah, unfortunately, it's not a pretty picture. Companies that haven't done layoffs yet likely will be considering it. I think the holiday season will be a test of how strong they are and how strong the consumer is and kind of be a what do we do next question based on their sales data. Now, for the state of layoffs so far it's really been concentrated in tech, concentrated in media as you highlighted. And then also industries that touch mortgages that's been an industry that's taken a big hit from the cooling housing market, so we've seen Zillow, LoanDepot do some pretty big layoffs. Retailers haven't really done big layoffs yet, at least in the people that you see in the store. So I haven't heard of say Target slashing workers as the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates and perhaps they're going to cool down a little bit. It just makes it harder for businesses to finance. And when they want to cut back on costs, one of the most expensive costs they have are workers. And that's going to probably get a lot worse as the situation worsens.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right, the elephant in the room, recession. Is it here?\n\nElisabeth Buchwald:\n\nEvery time I think, okay we're definitely in a recession or we're definitely heading to one, there's a piece of data that comes out that causes me to think twice. Now, one recent piece of data was the jobs report. It's still been pretty positive and even though many economists are predicting a slowdown, it hasn't shown up in the data yet, even though there are these widespread layoffs, there's a net positive employment effect going on right now. So the fact that we're still adding jobs, even though the economy, the outlook isn't great, is somewhat incredible. But I don't know how much longer that's going to last.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nElisabeth Buchwald, thanks so much for stopping by.\n\nElisabeth Buchwald:\n\nThank you so much for having me.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nThe White House is extending the pause on federal student loan payments until as late as June 30th of next year. The pause had been scheduled to end December 31st. President Joe Biden's plan for wider student loan debt forgiveness remains tied up in courts, but he defended his plan in a message posted to Twitter yesterday.\n\nPresident Joe Biden:\n\nAnd I'm completely confident my plan is legal, but right now it's on hold because of these lawsuits. We're not going to back down though in our fight to give families breathing room. That's why the Department of Justice is asking the Supreme Court of the United States to rule on the case. But it isn't fair to ask tens of millions of borrowers eligible for relief to resume their student debt payments while the courts consider the lawsuit.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nThe exact end to the pause is still uncertain. The Education Department said payments would start two months after litigation ends, or the mass debt relief plan has been implemented. It could last until June 30th, but borrowers won't be required to make payments for an additional two months. The extension coincides with the end of the Supreme Court's current session. Around 26 million people have applied for student loan debt relief. Borrowers received notices from the Education Department over the weekend telling them their loans would be canceled if and when the litigation was resolved. The Department has warned that restarting payments without mass relief could lead to a historically large increase in the amount of loan defaults.\n\n♦\n\nRichard Fierro is a US Army vet who was at Club Q in Colorado Springs on Saturday night when the shooting that killed five and injured 17 others began. Fierro spoke to reporters outside his home about his heroic and life saving decision to take down the shooter.\n\nRichard Fierro:\n\nPull the dude down, pin him against the side, and just start ... oh, I think he went for his pistol. I don't know either way I grabbed the pistol from him and then I told the guy, \"Move the AR.\" The kid in front of me, he was at his head. I said, \"Move the AR, get the AR away from him.\" And the kid did it. And then I started wailing on this dude, and I'm on top of him. I'm a big dude man and this guy was bigger. And I just kept wailing on him. And I told the kid in front of me, \"Kick him in his head, keep kicking him in his head.\"\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nProducer PJ Elliott spoke with USA TODAY national correspondent Trevor Hughes for the latest on the story.\n\nTrevor Hughes:\n\nThe shooter is in custody. He actually has a court appearance on Friday morning here in Colorado. We still haven't learned about the specific charges he'll face or even the injuries that he suffered in this attack. He was taken down by patrons at the club, including an Army veteran who basically ripped him to the ground to just beat him mercilessly with his own pistol.\n\nPJ Elliott:\n\nTrevor, how were people in Colorado Springs processing what happened just a few short days ago?\n\nTrevor Hughes:\n\nWe're still seeing a steady stream of people coming to the memorial here in Colorado Springs. Every few minutes a new car pulls up, parks, and comes out with a bunch of flowers. People are walking quietly and looking at the names, looking at the pictures of the dead, and remembering the times that they had at this club. Club Q is a really important part of this community for this specific community that it served. People felt safe there and so they, they've lost that sense of safety. And I think there is some catharsis, some processing that's going on by people who are coming back and saying, \"You know what, I'm ready to go back when they reopen.\"\n\nPJ Elliott:\n\nTrevor, you've been covering this story since the beginning. What's the feeling or the mood of the people there?\n\nTrevor Hughes:\n\nI think people are still very much in shock that this happened. I mean Colorado Springs is a big city. It has the same issues that other cities have around the countries, small towns and big cities. But people were there just for fun, it's not like these are folks who were out courting danger. These were folks in a safe environment with people who they loved and felt supported by. And I think just the sort of shock and terror that people felt has compounded the violence.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\n$400 million of New York taxpayer money and COVID aid is gone. Fraudsters hatched schemes to steal millions from the state, and that's just the tip of the iceberg, as USA TODAY network health reporter David Robinson is here to explain. David, thanks for making the time.\n\nDavid Robinson:\n\nYes, thanks for having me.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo what kind of fraud are we talking about and how did this happen?\n\nDavid Robinson:\n\nSure. So we're talking about a mix really of different COVID aid programs like the Paycheck Protection Program that helped out small businesses and large businesses, and also unemployment insurance was a big chunk of the fraud. And to be clear, this $400 million is really just the tip of the iceberg. We're expecting this total to be into the billions of dollars and there's already some auditing coming in, in New York showing the unemployment insurance fraud alone at an estimate of $11 billion plus. So really as we dug into this, this year's scale, as the size of fraud, really was striking. The concern was that actually there was so much fraud that it was going to take too long to dig into it from the prosecutor's standpoint. And so they put pressure on federal lawmakers earlier this year to try and extend that statute of limitations. And President Biden in August signed into law an extension of the statute of limitations to 10 years for this. So they really want a lot of time and a lot of effort to go into trying to track down all these tax dollars that were stolen.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nDavid, you write in your piece that fraud like this can shape public perceptions of government. What do you mean by that?\n\nDavid Robinson:\n\nWhen people see this amount of fraud, when they see their tax dollars being wasted and they see a lack of oversight and transparency and really kind of incompetence and negligence from lawmakers and from regulators, that erodes the trust in democracy and in our elected representatives to protect our interest and to protect our money that we send to the federal government, to the state government. And so when you see fraud on this scale, you can't help but think that people further distrust the people that they put in office and the systems and the agencies that are involved in oversight and transparency. And so spotlighting the cases and the efforts to go after this money is important, but also spotlighting the flaws and gaps in the systems and agencies and their failures is also important in trying to avoid this going forward.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nDavid Robinson, thanks so much.\n\nDavid Robinson:\n\nWell, thanks for having me. It was a pleasure.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd thanks to you listener for stopping by another episode of 5 Things. We're here every morning of the week, wherever you get your pods.

With an audience of 2,200, all in required face masks, it was the first Kennedy Centers Honors show staged for a full house since 2019.\n\nThe show was taped for its traditional Christmas week broadcast and will air at 9 p.m. Dec. 22 on CBS.\n\nJust days after another life milestone for Gordy — he turned 92 late last month — the Detroit native got to enjoy one of the most illustrious accolades of his career. He was energetic and in bright spirits throughout the Kennedy Center weekend, which included a post-gala dinner where he, Robinson and Wonder were a magnet for dignitaries and other guests.\n\nIn the heart of the holiday season in the nation’s capital, it was a grand and bustling couple of days for Gordy and his fellow 2021 honorees, including singer-actress Bette Midler, “Saturday Night Live” creator Lorne Michaels, opera star Justino Díaz and singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell, who spent formative artistic years of her own in Detroit during the 1960s.\n\nThe group spent Sunday afternoon at a White House reception with Biden, where the president talked up his personal affection for Gordy’s musical legacy.\n\n“Detroit, Motown — my God,” Biden said during the visit. “I tell you what, I don’t know how I’d have grown up without Motown. Talk about the soul of America.”\n\nRattling off a litany of Gordy-affiliated artists — Jackie Wilson, the Temptations, the Supremes, the Jackson 5 — the president drew chuckles when he told the gathered crowd: “If I had my cellphone, I’d play them all for you.”\n\nGordy told the Free Press afterward he was delighted by Biden's \"complimentary\" remarks about his work and his hometown.\n\nGordy was the focus of the closing segment in Sunday evening's four-hour gala, with Robinson serving as emcee and performing a sweet new composition, \"Did You Know,\" addressed to Gordy in a celebration of their long bond. He debuted the song accompanied by piano in front of a rendering of the Hitsville, U.S.A., house.\n\n“My friend, my wonderful friend, I love you so,” Robinson sang.\n\nWonder’s show finale took a couple of tries: Battling issues with his onstage monitor, he quickly halted his first go, prompting a scramble for production staff and confused chatter in the audience.\n\nEventually all was set and Wonder, at a piano and keyboard, rattled through “My Cheri Amour,” “You Are the Sunshine of My Life” and “Superstition” — the last one getting the tuxedoed-and-gowned crowd off its seats and clapping along, Biden among them.\n\nThe show wrapped with Wonder leading a rendition of his “Higher Ground” joined by singers Andra Day, Brittany Howard, Billy Porter and Ellie Goulding.\n\nIn a nod to Gordy’s filmmaking career — namely his Diana Ross vehicle “Lady Sings the Blues” — Day had stepped out for a smoky take on Billie Holiday’s “God Bless the Child,” reprising her role from recent film “The United States vs. Billie Holiday.”\n\nAnd cast members from the Temptations’ Broadway musical “Ain’t Too Proud” — playing the Supremes and Tempts — delivered a choreographed sequence for “I’m Gonna Make You Love Me.”\n\nGordy is now the Kennedy Center’s latest Motown honoree, following Wonder (1999), Robinson (2006), Diana Ross (2007) and Lionel Richie (2017). Detroit singer Aretha Franklin was honored in 1994.\n\nOn the red carpet ahead of the gala, Robinson said he lobbied for his close friend's inclusion since receiving his own Kennedy Center Honor, saying it was \"overdue.\"\n\n\"It's about time, and I'm very happy for him,\" Robinson said.\n\nGordy's tribute was part of a glitzy Sunday night where stars rubbed shoulders with politicos, and honorees got treated to surprise tributes and performances from friends and artists linked to them.\n\nFor Mitchell, that meant Norah Jones, Goulding, Howard and Herbie Hancock, along with Brandi Carlisle delivering a gorgeous “River.”\n\nDiaz was feted with opera performances that included a warm appearance by his two adult daughters, while Midler got appearances from Scarlett Johansson, Goldie Hawn, Barbara Hershey and a taped salute from Adele, with stage star Porter wowing on a medley of Midler hits.\n\nMichaels drew a host of “SNL” big guns, including Steve Martin, Jimmy Fallon and Pete Davidson, along with several others — Kevin Nealon, Amy Poehler, Seth Meyers, Colin Jost and Michael Che.\n\n\"SNL\" staple Paul Simon, his voice notably thinner since his 2018 farewell tour, nevertheless served up a sweet and sincere rendition of Simon & Garfunkel’s “America.”\n\nSunday's razzle-dazzle was diverse and wide-reaching, but for the Michigan contingent on hand, this was very much a Motown night.\n\nAt the evening’s lavish post-gala dinner adjacent to the opera hall, music aficionado Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Michigan, was feeling the moment.\n\n“Detroit was in the house in full force tonight,” she said. “Berry Gordy deserves every accolade for his leadership and commitment.”\n\nStabenow said she had spoken with Gordy that day about the ongoing $55 million expansion campaign at Detroit’s Motown Museum, site of the label’s original office and studio. The senator said Gordy was emphatic that “we have to get that done,” and she told him she was doing all she could to help.\n\nMore:As Temptations announce 60th anniversary album, Otis Williams is energized, nostalgic\n\nMore:Hitsville transformed: First look at Motown Museum’s new plaza as expansion fund hits $32M\n\nThe expansion fund stands at $37 million, including a $6 million gift from Gordy in 2019.\n\nFans around the globe have clearly shown the enduring love for Motown music, but the Kennedy Center Honors' embrace of Gordy was a kind of formal affirmation of his life's work. As former Motown executive and longtime Gordy friend Suzanne de Passe said Sunday, it's an award \"in a class by itself because it's about an impact on the whole culture and not one narrow corridor of accomplishment.\"\n\nWith Motown, the onetime boxer and auto-line worker struck gold in his musical ventures, a Detroit-worthy combo of soulful creativity and entrepreneurial grit. At his Hitsville complex on West Grand Boulevard, Gordy and his team nurtured young Black talent into global stars, turning Wonder, Robinson, Diana Ross & the Supremes, Marvin Gaye, the Temptations, the Jacksons, the Four Tops and others into headline names.\n\nAfter building his empire, Gordy’s much-decorated résumé went on to include Grammy Awards, a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction and a National Medal of Arts.\n\nBut it was the Kennedy Center distinction that truly floored him, Gordy told the Detroit Free Press when the news came in July.\n\nGordy was formally bestowed his Kennedy Center medal during a Library of Congress dinner on Saturday in front of an audience that included many previous honorees and officials such as Pelosi and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\n\nIn an affectionate speech that turned tearful, de Passe lauded her mentor’s multifaceted career — label founder, filmmaker, Broadway producer, song publishing tycoon.\n\n“He bets on himself, and in so doing, he brings life-changing opportunities to hundreds if not thousands of people,” de Passe said.\n\nDe Passe, who helped develop the Jackson 5, said Gordy and a young Michael Jackson shared a motivation, seeing in one another “a way to achieve greatness.”\n\n“He makes miracles in people’s lives, and not just the Smokey Robinson kind,” she said.\n\nGordy followed with his own remarks, saying the honor was a touching moment: \"We’re talking about the Kennedy Center Honors,” after all.\n\nA voice from the crowd shouted back: “You’re Berry Gordy!”\n\nContact Detroit Free Press music writer Brian McCollum: 313-223-4450 or bmccollum@freepress.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/12/06"}]}
