Biden will officially unveil the holiday decorations and make remarks on Monday alongside leadership of the National Guard and their families.\n\nfrom the White House\n\nEach of the rooms has its own theme within the theme. The East Room, for example, is centered around nature and recreation, and includes representations of four national parks. The Blue Room, which houses the official White House Christmas tree – an 18.5-foot Concolor fir from Auburn, Pennsylvania – includes handmade renderings of the official state and territory birds. The Red Room is the “Faith & Light” room with “towers of candles” and, as has been the tradition since 1975, fresh cranberries as part of the décor. The room also includes orchids, Jill Biden’s favorite flower.\n\nfrom the White House\n\nAgain this year, Biden family members’ stockings will hang from the fireplace mantel in the State Dining Room, each with an orange in the toe, which is a tradition from the first lady’s grandmother.\n\nThere are 77 Christmas trees throughout the White House with over 83,615 holiday lights that decorate the trees, garlands, wreaths and displays.

McLaurin\n\nOpinion columnist\n\nThe holiday season at the White House has become a public moment, part of our national traditions. The lighting of the National Christmas Tree is televised. Visitors and dignitaries get to glimpse an Executive Mansion dressed up with glittering lights, garland and rich decorations.\n\nIt wasn’t always this way. The first known Christmas party at the White House was a small affair for the granddaughter of President John Adams and first lady Abigail Adams. Family lore has it that President Andrew Jackson's children staged an indoor \"snowball fight\" with specially made cotton balls.\n\nThe first White House Christmas tree\n\nThe first documented record of a White House Christmas tree didn’t come until 1889, when President Benjamin Harrison put up an evergreen in the family quarters. Decades later, President Calvin Coolidge flipped the switch on the first public lighting of the National Christmas Tree. (The tree displayed in the Blue Room is still brought to the White House in a horse-drawn carriage.)\n\nI'm a rabbi who loves Christmas movies:Because Hanukkah is prone to the same holiday woes\n\nInsult-A-Columnist Holiday Food Drive:You have helped USA TODAY donate more than 150,000 meals. Let's give more.\n\nIt wasn’t until the era of President Franklin Roosevelt, who spent 10 Christmases at the White House, that the holiday season at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue moved toward becoming a bigger and more national event.\n\nA big Christmas Eve party was thrown for White House staff. Eleanor Roosevelt used the holidays to draw attention to Great Depression conditions – by visiting tree-lightings in Black and working-class neighborhoods, along with charitable events hosted by the Salvation Army, Central Union Mission or a local Kiwanis club.\n\nBut the Roosevelts still celebrated a private Christmas, hanging stockings in the family quarters (including one with a rubber bone for Fala the Scottish terrier). Each year, FDR sat with his family for more than three hours to read Charles Dickens’ \"A Christmas Carol.\"\n\nA wartime Christmas\n\nThen came wartime. In the days after the December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, Americans were on high alert. Fear and nighttime blackouts triggered calls to cancel the tree lighting.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, as the nation’s capital bristled with extra security, Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill – who had sailed for 10 days across the Atlantic to discuss global war strategy – emerged on the South Portico to light the tree. Christmas, the president told the assembled crowd and a nationwide radio audience, signified the “dignity and brotherhood of man” in the face of “enemies who preach the principles of hate and practice them.”\n\nHonoring my mom:Women served in WWII long before we valued them in the military. My mother was one.\n\n'The Forgotten Army' of WWII:D-Day 2022 spurs remembrance of 2.5M vital Allied Indian soldiers\n\nWorld War II brought changes large and small to Christmas at the White House. Roosevelt’s four sons fanned out on active duty, scattered across the world. Holiday gifts to staff included war bonds and a scroll with Roosevelt’s “D-Day Prayer.” As conservation and rationing took hold, electric bulbs were replaced with ornaments made by local schoolchildren.\n\nWhen the war ended in 1945, President Harry Truman lit the tree with electricity once again: “This is the Christmas that a war-weary world has prayed for through long and awful years.”\n\nA focus on holiday traditions\n\nChristmas at the White House resumed its growth and traditions. It was first lady Mamie Eisenhower – who one year installed 26 trees, varying from tabletop size to 18 feet – who started the practice of regularly displaying a tree in the Blue Room.\n\nJackie Kennedy followed, kicking off a tradition of decorating themes (she chose Nutcracker Suite). Motifs since have included Antique Toys, Mother Goose, American Craft, 'Twas The Night Before Christmas, Holidays in the National Parks, All Creatures Great and Small, and Simple Gifts. (This year’s is We the People.)\n\nNew tradition:How Gramps' Great Depression stories saved a Great Recession Christmas\n\nA Muslim's first real Christmas:And how I ended up with an everything bagel tree ornament\n\nFirst lady Patricia Nixon used Christmas to make the White House more visible and accessible, including candlelight tours for the public. She also began the practice of commissioning White House chefs to build holiday gingerbread houses – a simple A-frame design at first; later festooned with candy, jellybeans and reindeer; then growing into a village of gingerbread houses topped with hundreds of marzipan figures and spun sugar decorations.\n\nIn 1993, first lady Hillary Clinton oversaw the creation of a gingerbread replica of the White House that weighed nearly 100 pounds. Others have modeled Santa’s workshop, a winter castle and national monuments and historic landmarks.\n\nPatricia Nixon’s gingerbread legacy lives on in this year’s “White House in Gingerbread” ornament – the latest in a White House ornament series going back to 1981 that has become a holiday tradition for millions of Americans.\n\nCelebrations become diverse\n\nWhite House holiday celebrations are also becoming more diverse. President Jimmy Carter began a tradition of attending local Hanukkah celebrations that President George W. Bush converted into an annual White House menorah lighting, in which the Marine Band plays Hanukkah favorites.\n\nThe shamash candle:On Hanukkah, the 9th candle reflects how anyone can fight antisemitism by sharing truth\n\nBefore the White House acquired a permanent menorah, it would often borrow a historically significant one for the occasion: 2008 featured a bronze candelabra given to President Truman by Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion for the president’s help in establishing the state of Israel. (It was lit by the two leaders’ grandsons.)\n\nAfter the parties and shopping and traveling, there will come an all-too-short respite. Maybe a little snow will cover the White House and its lawn and the trees, a moment of gray and white calm.\n\nPresidents Truman and Reagan were known to try their hand at snowballs; here’s hoping that many of you can do the same this year.\n\nStewart D. McLaurin, a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors, is president of the White House Historical Association, a private nonprofit, nonpartisan organization founded by first lady Jacqueline Kennedy in 1961.\n\nThe association also sells the annual White House Christmas ornament; all proceeds help fund the acquisition of furnishings and artwork for the White House permanent collection, assist in the preservation of the historic rooms and educate the public on the history of the White House.\n\nMore from Stewart D.

Her father served in the National Guard and her late son, Beau Biden, was a major in the Delaware Army National Guard.\n\n“And that is why the National Guard has a very special place in my heart,” Biden told the group including military kids. “We’re here to learn about how your schools and community support you and what more we can do to support you because you have served right along side your parents, because you deserve to have your courage and sacrifice recognized, too.\"\n\nWhite House Thanksgiving:Biden pardons pair of turkeys, Chocolate and Chip\n\n\"The soul of our nation is, and always has been, 'We the People,'\" she says in prepared remarks released by the White House. \"And that is what inspired this year's White House holiday decoration.\"\n\nThe decorations include more than 83,000 twinkling lights on trees, garlands, wreaths and other displays, 77 Christmas trees and 25 wreaths on the exterior of the executive mansion.\n\nA copy of the Declaration of Independence is on display in the library, while the always-show-stopping gingerbread White House includes a sugar cookie replica of Philadelphia's Independence Hall, where the Constitution and Declaration of Independence were signed.\n\nThe Constitution opens with the phrase, \"We the People,\" in a super-large font in the original document, now in the National Archives.\n\nHome for the holidays:10 ideas to improve your Christmas decorations, according to an interior designer\n\n\"The values that unite us can be found all around you, a belief in possibility, optimism and unity,\" Biden says in her prepared remarks. \"Room by room, we represent what brings us together during the holidays and throughout the year.\"\n\nA new addition this year is a menorah, used in Jewish worship, that was built by White House carpenters from wood that was removed during a Truman-era renovation.

Illustrations of the family pets — dog Commander and cat Willow — can be found in the Vermeil Room, where the décor represents different ways of showing kindness and gratitude.\n\nGroupings of snowy trees fill corners of the East Room, which reflects nature and recreation. Four well-known national parks are depicted on the fireplace mantels: Grand Canyon, Yellowstone, Great Smoky Mountains and Shenandoah.\n\nIn the Blue Room, the official White House Christmas tree — an 18 1/2-foot (5.6-meter) Concolor fir from Auburn, Pennsylvania — is decorated to represent unity and hope with handmade renderings of the official birds from all 57 territories, states and the District of Columbia.\n\nThe State Dining Room is dedicated to the next generation — children — and trees there are decorated with ornaments that are self-portraits of the students of the 2021 Teachers of the Year, \"ensuring that children see themselves\" in the décor, the White House said.\n\nHanging from the fireplace in the State Dining Room are the Biden family Christmas stockings. A copy of the first lady's apple crisp recipe card decorates a fireplace mantel in the China Room.\n\nThe gingerbread White House was made using 20 sheets of sugar cookie dough, 30 sheets of gingerbread dough, 100 pounds of pastillage (sugar-paste icing), 30 poundsof chocolate and 40 pounds of royal icing.\n\nThe people, as in \"We the People,\" are celebrated in the Grand Foyer and Cross Hall on the State Floor, where metal ribbons also are inscribed with the names of all the states, territories and the District of Columbia.\n\n\"Mirrored ornaments and reflective surfaces ensure that visitors can see themselves in the décor, noting that the strength of our country — the Soul of our Nation — comes from 'We the People,'\" the White House said.\n\nThe White House noted that the holiday guide book visitors will receive was designed this year by Las Vegas-based Daria Peoples, who is Black. Peoples is a former elementary school teacher who has written and illustrated a series of picture books to support children of color, including those who have experienced race-based trauma.\n\nWhite House holiday decoration is an annual, much loved and generally non-controversial tradition.

The dates of the holiday run from sundown on Dec. 18 to sundown Dec. 26.\n\nHow many days does Hanukkah last?\n\nEight. The festival of lights lasts for eight days, and eight nights -- this year it will begin the evening of Dec. 18, and end the evening of Dec. 26.\n\nWhat is Hanukkah? Why do people celebrate Hanukkah?\n\n\"Hanukkah\" is Hebrew for \"dedication.\" Though the holiday is popularly known as the festival of lights, it is also the festival of rededication, meant to honor the victory of the Macabee soldiers over the Syrian Greek army.\n\nIn their victory the Macabees, led by Judah, reclaimed the Holy Temple in Jerusalem and rededicated it to their God. They had only enough oil to ignite the temple light for one night, and yet the light burned for eight days.\n\nIn the Jewish faith this instance is referred to as the miracle of Hannukah, and every year families honor that miracle during the eight-day holiday. A candle on the \"menorah\" or \"hanukkiah\" is lit each night to mimic the one that burned in the Holy temple so many years ago.\n\nWhat is the meaning of Hanukkah?\n\nHanukkah, the festival of lights, is meant to signify a miracle in the Jewish faith.\n\nIt symbolizes resilience, and the reclaiming of an important Jewish temple which had been captured. It is a holiday centered around rededication to God, and a small bit of oil burning a light for more days than anyone could imagine.\n\nWhat do the 8 days of Hanukkah stand for?\n\nHanukkah is celebrated for eight days to mark the miracle of an oil lamp which had only enough supply to burn for one day when the Macabee army recaptured the Holy Temple in Jerusalem but astonishingly burnt for eight.\n\nLatkes, jelly doughnuts and brisket:Inside Jewish Hanukkah food traditions\n\n'A Festivus for the rest of us':What to know about the 'Seinfeld' holiday\n\nWhy do Hanukkah's days change every year?\n\nThe dates of Hanukkah are determined by the Hebrew Calendar not the Gregorian calendar, which is what we use. This creates a shift in when the holiday is celebrated each year.\n\nThe first day of Hanukkah is always on the 25th day of Kislev on the Hebrew calendar which is lunisolar — based on the movements of the sun and moon.\n\nMore:For American Jews, Christmas is for Chinese food, movies and reflection on being different\n\nWhere is Hanukkah celebrated?\n\nHanukkah is celebrated all around the world -- anywhere you can find a Jewish community, you can find Hanukkah celebrations.\n\nTraditions may vary based on family and sect.\n\nWhat are some traditions of Hanukkah?\n\nAside from the lighting of the menorah, Hanukkah is also celebrated with traditional games and foods.\n\nJewish celebrants will often cook potato pancakes known as \"latkes\" throughout the holiday, serving them at times with apple sauce or sour cream. Another traditional dish is a jelly donut, or \"sufganiyot.\"\n\nAnother honored tradition involves the game of \"dreidel\" in which a four-sided top is spun and whichever face it lands on, each painted with a Hebrew letter, instructs players to add coins or take them out of a poker-style pot. The \"coins\" in question are actually made of chocolate though, wrapped in a gold tin foil to resemble money and called \"gelt.\"\n\nHow many sides does a dreidel have?\n\nA dreidel had four sides, each with a different Hebrew letter on it.\n\nThe fours faces can display:\n\nNun\n\nGimel\n\nHey or Chai\n\nShin\n\nEach letter corresponds to a different directive -- much like poker, you put chocolate coins in the pot or take them out and whoever has the most at the end wins./\n\nWhat do J ews do on Christmas?\n\nSome jews are in mixed-faith families and celebrate Christmas while others choose to participate in traditions of their own to mark the day.\n\nSome Jews spend the day going to the movies or eating out at Chinese restaurants while for others it is a day that punctuates difference, Andrew Wolfson writes for the Louisville Courier Journal.\n\nHanukkah recipes\n\nCheck out these recipes from Louisville chefs that put a spin on popular dishes.\n\nFour terrific Hanukkah dishes everyone should eat.\n\nTry making latkes at home with these easy recipes.\n\nJust Curious?:Your everyday questions answered.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/12/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2021/11/18/hanukkah-nov-28-2021-see-list-local-menorah-lightings/8637370002/", "title": "Hanukkah starts Nov. 28, 2021; see list of local menorah lightings", "text": "Hanukkah begins on Nov. 28 this year.

Weinrib, who lit the first candle on a 13-foot public menorah at Easton Town Center in Columbus, says his biggest triumph was surviving the Holocaust, the Nazi campaign to eliminate Jews in Europe.\n\nWeinrib told The Columbus Dispatch newspaper that he was arrested while working in Polish factories owned by his uncle when he was in his 20s. He spent six years imprisoned in camps, including the notorious Auschwitz.\n\n\"Rather than blowing out 100 candles, he'd rather light one candle representing kindness and good deeds,\" said Rabbi Areyah Kaltmann of the Lori Schottenstein Chabad Center in New Albany, which sponsored the menorah lighting. \"He wants this to be the way he ushers in his next century.\"\n\nIn New York City, Jews celebrated the holiday's start with the ceremonial lighting of a 32-foot-tall menorah at the edge of Central Park. Rabbi Shmuel Butman lit the giant structure that weighs about 4,000 pounds and has real oil lamps, protected from the wind by glass chimneys.\n\n\"It was a beautiful event,\" he said. \"A wonderful way to start the holiday.\"\n\nIn Florida, Gov. Rick Scott celebrated the beginning of Hanukkah with a menorah-lighting ceremony in his office at the state Capitol in Tallahassee. He was joined by a rabbi from the northwest Florida branch of the Chabad Lubavitch outreach organization.\n\n\"The story of Hanukkah reminds us that confidence in one's identity and hope for the future are powerful forces that cannot be defeated — even in the darkest of times.

The panel has weighed criminal referrals for former President Donald Trump and several members of his inner circle. A referral is a recommendation that the Justice Department investigate whether to charge the people in question, but the move is largely symbolic because it doesn’t obligate federal prosecutors to bring such a case. Whether the Justice Department brings charges will depend on whether the facts and the evidence support a prosecution, Attorney General Merrick Garland has said. Garland will make the ultimate call on any charging decisions.\n\n2. Twitter\n\nElon Musk says he will step down as Twitter’s CEO if he’s voted out by a poll he tweeted Sunday. According to the poll, the option “yes” won by a margin of 57% to 43% – and Musk has said he would abide by the results. In several follow-up tweets, Musk suggested he was serious about leaving and made a vague threat about Twitter’s future if he is voted out. “As the saying goes, be careful what you wish, as you might get it,” Musk tweeted. Since buying Twitter for $44 billion and taking over as CEO in late October, Musk has been embroiled in numerous controversies for causing abrupt changes to platform and its workforce. The most recent change came over the weekend when Twitter banned links to certain other social media platforms, including Facebook and Instagram.

Immigration\n\nAs border authorities try to prepare for the scheduled lifting of Title 42 on Wednesday, officials in the Rio Grande Valley say they have encountered between 900 and 1,200 migrants daily during the past two weeks. These numbers are reminiscent of the 2019 surge, when agents at the border encountered at least 1,000 migrants a day, according to a federal law enforcement source. The termination of the Title 42 policy is expected to lead to an increase in border crossings since authorities will no longer be able to quickly expel migrants as has been done since March 2020. Meanwhile, two buses carrying migrants arrived in New York City on Sunday and up to 15 more are expected in the next few days. The city’s shelter system is already at capacity and should expect more than 1,000 additional asylum-seekers to arrive every week, Mayor Eric Adams said. Denver, Colorado, is also struggling to provide shelter for a growing number of migrants.\n\n5.

Twenty passengers were taken to emergency rooms, and 11 patients were in serious condition, Honolulu Emergency Medical Services said in a statement Sunday.

The Festival of Lights. The \"Jewish Christmas.\" The holiday that Adam Sandler wrote a song about.\n\nTo Jewish people, however, Hanukkah isn't actually all that religious of a holiday –though because of its proximity to Christmas, it's often assumed the most important Jewish holiday. It's not. Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur and Passover, for example, are more religiously observed, though Hanukkah certainly holds cultural significance.\n\nAs a child, Hanukkah meant I could get presents just like my predominantly-Christian classmates and not feel left out. It also meant nodding politely (and still doing so) when someone said \"Merry Christmas\" come mid-to-late December, and trying to remember to say it back.\n\nSo, if Hanukkah isn't all that religious, what's all the fuss about?\n\nDisclaimer: Like any minority, I am but one of many members, and my experiences don't reflect that of all Jews.\n\nWhat exactly is Hanukkah and when is it?\n\nKnown as the Festival of Lights, Hanukkah celebrates the rededication of the Second Temple in Jerusalem during the second century B.C. The event occurred when Jews rose up against Greek-Syrian rulers in the Maccabean Revolt and drove them out of Jerusalem, according to the History Channel.\n\nTo mark their victory, Jews wanted to reclaim the temple and light its menorah, but only found enough pure olive oil for one day, according to Chabad.org. That one-day supply lasted eight and is considered a miracle in Jewish faith.\n\nEvery year, Hanukkah begins on the 25th day of Kislev, a month in the Hebrew calendar. It lasts eight nights (yes, because of the oil), and this year it's from Dec. 22-30.\n\nHold up. Did the oil actually last eight days?\n\nNo. Well, maybe. I was sure it was true until my seventh grade Hebrew school class when someone told me it wasn't.\n\nThe story of the oil lasting eight days goes back to ancient rabbis, who seemed to have made up the story while chatting about lighting candles during the holiday, reports The Washington Post. Some staunchly believe the oil story, though others are more inclined to focus on the messages/lessons the holiday teaches.\n\nAlso, back up. Is it Hanukkah or Chanukah?\n\nBoth are correct. In fact, there are more than a dozen variations of how to spell the holiday's name in English, according to the Oxford Dictionaries and Merriam-Webster.\n\nThe differences arise because the holiday's name comes from Hebrew, which doesn't use the Latin alphabet. According to Merriam-Webster, some sounds in Hebrew don't have exact matches for Latin letters, creating the multiple spellings.\n\nToday, the most common spelling Hanukkah, but don't be surprised if you also see Chanukah or Hanukah, according to the two dictionaries.\n\nWhat happens during Hanukkah?\n\nTo mark the holiday, Jews light one candle each evening on a nine-branched menorah. The ninth candle – the shamash, (\"helper\" or \"attendant\") – is used to light the other eight.\n\nThe lit menorahs are displayed prominently, often in windows. Playing with tops called dreidels and exchanging gifts are other Hanukkah traditions to celebrate the holiday. Don't forget about gelt, chocolate coins adults give to children during Hanukkah (a symbol of the money that Jewish parents would give their children in lieu of gifts; \"gelt\" means money in Yiddish).\n\nWait, Hanukkah isn't as big a deal as Christmas?\n\nNo, at least not in the traditional religious sense. In fact, if you Google \"Hanukkah not big deal,\" you'll find a plethora of articles that can tell you as much.\n\nThat said, it's still meaningful for other reasons. When I asked fellow Jews what makes Hanukkah special on my Twitter feed, my followers talked about \"latkes,\" the potato pancakes typically consumed on the holiday. (People eat doughnuts filled with jelly, or sufganiyot, too. Get it? Fried food.)\n\nLike other Jewish holidays, haunting Hebrew hymns are part of the occasion. \"Rugrats,\" the Nickelodeon cartoon, aired a Hanukkah-themed episode in 1996 that holds up as educational, endearing and entertaining.\n\nAnd who can forget about the presents? Growing up it was fun to look forward to a different gift every night – some less expensive like pajamas and art supplies. The best (and probably worst year, for the adults in my family, anyway) was when my grandparents bought each of the dozen or so grandchildren Razor scooters. As I got older, the tradition shifted into one large gift for the period, though we always still light the candles.\n\nOK, but why do people really make a fuss about Hanukkah?\n\nYou can thank (or not thank) American Jews for that. It's debatable whether it was a direct response to Christmas or an effort to encourage young people to make time for synagogue, reports Vox. The Atlantic notes that the story of Hanukkah isn't even in the Torah, the Jewish Bible. For comparison's sake: This is the same bible that included my Torah portion, Bamidbar, which was literally just about counting tribes around a sacred tabernacle.\n\nLike most Jewish teachings, \"it underscores one of the most significant themes in Jewish history: the struggle to practice Judaism when powerful forces seek to extinguish it,\" writes Lauren Markoe of the Religion News Service. Also: \"It serves a particular purpose: an opportunity to negotiate the twin, competing pressures of ethnic tension and assimilation,\" writes Emma Green in The Atlantic (i.e. we are Maccabees, hear us roar).\n\nAnti-Semitism remains more than prevalent in the world today, from the shooting at the kosher supermarket earlier this year in New Jersey to the Tree of Life shooting in Pittsburgh in 2018. President Donald Trump signed an executive order just this month designed to cut off aid to colleges that tolerate anti-Semitism, though some critics called it an effort to stifle free speech and criticism of Israel.\n\nI'm not a super religious person, but after re-educating myself about the holiday while researching this article, I will be proud to light the candles to remind myself about the most important part of the holiday to me: fighting for the right to exist.\n\nContributing: Ryan W.

The eight-day Jewish celebration commemorates the rededication of the Second Temple in Jerusalem during the second century B.C. The event occurred when Jews rose up against Greek-Syrian rulers in the Maccabean Revolt and drove them out of Jerusalem. To mark their victory, Jews wanted to reclaim the temple and light the menorah, but only found enough pure olive oil for one day. That one-day supply lasted eight and is considered a miracle. To mark the holiday, Jews light one candle each evening on a nine-branched menorah.

Johnson\n\nThe Republic | azcentral.com\n\nHanukkah starts at sundown on Dec. 2, 2018, and many Phoenix-area residents will be celebrating the Jewish holiday also known as the Festival of Lights. The celebration runs for eight days, ending this year on Dec. 10.\n\nHere are some things you should know about Hanukkah.\n\nWhat is Hanukkah?\n\nIt is not Jewish Christmas, first of all. The two celebrations often overlap (though not this year) and there are gifts involved, but that’s where the similarities end.\n\nHanukkah celebrates the rededication (Hanukkah means dedication or consecration in Hebrew) of the Holy Temple in Jerusalem following the Maccabee revolt in 165 B.C. against Greek-Syrian rule. The temple had been defiled by occupying forces before it was liberated by a small army led by Judah the Maccabee.\n\nAccording to Chabad.org, the celebration is sometimes referred to as the Festival of Lights because when the Jewish people retook the temple, they found just one bottle of oil to light the menorah (a seven-branched candelabrum) that had not been contaminated. They thought that would only be enough oil for one day’s worth of light but it lasted for the eight days it took to prepare more purified oil.\n\nSo the menorah is part of the celebration?\n\nActually, the type of candelabrum used for Hanukkah celebrations is called a hanukkiah. It has nine branches. Eight branches of the hanukkiah signify the eight days that the oil lasted in the temple. The ninth branch, usually elevated slightly above the others, holds the candle that's used to light the others.\n\nWhat's the correct spelling?\n\nYou've probably seen the word spelled in a variety of ways. The most common acceptable variations are Hanukkah, Hanukah, Chanukah and Chanukkah. Some of the confusion stems from the transliteration of the word from the Hebrew alphabet into English.\n\nWhy does the start date change?\n\nHanukkah can begin any time between Nov. 28 and Dec. 26. The variation is a result of the Jewish calendar being based on the lunar cycle so its dates vary in comparison to other calendars. Hanukkah starts on the 25th day of the month of Kislev on the Jewish calendar.\n\nHow important is Hanukkah?\n\nIn a 2016 interview with The Arizona Republic, Arthur Lavinsky the now-retired rabbi of the Beth El Congregation in Phoenix, said Hanukkah is a minor holiday on the Jewish calendar. He said the celebration is “wonderful and joyous” but does not compare in holiness to holidays such as Rosh Hashanah (the Jewish new year) or Yom Kippur (the day of atonement).\n\nHe said the proximity of Hanukkah to Christmas plays a role in the attention it receives in our society.\n\nWhat does gift giving have to do with Hanukkah?\n\nThe custom of giving gifts is relatively recent, having become more popular in the 20th century. Lavinsky said the influence of Christmas played a role in gifts becoming a part of Hanukkah celebrations in recent years.\n\n“Cultures tend to borrow from one another,” he said, mentioning Judaism’s influence on the Christian rite of baptism.\n\nWhat kind of foods are part of the celebration?\n\nFried foods are part of Hanukkah traditions because of the significance of oil to the celebration.\n\nLatkes, a potato pancake, are popular during Hanukkah. Jelly-filled donuts known as sufganiyot and other sweet treats are popular as well.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/12/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/columnists/2015/12/02/ruth-taber-celebrating-food-hanukkah/76458590/", "title": "Ruth Taber: Celebrating food for Hanukkah", "text": "El Paso Times\n\nHanukkah begins this Sunday evening and Jewish families all over the world will light the first candle on their Hanukkah menorahs.\n\nOne more candle is added each succeeding evening until eight are lit on the final evening. The holiday — also known as the Festival of Lights — commemorates a victory for religious freedom, vanquishing Syrian King Antiochus more than 2000 years ago.\n\nUnder Antiochus’ reign, the Jewish Temple had been converted to a pagan shrine; after the victory it was cleansed and rededicated. (Hanukkah means dedication in Hebrew.) When the victorious Jews prepared to light their ner tamid (eternal flame), there was only enough sacred oil to last one day. Miraculously, the flame burned for eight days.\n\nFried foods came to represent the miracle of the oil, but not until the 14th century, according to the late Rabbi Gil Marks, author of the \"Encyclopedia of Jewish Food.\" Cheese also was associated with the holiday at this time. (The cheese custom grew out of a medieval misunderstanding of one of the books of the Apocrypha, Judith.)\n\nTraditionalists insist fried potato latkes (pancakes) are an absolute must for the holiday table. Creative cooks have added veggies and other foods for more “contemporary” latkes. A full week of latkes would be tedious; fortunately, there’s no shortage of Hanukkah goodies enjoyed in the United States today, derived from recipes brought here by immigrants from other countries.\n\nZangula was brought here by Moroccan and Egyptian Jews. It is deep-fried batter poured into hot oil in a thin spiral and then coated with cinnamon, sugar or honey. They are similar to American funnel cakes. Burmuelos, fried fritters doused in honey, are favorites of Turkish and Greek Jews. In Mexico, Jewish families celebrate Januca and enjoy their buñuelos. Bene Israel Jews from India are known for their milk-based fried pastry, gulab jamun.\n\nJews in Poland adopted the local paczki , a donut filled with jam or jelly, and called them ponchiks. They are similar to the German Berliner donut. These goodies, yeast-based dough fried in oil, showed up a century later in Israel with a new name: sufganiyot, a national specialty at Hanukkah. Growing up in New York City in the 1930s, we called them jelly donuts. They were readily available in local bakeries all year and we had no idea there would be a Hanukkah connection in the future.\n\nEdda Servi Machlin’s \"The Classic Cuisine of the Italian Jews\" describes a typical Hanukkah menu from her childhood days in Pitigliano, Italy, which included frittelle di Chanuka, which are diamond-shaped yeast cakes with raisins and anise seeds fried in oil and then coated with hot honey.\n\nKitty Morse’s \"Sephardic Cuisine from Morocco\" includes a typical Hanukkah dinner: fish dumplings in tomato sauce, couscous with vegetable and mafleta (Sephardic pancakes), the ultimate in labor intensive latkes. A bread-like dough is used to make large pancakes, which get stacked one by one in the pan as they fry. All the pancakes, except the first one, get cooked on one side only. After 15 pancakes have been stacked, they’re moved to a serving plate, where honey or sugar may be added for extra sweetness.\n\nJoan Nathan’s \"Quiches, Kugels, and Couscous\" describes Jewish cooking in France today – mostly an amalgam of recipes from assorted immigrants over the centuries. These recipes evolved to newer versions, which they consider French, not Jewish. When celebrating Hanukkah, however, their fondue bourguignonne is cooked in hot oil. Potato latkes are popular, too, although they may masquerade as pommes dauphines, matafans or galettes/palets de pommes de terre. But, as Nathan writes, \"A latke by any other name is still a latke.\"\n\nNathan describes Hanukkah in France as “predominantly a holiday when children play games, (dreidel spinning) receive gelt or coins (often chocolate) from their parents ... and light the menorah.\" The dreidel game is played all over the world, usually with a four-sided spinning top with a different Hebrew letter on each side. In Mexico, the dreidel game is called toma toda and the dreidel is called pirinola or topa. Letters on the top are an abbreviation for the Hebrew words meaning, \"A great miracle happened there,\" referring to the miracle of the oil.\n\nLatkes are on my menu for the first night of Hanukkah, but I’ll be serving up a few other fried goodies during the week. Here are a couple of recipes you can try:\n\nPotato Latke Grilled Cheese and Apple Panini\n\nServes 2-3\n\nBasic recipe for latke panini\n\n2 russet potatoes ( just over 1 pound), peeled and grated\n\n½ medium onion, finely grated\n\n2 eggs, beaten\n\n2 tablespoons flour (substitute: potato starch or matzo meal)\n\nSalt, pepper to taste\n\nOil for fry pan\n\nAdditional ingredients\n\nSliced cheese (white cheddar cheese is what I used, the amount is up to you)\n\n2 apple slices, thinly cut, peeled and cored\n\nOptional: Sliced avocado, tomato, whatever you like for a sandwich\n\nFor the latkes, squeeze liquid from grated potatoes and onions in a cloth towel. Remember, too much liquid will prevent the batter from holding together. Place potatoes and onions in a bowl and add eggs, flour, salt and pepper and mix well.\n\nPour two to three tablespoons of oil (enough to cover bottom) in a fry pan; heat on medium high.\n\nTo make latke panini, scoop about three to four tablespoons of potato mixture for each latke into the fry pan. Pat down with a spatula to flatten. Cook until bottom is golden brown, about two to three minutes. Turn latkes over and place a slice(s) of cheese and apple (and other ingredients you choose) on one latke. Place second latke, browned side touching cheese, on top of the cheese and apple, and press gently with spatula. Cook about one to two minutes, then turn the panini (both latkes and filling) over, and cook until the bottom is golden brown, about one more minute. Drain on a paper towel and repeat with remaining potato batter.\n\nCan also be topped with fruit.\n\nArancini\n\nMakes about 8-10 rice balls each about 1½ inches in diameter\n\n2 cups cooked white rice (short or medium grain rice works best)\n\nHeaping ½ cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese\n\n2 eggs for rice and cheese mixture\n\n8 to 10 cubes of additional cheese about ¾ inches each (cheddar, gouda, mini-bocconcini, mozzarella or your choice)\n\n2 to 3 tablespoons flour (or potato starch) on a flat plate for dusting balls\n\n1 egg, beaten in bowl, for coating dusted rice balls\n\n1 cup panko crumbs, crushed to make them finer, on flat plate for final coating\n\nOlive or other vegetable oil for fry pan\n\nMix cooked rice, grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and two beaten eggs. Form balls large enough to contain the cheese cubes. Stuff cheese into center of each rice ball, smoothing rice around the cheese.\n\nRoll rice balls in flour, then in beaten egg and finally in panko crumbs.\n\nHeat oil in large fry pan on medium heat and add rice balls without crowding. Turn them as needed until they are golden brown on all sides, about five or six minutes.\n\nCan also be topped with a tomato salsa.\n\nRuth Taber is a member of the International Association of Culinary Professionals; taber.ruth@gmail.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/12/02"}]}

Celebrants light a kinara, or seven-pronged candle holder, for each principle: unity (umoja), self-determination (kujichagulia), collective responsibility (ujima), cooperative economics (ujamaa), purpose (nia), creativity (kuumba) and faith (imani).\n\nIn a video posted Monday, President Joe Biden and first lady Dr. Jill Biden offered thanks “for the rich heritage of African Americans, which is deep in the story of our nation.”\n\n“In 2023, it’s our hope that we’ll all remember the wisdom of the seven principles of Kwanzaa, especially the values of unity and faith, as we work to make the promise of our nation real in the lives of every American,” the president said, standing before a kinara in the White House.\n\nAnd Vice President Kamala Harris – the nation’s first Black vice president, in addition to being the first woman to hold the role – took the opportunity to share her own experience with Kwanzaa as a child.\n\n“Growing up, Kwanzaa was always a special time – we came together with generations of friends and family and neighbors,” Harris said. “There were never enough chairs, so my sister and I and the other children would often sit on the floor, and together we lit the candles of the kinara, and then the elders would talk about how Kwanzaa is a time to celebrate culture, community and family, and they of course taught us about the seven principles.”\n\nHarris said that her favorite principle as a child was the second, kujichagulia, or self-determination, which she called “a deeply American principle – one that guides me each day as vice president.”\n\nThe vice president was joined by her husband, second gentleman Doug Emhoff – the first Jewish spouse to serve in his role.

Sign up for Reviewed’s newsletter to get last-minute gift ideas and other holiday tips from shopping experts.\n\nWhat is Kwanzaa?\n\nFirst celebrated in 1966, Kwanzaa is a celebration of Black culture and African diasporic unity. Each day of Kwanzaa is dedicated to a principle that's supposed to be reflected on and celebrated. In order, the principles are Umoja (unity), Kujichagulia (self-determination), Ujima (collective work and responsibility), Ujamaa (cooperative economics), Nia (purpose), Kuumba (creativity) and Imani (faith).\n\nWhat does Kwanzaa start?\n\nKwanzaa begins this year on Monday, December 26th and runs through Sunday, January 1.\n\nHow many days does Kwanzaa last?\n\nKwanzaa lasts seven days in total. It is a week-long celebration observed annually.\n\nHow to celebrate Kwanzaa\n\nThere's no set are many ways to celebrate Kwanzaa — you can celebrate the holiday with a small family gathering or in a larger, community setting. One can even celebrate Kwanzaa alone by quietly reflecting on each of the principles. Two notable principles to reflect on are Kuumba (creativity) and Imani (faith). Kuumba is usually expressed by having various people show off their creative talents through music, art and poetry. Imani is a call for deep reflection of what an individual believes in.\n\nKwanzaa celebrations typically open each day with honoring ancestors and acknowledging their struggles. Ancestors honored can be from the distant past, such as those who died during the Middle Passage, or more recent relatives, like grandparents. Many often use the time to honor celebrities or community leaders who have passed, as well.\n\nA big part of Kwanzaa is the food, and many celebrate the richness of Pan-African cuisine by eating foods that come from various traditions from different parts of the diaspora. Options include various soul food, gumbo, okra, plantains and couscous. Kwanzaa can be a great time to try out a new recipe or make a favorite passed down through generations. These special feasts, or Karamu, can be held each day or on the sixth night of Kwanzaa.\n\nAnother aspect of Kwanzaa is gift-giving. Gifts are traditionally given on the seventh day of Kwanzaa and focus on handmade items intended for children.\n\nWhat decorations are used for Kwanzaa?\n\nThere are a few things needed to celebrate Kwanzaa properly, including several centerpiece items to be placed on a table throughout the holiday.\n\nPerhaps the most important set piece is the kinara candleholder. This candle holder has space for seven candles—one for each day of Kwanzaa.\n\nA head of corn (either real or decorative) is also placed on a table and symbolizes fertility. Traditionally, there will be an ear of corn for each child.\n\nAn Umoja or unity cup is used to pour libations each day of Kwanzaa to honor those who’ve passed away.\n\nFinally, a mkeka mat symbolizes tradition and is what all the centerpiece items are placed upon.\n\nAdditional items to consider using to symbolize unity are flags, such as the Pan-African flag, which signifies the importance of Pan-African unity and sports the colors most associated with Kwanzaa.\n\nHow many candles for Kwanzaa\n\nA kinara holds seven candles in total, with one more candle lit each day, starting with the center candle and alternating red and green from the center each day. The colors of the candles hold significance. The central black color symbolizes the people, the three green candles symbolize land and the three red candles symbolize the blood or struggles of the people.\n\nDo you give gifts for Kwanzaa?\n\nWhile gift-giving isn't a central component of Kwanzaa, gifts still play a role. They are typically given on the final day of Kwanzaa. Traditionally, gifts are meant for children and are supposed to be handmade, though this certainly isn't a hard-and-fast rule. What's more important is trying to support Black entrepreneurs and Black-owned businesses. Doing so is a way of honoring several of Kwanzaa's principles at once.\n\nKwanzaa gift ideas\n\n1. A Kwanzaa set\n\nYou don't need much to celebrate Kwanzaa, and with this beautiful set from the Kwanzaa Shop, you'll get nearly everything you need in one go. This set comes with a mat, a flag, a basket and a cup. Most stunningly, it comes with a beautiful wooden kinara and candles. You can choose among several beautiful Ghanaian symbols to put on the kinara or choose to have cowrie shells affixed to it. With this set, the only thing you'll be without is the corn.\n\n2. A beautiful serving platter\n\nWith food being such an important part of Kwanzaa, if you’ll be having guests over to celebrate, you'll want a tray to make serving food easier. What better tray to use for the occasion than this beautiful, porcelain one from 54kibo, a Ghanian-founded interior design company that highlights African designs. This particular platter was lovingly handmade in Zimbabwe.\n\n3. Brilliant or BS trivia game\n\nMade by Jamaican-born TV producer Kimelia Weathers-Smith, Brilliant or BS is a unique, hilarious trivia game. Players answer a variety of multiple-choice trivia questions; the kicker is that a judge must then determine if they actually know their stuff or if they're bluffing. It's a game that awards being both knowledgeable and convincing. It'll be sure to light up any gathering, Kwanzaa or otherwise.\n\n4. Mancala set\n\nYou may have heard of mancala, but did you know the game has been played across Africa for centuries? Possible evidence of the game has been unearthed in Eritrea, Egypt and Ethiopia. Whatever its origins, the board game is enjoyed across many nations in Africa today, making it a great symbol of Pan-Africanism. If you'd like to try your hand at mancala, we recommend buying this beautiful, handcrafted board from Etsy.\n\n5. Camille Rose\n\nCamille Rose is another great Black-owned brand to support this Kwanzaa. Founder Janell Stephens started the brand to help treat her children's dermatitis and it quickly grew into a successful brand recognized for its products for various hair textures. For a taste of what this exciting brand has to offer, try its honey leave-in collection. Reviewers rave over how well it hydrates their hair. Plus, it smells great.\n\n6. Uncle Nearest whiskey\n\nDid you know that the famous Jack Daniel owed his whiskey-making expertise to the teachings of a Black, master distiller? Nathan \"Uncle Nearest\" Green was a former slave whose work as head stiller helped make the famous whiskey brand what it is today. His pivotal role in the company was lost for decades. Now, to honor him by making sure everyone knows the name \"Uncle Nearest,\" Green's descendants and researchers are running a premium whiskey brand. Since its inception in 2016, Uncle Nearest has won numerous accolades for its smooth taste. If you're a fan of whiskey or are looking to try something new, give Uncle Nearest a shot this Kwanzaa.\n\n7. Eu’Genia Shea Butter\n\nShea butter has long been a favorite beauty product of many, with women of color being particularly big fans of the extract. It's great at moisturizing, it smells delightful and it's all-natural. Perhaps the biggest drawback to shea butter is its texture—its thickness and hardness is a bit unwieldy if you're used to smoother creams. Fortunately, the Black-owned Eu’Genia Shea solves this by making a shea butter that's as buttery smooth as traditional creams. Daily use of Eu'Genia Shea is said to promote smooth, vibrant skin and anti-aging. We're not saying it's the fountain of youth, but it can't hurt to try, right? This variety pack comes with lavender, grapefruit and unscented shea butter.\n\n8. Be Rooted journal\n\nBe Rooted was founded with the purpose of helping women of color see themselves in places (and products) they haven't often been featured in, from calendars to planners to journals. Be Rooted is based around a simple, yet powerful affirmation: \"You belong here.\" What better way to be affirmed than to write in a journal where your creativity can shine every day? Buyers love Be Rooted journals because they feel represented and inspired every time they open them.\n\n9. Li Li’s Creations\n\nLi Li's Creations is a small clothing store founded by New York native Malacia Anderson that combines eye-catching African-inspired designs with flowing, silky kimonos. She combines her expertise and love for all things vintage with her sense of culture to make clothing like no other. With golds, greens, oranges and blacks that invoke an ethereal forest, this sequin harusi kimono is just as perfect for weddings as it is for brunch.\n\n10. Ami Colé makeup\n\nSenegalese-American entrepreneur Diarrha N'Diaye-Mbaye felt that makeup options were limited for melanin-rich people, so she founded Ami Colé in 2018. Since then, this brand has made waves for its inclusive mission statement and great products. Ami Colé's lip treatments add moisture, color and shine without feeling sticky. The lip treatment trio comes with a rosy-brown shade, a subtle light pink and clear. Starting Friday, December 30, Ami Colé will be available at Sephora, but if you want to gift Ami Colé this holiday season, you can buy it directly from the brand's e-commerce site right now.\n\n11. Royal Nation\n\nRoyal Nation founder Lauren Hayes said that identifying with characters is an important part of childhood development. That's why she created Royal Nation, where every piece of clothing is attached to colorful characters that kids will latch onto. For example, the character Lance, who teaches kids that it's okay to forge your own path to happiness, even if it's not always economically sensible to do so, wears a hoodie that can be bought for children. With an encouraging life quote on the back, this hoodie is more than a hoodie—it's an inspirational statement, which is the core of Kwanzaa gift-giving.\n\n12. Afrikrea\n\nWhether you're looking to gift more traditional African attire this Kwanzaa or just want to support native-born African creatives, Afrikrea should be on your radar. Afrikrea is a storefront that connects African business owners to consumers across the globe. Afrikrea's aim is to distribute African culture so that it becomes a mainstay on the global stage. Paulprooffashion is a Ghanan store with countless pieces of striking clothing. This traditional, two-piece men's outfit is simple yet eye-catching thanks to the pop of brown.\n\n13. Health Roots Dolls\n\nThe toys we play with can have a fundamental impact on the way we view the world and ourselves. Many children love to play with dolls, but often those dolls don't reflect their appearance. Healthy Roots Dolls creates dolls that celebrate diversity, both in skin tone and hair. These dolls' curly hair can teach children how to care for and love their own hair. In addition to dolls, Healthy Roots Dolls sells a variety of accessories that kids will love, too.\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.

Bryant\n\nFor Savannah Morning News\n\nHabari Gani!\n\nThat means “What’s the news?” in Swahili. The news during Kwanzaa is the principle for each day. Of all the holidays observed in December — Hanukkah, Christmas and Kwanzaa — Kwanzaa is probably the least understood.\n\nKwanzaa was created in 1966 by Maulana Karenga, a professor at California State University. The name Kwanzaa comes from the Swahili phrase “matunda ya kwanza,” which means “first fruits.”\n\nObservance of Kwanzaa is not to replace Christmas or any other faith-based holiday. Rather, it is a seven-day non-faith based observation to honor and appreciate African-American heritage through focusing on seven principles or values that reaffirm our community and culture. It is based on seven Swahili Principles and is observed Dec. 26 to Jan. 1. On the sixth day, a community feast is held called the Karamu.\n\nThe 7 Principles are called Nguzo Saba:\n\n• Umoja – Unity – “to strive for a principled and harmonious togetherness in the family community, nation and world African community.” It is foundational and all of the other principles stand on it and stem from it.\n\n• Kujichagulia – Self Determination – “to define ourselves, name ourselves, create for ourselves, and speak for ourselves.” This requires knowing and believing who we are and refusing to let others define us.\n\n• Ujima – Collective Work and Responsibility – “to build and maintain our community together and solve our problems together.” This a commitment to look beyond ourselves and see the needs of others and join together to solve problems facing our community.\n\n• Ujamaa – Cooperative Economics – “to build our own businesses, control the economics of our own community and share in all its work and wealth.” The commitment to buy from Black businesses and to support Black business is the key to building wealth in the Black community\n\n• Nia – Purpose – “to make our collective vocation the building and developing of our community in order to restore our people to their traditional greatness.” When you don’t know your purpose, others will create a purpose for you. The greatness of African-Americans lies in our ability to live in our original purpose.\n\n• Kuumba – Creativity – “to always do as much as we can, in the way we can, in order to leave our community more beautiful and beneficial than we inherited it.” This principle invites each of us to use our gifts, talents and passion to create a better world!\n\n• Imani – Faith – “to believe with all our heart in our people, our parents, our teachers, our leaders, and the righteousness and victory of our struggle.” We must believe in ourselves and in our ability to persevere, survive, and thrive!\n\nIn addition to the principles are the seven symbols of Kwanzaa which are a part of the seven-day observance:\n\n• crops (mzao) represents the historical roots of African-Americans in agriculture and also the reward for collective labor.\n\n• The mat (mkeka) lays the foundation for self- actualization.\n\n• The candle holder (kinara) reminds us of the ancestral origins in the continent of Africa.\n\n• Corn/maize (muhindi) signifies children and the hope associated in the younger generation.\n\n• Gifts (Zawadi) represent commitments of the parents for the children.\n\n• The unity cup (Kikombe Cha Umoja) is used to pour libations in remembrance of the ancestors.\n\n• The seven candles (mishumaa saba) remind us of the seven principles and the colors in flags of African liberation movements — three red, one black and three green.\n\nI incorporate the Kwanzaa Principles into every fall course I teach on African-American studies. Several years ago, a student from Liberia was in the class. He was very ashamed of his name, heritage and culture — so much so that he did not call himself by his African name. The final project was to select a Kwanzaa Principle to present at the end of the semester. He chose Kujichagulia and shared his story of transformation from shame to self-determination. At the end, he re-introduced himself — using his African name. He said it with pride and confidence because he decided to stop allowing others to define him!\n\nThere is power in words. The words used for the seven Kwanzaa Principles are designed to empower, embolden and reengage the Black community specifically, and can do the same for all communities.\n\nKwanzaa Principles can be embraced by everyone, everyday!

When the Northern Hemisphere is at its furthest point, the winter solstice arrives, making for an extraordinarily short number of daylight hours.\n\nLess daylight does not always mean colder temperatures though, in fact, for many places in the US there is a weeks-long gap between the winter solstice and the coldest day of the year.\n\nHere's everything else you should know ahead of this year's winter solstice including how to celebrate, and when the sun will set.\n\nFact check:Ample evidence the Earth is round and rotating, contrary to claims\n\nWhat day is the winter solstice 2022?\n\nThis year winter solstice will take place Wednesday, Dec. 21.\n\nWhat is the winter solstice 2022 sunset time?\n\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, the sun will set on winter solstice around 4:47 pm ET. Depending on where you live the sunset time can vary slightly.\n\nAll across the globe, the solstice is experienced at the same moment, as the sun's rays will be directly over the Tropic of Capricorn, a latitudinal line that lies south of the equator.\n\nWhen is New Year's 2023?:Here's when (and why) we celebrate the holiday\n\nWhat is the winter solstice?\n\nThe winter solstice marks the official beginning of winter in the Northern Hemisphere. In accordance with the astrological calendar, it will fall this year on Dec. 21. It is also the shortest day of the year, with the sun often setting before 5 pm.\n\nAfter the winter solstice the days begin to grow longer, offering more and more hours of sunlight until the calendar reached the summer solstice - the longest day of the year.\n\nBecause the days begin to lengthen, in some cultures the winter solstice signifies a holiday of renewal and fresh beginnings.\n\nIs winter solstice always on the same day?\n\nNo.\n\nIn the Northern Hemisphere the winter solstice occurs each year on one of two days: December 21 or 22. It signifies the point at which the Northern hemisphere is tilted farthest from the sun, making it colder with less light.\n\nWinter solstice in the Northern Hemisphere coincides down to the instant with Summer Solstice in the Southern Hemisphere, as we tilt away from the sun, they tilt towards it.\n\nSummer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere occurs June 20 or 21. In 2023 it will be Wednesday, June 21.\n\nJust curious?:We're here to help answer life's everyday questions\n\nWhat are some winter solstice rituals?\n\nAmong the most famed solstice celebrations is a gather that occurs at Stonehenge in Wiltshire, England. Stonehenge was built as a monument to the alignment of the sun and moon. There, hundreds of worshipers convene each year to celebrate the winter solstice.\n\nIn China, winter solstice coincides with Dongzhi, a holiday meant to usher in the positive energy of the coming year. \"Dong Zhi\" translates literally to “Winter Arrives” and is celebrated by families coming together to enjoy a meal and sharing wishes and hopes for the new year.\n\nFor Iranians, this is also \"Shab-e Yalda,\" a holiday which celebrates Mithra, the Sun God, and her victory over darkness. Traditions involve sharing a special meal, burning fires, performing acts of charity, and sometimes staying up until sunrise to celebrate the return of light.\n\nIn Peru, which celebrates the winter solstice in June, along with the rest of the Southern Hemisphere, Inti Raymi or \"sun festival\" in Quechua is a way for people to honor Inti the god of sun. With deep origins in Incan tradition, the holiday was banned after the Spanish conquest, but given new life in the 20th century, and still celebrated today.\n\nRight here in the United States, the Zuni, a Native American Pueblo tribe in western New Mexico, celebrate the winter solstice as the start of the year, performing Shalako, a ceremonial dance. The Pekwin, or “Sun Priest” will signal the exact moment when the sun is reborn, and then the dance commences.\n\nIn Nothern Arizona, another indigenous community the Hopi tribe marks the winter solstice with the celebration of \"Soyal\" an all-night ceremony which commences after the \"Sun Chief\" announces the setting of the sun.\n\nHow you can celebrate winter solstice\n\nWinter solstice can be celebrated in all different ways depending on your culture, and your family's traditions.\n\nIf you don't have a particular holiday that aligns with the date, Sunset magazine lists these easy ways to mark the solstice, based on Nordic and Pagan tradition:\n\nBuild a yule altar\n\nDecorate a yule tree, or make a wreath\n\nExchange gifts made from nature\n\nSpend time outdoors\n\nLight lots of candles\n\nWhat happens at winter solstice?\n\nWinter solstice occurs at the same instant all across the Northern Hemisphere and coincides exactly with summer solstice in the Southern Hemisphere, marking the beginning of each astrological season for the different parts of the globe.\n\nOn that day, the Northern Hemisphere will experience less than 12 hours of sunlight, the shortest amount all year, while the Southern Hemisphere will experience more than 12 hours, the longest amount.\n\nWhy is the winter solstice so important?\n\nSince before recorded history, different cultures have celebrated winter solstice, The History Channel reports.\n\nMany of those ancient traditions have endured into the modern day, or inspired iterations that take the form of holidays we now know well. Saturnalia, for example, an ancient Roman solstice celebration can be thanked for some Christmas traditions, and St. Lucia's Day, a festival of lights in Scandinavia traces back to a Norse solstice holiday.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/12/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/sciencefair/2016/12/20/winter-solstice/95656640/", "title": "Winter solstice: It only gets better from here", "text": "Doyle Rice\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nHere comes the cold and dark: The winter solstice, the day of the year with the least amount of daylight in the Northern Hemisphere, occurs early Wednesday morning.\n\nThe solstice happens at the same instant everywhere on Earth.

The day of the solstice, however, isn't typically the coldest day of the year. There is a weeks-long lag between the solstice and the coldest average temperature for most spots in the USA.\n\nThis lag in temperature occurs because even though the amount of daylight continues to increase, the Earth's surface continues to lose more heat than it receives from the sun.

The honor is one accorded to all Rome-based cardinals. Law went to Rome after resigning his post in Boston and continued to exert influence in the church until he retired in 2011.

Trump has threatened to eliminate U.S. funding to any member that voted against his decision.\n\nU.S. life expectancy drops for second straight year\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the average life expectancy will drop for Americans for the second straight year, a new report released on Thursday finds.Some of the culprits, researchers say, center on the ongoing opioid crisis and stalled progress on solving heart disease, the nation's biggest killer. According to the report, a baby born in the U.S. in 2016 could expect to live 78.6 years, a decrease of more than a month from 2015 and more than two months from 2014. The decline is the first consecutive year drop since 1962 and 1963. One bit of good news for Americans? If you make it to age 65, you can expect to live another 18 years if you are a man and 20.6 years if you are a woman.\n\nCalifornia under wildfire warning\n\nAfter a brief lull from punishing winds, the second-largest wildfire in modern California history could well roar back to life after the National Weather Service issued a Red Flag warning — signals ideal conditions for wildfires — through Thursday morning. Although evacuation orders were lifted on Tuesday for some of the thousands of Southern California residents displaced this fire season, hillside homes are still threatened in Santa Barbara, about 100 miles northwest of Los Angeles. CalFire reported Wednesday the fire was only 60% contained and will soon become the largest in state history before its expected containment on Jan. 7.\n\nPrefer to listen?

I take Thanksgiving prep very seriously (read: there are lots of lists) and all I ask of my husband on Valentine's Day is a few bars of quality chocolate... and maybe also wine. I wasn't raised in a super religious household, but my mom always made a point of observing the High Holy Days out of love for my stepdad and his family traditions. And not unsurprisingly, my favorite Jewish holidays were the ones that involved food, in particular the soft, cloud-like goodness that is challah.\n\nGet expert shopping advice delivered to your phone.

Since challah is integral to the upcoming Rosh Hashanah holiday, I was eager to speak with the challah queen herself to find out her favorite items for celebrating the Jewish New Year.\n\nAbout Challah Dolly\n\nFounded by Dolly Meckler in March 2020—yes, right at the start of COVID-19—Challah Dolly began as an accident. \"I'm a freelancer, so when COVID hit last year, no one was hiring freelancers, and I couldn't find any work,\" Meckler explains. \"Everybody was baking bread all over my Instagram feed, so I wanted to try, too. I decided to bake challah bread simply because sourdough seemed way too complicated for me—someone who was a complete novice in the kitchen.\"\n\nMeckler documented her challah baking on Instagram, which is where she attracted her first customers.\n\n\"People replied to [my stories] asking if they could buy my loaves,\" she says. \"I was in business! From there, things just started to grow organically. All my sales were from word of mouth and social media, then I started to host pop-ups, and then I started to offer my loaves in retailers around NYC. I now ship nationwide, and I've shipped challah as far as Hawaii!\"\n\nWhen she isn't baking specialty round challah loaves for Rosh Hashanah, she's baking challah for every occasion.\n\n\"Challah Dolly is for people who love family/friend time, for people who love good food, and for people who want to adopt new traditions,\" says Meckler. \"It wasn't until the last few years that I started to view Shabbat (and, frankly, my Jewish identity as a whole) as this really cool cultural tradition that encourages the idea of dedicated time with family and friends, around a table of delicious food, to wind down after a long week. It can be whatever you want to make of it. And it's available for whoever wants to adopt this tradition.\"\n\nHere are Meckler's High Holy Day must-haves for setting the table and enjoying a special meal, from her Instagram-famous challah, to maximalist housewares, and beyond.\n\nChallah Dolly's Round Challah\n\n\"First and foremost, there will obviously be Challah Dolly at my High Holy dinner,\" says Meckler. \"This year I'm offering round plain challahs and round honey cinnamon raisin challahs.\"\n\nThe deadline for ordering round challah loaves from Cholly Dolly is Sunday, August 29, so be sure to get your holiday orders in ASAP.

I love the color and shape, and it's the perfect size for decoration in your home or to place on a festive dinner table.\"\n\nAs a fellow proud owner of this bowl (shoutout to my wedding registry), I can confirm that these bowls make an excellent statement piece when you're not using them, as well as fully functional serving vessels.\n\nGet the Raawii Strøm Small Bowl at West Elm for $57.60\n\nAnna + Nina Flower Candle Set\n\n\"I unfortunately don't own these, but I'm fantasizing about adding these floral candle sticks to my dinner table,\" she says.

Estelle makes glassware in all shapes and sizes, including rocks glasses, cake stands, Champagne coupes, and more.\n\nGet the Estelle Colored Glass Mixed Stemware Set at Anthropologie for $175\n\nChallah-themed accessories\n\n\"Of course, this year I will be sporting my original Challah Dolly pendant by the female-owned jewelry company Garbage NY,\" she says. \"I worked with the ladies of Garbage to turn a photo of my traditional three-strand loaves into a rendering and mold, and then into a gluten-free, neck-ready Challah Dolly pendant.

That doesn’t mean you can’t indulge in some fattening holiday foods. From turducken to Christmas cake, these dishes will fill you up with more than holiday cheer.\n\nKentucky Fried Chicken, Japan\n\nAh, Christmas. That sacred time when you gather friends and family around the table and proudly plop down a bucket of KFC for dinner. Thanks to a genius marketing campaign by Kentucky Fried Chicken in the 1970s, that’s a tradition in Japan. Since Christmas isn’t a big holiday there, marketing executives seized on the empty space, with the slogan “Kentucky for Christmas” and a themed “party barrel” full of fried chicken. The tradition holds strong today, and is so popular that you’ll have to pre-order your meal (which can be paired with cake or sparkling wine, also sold by the chain) and stand in line to pick it up.\n\nTurducken, United States\n\nTurducken is quite possibly the most American dish ever. It’s for when you just can’t decide which kind of meat you want, so you mash the first three animals you can think of into one unnatural Frankenstein specimen. Turducken is made by stuffing a chicken inside a duck, which is then wedged into a turkey. Make it extra American by tossing it in the deep fryer.\n\nEggnog, various countries\n\nEggnog may be a drink, but you should think of it more as a meal replacement shake. This creamy beverage packs about 400 calories, 19 grams of fat and 21 grams of sugar into one cup. On the bright side, you’ll also get about 9.7 grams of protein (and maybe a nice buzz if it’s spiked).\n\nChristmas cake, Great Britain\n\nLike Twinkies, Christmas cake is good to have on hand in case of an apocalypse, as it will stay good for an alarmingly long time. Christmas cake is traditionally made months ahead of time, in order to give the flavors of the dried fruit and spices time to mingle together. Fortunately, the cake is soaked in a good amount of alcohol that keeps it preserved until it’s ready to eat.\n\nThe 13 desserts of Christmas, Provence, France\n\nIf you’re having Christmas dinner in Provence, you’d really better save room for dessert. The post-meal tradition requires that 13 different types of sweets (like marzipan candy or dates) are served, and that each guest has a small bit of each dish. No leaving the table until you finish your 13 desserts!\n\nLatkes, Israel\n\nTraditionally made for Hanukkah, latkes are potato pancakes that are fried in plenty of oil, then served with toppings such as sour cream or apple sauce. Much like potato chips, it’s pretty much impossible to eat just one latke, which is unfortunate since each tiny treat has about 5 grams of fat.\n\nBuñuelos, Mexico\n\nNicknamed “Mexican Christmas fritters,” buñuelos are sure to put you in the holiday spirit (by means of a sugar rush). Buñuelos are made from fried dough topped with cinnamon sugar and served with warm honey or syrup for extra sweetness. They’re traditionally paired with hot chocolate to really up the cavity risk factor.\n\nThis story originally appeared on SmarterTravel.com.\n\nMore from SmarterTravel:\n\n10 most fattening foods in the world\n\n8 foods you should never eat before flying\n\n10 foreign fast food chains we want in the U.S.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/12/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/dining/2021/03/22/phoenix-dim-sum-restaurants-tradition/4665302001/", "title": "How COVID-19 has impacted metro Phoenix's dim sum restaurants", "text": "Unlike many Chinese American families who have fond childhood memories of eating dim sum every weekend, my parents in Texas — who emigrated from Thailand and Laos respectively — saw it as an occasional treat, a family event should we make the hour drive to Richardson, a suburb of Dallas.\n\nAt the now-closed Maxim’s, and later Kirin Court, the four of us, plus a couple of cousins, would gather around a circular table with a lazy Susan in the center, pouring hot tea and reaching with chopsticks to serve each other: juicy parcels of siu mai topped with shrimp, fried crab claws and pillowy red bean buns.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/03/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/08/05/take-tour-burlingtons-edible-history/88179336/", "title": "Take a tour of Burlington's edible history", "text": "ELISE GUYETTE and GAIL ROSENBERG\n\nFor the Free Press\n\nThe past is a vastly different place from the present. Most of us would hardly recognize our Queen City if transported back 100 years: Burlington’s sidewalks rang with many languages: French-Canadian, Russian, Italian, German, Lithuanian, Arabic, Greek, Chinese and others. Shoppers conducted business with people from all over the world. Battery Street sprouted tenements, boarding houses, and victualizing houses for immigrant workers. Families grew mounds of foods in their backyards, and ate dishes from their various cultures around their dinner tables.\n\nAlthough we see much diversity in our community today, the past was even more so. By 1910, Vermont’s population was 14 percent foreign born. The country as a whole was 15 percent, so Vermont mirrored the wider nation. The percent of foreign-born citizens was likely much higher in Burlington, Essex, and Winooski, as it is today. Vermont was only 4 percent foreign-born in 2010, while Winooski was 14 percent, Essex 10 percent, Burlington and South Burlington 8 percent\n\nSome of these new immigrant groups — many from Africa and Asia — serve the foods of their homelands in Burlington restaurants, cafes, and food carts. It would be logical to think the same was true 100 years ago. After all, food traditions link people to the land and hearths they left behind. The foods of their homelands give people comfort when adjusting to a new culture, especially for refugees who fled violence taking almost nothing of home with them. But the past is a different world, as we discovered during our research to develop our Burlington Edible History Tour. We wanted the tour to be rooted in our immigrant history and to explore food businesses and food traditions brought from other countries.\n\nServing ‘American’ foods\n\nAs we searched through Burlington City Directories and other public records, we found it was easier uncovering food businesses owned by migrants, than finding their food traditions. We turned to the best sources for this information – descendants of immigrants. Their ancestors were interested in assimilating into their new surroundings, in public at least. Those who started restaurants served what they considered “American” foods. Even in the 1930s-40s, when Greeks owned most of Burlington’s restaurants, they weren’t serving Greek food. “Who would want peasant food!” they said. Nick Danigelis, whose Greek parents Louis and Anna ran the Liberty Restaurant & Sea Grill (now Church Street Tavern) from 1941-68, tells us the restaurant was celebrated for spaghetti and meatballs — a recipe that one family story says was given to Louis by a mobster in Detroit, but that has never been verified. Fred Solomon says that his Lebanese father’s restaurant, The Oyster Bar, was famous for oysters and lobsters. Syrian Abdallah Mady and his Canadian wife Ida, who had a restaurant on Battery Street (1917 to 1938), served beefsteak and eggs for breakfast.\n\nHowever, there was one restaurant serving traditional foods in 1921. Wong J. Toy and his wife Wong Chin bought the long-standing Star Restaurant at 144 Church St.. They made it into a Chinese-American restaurant and managed it until 1948. For 90 years, the restaurants in that space were Asian. With a Japanese restaurant there now, the spirit feels right for success!\n\nNew Burlingtonians preserved their food traditions at family gatherings and in small markets that dotted the city. Merola’s Market on Cherry Street, gone due to 1960s urban renewal, was at the center of the Italian neighborhood, and Frank and Stella made it a welcoming place. According to their granddaughter, Janie Merola McKenzie, Italian-born Frank bought as much local produce as he could, especially fresh perch and smelt from Lake Champlain’s ice fishermen. The pasta came from Boston, loose rather than packaged, waiting to be weighed and bagged in front of the customer. Olive oil and olives came from Italy. Italian cheeses hung behind the cash register.\n\nFor the Merola family, traditional foods were central to their celebrations, as it was for so many descendants whom we interviewed. Merola’s was open 6 1/2 days a week and closed at 1 pm on Sunday; the family meal started at 1:30 pm. The Sunday meal was “always an adventure,” according to Janie. At every meal, visitors appeared whom she didn’t know: relatives or people with no families in the area. There was always pasta, with sauce from local tomatoes, and meatballs. They bought Italian bread from a nearby French bakery. On Christmas Eve, they celebrated with a traditional seven-fish meal. In Burlington, many tables probably included the new addition of perch.\n\nThe German community\n\nThe Kieslich Market (1913-1984), in the German community on North Avenue, carried items that German immigrants craved: sauerkraut, corned beef, sausage, and head cheese, among their products. The founder’s grandson, Dick Kieslich, described a homemade machine that made sauerkraut, which the family placed in wooden barrels to ferment, with marble weights holding down the lids against accumulating gases. This cabbage ended up on customers’ tables or on plates at Sunday picnics organized by the private Goethe Club on Crowley Street. These get-togethers were a major way for Germans to socialize and enjoy their traditional foods. They ate potato salad dressed with vinegar, hams, sausages, red cabbage, sauerkraut, and pickles from barrels. The men rolled in German beer kegs – skirting the blue laws that banned public drinking on Sunday.\n\nMirroring the concern of many migrant groups for those who experienced a lack of food, Dick described how his family saved the “bologna ends” of cold cuts for hungry children. Dick, later the store owner, said that people often approach him to say how much they appreciated the help and kindness during hard times.\n\nJohn and Nellie McKenzie, who continued their Irish traditions of making sausages and smoking hams, ran another early market. They started a small grocery store on Pearl Street below their apartment (now Bove’s parking lot) and in 1907 bought a house at 40 George St. for a meat manufacturing plant. The manufactory, an old horse barn in the back of the house with a loading dock (where McKenzie House is), proved much more profitable than the market, so they closed the market and went into fulltime meat production. A Burlington law prohibited pigpens within a 3/4 mile radius of Church and Bank streets, so they started a grass-fed pig farm and slaughterhouse in the Intervale to ensure fresh, local meat.\n\nNellie Mahoney McKenzie was “the nicest person on Earth,” according to grandson Bill McKenzie. She fed all the McKenzie workers and firemen who stopped in for breakfast every morning. Destitute people sometimes stopped at her back door for food, and she never turned anyone away, although she often asked them to perform a chore, such as chopping wood. The company prospered for close to 100 years, and though they sold their brand, the McKenzies run the sales and distribution from Flynn Avenue.\n\nOne Yankee-owned grocery store on North Champlain Street supplied lamb for traditional dishes: Bostwick’s Market near their Monroe Street home (1865-1952) and barn on Smith’s Lane. Few markets at the time sold lamb, which is so important to Lebanese and Greek cooking. Monica Farrington, a Lebanese woman who grew up on South Champlain Street, told us stories about her grandmother Lillian Masi Allen who could not speak English well, but knew how to contact Bostwick’s. She simply picked up the phone and said “Bostwicks” to the operator. Once connected, she ordered cuts of lamb, which were delivered a short time later. Lillian had a chicken house and two big gardens, one filled with all manner of vegetables, the other for only tomatoes. “She put tomatoes in everything!” exclaimed Monica. She canned 130 jars every year. Her Aunt Katherine next door had purple grapes, which “made good jelly.” For stuffed grape leaves, they went to Battery Street along the railroad tracks, where the wild grapes grew.\n\nAnother Lebanese descendant, John Crabbe, remembers Sunday meals at his grandparents’ home on Maple Street – the home of Bacus and Aneica Fayette. The older men sat on the back porch, reading Arabic language newspapers while the children played in the backyard. The women spent much time cooking when they got together. They had a brick, wood-fired bread oven; the women used long wooden paddles to remove the fragrant breads. John especially loved opening the basement door and smelling homemade Lebanese liqueur, arak, made with anisette and pounds of raisins. For Easter, Lebanese and Greek families had the lambs raised in their backyards ritually slaughtered by a woman who knew the traditions. The custom was to eat every part of the lamb, and they even fought over the “good” parts: organ meats.\n\nSome migrants, however, remember how Yankee children in school sometimes made fun of the traditional foods that their moms packed for lunches. In her 1937 book about Burlington, “We Americans: A Study of Cleavage in an American City,: Elin Anderson provides clues to such behavior: “The small Old American group (Yankees) has been helped to maintain its predominant position by the strength of its traditional feeling of the racial superiority of the Anglo-Saxon.” These feelings of superiority seem to have crossed over to foods as well. In researching old Vermont and Burlington cookbooks, we found book after book filled with traditional recipes of Yankees and northern Europeans, who were considered most compatible with Yankees. Such publications were meant to encourage newcomers to assimilate and leave behind traditions from their homelands.\n\nNative products in Vermont\n\nLittle did these ‘Old Americans’ know that they were eating and promoting foods much older than the fare brought by their Anglo-Saxon ancestors. We have the Native peoples of the Americas to thank for a large percentage of the foods eaten around the world today. In Vermont, indigenous foods include Abenaki rose corn, cranberry beans, white scallop squash, and large American strawberries. Nineteenth century agricultural census reports for Vermont showed that farmers grew mostly native products, such as Indian corn, peas, beans, and potatoes, mixed with Yankees products like apples, wheat, and rye. The Abenaki of today are rediscovering their earliest crops saved by small pockets of people around New England. Their original diet was low in carbohydrates, with no added sugars (except maple), but high in beans, nuts, fish, tomatoes, berries, and sweet potatoes – excellent anti-diabetic foods. Our logo contains a strawberry in honor of foods developed by American Indians, since so many of them have been mixed with old world fare to create today’s cuisine.\n\nEven the name Yankee connotes a syncretism (mixture) of eastern and western hemisphere traditions. Those who sailed to the Americas were soldiers, sailors, entrepreneurs, ministers, landless nobility, and servants. Hunting and husbandry were unfamiliar to them. They survived by learning the hunting, gathering, and farming techniques of indigenous peoples. A new Yankee culture — a new ethnic group — emerged out of that mixture of British traditions plus the skills and products of the Americas.\n\nThe mixing of British and American Indian traditions was not the only fusion. Enslaved African peoples, kidnapped and forced to the Americas and Vermont, brought nothing with them except the knowledge and traditions of their homelands. As the centuries went by African, Yankee, and Southern traditions and mixed. While the larger groups of African-descended people in the South (like the Gullah/Geechee people of the U.S. Southeast) have been able to hold onto many traditions, the much smaller numbers in the northeast meant more thorough assimilation. In the North, a new group — Black Yankees — developed. A group of Black Yankees settled in Hinesburg in the 1790s. An 1860 agricultural census indicated that they produced what other Yankees were growing: Indian corn, Irish potatoes, maple sugar, oats, wheat, and apples. After the Civil War, descendants of these pioneers participated in the farm-to-city movement and migrated to Elmwood Avenue in Burlington. They had large backyards where they could have gardens, while they became laborers, barbers, and cooks in the big city.\n\nWhile these farm-to-city migrants began to earn their living largely away from the food scene, many other immigrants started out with food carts selling fruits, vegetables, sandwiches, and other foodstuffs. David Hershberg talked about his father, Louis, who traveled the ocean from Lithuania by himself at age 16 and settled in the Jewish community in the North End. Louis started as a peddler, eventually buying produce from local farms, and then opened Hershberg Warehouse at 180 Battery Street (torn down in 1971, but the lobby of the replacement building has historic photos). Food trucks, a popular part of today’s culture, are not a new phenomenon. The earliest recorded food cart was H. D. Stone’s on Bank Street in 1895. The first Church Street food cart appeared in 1902 owned by Samuel Bergman, a Jewish man from Latvia. He sometimes registered his business as a lunch cart and sometimes as a night lunch cart (an “owl” cart).\n\nWe discovered that Jews and Vermont’s largest migrant group, French-Canadians, were commonly very friendly, living in the same neighborhoods and often attending the same schools. Thom Fleury and Peg Dumas related that their French-Canadian families lived on one side of St. Louis Street; the other side was Jewish. Thom remembers his father saying he was a ‘Sabbath Goy’ – a non-Jew who performed tasks for observant Jews who did no work, including cooking, from sundown Fridays to sundown Saturdays.\n\nPeg’s family baked traditional French-Canadian meat pies, or tortiere, at Christmas. Her family’s recipe is a mix of pork and beef, mashed potatoes, and spices. Other families use only pork, spices, and breadcrumbs. At the Dumas house, her mother’s Easter feast always included ham. Her Dad was a good cook too. One Friday night, meatless according to Catholic tradition, when her mother was working her father served the children frogs’ legs. Her mother thought it was terrible because that wasn’t fish, but he countered, “They’re from the water!”\n\nWhile growing up, Peg and Thom’s families shopped on North Street, the neighborhood’s “downtown.” One popular market was Alex Colodny’s, where Thom’s grandfather cut meat. Though Alex was a devout Jew, he aided “all who needed help, regardless of their ethnic background.” When Thom’s grandfather was dying of cancer in the 1940s, Alex brought food to his grandmother, being very diplomatic, never presenting it as charity. “Oh, Adeline,” he’d say, “I overbought this. Would you take it off my hands?” Thom observed, “He took pride in protecting other people’s pride.”\n\nWe are very proud of what we have started in Burlington — saving the day-to-day history of Burlington’s migrant groups, families, and businesses that have made our city what it is today. We also understand that new migrants continue to arrive and add new flavors from all over the world. If you listen carefully, you can hear Swahili, Vietnamese, Bosnian, Maay-Maay, Somali and many other languages on our streets. When we were creating our Edible History Tour, we knew we wanted to donate some of our profits to a good cause. In the spirit of generosity of the various people who built Burlington, we decided to donate 10 percent of our profits to New Farms for New Americans (NFNA), a great match for the themes in our tour. NFNA provides affordable farmland to refugees and immigrants so they can stay connected to their culinary traditions and crops that remind them of home. Join us on a tour and you too can donate to Burlington’s newest farmers!\n\nElise Guyette and Gail Rosenberg are co-founders of Burlington Edible History Tour.\n\nTo learn more\n\nBURLINGTON EDIBLE HISTORY TOUR: Part food.

But we have all probably at some point in life been told that \"breakfast is the most important meal of the day,\" an old saying that actually might be -- at least to some extent -- true.\n\nNo matter what studies and research might say about breakfast -- will it help you lose weight? Will you gain weight? -- the morning meal is enjoyed in one way or another in countries all around the world. What a typical breakfast plate looks like can also tell a lot about a country's general food culture, and attitude toward this fast-breaking meal.\n\nThe traditional American spread of fried eggs, bacon, toast and possibly potatoes might seem like an oddly heavy way to start the day to someone from France or Japan, for example. In France, the typical morning meal consists of a light snack, such as a baguette with a spread of butter and jam, or maybe the famous \"Parisian breakfast\" of a freshly baked croissant and a cup of coffee. In Japan, a bowl of miso soup and rice is not uncommon in the morning, and in several parts of the world, a sweet or savory porridge is a common way to start the day.\n\nTo compare typical breakfasts around the world, we at The Daily Meal gathered pictures of breakfast plates from 12 different countries -- from India to Finland to Venezuela -- and put them together in the slideshow above. So click on through and get a peek into the typical way to enjoy \"the most important meal of the day\" -- all around the word.\n\nJapan\n\nA breakfast in Japan is often light, savory and simple. A bowl of miso soup and rice or rice porridge is often the main part of the meal, sometimes accompanied by a piece of cooked fish and some pickled vegetables, and of course a cup of green tea.\n\nFrance\n\nA piece of baguette, topped with butter and jam, is a common breakfast in France. Breakfast pastries, such as croissants, are often also eaten together with coffee or a glass of juice.\n\nChina\n\nCongee, rice porridge, is a popular comfort food and breakfast item in China, as well as several other Asian countries. The savory porridge can be eaten plain, or topped with anything from ground meat to squid.\n\nKorea\n\nIn Korea, a typical breakfast consists of foods that could be found at lunch or dinner as well: a stew of some sort, rice and several side dishes, such as kimchi, spinach and spicy cucumbers.\n\nIndia\n\nA typical breakfast in India varies depending on region, but is often quite similar to a lunch or dinner. A breakfast plate in India might include roti (flatbread), dosas (thin crepes made of lentils) or idlis (steamed rice-dough pancakes), and different dips and chutneys, as well as spiced potatoes.\n\nMexico\n\nDepending on the region of Mexico, typical breakfast items may vary slightly, but often include ingredients such as corn tortillas, eggs, beans and sauces, compiled in different way. One common breakfast item is chilaquiles -- fried corn tortilla chips topped with green or red salsa (or mole) eggs, pulled chicken, cheese and refried beans.\n\nSpain\n\nIn Spain, a typical morning might start out sweet, with a serving of chocolate con churros (hot chocolate with churros). The stick-shaped churros are served with a thick hot chocolate, used as a dip.\n\nSwitzerland\n\nA breakfast item now enjoyed in several parts of the world -- muesli -- has its roots in Switzerland. Here, the cereal blend of oat flakes, nuts and raisins or other types of dried fruit is often eaten with yogurt.\n\nVenezuela\n\nThe soft corn flatbread arepa is eaten in Venezuela throughout the day, but most commonly served in the morning stuffed with different fillings such as cheese, meat or beans.\n\nBrazil\n\nSteaming warm, fresh-from-the-oven pao de queijos, round-shaped \"cheese buns,\" are a breakfast staple in Brazil.

The conglomerate behind Skippy and Jennie-O turkey says it can’t make Spam fast enough and is increasing production capacity.\n\nSpam is a trending ingredient on TikTok and on the menu at fine-dining restaurants in coastal cities. In 2019, a limited-edition Spam pumpkin spice flavor sold out in minutes. (You can still buy it on Ebay, where it goes for up to $100 per can.)\n\nWhat is behind this phenomenon? Why does this slab of cooked pork that has long been stigmatized as fake meat, linked to wartime rations and hilariously spoofed on Monty Python now have cachet with foodies?\n\nSpam’s popularity in Hawaiian, Asian and Pacific Island cuisine has influenced its growth in the United States. As more immigrants came to the United States and fusion dishes and ethnic cuisines entered the cultural mainstream, Spam has reached new, younger foodies, say Hormel, food analysts and researchers.\n\nEdgy and clever advertising campaigns also have helped Spam attract a broader customer range than the Baby Boomers who grew up eating it, sometimes reluctantly.\n\n“Spam has undergone a reputation makeover,” said Robert Ku, an associate professor of Asian and Asian American studies at Binghamton University and the author of “Dubious Gastronomy: Eating Asian in the USA.” “A lot of celebrity chefs have been Asian and Asian American, and reintroduced Spam to a new audience.”\n\n‘Miracle meat’\n\nMore than 100,000 visitors stream into the Spam museum every year in Austin, Minnesota, with stories to tell about Spam and recipes to share, said Savile Lord, the manager of the museum in the brand’s hometown. Visitors most often ask her and other museum “Spambassadors” how Spam got its name and what the heck is in it.\n\nA family peruses the history of Spam at the Spam museum. Josh Noel/Minneapolis Star Tribune/Tribune News Service/Getty Images\n\nSpam first hit shelves in 1937 as a 12-ounce, 25-cent, convenient and long-lasting protein in a tin can during the lean years of the Great Depression. Spam contained nothing but pork shoulder, chopped ham, water, sugar and sodium.\n\nIt was a concoction of George Hormel and his son, Jay, meatpackers in Austin. The Hormels had been working on the “problem of canning a nonperishable pork product for a good many years and at last we solved it,” Jay told The New Yorker in 1945.\n\nThey offered a $100 prize for the best name for the food. It needed to be short for display purposes and to fit on one-column newspaper advertisements. It also had to pronounceable in any language.\n\nThe brother of a corporate executive threw out “Spam,” a combination of “spice” and “ham,” at a party, and Hormel “knew then and there that the name was perfect.”\n\nFrom the beginning, Spam was marketed as a time-saver and a food for any meal: Spam and eggs. Spam and pancakes. Spam and beans, spaghetti, macaroni and crackers. Spamwiches.\n\nA pie made with Spam-brand canned meat, potatoes, scallions, and cream of mushroom soup during the 1950s or 1960s. Tom Kelley/Getty Images\n\n“Never have you imagined a meat could turn into so many interesting uses. Morning, noon or night – cold or hot – Spam hits the spot!” read one early advertisement. Spam was a “miracle meat,” the company told consumers in newspaper spots and radio ads.\n\nAnd then came the United States’ entrance into World War II in 1941, the decisive moment in Spam’s growth.\n\nAt many Pacific outposts, which had little refrigeration or local sources of meat, American and Allied troops relied on the canned meat that could be stored away for months and eaten on the go.\n\nHormel says more than 100 million pounds of Spam were shipped overseas to help feed the troops during the war. Uncle Sam became known as Uncle Spam, much to the dismay of troops forced to eat it every single day.\n\n“During World War II, of course, I ate my share of Spam along with millions of other soldiers,” Dwight D. Eisenhower later wrote to Hormel’s president. “I’ll even confess to a few unkind remarks about it – uttered during the strain of battle.”\n\nFor the citizens of conflict-wracked countries in the Pacific struggling with hunger and famine during the war and rebuilding years, however, Spam was a symbol of access to American goods and services. Sometimes, it was the only protein source available. After US troops left, Spam remained, becoming an ingredient in local dishes.\n\n“Spam became part of Asian culture,” said Ayalla Ruvio, a consumer behavior researcher at Michigan State University who studies identity and consumption habits. “It represented a piece of America. It’s like Coca-Cola or McDonald’s.”\n\nAmerican troops also introduced Spam in Korea during the Korean War in the early 1950s, and Budae Jjigae (Army Stew) became a popular Korean dish. Spam also remains a common ingredient in dishes almost anywhere US soldiers were stationed, such as Guam, the Philippines and Okinawa, Japan.\n\nIn Hawaii, where the US military has long been a major presence, more Spam is consumed per person than any other state. It’s stacked on a block of rice and wrapped in seaweed to make Spam musubi and sold at fast-food chains like McDonald’s in Hawaii. There’s even an annual Waikiki Spam Jam festival.\n\nSpam musubi and tacos\n\nMany US soldiers returning from World War II vowed never to eat Spam again, and the brand became linked to rationing and economic hardship. But Spam has appealed to new consumers in the United States in recent years.\n\nSpam musubi, a common Japanese lunch dish that was created in Hawaii. Glenn Asakawa/The Denver Post/Getty Images\n\n“When I first started getting into the brand, we started to notice this transition to a stronger multicultural set of consumers,” said Brian Lillis, who has been product’s brand manager for six years. “They brought with them the traditions of utilizing the product in their home country or where maybe their ancestors came from.”\n\nHormel has worked with chefs at Korean, Taiwanese and Vietnamese restaurants to get Spam on menus. As more people have been introduced to these dishes, they go home and try to make their own versions, Lillis said.\n\nSpam highlights its versatility in dishes on social media and TV advertisements. There are ads for Spam and eggs, as well as Spam fried rice, Spam musubi, yakitori, and poke.\n\nSpam has made a comeback in the United States because Asian and Asian American chefs such as Chris Oh have tried to reinvent it in their own ways, said Ku, the Binghamton University professor. “They brought some of the culinary influences of Asia and the Pacific and upscaled it.”", "authors": ["Nathaniel Meyersohn"], "publish_date": "2022/10/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/dining/2018/12/01/essential-east-side-dining-guide-2019-edition-des-moines-mexican-honduran-chinese-burgers-italian/822316002/", "title": "The essential East Side restaurants: 2019 edition", "text": "Des Moines' East Side is a diverse area.

Others give up social media. Still others put the kibosh on television.\n\nFasting as a way to regain or refocus spirituality is common in many religions.\n\nSome Christians observe Lent, which begins on Ash Wednesday (Feb. 26 this year) and ends on either Holy Thursday, Palm Saturday or Palm Sunday — depending on what you believe. Others, like actor Chris Pratt, may also choose to follow the Daniel Fast, which isn't tied to a specific religious holiday.\n\nDuring the month-long fast of Ramadan, Muslims are not allowed to eat, drink or engage in any sensual activity between break of dawn and sunset — no, not even water.\n\nYom Kippur is considered the holiest day of the year in the Jewish faith. During the observance, Jews do not eat or drink anything for 25 hours.\n\nHere is a deeper look at four fasts that can be found in Christianity, Islam and Judaism.\n\nLent\n\nReverend Marc Lavarin, the assistant minister at the Alfred Street Baptist church in Alexandria, Virginia describes Lent as a season of preparation as Christians look ahead towards Jesus' resurrection and his journey to crucifixion.\n\n\"Ash Wednesday is a reminder that we are dust and to dust we will return,\" Lavarin said, explaining the ash on Christians' foreheads at the start of Lent.\n\nHe said the most common thing people tend to eliminate during Lent is chocolate or sugar, but since fasting doesn't necessarily have to do with food, some people will also give up social media or TV.\n\nLavarin said Easter is the culmination of Lent and observers generally go back to eating and doing whatever it is they gave up for the season.\n\nHe said that although Lent is most commonly observed within Roman Catholicism, there are different denominations that choose to honor it in their own way even though they may not necessarily call it Lent.\n\nWhat is dopamine fasting and why are people doing it?\n\nRamadan\n\nNo one is ever completely sure when Ramadan begins until sometimes the day before it's supposed to start. Since the Islamic calendar is based on the lunar cycle, the beginning of Ramadan is marked by the sighting of a new moon. People come close to guessing when the holy month will start, but because of geographical differences sometimes the sighting of the new moon can vary.\n\nIbrahim Hooper, the national communications director for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said fasting is mandated for everyone who is able by the Quran for Muslims, but in recent years they've increasingly seen people of other faiths participating in solidarity.\n\nIf you're too young or too old, sick, traveling or pregnant you're exempt from fasting, but it's really up to everyone's individual conscious, Hooper says.\n\nHooper says the purpose of the fast is to \"recharge the spiritual battery\" and to focus on the plight of those who involuntarily go without food or water throughout the year. Ramadan is considered the holiest month of the Islamic calendar, so it's a time of heightened spirituality. People will do extra prayers and devotions and give to charity during this time.\n\nYom Kippur\n\nYom Kippur, also known as the Day of Atonement, is just one of the few fasts that are a part of the Jewish religion, Rabbi Shmuel Herzfeld of Ohev Sholom in Washington, D.C. said. It's considered the holiest day of the year and is observed eight days after Rosh Hashanah.\n\nMore:Lent is here, and fish is on the menu at these fast food joints\n\nThe rabbi said it's a 25 hour fast that's mandated in the Torah for men, women, boys over the age of 13 and girls over the age of 12. The fasts require observers to refrain from all food and drink (even water). Depending on which sect believers follow, bathing and physical contact with the opposite sex can also be prohibited.\n\nHerzfeld said believers typically spend this period of fasting in a synagogue praying . It's a time for repentance and asking God for forgiveness.\n\nWhen the period of fasting is over, people feast and go back to regular eating and drinking.\n\nDaniel Fast\n\nThe Daniel Fast begins with the biblical story of the prophet Daniel and his three friends who were brought to the king of Babylonia's palace. They were to train for three years to be the king's servants.\n\nThe king offered them food, but Daniel did not want to \"defile\" himself with the king's food, so he and his friends committed to eating only vegetables and water.\n\nLavarin says the scripture doesn't mandate the Daniel Fast for Christians, so it's a voluntary journey.\n\nAlthough Daniel and his friends fasted for 10 days during their time with the king, there was another fast that he did for 21 days. Lavarin says there isn't a set amount of time that people tend to participate in the fast but the range is three days to 21 days.\n\nMore:Want to live longer? NIA study links fasting to longevity\n\nLavarin says the Daniel Fast consists of eliminating meat (including fish), dairy, wine and added sugars and eating vegetables and fruits and drinking water. The reverend likens it to being vegan.\n\nHe said that the purpose of fasting is not just to eliminate something from your life, it's a way to replace it and supplement it with prayer. The reverend said fasting is a way for believers to redirect their attention back to God.\n\n\"That’s why today we don’t only have to fast from food, food tends to be the typical view of fasting, but in reality anything that can take up your attention,\" said Lavarin. \"So I know one thing that becomes very common for fasting today becomes social media.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/03/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/dining/2021/11/10/thanksgiving-day-2021-these-jacksonville-area-restaurants-open/6352882001/", "title": "Thanksgiving Day 2021: These Jacksonville-area restaurants are ...", "text": "Staff\n\nThe Florida Times-Union\n\nIf you'd rather take the day off and let someone else do the cooking this Thanksgiving Day, a number of Jacksonville-area restaurants will be open, some offering special Thanksgiving dinners while others offer their full menu.

It's a time when family is central and special holiday meals are prepared; from coconut pudding in Puerto Rico to black cake in Barbados. All of this good cheer eventually spills out into the streets, with colorful parades and fireworks by the ton lighting up the night sky.\n\nTravelers will find it easy to join in the festivities, with the added bonus of celebrating far from frigid temperatures.\n\nBermuda: Christmas Walkabout in St. George's\n\nWhile most Caribbean cities are as modern as can be, St. George's Parish in Bermuda is a UNESCO World Heritage Site with a rich historical heritage. On December 5, history literally shines in St. George's, when historic homes hailing all the way back to the 17th century come ablaze with holiday lights, with some decorated homes open for tours. The city's festivities continue with lanes lit by candlelight and costumed re-enactors and carolers setting a celebratory scene.\n\nSt. Kitts: National Carnival\n\nGiven the popularity of the Carnivals in Brazil and Trinidad, most travelers are conditioned to think of Carnival coinciding with the Spring Lenten season. Not so on St. Kitts, where on December 26, the island kicks into high gear with a riotous week-long Carnival. It's a sensual overload of street parades, masquerades, beauty pageants, calypso contests and costumed stilts walkers, called mocko jumbies. The parade is powered by native sounds of the Caribbean, mainly from steel drums and brass bands. Revelers may visit to let off steam and dance in the streets, but the St. Kitts Carnival also has a historical component, weaving together themes of the island's African heritage with its present-day island customs.\n\nSt. Lucia: Festival of Lights\n\nLight is St. Lucia's namesake. The island is named after the real-life Saint Lucia, whose name came from from the Latin word \"lux,\" for \"light.\" On December 12, the island fittingly celebrates a Festival of Lights in the saint's honor. On the big day the island's capital city, Castries, is bedecked with decorative lanterns and a variety of cultural presentations are staged, with light as their focus. Artisans also enter competitions to create the most beautiful hand-crafted lantern. The day-long shebang is capped off with a huge fireworks display.\n\nJamaica and the Bahamas: Jonkanoo\n\nOnce celebrated throughout the Caribbean, Jonkanoo (or Junkanoo) is now most closely associated with Jamaica and the Bahamas. Celebrated since the 16th century by African slaves in the Caribbean, Jonkanoo is commonly believed to have roots in a West African celebration called John Canoe, honoring a wealthy black merchant. During the colonial period, Caribbean slaves were granted a small slice of freedom at Christmas, to gather with family and attend a grand dance. After slavery was abolished, the freed men and women continued the Jonkanoo tradition, as a way to celebrate their West African heritage.\n\nToday revelers masquerade and dance through the streets on Dec. 26, held in towns across Jamaica and the Bahamas. In Jamaica, the party goes strong in Kingston, with Montego Bay following close behind, while Nassau hosts the Bahamas' biggest and baddest displays. Travelers can expect vibrant street parades, with colorfully-costumed dancers moving to the beat of goatskin drums and fifes.\n\nDominican Republic: Christmas Eve Fireworks\n\nIf you're in the Dominican Republic on Christmas Eve, and happen to like fireworks, you're in luck. Each year on December 24, customers crowd into roadside stands and shops to buy armloads of \"fuegos artificiales,\" or fireworks, all in preparation for the big bang once the sun sets. During the early part of the evening, families feast on traditional fare, which they customarily share with neighbors. In the hours before midnight, Dominicans head out into the streets to light up the sky with booming fireworks. Then it's off to midnight mass.\n\nIf you're in Santo Domingo during Christmas, try to attend the mass at Basilica Catedral Santa Maria de la Encarnacion in the city's Colonial Zone. The cathedral is often referred to as The First Church in the Americas, dating from 1540.\n\nCayman Islands: White Sand Christmas\n\nDuring the holidays, many islands in the Caribbean go for all-out light displays of pyrotechnics and full-on wattage. The Cayman Islands also make light the centerpiece of their festivities, with a unique sandy spin. Families lay out the welcome mat for Santa by covering their yards with white sand in imitation of snow. Just as American suburbanites compete for who has the greenest lawn, Caymanian compete for who has the whitest and least-trammeled yard come Christmas morning. The white sand yards are particularly beautiful on moonlit nights.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/10/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/happyeverafter/2014/07/21/recommended-romance-bartlett-mcclymer-hailstock-pratt-king-gamble/12914641/", "title": "Must-read romances: 'Dangerous Secrets Boxed Set,' 'The Revelers ...", "text": "Michelle Monkou\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY\n\nJoin me every week as I share a few shout-outs on romance author goings-on, related events and recommended reads.\n\nSPOTLIGHT ON …\n\nDangerous Secrets Boxed Set by L.L. Bartlett, Kelly McClymer, Shirley Hailstock, C.B. Pratt\n\n\"Four bestselling novelists — Four full-length novels packed full of juicy secrets!\"\n\nRoom at the Inn by L.L. Bartlett\n\nAbout L.L. Bartlett (courtesy of the author):The immensely popular Booktown Mystery series is what put Lorraine Bartlett's pen name Lorna Barrett on the New York Times bestseller list, but it's her talent — whether writing as Lorna, or L.L. Bartlett, or Lorraine Bartlett — that keeps her there. This multipublished, Agatha-nominated author pens the exciting Jeff Resnick Mysteries as well as the acclaimed Victoria Square Mystery series, and now the Tales of Telenia fantasy saga, and has many short stories and novellas to her name(s).\n\nMichelle: Tell us about Room at the Inn.\n\nL.L.:Room at the Inn is the third book in my Jeff Resnick mystery series. Jeff is out of his element when he and his girlfriend, Maggie, take a working vacation at a quaint Vermont inn. But when Jeff crosses the threshold, his sixth sense warns him someone will meet a violent death. His anxiety intensifies when he travels on one of the local roads and is overwhelmed by feelings of impending doom. With their own lives at stake, Jeff must use all his wits and skill to bring a ruthless killer to justice.\n\nMichelle: What was a fun/interesting fact that you researched for your story?\n\nL.L.: I loved (and still do) Stowe, Vermont, and got to stay at an inn very much like the one described in Room at the Inn (which has since burned to the ground). I wrote the book and went back to the inn several more times … just for research purposes. (NOT!)\n\nMichelle: Who or what inspired you to write?\n\nL.L.: My first \"mystery\" was actually a romantic suspense title written by Barbara Michaels. It had a paranormal thread running through it. I always thought, if I ever write a book, I'd like to have a paranormal aspect as an important part of the story. I've gone on to write not only the Jeff Resnick series, but write cozy mysteries for Berkley Prime Crime (the Victoria Square Mysteries under my Lorraine Bartlett name, and the Booktown Mysteries under the name Lorna Barrett). I also write an adventure fantasy series called the Tales of Telenia and am about to embark on a new cozy mystery series called the Lotus Bay Mysteries.\n\nMichelle: What is your typical writing schedule?\n\nL.L.: I tend to write during the hours of 1 to 5 in the afternoon, but as long as I've got a pad of paper and a pen, I can usually write anywhere. (I sometimes get a lot of work done sitting in my car while I wait for my mother at her appointments.)\n\nMichelle: Thanks, L.L. Readers, you can stay in touch with L.L. through www.LLBartlett.com, Facebook and Twitter (@llbartlettbooks).\n\nThe Fairy Tale Bride by Kelly McClymer\n\nAbout Kelly McClymer (courtesy of the author):Kelly fell in love with Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty and Snow White as a child. Her most prized possession is her copy of The Complete Tales of the Brothers Grimm. These are the stories which gripped our ancestors as they huddled around the fire at night, which taught countless children to persevere through hardship and succeed against the odds. Her favorite fairy tale remains The Six Swans — where a young sister must not speak a word for six years in order to save her brothers from their stepmother's evil spell.\n\nMichelle: Tell us about The Fairy Tale Bride.\n\nKelly: My contribution to the Dangerous Secrets anthology is The Fairy Tale Bride, a Victorian historical romance that brings together an independent young woman with a penchant for getting herself into trouble with a very proper duke hiding an explosive secret. Miranda is still one of my favorite heroines, as she is devoted to family — her sisters and brother at first, and then her new family when she finds herself unexpectedly married to the duke of Kerstone. Simon, the duke, was fun to write, as is he such a stickler ... until he marries Miranda and she teaches him the power of unconventional thinking.\n\nMichelle: Please finish this sentence: Writing stories is like ...\n\nKelly: … swimming in the ocean (I was born in Charleston, S.C., and spent my childhood weekends on the beach at Sullivan's Island, where my great-aunt had a teensy-tiny little house). I am lured by the sound of the waves, and the call of the warm salt water and ever deepening depth until I'm over my head and letting the waves carry me where they will.\n\nMichelle: What excites you about the Young Adult world for your writing?\n\nKelly: In addition to writing historical romance, I write momlit, chicklit, and Young Adult novels (like Miranda from The Fairy Tale Bride, I refuse to be put into a one-size-fits-all box). There's something wonderful in writing young characters, who are experiencing things for the first time, and testing themselves against all the challenges that adulthood and independence brings. I think all readers can relate to those moments, that ultimately define us, like how we handle first love and betrayal, first job and responsibility, the decision to do what needs to be done to become what we dream of being.\n\nMichelle: If you didn't become a writer, in your creative imaginative world, what would be your dream job?\n\nKelly: That's easy, because in my creative imaginative world I am not hampered by a difficulty with the language of math. I would go into the sciences and become a neuroscientist. The brain — and, as we're learning now, the entire nervous system — is an unexplored land waiting to be discovered and mapped.\n\nMichelle: Thanks, Kelly. Readers, you can stay in touch with Kelly through kellymcclymer.com, Facebook and Twitter (@kellymcclymer).\n\nMore Than Gold by Shirley Hailstock\n\nAbout Shirley Hailstock (courtesy of the author):Shirley is the best-selling, award-winning author of over 30 books. She writes women's fiction, romance and paranormal. Her books have garnered many awards, including the HOLT Medallion and Romantic Times' Career Achievement Award. Shirley lived in Washington, D.C., and Buffalo, New York. She has visited many capitals of the world and has set her stories in these places. Shirley is a past president of Romance Writers of America and a former officer of Women Writers of Color. She lives in New Jersey with her family.\n\nMichelle: Tell us about More Than Gold.\n\nShirley: My novel in the Dangerous Secrets Boxed Set is titled More Than Gold. It's a romantic suspense with political overtones. Morgan Kirkwood was only 19 when her performance at the Olympics made her name a household word. Twelve years later a new political faction is vying for dominance in the small republic. At the same time, the U.S. is electing a new president. Morgan is the linchpin in both elections and the shocking secret she holds could affect the outcome of both.\n\nJack Temple's been in the CIA long enough. He's resigning, but discovering Morgan Kirkwood is in trouble, he rushes to her rescue. Jack traveled as a swim team coach to Seoul at the same time Morgan was a gymnastics competitor. While his real position was to back her up in the political operation she'd agreed to perform, he found himself falling for the young gymnast. Being in the CIA offers him no opportunity for entanglements and she was definitely a complication. Now that someone wants more from her than an interview, Jack is back on trail and the torch he's carrying could light more than a fire at the upcoming games.\n\nMichelle: What part of the research or writing was the most difficult/intriguing?\n\nShirley: The most difficult is keeping the balance between the romance and the intrigue. Readers want to fall in love with the characters and they want to go on the adventure with them. In a romantic suspense, there is a careful balance between the two. Neither should overshadow the other. But neither should be shortchanged for the other either.\n\nThe most intriguing is getting to know the characters. It's their story, but they don't reveal themselves all at once. While as a writer, I might know who I believe they are, they tend to bring in aspects of their personality that were unknown to me at the beginning of the book.\n\nAs to research, it's very intriguing to learn new details about a subject. Getting just enough of those details into the story without boring the reader is the difficult part.\n\nMichelle: You often write with a suspense thread. What is your brand?\n\nShirley: I love strong women equally paired with a strong man. I like to find subjects that take the reader on an adventure that is unlike what I've read before. I look for stories that intrigue me. If it's something I'd like to read about, maybe they will too. In More Than Gold, the Olympics games were on my mind and I thought what if there was something else going on in the underbelly of the games. This was the beginning of the idea for Morgan and Jack's story.\n\nMichelle: What are a couple fun facts about yourself that you'd like to share?\n\nShirley: As an adult, I took gymnastics for six years. My goal was to be able to do giants (to swing 360 degrees around the parallel bar). I never was able to do it, but I spent a lot of time on the balance beam. Naturally, this became my character, Morgan's, place to shine.\n\nI also used to work in a bridal shop. I was in negotiations to buy the shop, but the deal fell through. Good thing because I became an author instead. But the work gave me fodder for romantic relationships and for the wedding stories I write.\n\nMichelle: Thanks, Shirley. Readers, you can stay in touch with Shirley through shirleyhailstock.net.\n\nEno the Thracian by C.B. Pratt\n\nAbout C.B. Pratt (courtesy of the author):C.B. lives in Mickeyland, Florida, keeping a nearly sleepless watch on the Empire, often infiltrating in the guise of simple tourist. All the Hero-for-Hire books are dedicated, at heart, to the programmers of late-night movies in Upstate NY, when a slapstick 1930s comedy might follow a sword-and-sandal picture illuminated by the work of the brilliant Ray Harryhausen.\n\nAfter a long career in various mad enterprises, including fiction, returning to writing is like coming safely into port at last.\n\nMichelle: Tell us about Eno the Thracian.\n\nC.B.: Eno the Thracian handles other people's problems for a fee in a world where \"problems\" can include talking snakes, minotaurs and angry gods. In the first book, Eno is hired to remove a harpy from an island, only to find he's immersed in a plot to cover the earth with an undead army, a plot with roots in the birth of the gods themselves.\n\nMichelle: What got you excited about writing ancient heroes?\n\nC.B.: You mean besides them running around in only a kilt? In those days, there was a great emphasis on a healthy body and strength both of body and of character. I like that Eno can't rely on any weapon but a sword and his own innate power. He's also a guy who can make you laugh even in the midst of a life-or-death battle.\n\nMichelle: Your favorite movies in the same vein are?\n\nC.B.: I've liked everything from Neptune's Daughter (1949) to Troy to Clash of the Titans (all three versions) and the BBC America series Atlantis. I'm looking forward to Hercules with Dwayne Johnson. I'm not a stickler for historical accuracy in movies as long as the fight scenes are good and they don't take too many liberties.\n\nMichelle: Have you visited any of the ancient sites in Greece or Italy? If not, would any be on your bucket list?\n\nC.B.: In 2011, I went on a long trip around the region and was amazed to learn how much is still there despite the centuries of changes and upheavals. One of my more exciting stops was at the archaeological dig currently happening in Metropolis, now in Turkey. There's nothing as exciting for a writer as standing on 2,500-year-old pavement and feeling the history all around you, some unseen for hundreds of years. I'd love to go back!\n\nMichelle: Thanks, C.B. Readers, you can stay in touch with C.B. through www.cynthiapratt.com, Facebook and Twitter (@CBPratt).\n\nSPOTLIGHT ON …\n\nThe Revelers series by Marcia King-Gamble\n\nAbout Marcia King-Gamble (courtesy of the author):Marcia hails from a sunny Caribbean island where the sky and ocean are the same mesmerizing shade of blue. She is a former travel industry executive and a self-proclaimed globetrotter. Marcia is particularly fond of Hong Kong, Venice, and New Zealand, not only for the scenery, but because of the mouthwatering food. A national best-selling author, Marcia has penned 24 books and two novellas. Her free time is spent at the gym, traveling, and with her animal family.\n\nMichelle: Tell us about the Revelers series and the titles.\n\nMarcia: The Revelers series is a collaboration by two \"island girls.\" My interviewer and I both grew up in the Caribbean. We had fond memories of Carnivals' past and came up with the idea of writing novellas set in countries where Mardi Gras/Carnival was the norm. The first in the series was titled Seducing Circe and set in New Orleans. The second, Carnival Temptress, penned by you (Michelle), takes place in Trinidad. The third (to be released in the next two weeks) is titled Tempting Andie and introduces the reader to Junkanoo in the Bahamas.\n\nMichelle: What makes Carnival special to the particular country and the world?\n\nMarcia: You don't have to be a Christian to celebrate. It's a time of festivities and much looked forward to by many around the world. For some, it is the last hurrah before Lent when abstinence is the norm. Carnival is typically a sign of spring and hope. It's viewed as a time to toss aside inhibitions.\n\nMichelle: Have you ever attended or participated in Carnival?\n\nMarcia: I've been \"playing\" Carnival since I was a child. At age 4 I was dressed up as Popette, the clown, and entered into the children's competition on my island. Since then I have been Cleopatra, a butterfly, a mermaid and an assortment of inanimate objects. Carnival is an annual event. When not participating, attending was mandatory and not to be missed.\n\nMichelle: What were some of the research highlights/facts that you learned about Carnival?\n\nMarcia: I discovered that Carnival dates back thousands of years to the time of pagan spring and fertility rites. When I wrote Seducing Circe, set in New Orleans, I learned that a French explorer named Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville first brought the term to the United States. In Pierre's native country, France, March 3 was a holiday, so he named the spot he was camped on (50 miles outside of New Orleans) Point du Mardi Gras.\n\nJunkanoo, in the Bahamas, the setting of Tempting Andie, is typically celebrated on Boxing Day (Dec. 26) and New Year's Day and has roots from the 16th and 17th centuries. This was the time when slaves were allowed off the plantation to spend time with their families. They celebrated with African dance, music and costume.\n\nMichelle: What other works are on the horizon for you?\n\nMarcia: Recently, I got the rights back to Change of Heart, one of my more popular novels. I'll be reissuing it with a different title and it will be available as an e-book on Amazon, Barnes & Noble and Apple. I am also waiting to hear back from a publisher about a recent submission and will let you know as soon as I do. Please be sure to join me for Spicy Sundays on Facebook when there is a lively discussion on relationships. The fun continues on www.digitalromanceinc.com where I write a monthly column.\n\nYou may reach me on my website or on Facebook and Twitter (@Soflamuse).\n\nMichelle: Thanks, Marcia. Good luck with your submission.\n\nMichelle Monkou celebrates her digital release in Evernight Publishing's Executive Assistant anthology, writing as Michelle Rhys. Her website is michellemonkou.com.

Check out our suggestions and get a big bang for your buck at a Caribbean all-inclusive resort.\n\nBarbados\n\nOn Maxwell Beach, Sandals Royal Barbados is the new side-by-side sibling to Sandals Barbados. With a combined 17 restaurants and a \"Stay at One, Play at Two\" option, the all-suite adults-only Sandals Royal is the smaller of the pair with 222 suites (the larger has 280 suites) and upscale signatures like 24-hour room service, six restaurants and four bars, glass-bottom boat rides, boogie boarding, snorkeling and 17 Rondoval cottages popular with honeymooners. Thirty-one pools include the ones in the suites and the ocean-view rooftop which is the largest glass-fronted infinity pool in the Eastern Caribbean and the only one at a Sandals Resort. More firsts for the Sandals chain include a four-lane bowling alley with a wraparound beer bar built in a strip of ice, a barbershop convenient for grooms needing a new 'do before their wedding and a Chinese-Japanese fusion menu at Chi Asian. High-end perks in the high-end suites include butlers and Rolls Royce transfers from Grantley Adams International Airport, just 15 minutes from the resorts. Other fun freebies are reggae dance classes on the pool deck, mixology classes at the Infinity pool bar, soccer games on the beach, and nature walks. For those planning holidays in July and August, Crop Over is the biggest festival of the year with island-wide parades, soca contests and good eats on the beach.\n\nCuracao\n\nOn one of just a handful of islands below the hurricane belt, which from June 1 to Nov. 30 is a weather wildcard, you won’t pay extra to keep the family entertained at the 342-room Curaçao Sunscape Resort Spa & Casino. For kids aged 3 to 12, Explorers Club is full of no-extra-cost fun like sandcastle building competitions and a campout adventure. For finicky tweens and teens up to 17 years, Core Zone stays open until 11 p.m. with pool tables, bocce ball, karaoke and archery. The largest beach all-inclusive on the Dutch island, the resort is ideal for young swimmers and snorkelers courtesy of the wave breakers in the Caribbean Sea. There’s beach volleyball, movies on the sand, rock wall climbing, sumo wrestling, four pools and two tennis courts lit for night play. Theme nights are creative like Curacao Day every Monday, when families learn about local traditions, and on Friday when the staff show off their artsy side during Talent Night. A quartet of restaurants includes Oceana for the catch of the day and pasta and pesto at Da Mario. The Manatee swim-up bar is one of six with last call at 11 p.m. A complimentary shuttle makes the 2-mile trip to the pretty capital city of Willemstad for exploring. Back at the resort, Princess Casino stays open until 3 a.m. with a $20,000 Kadushi jackpot.\n\nAruba\n\nAlso located below the Atlantic hurricane belt, it’s a twofer at the side-by-side Divi Aruba and Tamarijn Aruba on the less-traveled mile-long Druif Beach. A short 10 minutes from the capital city of Oranjestad and 30 minutes from Queen Beatrix International Airport, the resorts offer stays at one and play, eat and chill at both. At the pair of AAA Three-Diamonds, 261 rooms and four oceanfront suites are in low-rise buildings across the street from The Links at Divi Aruba Golf Course. Available to guests at both resorts are four freshwater pools, 10 restaurants including Lime, the first Mexican restaurant on the island, and eight bars like the Bunker set out over the water. Also on the comp list is Divi Winds Sports Center with a 30-foot rock climbing wall, snorkeling, windsurfing, catamarans and kayaks. For the less adventurous, there’s water aerobics, Zumba fitness classes and coupons for play at the Alhambra Casino, next door to the resort. Skip the clubs on the pricier Eagle Beach and opt instead for in-house entertainment like free reggae concerts, Cuban dance performances, steel pan bands and fireworks that light up the sister resorts.\n\nJamaica\n\nOne of the newest resorts on the northwest coast, Jewel Grande Montego Bay, now with a AAA Four Diamond rating, offers a boatload of perks like airport transfers, kayaks built for two, stand-up paddleboards, snorkeling equipment and aqua-trikes. Bars are poolside, coffee bars open early, crafty cocktails are poured at the Lobby Bar and Morgan’s Bar and 12 restaurants keep hunger at bay day and night. Big on pampering, the all-inclusive offers butler service in the 217 suites laid out nicely in three beachfront towers, concierge service by the pool and beach and plenty of chill-outs in the Grande Spa with the only sand massage table in Jamaica and the Caribbean’s only Himalayan Salt Therapy Lounge. Stay for a smoothie made with ginger and apples and a funky exercise class called reggae-lates that marries a reggae beat with pilates. Kids Club freebies include sandcastle building and treasure hunts, and for teens, there are basketball hoops and ping pong tables.\n\nThe Bahamas\n\nOn Bahamas Harbour Drive in Paradise Island, Warwick Paradise Island is adults-only with a laundry list of extras for singles, couples and gaggles of pals. On 12 floors with 250 rooms, some with views of Nassau Harbour, the resort is a 30-minute drive from Lynden Pindling International Airport. With five restaurants like Abbiocco for Italian and Tings on a Stick for Asian, two bars, pool, chess played on gigantic outdoor boards and Panama Jack beach bikes to explore the island, an all-inclusive stay includes gratis picnics on Cabbage Beach and nature walks that stop at freshwater ponds to feed the turtles. For those trying their hand at fishing, rods, bait, sinkers and hooks are complimentary with cash prizes for the biggest catch and a $50 charge to have the chef prepare it for dinner. At night, Rum Cay Lobby Bar and The Junkanoo Beat heat up with local singers and dancers.\n\nTurks and Caicos Islands\n\nOn a 12-mile stretch of Grace Bay Beach in Providenciales, Beaches Turks & Caicos is the island’s largest resort for families, with 758 rooms and suites spread out over 75 acres. The stats are staggering with 24 restaurants, 15 bars, 10 pools and a 45,000-square-foot water park. Also without additional costs, there’s scuba diving, kayaks, windsurfing, snorkeling and paddleboarding. On land, free stuff includes playing in the Xbox Lounge, tennis clinics and yoga classes. For kids, tweens and teens, there’s a roster of activities on Pirate’s Island and for families with newborns, nannies are on hand at Camp Sesame. Food choices are over-the-top from the retro diner Bobby Dee’s, seafood at Schooners, British pub grub and the late-night chocolate buffet to a food truck called Curls & Swirls that makes the rounds scooping ice cream cones and another roaming truck named Mr. Mac that ladles mac and cheese. Courtesy of a partnership with \"Sesame Street,\" Cookie Monster, Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch are happy to pose for photos and Sesame Street parades every Tuesday delight the entire brood.\n\nAntigua\n\nOn the southern coast at the convergence of the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, Curtain Bluff is a 72-room grand dame that appeals to families and couples from the U.S. and British rock royalty like Sir Paul McCartney and Eric Clapton. On 20 acres, add-ons reach far beyond unlimited food and drink to include snorkeling trips to Cades Reef, kayaking, windsurfing and Cee Bee Kids Camp where kids up to 12 years old go beachcombing for shells and lizards and cheer on Ezra the gardener as he climbs a palm tree to gather up the ripe coconuts. Also without additional charges, there’s yoga classes on the deck, rides on the Super Mabel raft, aerobics in the pool and tours of the ginormous wine cellar led by the sommelier. A trio of restaurants and a six-pack of bars offer enough variety to please even the pickiest of palates. A host of calorie-burners include tennis, squash and swimming in the two-lane lap pool. On Surf and Bay beaches, you’ll find day beds, hammocks and concierges delivering ice lollies. For big families, adjoining suites can be linked together for more space and for bigger groups, an entire floor with four bedrooms can be booked as one. Room service is gratis, and the banana bread is so good the resort will pack a loaf for the trip home.\n\nGrenada\n\nLow-rise and high-luxe, 64-suite Spice Island Beach Resort is a no-wristband all-inclusive fronting Grand Anse Beach. While the elegant resort won’t appeal to those who covet the gigantic buffets laid out at other all-inclusives, foodies give a hearty thumbs-up to the eat local menu at Oliver’s, the Friday night Caribbean Buffet and Sea & Surf Terrace and Bar for a Spice Island Classic stirred with the herb called sorrel that complements a bowl of flash-fried green banana chips. Earning Five Diamonds from AAA for the second consecutive year and a member of Small Luxury Hotels of the World, the family-owned resort is the top pick of visiting British royals like Prince Harry, who spent the night at the resort during his 2016 Caribbean holiday. Spread out over 8 acres and dotted with lemon and almond trees, perks you won’t see on your bill are impressive like greens fees at the Grenada Golf Club, bikes as long you stay within 2 miles of the resort, Nutmeg Pod for kids up to 12 years, garden tours and cooking demos.\n\nSt. Lucia\n\nOn the south coast, Coconut Bay Beach Resort is the only family-friendly all-inclusive within minutes of the Hewanorra International Airport. This is a big plus not only because airport transfers are gratis but also because many of the other resorts are in the north which is a long and hilly drive from the airport and not fun for cranky kids. On the mile-long Anse de Sables Beach with views of the Maria Islands Nature Reserve, the 250-room resort is big enough for an adults-only wing called Harmony with a pair of pools, hammocks and sun decks, plus a wing just for families called Splash with CocoLand Kidz Klub, a petting zoo and Coco Pak backpacks loaded with all sorts of fun stuff for kids and cellphones for parents to check in on them. With more choices than the standard-issue all-you-can-eat-and-drink formula, menus vary in nine restaurants from Caribbean Creole to the Jerk Treehouse next to the lazy river. Indoor, outdoor or swim-up, seven bars stock top-shelf bottles like Patron Tequila and beer from the local Antillia Brewing Company. Tasting classes are gratis at the Sugar Cane Rum Bar and rummy cocktails are mixed all day at the beachfront Paradise Bar. Also with no additional charge, there’s water polo, bocce ball, reggae dance classes, kiteboarding, snorkeling, kayaking and paddleboarding. For the devoted, personal trainers are on call and tennis courts and basketball courts are lit for night play.\n\nDominican Republic\n\nIn Punta Cana on the easternmost tip abutting the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, there may be more resorts than palm trees. The most popular tourist town in the country also sports the largest all-inclusive in the country. Along Macao Beach, 1,775-suite Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Punta Cana is a resort on steroids with 13 pools with swim-up bars, nine restaurants from buffets to a Brazilian steakhouse, 24-hour room service, 23 bars and lounges, Kids Club, nightclub, casino and “rock star suites” with retro music memorabilia. For the fitness-minded, there are classes for kids and teens, en-suite yoga videos and play at the adjacent Jack Nicklaus-designed 18-hole par-72 golf course at Hard Rock Golf Club at Cana Bay. Perks for rock-and-rolling families include jam sessions with Fender guitars and the Pop Star Lounge where pop star wannabees learn how to sing like a superstar and design their own album cover. So popular that repeat guests are called Hard Rockers, the longer you stay, the more free stuff you get with resort credits that buy dinners on the beach, Rock Spa Rhythm & Motion treatments, excursions to swim with the dolphins and services in the beauty salon.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/07/30"}]}

All but left for dead after a lethargic first 80 minutes, he scored twice in 90 seconds to force extra time and then, after Messi had scored, converted a penalty to force the shootout.\n\n– Nancy Armour\n\nARGENTINA WINS IN PENALTIES!\n\nKingsley Coman and Aurélien Tchouaméni missed for France, while Argentina converted all four kicks to win the country's third World Cup championship. Gonzalo Montiel scored the winner for Argentina.\n\nWorld Cup final heading to penalty kicks\n\nFor the third time in history, the World Cup final will be decided by penalty kicks. Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbappe each scored in the second period of extra time to send this to penalties, truly one of the matches in World Cup history.\n\nEach team had a big chance in the last minute of extra time.\n\nGOAL FRANCE! Kylian Mbappe penalty makes it 3-3\n\nAfter a handball in the penalty area, France's Kylian Mbappe converted from the penalty spot in the 118th minute, his third goal of the night for the second hat trick in World Cup final history.\n\nGOAL ARGENTINA! Lionel Messi scores on rebound to take 3-2 lead\n\nLionel Messi pounced on a rebound to smash the ball over the line and put Argentina ahead 3-2 in the 108th minute of the World Cup final. It's his second goal of the night and he's back in the lead for Golden Boot.\n\nFrance, Argentina still tied after first period of extra time\n\nNeither team scored in the first 15 minutes of extra time, meaning we're just 15 minutes away from penalty kicks if the scoreline holds. Argentina had two huge chances in the final few minutes but France defender Dayot Upamecano made a game-saving slide tackle to block a shot and Lautaro Martinez was unable to get a shot on frame in a 1-on-1 with keeper Hugo Lloris.\n\nWorld Cup final heading to extra time at 2-2\n\nBoth teams pushed hard for a winner in the final 10 minutes of regulation, but we're heading to extra time in Qatar, with an additional 30 minutes and penalty kicks if necessary to decide the world champion.\n\nFour of the last five World Cup finals have gone to extra time, including Argentina's loss to Germany in 2014.\n\nGOAL FRANCE! Kylian Mbappe ties it up\n\nLess than two minutes after scoring a penalty kick to get France back into the game, Kylian Mbappe hammered home the equalizer. Mbappe is now the tournament's top scorer with seven, pulling his country back after struggling for the first 75 minutes of the game.\n\nWow.\n\nArgentina also blew a 2-0 lead in the quarterfinals against the Netherlands, but went on to win in penalty kicks.\n\nGOAL FRANCE! Kylian Mbappe's penalty makes it 2-1\n\nIt's going to be a breathless final 10 minutes plus stoppage time after Mbappe converted from the spot in the 80th minute.\n\nFrance still can't find a way through\n\nAfter a listless first half, the defending champions still haven't been able to get anything going since the break – while Argentina is taking advantage of the space to create some good chances in the first 20 minutes of the half.\n\nHALFTIME: Argentina leads France 2-0\n\nIt was all Argentina in the first half, heading into the break up 2-0 behind goals from Lionel Messi and Angel Di Maria. They're 45 minutes away from their first World Cup championship since 1986, and the first of Messi's storied career.\n\nMessi is the first player to score in all four rounds of the knockout stage – converting penalty kicks in the quarterfinals, semis and final after a goal from open play in the round of 16.\n\nGOAL! 2-0 Argentina as Angel Di Maria scores\n\nA beautiful counter-attack ends with Angel Di Maria finding the back of the net on a sweeping cross from Alexis Mac Allister. Lionel Messi's clever flick from the midfield released his teammates into space behind the French back line.\n\nYou're not going to see a nicer goal than that in a World Cup final.\n\nGOAL! Lionel Messi penalty makes it 1-0 Argentina\n\nArgentina's Angel Di Maria was fouled in the box by France's Ousmane Dembélé, gifting a penalty kick to Lionel Messi – who converted cooly from the spot as Hugo Lloris went the wrong way.\n\nIt's Messi's sixth goal of the tournament, and he's now in the lead for the Golden Boot.\n\nArgentina applying pressure early\n\nThe Argentines have been on the front foot in the first 20 minutes, getting a couple of decent looks at goal and have been caught offsides twice already.\n\nFrance goalkeeper Hugo Lloris was down for a little bit after taking some contact in the penalty area.\n\nFrance recovered from flu\n\nLes Bleus are back to full strength. Well, as full strength as they get at this tournament.\n\nMidfielder Adrien Rabiot and defender Dayot Upamecano, who missed the semifinal with the flu, were back in the starting lineup for France for Sunday's final against Argentina. Raphael Varane is also in the starting XI, two days after missing practice with \"flu-like symptoms.\"\n\nIbrahima Konate and Kingsley Coman, who missed practice the same day as Varane, are also available to play.\n\nOne player who isn't available is Karim Benzema.\n\nThe reigning Ballon d'Or winner is training again with Real Madrid after recovering from the thigh injury that's kept him out of the World Cup, and there were reports the club had cleared him to join France for the final. But Benzema is listed on the start sheet as \"absent.\"\n\nThe only change to Argentina's lineup is Angel Di Maria is back starting and Leandro Paredes is coming off the bench.\n\nThe 34-year-old Di Maria started Argentina's first four games at the World Cup, but came on as a substitute in the quarterfinal game against the Netherlands. He didn't play in Tuesday's semifinal against Croatia.\n\n– Nancy Armour\n\nWhat Argentina, France must do to win World Cup final\n\nThis wasn't the final many expected when the World Cup began almost a month ago, what with France hollowed by injuries and Argentina losing to Saudi Arabia in its opener. Yet here we are, the defending champions and Lionel Messi and Co. emerging as the class of the tournament as both chase history.\n\nSo what are the keys to victory for each team?\n\nArgentina:\n\nBe ruthless\n\nForget what's at stake\n\nCorral Kylian Mbappe\n\nFrance:\n\nStay present\n\nDon’t overlook Argentina’s youngsters\n\nDon’t mess with what’s working\n\nRead Nancy Armour's full World Cup final preview here\n\nIs Qatar's World Cup a prelude to Olympics in the Middle East?\n\nThere will come a day, not long from now, when Qatari officials will make their case that the success of this World Cup has shown Doha to be a worthy host of a Summer Olympics. Possibly as early as 2036. They will tout the dazzling World Cup stadiums, first-class training facilities and the efficient metro system that whisked fans between games. They will show photos of those smiling fans, celebrating their teams as the skyline glitters in the background.\n\nThey will remind the IOC that a Middle Eastern country has never hosted an Olympics, and point to the unfairness of excluding a region with more than 400 million people. It will be a compelling argument and one sure to tempt IOC president Thomas Bach, the great statesman he fancies himself to be.\n\n– Nancy Armour, USA TODAY Sports\n\n2022 Golden Boot: Messi, Mbappe tied for most World Cup goals\n\nThe World Cup final will decide the winner of the Golden Boot award as the top scorer of the tournament.\n\nArgentina's Lionel Messi and France's Kylian Mbappe have each scored five goals in Qatar, with Messi holding the tiebreaker having three assists to Mbappe's two. Their teammates, Julian Alvarez of Argentina and Olivier Giroud of France are tied for third with four goals each.\n\nPremier League, European clubs brace for fallout from winter World Cup\n\nThe tournament in Qatar has been described by FIFA president Gianni Infantino as the “best World Cup ever.” Europe's biggest soccer clubs, however, might not agree.\n\nStaged in November and December for the first time in its 92-year history, the true impact of a midseason World Cup remains to be seen.\n\n“We are exhausted,\" said Croatia midfielder Mateo Kovacic, who plays for Chelsea in the English Premier League. \"Many of us will be exhausted when we come back to our clubs.”\n\nThe disruption caused by staging the World Cup during the European season has long been a point of contention. Traditionally held in June and July, the tournament dates had to be moved because of Qatar's soaring temperatures at that time of the year.\n\n– Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/12/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/22/football/saudi-arabia-argentina-world-cup-upsets-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Saudi Arabia's victory over Argentina is the greatest upset in World ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nArgentina has won the World Cup twice – in 1978 and 1986 – but at Qatar 2022 La Albiceleste wrote its name into the history books in an altogether different way.\n\nAccording to sports data group Gracenote, Argentina’s 2-1 defeat by Saudi Arabia in their Group C match is the biggest upset in World Cup history.\n\nLed by Lionel Messi, ranked third in the world, unbeaten for three years and among the favorites to win the 2022 tournament, many had expected Argentina to sweep aside Saudi Arabia with 48 places separating the two teams in the world rankings.\n\nAll the pre-match talk focused on Messi, one of the world’s greatest ever players who is likely playing his last World Cup.\n\nThe Argentina captain scored an early penalty to put his side in the lead, but two second-half goals from Saleh Al-Shehri and Salem Al Dawsari turned the game on its head.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback See hilarious moment a Saudi soccer fan tears a door from frame during surprise upset 00:45 - Source: CNN\n\nAl Dawsari’s incredible winner from distance – and subsequent acrobatic celebration – will become one of the moments of this – or any – World Cup, and undoubtedly, in time, an “I-was-there” moment for fans.\n\nAccording to Gracenote, the previous most surprising World Cup win was USA’s victory against England in 1950, in which the American team had a 9.5% chance of victory.\n\nBut Saudi Arabia’s chance of victory on Tuesday was estimated at 8.7%, which means the Green Falcons take over the number one spot.\n\nGracenote said it uses the company’s “proprietary football ranking system to identify the most shocking upsets over the course of the World Cup’s storied 92 years.”\n\nBut what have been some of the World Cup’s other big upsets?\n\nItaly 1990: Cameroon 1-0 Argentina\n\nCameroon's victory at Italia 90 changed the world's perception of African football. David Cannon/Getty Images\n\nDiego Maradona had taken the world by storm at the 1986 World Cup, delivering a succession of spectacular individual performances as Argentina claimed its secondd title.\n\nFour years later, the tournament was hosted by Italy and Maradona came into the World Cup having led Italian club Napoli to an iconic Serie A title.\n\nArgentina’s opponent in Italia 90’s opening match was a Cameroon team that had been knocked out of that year’s Africa Cup of Nations in the group stages and had recently recalled a then-38-year-old Roger Milla, who hadn’t played for the Indomitable Lions for three years.\n\nCameroon didn’t let Maradona play, practically fouling him every time the Argentine magician touched the ball – so much so that the African team ended the game with nine players.\n\nHowever, a second-half header from Francois Omam-Biyik was enough to earn Cameroon a famous victory.\n\nSouth Korea and Japan 2002: Senegal 1-0 France\n\nEl Hadji Diouf was African player of the year in 2001 and 2002. Eric Renard/Icon Sport/Getty Images\n\nFrance won the World Cup on home soil in 1998, beating Brazil 3-0 in the final, then won Euro 2000 two years later and was a strong favorite to retain its world title in South Korea and Japan.\n\nFrance’s first game was against a Senegal team making its debut at the World Cup.\n\nThe former French colony was clearly up for the match. With iconic players such as El Hadji Diouf, Khalilou Fadiga and current Teranga Lions head coach Aliou Cisse, Senegal went for the throat of its much-fancied opponent.\n\nDiouf produced a spectacular performance, but it was the unheralded Papa Bouba Diop who scrambled home the only goal of the game to secure a stunning victory for Senegal.\n\nThings went from bad to worse for France as the defending champion failed to reach the knockout stages, finishing bottom of its group.\n\nSpain 1982: Algeria 2-1 West Germany\n\nLike Saudi Arabia's team in Qatar, Algeria's team in 1982 consisted almost entirely of home-based players. Gerard Bedeau/Onze/Icon Sport/Getty Images\n\nAnother African nation making its debut, Algeria, took on West Germany in a group that would change the World Cup forever.\n\nWest Germany came into the game as one of the tournament favorites having won every single qualifying match. The team was so confident that manager Jupp Derwall said he would “jump on the first train back to Munich” in the event of a defeat.\n\nThat arrogance came back to haunt Derwall as a completely unknown Algeria team outplayed West Germany.\n\nThe North Africans took the lead in the 54th minute through Rabah Madjer, before Karl-Heinz Rummenigge leveled 13 minutes later. But straight from the kickoff, Algeria went up the other end of the pitch to retake the lead.\n\nDespite the famous victory, Algeria would not make it out of the group, in part because West Germany secured a 1-0 win against Austria – a result that put both European sides through to the next round at the expense of Algeria.\n\nEver since the “Disgrace of Gijón,” the final group matches at the World Cup have been played simultaneously.\n\nBrazil 1950: USA 1-0 England\n\nThe 1950 US team reached the semifinals, the country's highest ever finish at the tournament. Keystone/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nAhead of the 1950 World Cup in Brazil, football had been fully professional in England for decades, though this was the English team’s first appearance at a World Cup having chosen not to appear in the previous three tournaments.\n\nEngland was up against a US team comprising semi-professional and amateur players including a grave digger, a dish washer and a postman.\n\nBut those amateurs pulled off the first great World Cup upset as Joe Gaetjens’ glancing header near the end of the first half was enough to secure a remarkable win for the US.", "authors": ["Alasdair Howorth"], "publish_date": "2022/11/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/07/football/morocco-spain-quarter-finals-world-cup-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Why Morocco's World Cup success is no fluke | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nAfter three hours of constant noise, the Education City Stadium was brought to library-like silence as Achraf Hakimi stood over the penalty spot.\n\nHakimi was born in Madrid and the the weight of Africa and the Arab world on his shoulders, but you would never have guessed as the Paris Saint-Germain coolly clipped the ball into the net and set off wild celebrations not just in the stadium, but also in Morocco and for the Moroccan diaspora.\n\nThis was a historic day for Morocco, for Africa, for Arabs and for Muslims. The Atlas Lions had roared to stun 2010 World Cup winner Spain and reach the quarterfinals of Qatar 2022. The significance of the occasion was not lost on head coach Walid Regragui.\n\n“Before it was just the Moroccans who supported us,” he said ahead of the game against Spain. “Now it is the Africans and Arabs.”\n\nFor many, it was the shock of the tournament, as the North Africans won their first ever knockout game at a World Cup.\n\nOn Saturday, Morocco went one better, beating Portugal 1-0 in the quarterfinals to become the first African team to reach a World Cup semifinal.\n\nYoussef En-Nesyri netted the only goal of the match ijust before half time with a spectacular header to score the first ever knockout stage goal in the nation’s history.\n\nBut how did Morocco get to the final four of the most prestigious competition in world football?\n\nReturn of Morocco’s chosen son\n\nMany eyebrows were raised when the Moroccan Federation made the decision to sack Vahid Halilhodžić in August, just over three months ahead of the World Cup after the Bosnian coach had guided the team through qualifying to Qatar 2022.\n\nBut for those in Morocco, it was instead the heir to the Moroccan coaching throne simply taking his place at the perfect time.\n\nAffectionately nicknamed “Rass l’Avocat” (Avocado Head) because of his bald head, Regragui was a hard-tackling defender who, despite being born in France, chose to represent the nation of his family, notching up 45 caps.\n\nRegragui was part of the first group of coaches to earn CAF Pro coaching license which was offered for the first time this year. Youssef Loulidi/Fantasista/Getty Images\n\nSince becoming a coach, Regragui has enjoyed success everywhere he has been, leading a mid-table Moroccan club FUS Rabat to their only ever league title.\n\nHe had a brief stint in Qatar where he won the league with Al Duhail SC, before moving back to Morocco where he led Wydad Cassablanca to a league and Champions League double earlier this year.\n\nIt was a matter of when, not if he would take charge of the national team. Many Moroccans thought that it could be after the World Cup or in a few years, but none were unhappy when it was announced he would take over the national side less than 100 days before their first game at the World Cup.\n\nIn African football, Regragui has often been compared with José Mourinho thanks to his tactical discipline and stellar man-management skills. Both of those have been present in the World Cup.\n\nMorocco has played more than 400 minutes of football at the tournament and negotiated a penalty shootout, and yet the Atlas Lions have conceded just once – and that was an unfortunate own goal against Canada in the team’s final Goup F match.\n\nAfter the dramatic shootout win against Spain, video circulated on social media of Regragui running to the stands and hugging and kissing his mother who was in the crowd.\n\nRegragui is a French-born Moroccan. He has assembled the most nationally diverse team at the World Cup – 14 of the 26 players were born outside of Morocco from six different countries – and has seamlessly integrated this group players from around the world into one coherent unit.\n\nWorld Cup tournaments can be tough emotionally to navigate – players are away from home for weeks – but Regragui has counteracted that by allowing the players’ families to stay with the team in camp in Qatar.\n\nAs with that of emotional video of Regragui embracing his mother, one of the most heartwarming photos of the World Cup was Hakimi kissing his mother after Morocco’s victory against Spain.\n\nHakimi scored the winning penalty as Spain missed all three of their penalties. Youssef Loulidi/Fantasista/Getty Images\n\nIt’s not only the players who have had their families with them. Regragui himself was filmed going to the stands to visit his mother Fatima who told Morocco broadcaster Arriyadia how much it meant to her.\n\n“During his whole career as a player and as a coach, I never traveled to watch him,” Fatima said. “I’ve been living in France for more than 50 years now and this is the first competition that I left Paris for.”\n\nA Federation taking football seriously\n\nThe Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FMRF) should also be credited with the Atlas Lions’ success at Qatar 2022.\n\nAfter decades of footballing mediocrity, the FMRF – with the backing of King Mohammed VI – decided to overhaul the nation’s football structure.\n\nIn 2009 the FMRF opened its national football academy, the Mohamed VI Football Academy – which helped develop current international players like Nayef Aguerd and Youssef En-Nesryi – as well as trying to unearth talent in the Moroccan diaspora by employing scouts from across Europe to flag any eligible youth players in Europe.\n\nThe federation also began investing in women’s football, developing football in schools and clubs as well as a creating a national league structure. Funded by the FMRF, Morocco is currently the only nation in the world to have two tiers of women’s football that are both fully professional.\n\nThe crown jewel of Morocco’s football investment is the Mohamed VI Football Complex just outside Rabat.\n\nThe training complex contains four five-star hotels, eight FIFA standard pitches – one of which is indoor in a climate-controled building – as well a medical facility that includes a dentist.\n\nThat investment over the last decade has begun to pay off.\n\nFor the first time in history, Moroccan clubs are the holders of the men’s and women’s African Champions League titles as well the men’s Confederations Cup – Africa’s Europa League.\n\nMorocco is also the African Nations Championship champion – a continental tournament where nations put out teams exclusively featuring players who play domestically – while the women’s team came second in the Women’s Africa Cup of Nations earlier this year and qualified for its first World Cup.\n\nMorocco’s success at the World Cup may be best story of the tournament so far, but it is not the not the result of luck and grit, but rather expertise and planning.", "authors": ["Alasdair Howorth"], "publish_date": "2022/12/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/17/football/qatar-legacy-world-cup-2022-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "How has holding a World Cup changed the way the world sees Qatar?", "text": "CNN —\n\nQatar has been at the center of the world over the last few weeks – and it’s been quite a ride.\n\nFor Qataris, as well as putting on a well-organized tournament, the World Cup was an opportunity to expose the world to their culture, displaying everything from their architecture to their hospitality.\n\nBut being in the spotlight also brings scrutiny and much of the coverage, particularly in the western world, has centered around the Qatari government’s human rights record, from the deaths and conditions endured by migrant workers to LGBTQ and women’s rights.\n\nWhy did Qatar want to host the World Cup?\n\nQatar is a tiny country – smaller than Connecticut – but, despite its size, it has been asserting itself as a global player politically and economically in recent years.\n\nThe Gulf state is one of the world’s largest exporters of liquid natural gas and has carved out a role as an international mediator of conflicts, working to ensure evacuations from Afghanistan in August 2021 and hosting indirect talks between US and Iranian officials in Doha. It also launched the media network Al Jazeera.\n\n“I think Qatar doesn’t want to just be a major power as relates to energy… I think they’re trying to set themselves apart in terms of the support that they can offer to help with kind of international conflict resolution efforts,” Anna Jacobs – Senior Gulf Analyst at the International Crisis Group (ICG) – tells CNN Sport.\n\nHosting a World Cup plays an important part of this diversification.\n\nFans enjoy the pre-match atmosphere prior to the World Cup's first game. Hector Vivas/FIFA/Getty Images\n\n“I think sport plays [more of a role] as a political tool for Qatar, for its foreign relations, than in any other country in the world,” Danyel Reiche, a visiting Georgetown University associate professor in Qatar who is leading a research initiative on the 2022 World Cup, told CNN Sport.\n\nThe whole world is now exposed to Qatar, according to Haya Al Thani, 32, who works for “Teach for Qatar” – a local organization that works to solve problems students may face in school.\n\n“Growing up, I was so aware of explaining where Qatar was. Because when we used to travel, and people ask where you’re from they always asked: ‘Oh, where is that?’ And now that’s become easier,” Al Thani told CNN Sport, speaking at the Virginia Commonwealth University School of the Arts in Qatar.\n\n‘It’s been so heartbreaking’\n\nBut hosting the World Cup has brought Qatar’s human rights record, as well as the country itself, to the attention of a wider audience.\n\n“I don’t think Qatar had a reputation as a human rights champion in the first place … but its record was not under so much scrutiny either,” Dr HA Hellyer, Middle East analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and Cambridge University, tells CNN Sport.\n\nIt is difficult to verify how many migrant workers have died as a result of work done on projects connected to the tournament.\n\nThe Guardian reported last year that 6,500 South Asian migrant workers have died in Qatar since the country was awarded the World Cup in 2010, most of whom were involved in low-wage, dangerous labor, often undertaken in extreme heat.\n\nThe report did not connect all 6,500 deaths with World Cup infrastructure projects and has not been independently verified by CNN.\n\nIn an interview with Piers Morgan, which aired on TalkTV in November, Hassan Al-Thawadi, Secretary General of the Qatar’s Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC), an organization charged with organizing the World Cup, said that between 400 and 500 migrant workers have died as a result of work done on projects connected to the tournament – a greater figure than Qatari officials have cited previously.\n\nAl-Thawadi said in the same interview that three migrant workers had died in incidents directly connected with construction of World Cup stadiums, and 37 deaths were attributed to other reasons.\n\nHuman rights groups have highlighted the conditions endured by migrant workers. Anthony Dibon/Icon Sport/Getty Images\n\nRothna Begum, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch, tells CNN Sport that her reports documenting human rights abuses in the country were sparked by Qatari LGBTQ people and women coming to her organization.\n\n“It’s because Qatari society, which is otherwise a fairly closed society, was sort of seeing the World Cup as an opportunity in some ways to actually raise the alarm and in the hope that the scrutiny might allow for some changes in their own country,” she says.\n\nSex between men is illegal in Qatar and punishable by up to three years in prison. A report from Human Rights Watch, published last month, documented cases as recently as September of Qatari security forces arbitrarily arresting LGBTQ people and subjecting them to “ill-treatment in detention.”\n\nQatar’s Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) told CNN last month, before the tournament began, that the 2022 World Cup “will be an inclusive, safe tournament” and said, “everyone is welcome, regardless of race, background, religion, gender, orientation or nationality.”\n\nBut these reassurances did little to change the minds of some of members of the LGBTQ community.\n\n“We’d be campaigning against any country on these issues. It’s not Qatar specific,” Rishi Madlani, co-chair of Pride in Football – a network of LGBTQ+ fan groups in the UK, tells CNN Sport.\n\n“As we got closer to the tournament, you could see people getting really conflicted. It’s been so heartbreaking … in any other situation, if the country was LGBT friendly, I’d be out there [but] I don’t feel comfortable going.”\n\nMadlani recalls hearing Qatar FIFA World Cup ambassador and former footballer Khalid Salman saying that homosexuality is “damage in the mind,” as a turning point for his decision not to go to the World Cup and his feelings towards the tournament.\n\n“At that stage I was still debating buying tickets, this is the madness of a football fan. To hear him talk about it being an illness in the head, the mask slipped. We knew what they really think about us.”\n\nThe captains of seven European nations had planned to wear the OneLove armband to promote inclusion and display solidarity with people of different genders and sexual identites. Vincent Kalut/Photonews/Getty Images\n\nNormally, any interest in human rights issues wanes once the tournament begins, Begum recalls from her organization’s experience reporting on human rights abuses in Russia before the 2018 World Cup and China before the 2022 Winter Olympics, but not at Qatar 2022.\n\n“Before the opening match, they could have taken that moment to provide remedy, to say that they would compensate migrant workers, but they didn’t, which meant that the campaign that all these key organizations were a part of was still going to continue during the World Cup,” says Begum.\n\nHuman rights groups have called on FIFA and Qatar to establish a program that includes easily accessible financial compensation to migrant workers and their families.\n\nOn the eve of the World Cup, FIFA announced a Legacy Fund to “benefit people most in need” but this has no provision for worker compensation, human rights groups point out.\n\nThe Qatar Labor Ministry has a Workers Support and Insurance Fund which began operating in 2020.\n\nWhile the human rights coalition contends that “the fund is not currently set up to be able to provide compensation on any meaningful scale,” the International Labor Organization (ILO) says that it has disbursed over $350 million to workers.\n\nHowever, the human rights coalition added: “Qatari authorities have also failed to provide disaggregated details about the announced $350 million reimbursed to migrant workers for wage theft, despite repeated requests by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International.”\n\nTwo migrant workers are reported to have died during this World Cup – 24-year-old John Njue Kibue from Kenya who reportedly fell while on duty at Qatar’s Lusail Stadium and another worker who died at the resort used by Saudi Arabia during the group stages.\n\nMeanwhile, FIFA’s decision to threaten sanctions for any player wearing a “OneLove” armband, which features a heart containing different colors to promote inclusion, created a rift between the sport’s governing body and the seven European nations whose captains had planned to wear it – England, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Switzerland and Wales.\n\nReports also emerged of security officials asking people to remove rainbow-colored items of clothing – a symbol of LGBTQ pride.\n\n“When it came to LGBT rights, the authorities didn’t provide any serious assurances and everything they did, they did it with mixed messages … And that’s why we saw this level of attention in a way that’s like in other contexts,” Begum says.\n\n‘Creating bubbles’\n\nHowever, some have said that the media criticism, while grounded in a genuine human rights critique, has been more intense than what was directed towards Russia in 2018 – another controversial World Cup host.\n\nFor Maryam AlHajri, a Qatari researcher at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies, some of the rhetoric has been more concerned with feeding into an “orientalist discourse,” than addressing human rights concerns.\n\nCritics have cited an on-air joke by a French journalist about the presence of “a lot of mosques” and a photo caption by the Times of London that said “Qataris are unaccustomed to seeing women in Western dress in their country” before it was deleted as examples of this.\n\n“This should not be read as a justification to cease criticizing the migrant worker condition in Qatar,” AlHajri told CNN last month. “Rather, it should be interpreted as an argument for the necessity to contextualize the migrant workers situation as part of a globalized economic order built on colonialism and racial capitalism.”\n\nGerman student Bengt Kunkel, 23, was one of hundreds of thousands of fans who travelled to Qatar.\n\nHe wore rainbow-colored arm and wristbands to the match between France and Denmark, but was asked by security officials to remove them. Kunkel then told CNN he was stopped four more times before being allowed to take his seat inside the stadium wearing the rainbow-colored items.\n\n“I think Qatar itself is pretty good at creating bubbles,” he says, “and people don’t necessarily get to know everything about the country because they want to set up the perfect image of Doha.”\n\nBut he says that this incident didn’t harm his overall experience at the tournament, speaking of “people coming from all over the world to celebrate football.”\n\nHe adds that “Qatar is a way more tolerant country than is being displayed … it tried its best to act like a world open host of the tournament.”\n\nArnov Paul-Choudhry, a 21-year-old student from England, was another of these fans who travelled to Qatar for the World Cup, visiting the country for two weeks.\n\nHundreds of thousands of fans arrived in Qatar for the football. Laurence Griffiths/Getty Images\n\nHe says that he “wasn’t sure what to expect” beforehand but that staying in Doha, meeting fans from all around the world and the hospitality of the Qatari people made his experience a good one.\n\n“I think the tournament has got a lot of negative heat which is understandable but from the experience of people who have actually gone out there I don’t think I’ve heard a negative experience from anyone.\n\n“All the fans I spoke to out there have loved it.”\n\n‘A popular touch to the reconciliation’\n\nDuring the buildup to the World Cup – from June 2017 to January 2021 – Qatar was at the center of a diplomatic crisis as several countries – including Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates – cut diplomatic relations with it, accusing it of supporting terrorism and destabilizing the region.\n\nQatar repeatedly denied the accusations.\n\nOver the last two years, there has been a gradual thawing of tensions and the World Cup provided a tangible symbol for this thaw with Saudi crown prince and de facto ruler Mohammed bin Salman pictured wearing a Qatari scarf at the opening ceremony while Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim al-Thani returned the favor by draping Saudi Arabia’s scarf over his shoulders during its match against Argentina.\n\n“It’s put a sort of popular touch to the reconciliation from where I can see it at least,” Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, author of Qatar and the Gulf Crisis, tells CNN Sport. “It’s really to some extent sealed what was a political agreement between the leadership in 2021.”\n\nEmir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani watches the match between Argentina and Saudi Arabia.

But though kickoff for the opening match is just hours away, soccer itself is still being overshadowed by off-the-field matters.\n\nFIFA President Gianni Infantino’s extraordinary tirade against Western critics of the controversial tournament in an explosive hour-long monologue is still making headlines around the world. Human rights groups described it as “crass” and an “insult” to migrant workers.\n\nInfantino, the boss of world soccer’s governing body, looked on glumly as he addressed hundreds of journalists in Doha, Qatar, Saturday, and started the news conference with a near hour-long speech, during which he accused Western critics of hypocrisy and racism.\n\n“We are taught many lessons from Europeans, from the Western world,” he said, referring to criticisms of Qatar’s human rights record.\n\n“What we Europeans have been doing for the last 3,000 years, we should be apologizing for the next 3,000 years before starting to give moral lessons.”\n\nThis tournament will be a historic event, the first World Cup to be held in the Middle East, but is also mired in controversy, with much of the build-up focusing on human rights, from the death of migrant workers and the conditions many have endured in Qatar, to LGBTQ and women’s rights.\n\nThose involved in the tournament have faced much criticism. Last week British comedian Joe Lycett questioned David Beckham’s status as a gay icon were the former England captain and Manchester United star to continue in his role as a Qatar World Cup ambassador.\n\nHomosexuality in Qatar is illegal and punishable by up to three years in prison. A report from Human Rights Watch, published last month, documented cases as recently as September of Qatari security forces arbitrarily arresting LGBT people and subjecting them to “ill-treatment in detention.”\n\nColombian singer Maluma, who features in the official World Cup anthem, walked out of an interview on Israeli television when he was questioned about the Gulf state’s human rights record.\n\nInfantino addressed questions around the last-minute ban on alcohol from being sold at stadiums. Gabriel Bouys/AFP/Getty Images\n\n‘Today I feel gay’\n\nWhile Qatar’s team will take on Ecuador in the first game at 11 a.m. ET Sunday, in his remarkable press conference Infantino barely spoke about soccer and focused his attention on what he called the “hypocrisy” of Western criticism.\n\nInfantino told journalists that he knew what it felt like to be discriminated against, saying he was bullied as a child for having red hair and freckles.\n\n“Today I feel Qatari. Today I feel Arab. Today I feel African. Today I feel gay. Today I feel disabled. Today I feel a migrant worker,” he said, in front of a stunned audience.\n\n“I feel this, all this, because what I’ve been seeing and what I’ve been told, since I don’t read, otherwise I would be depressed I think.\n\n“What I’ve seen brings me back to my personal story. I am a son of migrant workers. My parents were working very very hard in difficult situations.”\n\nInfantino said progress had been made in Qatar on a range of issues, but insisted real change took time, adding that FIFA would not leave the country after the tournament finished. He suggested that he thought some Western journalists would forget about the issues.\n\n“We need to invest in education, to give them a better future, to give them hope. We should all educate ourselves,” he said.\n\n“Reform and change takes time. It took hundreds of years in our countries in Europe. It takes time everywhere, the only way to get results is by engaging […] not by shouting.”\n\nHuman rights groups have criticized the FIFA boss and his speech. Nicholas McGeehan, director of FairSquare, a non-profit human rights organization, said in a statement: “Infantino’s comments were as crass as they were clumsy and suggest that the FIFA president is getting his talking points direct from the Qatari authorities.\n\nSteve Cockburn, Amnesty International’s head of economic and social justice, said in a statement: “In brushing aside legitimate human rights criticisms, Gianni Infantino is dismissing the enormous price paid by migrant workers to make his flagship tournament possible – as well as FIFA’s responsibility for it.\n\nAlcohol ban\n\nInfantino also addressed questions around the last-minute decision to ban alcohol from being sold at the eight stadiums which will host the tournament’s 64 matches. In a FIFA statement issued on Friday, the governing body said alcohol would be sold at fan zones and licensed venues.\n\nThe Muslim country is considered to be very conservative and tightly regulates alcohol sales and usage.\n\nIn September, Qatar had said it would permit ticketed fans to buy alcoholic beer at World Cup stadiums three hours before kickoff and for one hour after the final whistle, but not during the match.\n\n“Let me first assure you that every decision that is taken in this World Cup is a joint decision between Qatar and FIFA,” he said. “Every decision is discussed, debated and taken jointly.”\n\n“There will be […] over 200 places where you can buy alcohol in Qatar and over 10 fan zones, where over 100,000 people can simultaneously drink alcohol.\n\n“I think personally, if for three hours a day you cannot drink a beer, you will survive.”\n\n“Especially because actually the same rules apply in France or in Spain or in Portugal or in Scotland, where no beer is allowed in stadiums now,” he added.\n\n“It seems to become a big thing because it’s a Muslim country, or I don’t know why.”\n\nInfantino finished the press conference by insisting that everyone would be safe in Qatar, amid concerns from the LGBTQ community.\n\nHomosexuality in Qatar is illegal and punishable by up to three years in prison, but the FIFA president promised that this was a tournament for everyone.\n\n“Let me mention as well, the LGBT situation. I have been speaking about this topic with the highest leadership of the country several times, not just once. They have confirmed, and I can confirm, that everyone is welcome,” Infantino said.\n\n“This is a clear FIFA requirement. Everyone has to be welcomed, everyone that comes to Qatar is welcome whatever religion, race, sexual orientation, belief she or he has. Everyone is welcome. This was our requirement and the Qatari state sticks to that requirement,” Infantino said.", "authors": ["Ben Church"], "publish_date": "2022/11/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columnist/nancy-armour/2022/11/20/qatar-2022-world-cup-migrant-workers-deaths-hate/10745024002/", "title": "Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup known for sportswashing, workers deaths", "text": "AL KHOR, Qatar – The stadiums are spectacular, stunning displays of both architecture and art. The Doha waterfront is beautiful, and the skyline in Lusail is breathtaking. The fans – the real ones, anyway – are a festive delight.\n\nIf only it wasn’t all so gross.\n\nThe World Cup finally kicked off Sunday, 12 years after Qatar bought, err won, the right to host. Contrary to what FIFA president Gianni Infantino would have you believe, the criticism of the Qataris is not hypocrisy nor is it unjust. The stadiums, the skyscrapers, this whole event has been paid for in blood.\n\n“We invested for the good of all humanity,” Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, Qatar’s emir, said during the opening ceremony.\n\nThat’s as big a farce as that VAR call on what should have been Ecuador’s first goal in what ended up being a 2-0 win over Qatar. The emir and his family want to be a power, both in the region and beyond, and they saw the World Cup as their entrée.\n\nFortunately for them, Infantino and his fellow FIFA members are feckless grifters who are unbothered by human rights abuses so long as the money is good. I’d say they sold their souls, but no one is naïve enough to think they ever had them.\n\nNEWSLETTER:Get daily news and stories delivered directly to your inbox\n\nOPINION: FIFA president Infantino's screed on Qatar criticisms wrong, inappropriate\n\nSo here we are. Thousands of migrant workers were exploited and abused to build the gleaming palaces for the World Cup, and an untold number died. Despite the emir promising that everyone is welcome in Qatar, homosexuality is still illegal and, after Friday’s reversal on the sale of alcoholic beer at stadiums, the LGBTQ community is petrified at what other promises will be broken. Women remain second-class citizens.\n\nAnd FIFA has gone along with all these horrors without a second thought, giving Qatar an assist as it sportswashes its sins away.\n\n“Welcome to celebrate football, because football unites the world!” Infantino said at the opening ceremony.\n\nThat’s the biggest disappointment of all.\n\nSports is society’s great equalizer, a common ground that bridges language barriers, politics and religion, and no sport is more egalitarian than soccer. It’s played in every corner of the world, by men and women, young and old, rich and poor.\n\nIt isn’t right that the World Cup, the crown jewel of this global game, has been held almost exclusively in Europe and the Americas. The Middle East deserved to host a World Cup, just as Africa did 12 years ago, and it could have been transformative.\n\nImagine if the Qataris – who, last I checked, have money to burn – had used their construction projects as an exemplar for worker’s rights. Imagine if they’d used these last 12 years to encourage tolerance and respect. What a message that would have sent not just to the rest of the region, but the rest of the world.\n\nInstead, Qatar’s World Cup has further marginalized some of the poorest and most vulnerable people in the world. It has sanctioned bigotry and hate. It has sullied the beautiful game.\n\nNow that the tournament has started, Qatar and FIFA are no doubt hoping that attention will shift to the games. That we’ll be so entranced by Brazil’s poetic style, France’s flow and Lionel Messi’s last chance to lift the Jules Rimet Trophy that we’ll forget how morally bankrupt and inauthentic everything about this World Cup is.\n\nBut you cannot sit in these majestic stadiums and not think about their human cost. You cannot see crowds of fans and not wonder who among them would be subject to persecution simply for being who they are. You cannot see the close-ups of the Qatari fan section, with nary a woman in sight, and not feel desperate for the women and girls who live here.\n\nThis will be the enduring legacy of the World Cup in Qatar, and nothing that happens over the next four weeks can change that.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports columnist Nancy Armour on Twitter @nrarmour.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/12/19/jan-6-world-cup-title-42-snow-weather/10901756002/", "title": "Jan. 6 committee, World Cup, winter weather, Title 42: Daily Briefing", "text": "The Jan. 6 committee meets today in its likely final act as the 18-month investigation of Donald Trump and the Capitol attack ends.

And that's the point. Four years out from hosting the 2022 FIFA World Cup, Qatar wants you to know it's growing. Evolving. Not just physically but politically and — this small Muslim nation tucked into a corner of the Arabian Peninsula insists — culturally.\n\nScan the skyline in downtown Doha and you'll find massive construction cranes sprinkled every few blocks in an attempt to keep pace with demand in a country expanding at a seemingly frenetic pace. Look down and everything appears to be covered in a fine layer of dust, the kind you see while walking into a new home not quite ready to go on the market.\n\nEight years after FIFA stunned the soccer world by promising to bring its crown jewel to the Middle East for the first time, what once seemed impossibly far-off is becoming decidedly tangible.\n\nThe eight stadiums scattered in a 30-mile radius that will host 32 teams from across the planet are in various stages of development, most of them trying to walk the treacherous line of paying homage to the region's history while simultaneously avoiding becoming an expensive and unused relic once the party ends and everyone else goes home.\n\nScientists refine genetically engineered grass to withstand the parched desert conditions as engineers tinker with massive air conditioners. The ideas to deal with the anticipated influx of over 1 million soccer fans range from the creative — think cruise ships doubling as Air BnBs during the tournament's 28-day run — to pragmatic.\n\n\"This is our stamp,\" said Yasser al-Mulla, the Landscape and Sport Turf Management Senior Manager of Competition Venues.\n\nAlbeit a complicated one.\n\nHUMAN RIGHTS CONCERNS\n\nLogistically, the country that promised to \"Deliver Amazing\" when it landed the bid in 2010 remains intent on doing just that. Logistics, however, might be the easy part in a nation of 2.7 million — only 300,000 actual Qatari citizens — that's spent a large portion of the last decade adjusting to the white-hot glare that accompanied its surprise win over the United States, Japan, South Korea and Australia.\n\nHuman rights groups question Qatar's care of low-paid migrant laborers building stadiums in humid summertime heat of above 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit). Others wonder how alcohol sales will work in a conservative Wahhabi Muslim nation where bars routinely check passports before pouring pints. Then there's the ongoing boycott of Qatar by four Arab nations, which has thrown air travel in the region into chaos.\n\nQatar's physical makeover is one thing. It has the money, billions of dollars in fact, from its vast natural gas deposits. Navigating the political and cultural stakes the World Cup brings is another matter.\n\nHosting the tournament featuring the most popular sport on the planet is the largest and most audacious step of Qatar's plans to put it on the world stage . Doha has tried to model the success of Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, building skyscrapers and a large international airport to host a state carrier that provides a link between East and West.\n\nThat construction boom has been built on the backs of migrant laborers from India, Pakistan, Nepal and other Asian nations, much like it has in other oil-rich sheikhdoms in the region. As oil prices crashed below $30 a barrel in 2016, construction firms in Qatar and elsewhere in the region suffered. Some stopped paying staffers on time, if at all. Others seized workers' passports or otherwise abused Qatar's \"kafala\" system that ties expatriate workers to a single employer.\n\nIn recent months, Qatar ended a requirement for some workers to seek their employers' permission before leaving the country. It also required contractors who bring in workers from other nations to reimburse employees for any recruitment fee they paid to an outside agency to facilitate their placement.\n\nAmnesty International, Human Rights Watch and other activists say more needs to be done. There have been two reported deaths at Qatar's World Cup projects.\n\n\"We've identified that this is an area we're going to have to do a lot of work,\" said Nasser al-Khater, deputy-secretary general of the World Cup organizing committee, told The Associated Press.\n\nStill, al-Khater stressed \"we should be very proud of ourselves,\" calling Qatar's progress a \"case study\" that actually puts the current country's labor practices ahead of its Middle Eastern neighbors.\n\nIF YOU BUILD IT, WILL THEY COME?\n\nTalking from his office on the 33rd floor of the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy, al-Khater glanced out the window across Doha Bay to where the foundation of Ras Abu Aboud Stadium is being laid. The view has changed significantly on many levels, all of them aimed at proving Qatar is a worthy host.\n\n\"People say ... 'They have zero football pedigree,'\" al-Khater said. \"That's not true. We don't have zero football pedigree. We have a football pedigree. You just don't know it. It might be shorter than England's or Germany's, but we still do. And you know what? Why do you need to have a football pedigree to host the World Cup? Why don't you use the World Cup to evolve the game and to promote the game.\"\n\nPromoting it enough to make sure 1.5 million visitors will pass through Hamad International Airport over the course of four weeks in November and December 2022 is a daunting challenge.\n\nCrowds for the Qatar Stars League, the highest level of soccer in the country, are modest, and that's for people who have to simply hop in their car or call up an Uber to get there.\n\nThe stands inside the Aspire Dome at the recently completed World Gymnastics Championships, where American star and Olympic champion Simone Biles won six medals, were half full at best for most of the 10 days of competition. Expectations are higher for the 2019 World Track & Field Championships, which will descend on Khalifa International Stadium next fall.\n\nYet getting to Qatar may prove more complicated than initially planned. Doha has found itself under a boycott by Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE since June 2017 over a political dispute. That has seen its air routes affected and other regional airlines cut their flights. What should be a flight under an hour from Dubai now lasts far longer and requires a layover.\n\nThere are no signs of the crisis being resolved soon, an issue that makes FIFA president Gianni Infantino's quest to expand the World Cup from 32 to 48 teams in 2022 a delicate and likely doomed proposition. Infantino believes boosting participation could help ease the current political strain in the region because it would require Qatar to share some of the responsibility with its neighbors.\n\nQatar's response has been polite but skeptical. Given the time crunch Infantino faces — a new plan would have to be in place before qualifying begins in the spring — a 48-team tournament will likely have to wait until 2026.\n\nHOSTS WITH THE MOST?\n\nRegardless of the tournament's size, finding a place to sleep will be at a premium. Qatar has some 25,000 hotel rooms, according to government statistics. FIFA required Qatar to have at least 60,000 rooms by 2022. There are plans to make as many as 6,000 rooms on cruise ships available while also opening up any unused dwellings in Doha for rent before play kicks off on Nov. 21, 2022.\n\nLocating somewhere to crash is only part of the issue. Officials stress food supply has not been disrupted by the economic boycott, thanks in part to the decision to bring in 4,000 cows to help deal with potential meat or dairy shortages.\n\nYet milk is not exactly the beverage of choice at the World Cup, which at times can feel like a monthlong party with the occasional soccer match thrown in to break things up. Grabbing a pre-match beer, however, could be a challenge in a country where access to alcohol is limited. To have a beer most nights you need to visit a restaurant affiliated with a hotel and then have your passport scanned before heading inside, an arrangement that simply won't be tenable given the wave of people expected.\n\nThere are tentative plans to permit alcohol use in certain areas during the World Cup, though al-Khater declined to get into specifics.\n\n\"It'll be very clear for fans that do arrive in Qatar, which areas will be designated for (drinking),\" al-Khater said.\n\nOfficials are quick to point out there are other things to do than have a drink, throw on your country's jersey and go to the stadium. Take a stroll down the Corniche, the waterfront promenade that runs along Doha Bay. Browse at the Souq, a historical outdoor market, or visit a shopping mall like the Villaggio, which offers everything from indoor gondola rides to high-end shopping to rival anything you'd find in London or New York.\n\nLEGOS ON STEROIDS\n\nThe hope over the next four years is to systematically address all outside concerns. Do that and Qataris believe the conversation will turn away from \"should Qatar be hosting the World Cup?\" to \"can Qatar pull it off?\"\n\nOn that front, the answers are far less nebulous. Qatar is intent on putting on a show, but doing it creatively and financially responsibly.\n\nThat's why Mohammed Abdulla al-Mulla and Mohamed al-Atwaan are standing in the middle of mounds of dirt and rocks that will eventually become Ras Abu Aboud Stadium in the East Bay and envisioning a finished product that could change the entire concept of what an athletic venue is, what it can be and most importantly, where it can be.\n\nThe two project managers have been tasked with putting together a 40,000-seat stadium that will feature 1,000 shipping containers in a project that's akin to playing with the most intricate Lego set on the planet, one that will also offer a sweeping view of the striking high-rises of the West Bay that will look good broadcast in high definition to hundreds of millions of televisions across the planet.\n\nIt's savvy marketing on both ends. In an era of bloat where budgets for big ticket events like the World Cup and the Olympics are calculated and then blown up, Qatar is determined to show it can dazzle without saddling itself with hulking stadiums left unoccupied. The majority of the venues used in the World Cup will have their capacity diminished from 40,000 to 20,000 after the competition ends, with the sections taken out then put up for sale. What's left will serve as the home pitch for QSL teams.\n\nRas Abu Aboud won't exist at all. After the World Cup ends, it will be meticulously taken apart and dismantled to make way for a mixed-use area that will feature housing and shops.\n\nGOING GREEN\n\nOther innovations could have a more lasting impact.\n\nAl-Mulla oversees a turf farm a few miles west of the city center, where he's tested 36 different kinds of grass, exposing them to various amounts of shade, sunlight and other forms of treatment to see what works and what doesn't. The turf isn't designed simply for the games — though al-Mulla points out an entire stadium can be resurfaced in less than 13 hours if necessary — but for the open recreational areas that will surround the venues after the World Cup is gone. The strain of grass it believes it will use for the World Cup could possibly signal an opportunity for other arid countries to introduce their own public green spaces.\n\nIn case temperatures do spike, there will be vents surrounding the field and behind each seat in most stadiums designed to create a \"cold bubble\" that could shield players and fans from lighter, warmer air.\n\nDr. Saud Abdul-Aziz Abdul-Ghani, professor and assistant dean at the College of Engineering at Qatar University, came up with a system that doesn't blow air directly onto your body but instead diffuses it around you, creating a blanket of sorts. They're using dummies to mimic the effect of the fans on body temperature, and Abdul-Ghani is confident the only thing that will make fans uncomfortable in the stands during the World Cup is the pressure of the stakes.\n\nThe heat shouldn't be an issue on the pitch itself. The air conditioning vents surrounding the field at Khalifa International, for example, are so strong you can feel the breeze standing at midfield. Organizers, however, are confident they'll be able to keep the AC off and only use if absolutely necessary.\n\nThey understand the long list of questions they need to answer. They've spent the last eight years trying to take care of them one by one. There are still four more to go. The pace is picking up. What once seemed like some sort of vague goal far off is approaching rapidly. Qatar is attempting to embrace all the thorny issues that come with the responsibility.\n\n\"I actually think it's going to be something that really proves that ... the World Cup can go beyond football and beyond sports and beyond what it means for the athlete,\" al-Khater said. \"But it goes toward real social and economic change and human change and I think that's the beauty of the World Cup.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/11/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2020/01/07/court-date-set-for-uae-appeal-against-qatars-asian-cup-win/40957153/", "title": "Court date set for UAE appeal against Qatar's Asian Cup win", "text": "AP\n\nGENEVA (AP) — A legal challenge by the United Arab Emirates soccer federation that threatens Qatar’s 2019 Asian Cup title will be heard at sport’s highest court.\n\nThe Court of Arbitration for Sport said Tuesday it will hear the UAE's appeal on March 12 in a case that alleges Qatar fielded two ineligible players at the tournament. The Asian Cup was hosted by the UAE during an ongoing diplomatic rift with neighboring Qatar, which will stage the next World Cup in 2022.\n\nA verdict by CAS judges is likely at least several weeks after the hearing in Lausanne, Switzerland.\n\nThe ruling could strip Qatar of its biggest success in world soccer, affect key young players in its World Cup planning, and see the UAE inflict an embarrassing loss on a regional political rival.\n\nThe UAE filed a complaint with the Asian Football Confederation after a 4-0 loss to Qatar in the Asian Cup semifinals in Abu Dhabi last January.\n\nWhen an ineligible player case is proven, AFC rules say a team must forfeit the game.\n\nThe Asian governing body’s first disciplinary ruling cleared Qatar of wrongdoing hours before beating Japan 3-1 in the final.\n\nUAE officials have appealed to CAS against the Qatar Football Association and the AFC, whose appeal committee also later dismissed the claims of wrongfully submitted documents.\n\nThe UAE alleges Qatar’s star forward Almoez Ali and defender Bassam Al-Rawi were not born there and did not meet FIFA nationality requirements to represent the country.\n\nFIFA’s statutes say players can acquire a nationality if they have “lived continuously for at least five years after reaching the age of 18 on the territory of the relevant association.”\n\nBoth Ali, who turned 23 since the Asian Cup ended, and Al-Rawi, who is now aged 22, seemed not to meet the five-year residency rule.\n\nHowever, both reportedly claimed their mothers were born in Qatar — meeting FIFA’s national eligibility standard if a parent or grandparent is born on a territory.\n\nAli scored against the UAE, and again in the final, for a tournament-leading nine goals. Al-Rawi was suspended for the semifinal but returned to play against Japan.\n\nThey are also club teammates at Al-Duhail, runner-up in the Qatari league last season, and fellow graduates of the state-of-the-art Aspire youth academy in Doha which has educated many players born outside of Qatar.\n\nThe latest appeal extends difficulties between the soccer neighbors which showed in a heated semifinals game played 20 months into an economic and travel boycott of Qatar by regional political rivals.\n\nAfter Qatar took a 2-0 lead in Mohammed bin Zayed Stadium — named for the UAE crown prince — players celebrating the goal had to dodge shoes thrown by some spectators.\n\nThe UAE soccer body was later fined $150,000 by the AFC for the fans' misconduct, including the shoe-throwing and disrespecting the Qatari anthem.\n\nThe teams met again in Doha five weeks ago, when the UAE and Saudi Arabia agreed to travel to Qatar to play in the Arabian Gulf Cup, won by Bahrain. Qatar beat the UAE 4-2 in a group-stage game.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/07"}]}

This will signal the change in seasons, depending on if you're in the Northern or Southern Hemisphere. The winter solstice means winter in the north, while in the south it means the summer time since it's tilt is closest to the sun.\n\nWhen the summer solstice happens in June, the roles are reversed.\n\nWe also have equinoxes – the March \"spring\" and September \"fall\" – when the day and nights are equal length, but signal the change in seasons.\n\nWhen is the winter solstice?\n\nThe winter solstice happens at the same time no matter where you are in the Northern Hemisphere, which will be around 4:48 p.m. ET, according to the U.S. Naval Observatory and Time and Date.\n\nAt that time, the sun's rays will be directly over the Tropic of Capricorn, a line of latitude that circles the Earth in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nHow long will winter be?\n\nPunxsutawney Phil doesn't get a say in the astronomical timing of winter.\n\nWinter lasts from the winter solstice to the March equinox, which is typically around 89 days. The 2023 March equinox is on March 20, meaning this winter will be 89 days long.\n\nDoes the winter solstice mark the coldest day on Earth?\n\nNo.\n\nEven though this marks the official start of winter, most of the U.S. experiences its lowest temperatures in January because it takes time for Earth to cool down, which takes around a month. It's similar to the summer solstice in that even though it happens in June, the U.S. sees its highest temperatures in July and August.\n\nDoes the winter solstice mean the days will get longer?\n\nIf you hate it getting dark so early, the light is at the end of the tunnel.\n\nAlthough most places don't have their latest sunrise or earliest sunset on the winter solstice, it is the shortest day of the year, meaning the day with the least amount of daylight.\n\nBeginning Thursday, the days will get slightly longer and the nights will become shorter with each passing day.

Solstice observations there have been going on annually for thousands of years.\n\nThe Mayans and Aztecs used the summer and winter solstices as markers to build structures that precisely line up with shadows created by the sun, according to Scientific American.\n\nTuesday is also the winter solstice in the Southern Hemisphere, meaning winter is coming for the roughly 12% of the world's population who live there.\n\nWhy do we have solstices?\n\nThe reason we have solstices, equinoxes and seasons is because the Earth is tilted on its axis, thanks to a random collision with another object untold billions of years ago. According to Earthsky, Earth’s Northern and Southern Hemispheres trade places in receiving the sun’s light and warmth every six months as the Earth revolves around the sun.\n\nEXPLAINER:What is a derecho?", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/12/18/winter-solstice-longest-night-year/2352161002/", "title": "Winter solstice, a full moon and the Ursid meteor shower on the way", "text": "Friday and Saturday will be fun days for skywatchers and worshippers of the dark.\n\nThe winter solstice – marking the longest night and fewest hours of daylight of the year – is Friday. It's the precise moment at which the Northern Hemisphere is tilted farthest from the sun.\n\nIn addition, for some extra excitement, there will also be a full moon and the Ursid meteor shower over the weekend.\n\nThe winter solstice occurs at the same instant everywhere on Earth. In the United States, it happens at 5:23 p.m. ET Friday (4:23 p.m. CT, 3:23 p.m. MT, and 2:23 p.m. PT).\n\nAt that moment, the sun's rays are directly over the Tropic of Capricorn, a line of latitude that circles the Earth in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nIs it in the stars?: Free Daily and Monthly Horoscopes\n\nAlthough the moon becomes full at 12:49 p.m. Saturday, it will certainly appear plenty big and bright both Friday and Saturday nights. It's the final full moon of the year. In North America, we call the December full moon the Long Night Moon, Cold Moon or Moon Before Yule, according to Earthsky.org.\n\nThe solstice and full moon occur less than one day apart, something that won't happen again until 2029.\n\nThe final skywatching treat this weekend will be the Ursid meteor shower, which peaks around Saturday Dec. 22, EarthSky said. Typically a rather low-key shower, the few shooting stars it produces might be even more difficult to see this year thanks to the bright light of the full moon.\n\nFriday also marks the astronomical beginning of winter, even though meteorologists and climatologists view winter as starting Dec. 1, which is the start of the coldest three months of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. After the solstice, the days slowly start to get longer again.\n\nHowever, most locations don't have their earliest sunset or latest sunrise on the solstice. Those events occur either weeks before or after Dec. 21.\n\nAdditionally, winter's shortest day is typically not the coldest day of the year. There is a bit of a lag between the shortest day of the year and the coldest average temperatures for most spots in the USA.\n\nThis lag in temperature occurs because even though the amount of daylight is increasing, the Earth's surface continues to lose more heat than it receives from the sun. In most locations across the U.S., the minimum daily temperature average occurs around two or three weeks later, in early to mid-January.\n\nFor example, the coldest days in Boston, on average, are Jan. 17-26. In Chicago, it's Jan. 17-20, and in Miami, it's Jan. 2-22. At the end of January, more heat finally begins arriving than leaving, and days slowly start to warm up.\n\nIf you hate the cold you're in luck: At least for the next week or so, bitter cold isn't expected: A relatively mild stretch is expected to develop and persist into late December for much of the U.S. as the source of the air across the Lower 48 will be from the Pacific Ocean, rather than the Arctic, the Weather Channel said.\n\nHowever, beyond that, there are some signs the infamous polar vortex may make its chill return in January.\n\nMore:Polar vortex? Back in the day, we called it 'winter'\n\nWhy do we have the seasons? Because the Earth is tilted on its axis. During the Northern Hemisphere's winter, the land north of the equator is tilted away from the sun, which lowers the amount of the sun's energy warming the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nOf course, it's all opposite in the Southern Hemisphere, where Dec. 21 marks the beginning of astronomical summer.\n\nThe Earth is tilted because of collisions with various proto-planets and other massive objects during the formation of the solar system billions of years ago, according to NASA.\n\nThus, the reason the Earth has the perfect temperature for life to form is a few random collisions with other space rocks uncounted eons ago.\n\nOne of the most famous solstice celebrations occurs at the ancient Stonehenge ruins in Wiltshire, England, where druids, pagans and other revelers gather each year to celebrate the event.\n\nThe winter and summer solstices, along with the equinoxes, loom large in myth and folklore.\n\n\"Culturally, the solstices and equinoxes are typically used to denote either the beginnings of the seasons or the center points of the seasons,\" as in England, said Rick Kline of the Spacecraft Planetary Imaging Facility at Cornell University.\n\n\"Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa and other holidays have arisen out of the solstices, equinoxes and the midpoints between them,\" he said.\n\nContributing: Elizabeth Weise, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/12/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/sciencefair/2016/12/20/winter-solstice/95656640/", "title": "Winter solstice: It only gets better from here", "text": "Doyle Rice\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nHere comes the cold and dark: The winter solstice, the day of the year with the least amount of daylight in the Northern Hemisphere, occurs early Wednesday morning.\n\nThe solstice happens at the same instant everywhere on Earth.

The day of the solstice, however, isn't typically the coldest day of the year.

The Massachusetts Democrat charged that the required audit of Trump’s taxes “did not occur,” as his returns were only subjected to the mandatory audit once, in 2019, after Democrats inquired.\n\n“The research that was done as it relates to the mandatory audit program was nonexistent,” Neal told reporters after the committee hearing.\n\nThe committee also released a supplemental report from the Joint Committee on Taxation that included details on Trump’s tax returns from 2015 to 2020, ahead of the planned release of the returns themselves.\n\nThose underlying documents, however, will need to undergo significant redactions first.\n\nThe release of Trump’s tax returns marks the conclusion of a nearly four-year legal battle House Democrats waged against the former president after they took control of the House in 2019.\n\nThe audit program was important to Democrats because it was the justification they used to obtain the returns in the first place – but the Democratic pursuit was also tied in part to long-held suspicions about Trump’s taxes after he would not release his returns while running for president in 2016 or once in office.\n\nThe committee also made legislative recommendations to bolster the presidential audit program, including new requirements “for the mandatory examination of the President with disclosure of certain audit information and related returns in a timely manner.” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Tuesday evening that the House would “move swiftly” to advance the legislation, even though Congress is days away from adjourning.\n\nIn a separate report, the Joint Committee on Taxation offered a summary of its review of tax returns between 2015 and 2020 for Trump and several of his businesses. The JCT noted in its report it had no investigatory power – it couldn’t demand documents from Trump or his businesses or interview IRS agents assigned to Trump’s audits – so the committee issued no opinion about whether Trump should have paid more or less taxes.\n\nTrump paid no federal income tax in his last year as president\n\nTrump reported a stunning reversal of fortune during the middle two years of his presidency that led to a considerable tax bill, according to the report from the Joint Committee on Taxation. The $1.1 million paid in federal taxes in 2018 and 2019 stand in stark contrast to the $750 he paid in 2017 and $0 in 2020.\n\nTrump’s tax bill grew substantially as his income surged in 2018 and 2019. Trump reported a $22 million capital gain in 2018 and a $9 million gain in 2019 from asset sales, sending his income into the black following years of enormous losses.\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, Trump reported he lost more than $32 million each year. In 2017, Trump said he lost nearly $13 million. But he reported taxable income of $24 million in 2018 and more than $4 million in 2019, giving him a sizeable tax bill.\n\nHowever, in 2020, as the pandemic hit, Trump once again reported a gigantic loss of nearly $5 million. He paid $0 in federal income taxes that year.\n\nTrump’s pattern\n\nEvident in tax information broken out in the Joint Committee on Taxation report on Trump’s tax returns from 2015-2020 is Trump’s pattern – as previously shown by a New York Times investigation – of generating huge net operating losses and then carrying them forward for years afterward to zero out his tax liabilities. For instance, the JCT noted that Trump carried forward $105 million in losses on his 2015 return, $73 million in 2016, $45 million in 2017 and $23 million in 2018.\n\nA spokesperson for Trump accused House Democrats of playing politics for moving to release his tax returns to the public.\n\n“This unprecedented leak by lameduck Democrats is proof they are playing a political game they are losing,” said Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung.\n\nHe added, “If this injustice can happen to President Trump, it can happen to all Americans without cause.”\n\nThe Ways and Means Committee report concluded that the IRS failed to audit Trump’s taxes as required under the mandatory presidential audit program. The report found that Trump was only audited one year from 2015-2020. “The Committee’s investigation revealed only one mandatory audit was started under the prior Administration and the program was otherwise dormant, at best,” the committee wrote in its 25-page report released Tuesday after the committee hearing.\n\nThe committee found that the IRS was under-resourced to handle the presidential audit program, recommending additional staffing including “two senior IRS agents, a partnership specialist, a foreign specialist, and a financial products specialist.”\n\nNeal also wouldn’t say if he saw any red flags in Trump’s taxes – either on his business or personal filings. “I think we need to leave that to the tax folks,” he said.\n\nRepublicans accuse Dems of ‘weaponizing’ tax info\n\nTexas Rep. Kevin Brady, the top Republican on the committee, attacked Democrats for weaponizing Trump’s financial information. Brady said that the committee voted to release Trump’s returns for six years, along with returns from eight affiliated businesses.\n\n“What became clear is that almost all those audits that the IRS is doing is not yet complete. So any characterizations of the returns themselves, you have to acknowledge, this is incomplete at this time,” Brady said.\n\nThe highly anticipated meeting, which began publicly but quickly entered into a closed, private session, was years in the making but comes as Democrats have just days to act on whether to release the former president’s tax returns. While there is historic precedent for Ways and Means to release confidential tax information, a decision to put it out to the public comes with intense political fallout as Trump has already declared he is running for president in 2024.\n\nThe committee has had access to Trump’s taxes for weeks after winning a lengthy legal battle that began in the spring of 2019. Neal requested the first six years of Trump’s taxes as well as tax returns for eight of his businesses back in April of 2019.\n\nBrady, the panel’s top Republican, told reporters just before Tuesday’s meeting that releasing Trump’s tax returns would amount to “a dangerous new political weapon that reaches far beyond the former president and overturns decades of privacy protections for average Americans that have existed since the Watergate reform.”\n\n“We are unified in our concern the Democrats may today move forward with unprecedented action that will jeopardize the right of every American to be protected from political targeting by Congress,” Brady said.\n\nDemocrats on the committee would rely on section 6103 of the tax code to lawfully release information about Trump’s taxes, but Republicans are prepared to argue that Democrats are abusing the provision, attacking a political enemy and potentially unleashing a system where even individuals could have their personal information exposed if they become targets of the committee.\n\nCharitable giving\n\nThe Joint Committee on Taxation also raised many questions about the validity of Trump’s claims in his tax returns.\n\nFor example, Trump included many gigantic tax deductions for charitable donations that the JCT said merited further investigation.\n\nIn 2015, Trump claimed a $21.1 million deduction for donating 158 acres of his 212-acre property called Seven Springs in North Castle, New York. The donation is included in the Manhattan district attorney’s criminal investigation of the Trump Organization’s finances.\n\nThe report noted that an IRS agent assigned to audit Trump’s taxes suggested disallowing the entire $21.1 million deduction because Trump did not get a qualified appraisal for the land. The agent alternatively suggested reducing the value of the deduction by more than half and said the appraiser may be subject to a fine for potentially misstating the value of the land.\n\nIn 2016 and 2017, Trump claimed nearly $1.2 million and $1.9 million, respectively, in charitable contributions, the bulk of which were made in cash. Trump had no taxable income in either year, but he was able to carry forward the deduction to future years, further limiting the amount of federal income tax he had to pay. The JCT said the large cash contributions merited a review.\n\nTrump had taxable income in 2018 and 2019 and reported cash donations of just over $500,000 each year. That means he was able to claim a charitable contribution deduction those years. The JCT suggested Trump should be asked to substantiate those large cash donations.\n\nHistorical precedent\n\nWhen Neal requested Trump’s tax information in 2019, he wasn’t the first chairman to use an arcane section of the tax code known as 6013 to glean confidential tax information. The same statute has been used a number of times by Ways and Means chairmen for investigations and the Joint Committee on Taxation also used the statute to obtain information about former President Richard Nixon’s taxes in the 1970s.\n\nAccording to the House Ways and Means Committee, that information was requested and received without a legal fight. Nixon had voluntarily released some of his returns, but JCT requested additional returns using 6103, according to a House Ways and Means Committee memo released earlier this summer. Republicans have also used the 6103 statute. Back in 2014, Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp led the committee in releasing confidential tax information to further the committee’s investigation into whether the IRS had unfairly targeted conservative organizations when deciding on groups to probe.\n\nWhat the public could learn\n\nAlthough The New York Times obtained decades of Trump’s personal tax information back in 2020, Neal’s request could shed light on additional years of Trump’s finances and paint a picture of how the former president used his business entities and personal wealth in the years before and after becoming president.\n\nTrump broke with tradition in 2016 by refusing to release any of his personal tax returns.\n\nDemocrats have long argued that Trump’s taxes could provide necessary information about whether the president had any entanglements that could impact his decision making as president. Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee argued in court they needed Trump’s tax returns so they could understand better the presidential audit program, which is supposed to routinely audit the returns of every incoming president and vice president when they are elected.\n\nNeal didn’t just request Trump’s raw tax return, however. Neal also requested administrative files and paperwork, items that could include IRS officials’ notes or audits of Trump’s returns. The information could paint a picture of what kind of scrutiny the IRS has pursued on Trump in the past and whether any of that scrutiny changed when he became president.\n\nWhen the returns are made public, they could shed light on how wealthy Trump really is, how much he gave to charity and how much he paid in taxes. The New York Times report in 2020 made clear that Trump carried over business losses for years to legally be able to avoid paying taxes for many of those years, but Ways and Means will have access to some additional years of Trump taxes as well.", "authors": ["Lauren Fox Daniella Diaz Jeremy Herb", "Lauren Fox", "Daniella Diaz", "Jeremy Herb"], "publish_date": "2022/12/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/30/politics/house-ways-and-means-committee-now-has-donald-trumps-federal-tax-returns/index.html", "title": "Trump tax returns: House committee receives Donald Trump's ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe House Ways and Means Committee now has six years of Donald Trump’s federal tax returns, ending a yearslong pursuit by Democrats to dig into one of the former president’s most closely guarded personal details.\n\n“Treasury has complied with last week’s court decision,” a Treasury spokesperson told CNN on Wednesday.\n\nThe spokesperson did not provide any additional information. Federal courts had decided the House could request six years of Trump’s returns, after the committee had requested them in 2019 and again in 2021, according to public court records.\n\nThe handover had been on hold, until the Supreme Court declined last week to intervene. Several judges, including Republican appointees, have found the House had power to request the returns from the IRS.\n\nTreasury declined to say whether the committee members have accessed the documents, according to a Treasury official.\n\nThe committee, led by Democratic Rep. Richard Neal of Massachusetts, had sought six years of Trump’s tax records, primarily from the time he served as president. That included records about both Trump personally and several of his corporate entities.\n\nThe panel is planning to meet Thursday to get briefed on the legal ramifications of the section of the tax law that Neal used to request Trump’s tax returns, according to a Neal aide.\n\nDemocrats are not expected to review the tax returns at this session, and the documents are not expected to be immediately released to the public.\n\nHouse general counsel Doug Letter plans to brief the panel about section 6103 of the tax law at the meeting, which is a weekly session that Democrats on the committee have when they’re not on recess.\n\nNeal refused to say to CNN if he had possession of the Trump tax documents, saying the law strictly prohibits him from discussing the state of the returns. Earlier Wednesday, the congressman also declined to say if they would release any of the returns publicly.\n\n“The next step is to have a meeting of the Democratic caucus,” Neal said.\n\nTrump’s legal team had continuously sought to keep his returns secret, and turned to the Supreme Court – composed of three of his nominees – after he lost at the lower court level.\n\n“No Congress has ever wielded its legislative powers to demand a President’s tax returns,” Trump argued to the Supreme Court, as he warned of the “far-reaching implications” implications of the DC Circuit’s ruling. He had argued that that the way lower courts approached the House request ran afoul of the Supreme Court’s ruling in the Mazars case, concerning a subpoena that the House issued to Trump’s accounting firm for his tax information.\n\nTrump’s taxes have been largely a mystery since he first ran for office.\n\nDuring his 2016 campaign, the Trump broke with presidential election norms and refused to produce his tax returns for public review, and they remained private after he took office.\n\nBeing under audit by the IRS does not preclude someone from releasing their tax returns publicly.

Kevin Brady, R-Texas, the lead Republican on the House committee deciding whether to release them, said before the decision that doing so would set a precedent giving power to lawmakers going forward to “target and make public the tax returns of private citizens, political enemies, business and labor leaders or even the Supreme Court justices themselves.”\n\nDemocratic political group Occupy Democrats soon took to Twitter to say that releasing the tax returns of the “Republican-controlled Supreme Court” sounds “pretty darn good.”\n\n– Donovan Slack\n\nBrady warns Democrats about releasing Trump taxes\n\nJust minutes before the meeting, Brady, the top Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, issued one final warning to Democrats about releasing Donald Trump's tax returns.\n\nFuture lawmakers will have \"nearly unlimited power\" to \"make public the tax returns of private citizens,” Brady told reporters, though most legal analysts said the law will continue to shield people who are not government officials..\n\nThe Twitter account of Ways and Means Republicans explained Brady's motion for release of a transcript: \"The American people know which lawmakers in Congress support the power to target political enemies & which side w/ longstanding taxpayer protections. That's why @RepKevinBrady called for the transcript from the secret executive session be published along w/any Committee action.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nCommittee closed meeting to the public\n\nRep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., chairman of the committee, had asked that the meeting be closed to the public as soon as it started, noting the confidential nature of the documents under review.\n\nRep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, asked first that a transcript of the private session be made public later if any taxpayer information is released as a result of the hearing. The committee unanimously agreed, and Neal said it would be made available “at the appropriate time.”\n\nThe committee went into private session less than five minutes after the meeting started.\n\n– Donovan Slack\n\nHow can the House committee release Trump's personal tax returns?\n\nAs a legal matter, attorneys cite federal law, which allows certain House and Senate committees to obtain the returns of any taxpayer, including the sitting president. The committee can then submit the information to the House or Senate for purposes of passing legislation.\n\nIn this case, committee members said they sought Trump's records as part of an effort to write new laws regarding tax audits.\n\nWatchdogs: Release Trump's tax returns\n\nPublic interest groups like Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington are urging lawmakers to release Trump's taxes, noting that Congress secured President Richard Nixon's tax records in 1973, during the height of the Watergate scandal.\n\nTax returns should be made public \"especially when you have a president in Trump who continued to operate an international business while president,\" said Jordan Libowitz, communications director for CREW. \"The American people need to know where his income was coming from.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWhose tax-release precedent is it?\n\nCommittee Republicans are accusing Democrats of considering a frightful precedent that could be used against anybody.\n\n“We urge Democrats, in their rush to target former President Trump, not to unleash this dangerous new political weapon on the American people,\" said Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, the committee's top Republican.\n\nWhen Republicans led the committee in 2014, they considered releasing confidential tax information. And then voted to release it. At the time, they were investigating IRS delays on applications for tax-exempt status from conservative, Tea Party groups.\n\nThey voted to release documents that contained taxpayer information as part of a referral to the Justice Department recommending prosecution of an IRS official, Lois Lerner, for allegedly targeting conservative groups for increased scrutiny, causing the delays. Justice officials declined to prosecute, saying they found evidence of mismanagement at the IRS but not criminal wrongdoing.\n\n– David Jackson and Donovan Slack\n\nWhat’s in Donald Trump’s tax returns?\n\nCharles Rettig, the California-based tax law expert Trump tapped as the nation’s IRS commissioner, offered predictions in a Forbes essay he wrote in 2016, two years before his nomination.\n\n\"Teams of sophisticated tax advisers were likely engaged throughout Trump’s career to assure the absence of any ‘bombshell’ within the returns. His returns might actually be somewhat unremarkable but for the fact they are the returns of Donald Trump,” wrote Rettig.\n\n“For wealthy individuals, individual tax returns sometimes only provide a brief financial overview linked to numerous other conclusions and entities. To fully understand the financial status of Trump, one would likely need to see returns for multiple years, the work-papers for the individual returns and the returns for numerous related entities, something that is unlikely to happen.”\n\n– Kevin McCoy\n\nCould the Senate jump in?\n\nThe Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee have had little time to analyze Trump’s tax returns. Moreover, Republican control of the House starts in January, and GOP lawmakers have no plans to pursue the issue. But there’s a chance the Democrat-controlled Senate might, Steve Rosenthal, a senior fellow in the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute, said Tuesday.\n\nSen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., chairs the Senate Committee on Finance. And he’s been on record supporting the Ways and Means effort. In a July 2021 statement issued after the Department of Justice said the House committee should have access to the Trump tax returns, Wyden said he would “consult with the Ways and Means Committee and consider the (Senate) Finance Committee’s next steps.”\n\nAs the Finance Committee leader, “Sen. Wyden has all the same powers” to seek and review tax returns as part of Congress’ oversight role as Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., the chair of House Ways and Means panel, said Rosenthal. “He may want to wait and see what happens with Ways and Means first.”\n\n– Kevin McCoy\n\nDemocrat blasts Trump ahead of tax-release meeting\n\nAhead of the meeting Tuesday afternoon, Rep. Brendan Boyle, D-Pa., lashed out at the former president’s “major tax avoidance.”\n\n“It is pretty clear that Donald Trump and his organization have a major tax avoidance issue. To put it mildly,” he told CNN. “So I think there’s clearly a lot of smoke here and I’ll just leave it at that.”\n\nBoyle is one of two dozen Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee, in addition to Neal. There are 17 Republicans. Ways and Means is the oldest congressional committee and the lead tax-writing panel in the House.\n\n– Donovan Slack and David Jackson\n\nCase builds to send Trump taxes to Senate Democrats\n\nCitizens for Responsibility and Ethics, the public interest watchdog group that earlier urged public release of his tax information, fired off a letter to the committee Tuesday asking members to send Trump’s tax materials to the Senate for further investigation.\n\nPublic disclosure of his tax information would “undoubtedly” be justified, CREW’s president and CEO Noah Bookbinder wrote. “However, we are not asking you to do that today.”\n\n“Rather, we are simply asking you to send the information to the Senate Finance Committee,” which will still be controlled by Democrats next year, for further investigation. “Mr. Trump has spent decades avoiding transparency and accountability. For the sake of our democracy, his staggering record of financial impropriety must be fully investigated and understood so that it cannot recur.”\n\nA representative for Neal, the House committee chair, did not respond to messages seeking comment ahead of the meeting.\n\n– Donovan Slack\n\nMaybe some small surprises?\n\nRobert McKenzie, a tax law expert who's of counsel to the Saul Ewing LLP law firm in Chicago, said tax returns sometimes contain surprising finds.\n\nAfter former House Speaker Newt Gingrich released his returns in 2012, McKenzie and other lawyers told USA TODAY Gingrich used a popular tax strategy that enabled him to avoid paying Medicare tax on most of his 2010 income.\n\nA spokesman for Gingrich, who was a presidential contender at the time, said the tax filing was handled properly and legally.\n\n– Kevin McCoy\n\nTrump prepares for tax revelations\n\nTrump has repeatedly opposed any release of his tax information, calling the entire process political. In a recent Truth Social post, he claimed that the records will show his business has \"lots of cash, some of the greatest assets anywhere in the World, and very little debt. Also, strong on deductions and depreciation.\"\n\n\"You will be seeing these numbers soon, but not all from my tax returns, which show relatively little,\" he said.\n\nTrump also claimed, \"You can’t learn much from tax returns, but it is illegal to release them if they are not yours!\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nGo deeper:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/12/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/12/20/trump-tax-returns-house-panel-may-vote-release/10925618002/", "title": "Trump tax returns: What to expect if House panel votes to release them", "text": "House Democrats could vote to release former President Donald Trump’s tax returns Tuesday.\n\nThe potential release follows a protracted legal battle settled by the Supreme Court last month.\n\nTrump has refused to release his tax returns and argued the public isn’t entitled to see them.\n\nWASHINGTON – After years of speculation and legal action, the public may soon get a look at some long-sought information: Donald Trump's tax records.\n\nThe House Committee on Ways and Means meets Tuesday to decide what to do with Trump tax records it obtained as a result of a legal battle that ended with a Supreme Court decision paving the way for their potential release.\n\nAn individual's tax returns are supposed to be shielded by privacy laws, but the committee obtained Trump's returns by successfully arguing they were needed to guide possible changes in tax laws. The committee may decide to attach the records to a report to the full House; it may also decide to release a summary of the Trump tax information. Alternatively, the panel could vote against making the information public.\n\nCongress gets Trump's taxes:Supreme Court denies Donald Trump request to block release of tax returns to House panel\n\nThe Democratic-run committee is weighing whether to act before the start of the new year, when Republicans take control of the chamber. If records are made available, here's what to watch out for:\n\nHow often did Trump pay zero in federal taxes?\n\nSome of this information is already out.\n\nThe New York Times has obtained Trump tax records over the years, including documents in 2020 that covered more than two decades.\n\nThose records showed that Trump paid no federal taxes in 11 of 18 years. In 2017, his first year as president, Trump paid only $750 in federal taxes – a miniscule amount compared to other tax bills, according to a 2020 report from Steven Rosenthal, an expert at the Urban Brookings Tax Policy Center.\n\nTrump used a variety of methods to reduce or even eliminate federal taxes, including applying losses to future years and using refunds of offset tax bills, the Times reported. They included a $72.9 million tax refund that became the subject of a long-term audit by the Internal Revenue Service. The results of that audit are unknown.\n\nHow wealthy is Trump, anyway?\n\nThe documents, if they are released, may shed light on another long-running dispute surrounding Trump: Just how rich is he?\n\nTrump has always claimed to be a billionaire, but some financial analysts have questioned that assertion, citing his frequent bankruptcies, business failures, and questionable valuations of real estate holdings.\n\nAn estimate from Forbes, which tracks billionaires’ wealth, pegged his net worth this week at $3.2 billion.\n\nThe former president’s fortune is derived from New York City real estate holdings, golf courses, a winery and licensing deals for usage of his name around the world, the publication said. He also got a $730 million bump from the Trump Media and Technology Group, which owns Truth Social.\n\nHas Trump fudged the value of his assets?\n\nNew York State Attorney General Letitia James filed a civil lawsuit against Trump and his family in September accusing the former president of carrying out a 10-year scheme \"that grossly inflated\" his personal net worth by billions of dollars and then used the higher values \"to induce banks to lend money to the Trump Organization on more favorable terms than would otherwise have been available.\" The Trump Organization denied any wrongdoing.\n\nNew York prosecutors have conducted a criminal probe of Trump's property valuations, but two of them left their jobs earlier this year without filing criminal charges against the ex-president. It is not known how aggressively Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg is pursuing the investigation.\n\nExperts say tax returns may not shed much additional light on Trump's net worth. It's typically difficult to make determinations about asset values from tax returns, said Martin Press, a tax law expert at the Florida-headquartered Gunster law firm.\n\n\"An income tax return is a tax return. It's not an asset statement,\" Press told USA TODAY.\n\nHasn't there been a trial over Trump's business dealings?\n\nTrump himself has not been tried; his companies have.\n\nTwo of his companies were found guilty Dec. 6 in a scheme that doled out corporate perks such as company-paid apartments and luxury autos to executives who did not report the largesse on their tax returns.\n\nA jury speaks:Trump companies convicted on all charges in Manhattan criminal tax fraud case\n\nProsecutors argued at the trial that the scheme kept the executives happy while enabling the companies to avoid salary hikes and reap other savings on the company-paid portion of Medicare taxes.\n\nTrump reported $900 million in losses, preparer says\n\nTrump’s personal taxes were not at issue in the trial, but they did come up during the testimony of Donald Bender, a partner at international audit and tax advisory firm Mazars, the company that previously prepared the corporate tax returns for dozens of Trump’s companies.\n\nBender, who previously prepared the personal tax returns for Trump and his wife, Melania Trump, told jurors that Trump reported tax losses for the decade from 2009 through 2018. The losses included a total of $900 million in 2009 and 2010, said Bender.\n\nThe red ink stemmed from operating losses at some of the many businesses Trump owns under the corporate umbrella of the Trump Organization, Bender testified.\n\nWhat are Republicans saying about Trump's taxes?\n\nThe top Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas, accused Democrats of “unleashing a dangerous new political weapon,” setting a precedent that “jeopardizes the privacy of every American.\"\n\n“Going forward, partisans in Congress have nearly unlimited power to target political enemies by obtaining and making public their private tax returns to embarrass and destroy them,” he said in a statement. “This is not limited to public officials, but can target private citizens, business and labor leaders, and Supreme Court justices.”\n\nHow did Democrats get the records?\n\nHouse Democrats officially requested copies of Trump’s tax returns from the IRS in 2019. It was the first such demand for a sitting president’s taxes in 45 years and kicked off a protracted court battle that culminated in a Supreme Court decision last month not to intervene.\n\nTrump had asked the court in October to stop the IRS from giving the returns to the committee, arguing that the committee’s request for the returns “has nothing to do with funding or staffing issues at the IRS and everything to do with releasing the president’s tax information to the public.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court, after temporarily delaying the action, denied Trump’s request late last month, and the Treasury Department turned over the returns.\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nTrump refused to release copies of his tax returns when he ran for president, saying they were under audit. Trump is the only major presidential candidate to refuse to release financial information since Richard Nixon, whose taxes were an issue during the Watergate scandal of 1972-74.\n\nA long-running dispute:Q&A: What we know (and don't know) about Trump's taxes\n\nIn its 2020 report, the New York Times reported that he paid only $750 in personal federal income taxes in 2016 and 2017.\n\nTrump at that time called the report “fake news” and said that he would release them when the audit was finished. To date, he has not released any of his personal tax records. “Actually I paid the tax, and you'll see them as soon as my tax returns are done,\" Trump told reporters at the White House in 2020. \"It's under audit. They've been under audit for a long time. The IRS does not treat me well.\"\n\nTrump has also argued that the public is not entitled to his tax returns and bragged about efforts to reduce his tax bills. During the 2016 presidential campaign, when Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton criticized Trump for not paying more in taxes, the future president responded: \"That makes me smart.\"\n\nGo deeper:\n\nTrump-approved tax scheme:Prosecutor: Evidence shows Trump 'explicitly' sanctioned alleged tax fraud scheme at two companies\n\nTrump and his taxes:Trump says he still can't share returns after report he paid only $750 in income taxes in 2016 and 2017\n\nWhat's been out:Top seven revelations from New York Times report on Trump income taxes\n\nTrump request on taxes denied:Supreme Court rejects Donald Trump request to block release of tax returns to House panel", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/12/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/donald-trump-investigations-lawsuits/index.html", "title": "The notable legal clouds that continue to hang over Donald Trump ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAll eyes are on former President Donald Trump, whose third White House bid has already become mired in controversy.\n\nProsecutors, investigators and lawmakers in Washington, DC, New York, Georgia, Florida and across the United States are among those interested in what Trump has to say about the myriad legal issues facing the former president, his business and his allies.\n\nMultiple federal and state investigations are ongoing regarding the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, his handling of sensitive government documents and his family business.\n\nTrump and his company deny any wrongdoing or criminality in all matters, state and federal, and has aggressively maintained his innocence.\n\nHere’s an updated list of notable investigations, lawsuits and controversies:\n\nTax returns: House Democrats win court battle to view documents\n\nThe House Ways and Means Committee finally got access to the former president’s tax returns after the Supreme Court dealt a massive defeat to Trump, paving the way for the Internal Revenue Service to hand over the documents to the Democratic-led House.\n\nA federal appeals court sided with a House Ways and Means Committee request – originally made in 2019 – to obtain the returns, upholding a ruling from a Trump-nominated district court judge.\n\nTrump appealed to the Supreme Court, which rejected his appeal with no noted dissents.\n\nHouse Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, a Massachusetts Democrat, first sought the tax returns from the IRS in 2019, and the agency, under the Trump administration, initially resisted turning them over. The case moved slowly until 2021, when, under the Biden administration, the Justice Department changed its legal posture and concluded the IRS was obligated to comply with the committee’s request.\n\nMar-a-Lago documents: Did Trump mishandle classified material?\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland has appointed special counsel Jack Smith to oversee the Justice Department criminal investigations into the retention of national defense information at Trump’s resort and parts of the January 6, 2021, insurrection.\n\nThe Justice Department investigation continues into whether documents from the Trump White House were illegally mishandled when they were brought to Mar-a-Lago in Florida after he left office. A federal grand jury in Washington has been empaneled and has interviewed potential witnesses to how Trump handled the documents.\n\nRELATED: The big numbers from the Mar-a-Lago search\n\nThe National Archives, charged with collecting and sorting presidential material, has previously said that at least 15 boxes of White House records were recovered from Mar-a-Lago – including some classified records.\n\nAny unauthorized retention or destruction of White House documents could violate a criminal law that prohibits the removal or destruction of official government records, legal experts told CNN.\n\n2020 election and January 6: House select committee\n\nThe House select committee investigating the US Capitol attack has uncovered dramatic evidence of Trump’s actions before and on January 6, especially efforts to use the levers of government to overturn the election.\n\nThe committee is expected to issue a report and to vote on whether to make criminal referrals to the Justice Department later this month, marking the end of its investigation.\n\nDuring the panel’s hearings this summer, fingers were pointed at GOP lawmakers and Trump allies who tried to help overturn the election and Trump White House officials who failed to stop the former president’s actions.\n\nThe House panel and Trump are also enmeshed in a legal fight over whether the former president must comply with a subpoena for documents and his testimony.\n\n2020 election and January 6: US Justice Department\n\nThe Justice Department has an investigation of its own into the post-2020 election period.\n\nWhile DOJ has not acted publicly during the so-called quiet period leading up to the midterms, a grand jury in Washington has been hearing from witnesses.\n\nRecently, DOJ moved to compel additional testimony from former White House counsel Pat Cipollone and deputy White House counsel Patrick Philbin.\n\nTrump has been fighting to keep former advisers from testifying about certain conversations, citing executive and attorney-client privileges to keep information confidential or slow down criminal investigators.\n\n2020 Election: Efforts to overturn Georgia results\n\nFulton County, Georgia, District Attorney Fani Willis is overseeing a special grand jury investigating what Trump or his allies may have done in their efforts to overturn President Joe Biden’s victory in Georgia.\n\nThe probe was launched last year following Trump’s call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, in which he pushed the Republican to “find” votes to overturn the election results.\n\nWillis, a Democrat, has also informed all 16 of the individuals who signed an “unofficial electoral certificate,” which was ultimately sent to the National Archives in late 2020, that they may be indicted in the probe.\n\nThe investigation may be drawing closer to Trump as well. Former New York City Mayor and Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani has appeared before the grand jury, as has Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp. Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham lost a court bid to avoid testifying.\n\nWillis had pledged to wait until after the midterms to make announcements about possible charges.\n\n2020 Election: Fake GOP electors\n\nThe Justice Department, meanwhile, is looking at an aspect of a plot to put forward fake GOP electors from seven states.\n\nFake certificates were created by Trump allies in Georgia, Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Nevada and New Mexico, who sought to replace valid presidential electors from their states with a pro-Trump slate.\n\nTrump Organization convicted of criminal tax fraud\n\nTrump’s namesake business, the Trump Organization, was convicted this week by a New York jury of tax fraud, grand larceny and falsifying business records in what prosecutors allege was a 15-year scheme to defraud tax authorities by failing to report and pay taxes on compensation provided to employees.\n\nManhattan prosecutors told a jury the case is about “greed and cheating,” laying out an alleged 15-year scheme within the Trump Organization to pay high-level executives in perks like luxury cars and apartments without paying taxes on them.\n\nFormer Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg pleaded guilty to his role in the tax scheme this summer. He testified in the trial but did not cooperate with prosecutors.\n\nTrump Organization: NY attorney general investigation\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James, after a lengthy investigation, sued Trump, three of his adult children and the Trump Organization in September, alleging they were involved in an expansive fraud lasting over a decade that the former president used to enrich himself.\n\nJames alleged the fraud touched all aspects of the Trump business, including its properties and golf courses. According to the lawsuit, the Trump Organization deceived lenders, insurers and tax authorities by inflating the value of his properties using misleading appraisals.\n\nJames is seeking $250 million in allegedly ill-gotten funds.\n\nRetired Judge Barbara Jones has been named to serve as a monitor over the company. James said one is needed to prevent the real estate company from continuing what the state has alleged is a decade-long fraud.\n\nTrump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and has called the investigation politically motivated based on James’ electoral ambitions.\n\nA trial is set for October 2023.\n\nTrump Organization: NY DA criminal investigation\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg inherited that office’s probe into Trump’s businesses, but it has slowed significantly.\n\nProsecutors were focusing on the accuracy of the Trump Organization’s financial statements when seeking financing, people familiar with the matter have told CNN.\n\nEarlier this year, Carey Dunne and Mark Pomerantz, two senior prosecutors on the team, resigned after Bragg informed them that he wasn’t prepared to move forward with criminal charges, CNN’s Kara Scannell has reported.\n\nA special grand jury hearing evidence in the case expired in April, but a new one could be seated in the future.\n\nBragg has maintained the investigation is ongoing and prosecutors are reviewing new evidence. He said he will issue a public statement or an indictment when it’s completed.\n\nJanuary 6: Lawsuits by police officers\n\nSeveral members of the US Capitol Police and Washington, DC, Metropolitan Police are suing Trump, saying his words and actions incited the riot.\n\nThe various cases accuse Trump of directing assault and battery; aiding and abetting assault and battery; and violating local Washington, DC, laws that prohibit incitement of riots and disorderly conduct.\n\nA federal judge in February said Trump’s statements to his supporters before the riot are “the essence of civil conspiracy,” and lawsuits by the police officers have been allowed to proceed.\n\nTrump and his top advisers have not been charged with any crimes. Trump and others who are sued have argued they are not responsible for the actions of the people who stormed the Capitol.\n\nA federal appeals court this week heard Trump’s attempt to throw out the cases.\n\nE. Jean Carroll: Defamation suit over Trump’s denial of rape claims\n\nMagazine writer E. Jean Carroll alleged Trump raped her in a New York department store dressing room in the mid 1990s and defamed her when he denied the rape, said she was not his “type” and alleged she made the claim to boost sales of her book.\n\nTrump and the Justice Department said Trump was a federal employee and his statements denying Carroll’s allegations were made in response to reporters’ questions while he was at the White House. They argue the Justice Department should be substituted as the defendant, which, because the government cannot be sued for defamation, would end the lawsuit.\n\nIn September, a federal appeals court in New York ruled that Trump was a federal employee when he denied Carroll’s claim of rape and sexual assault.\n\nEarly next year, the Washington, DC, appeals court will determine if Trump was acting within the scope of his employment when he made the allegedly defamatory statements. Meanwhile, the judge overseeing the lawsuit has set a trial for early February.\n\nCarroll has also sued Trump for battery and defamation.\n\nMichael Cohen: Claims of retaliation against Trump and Barr – Trump victory\n\nTrump’s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, sued Trump, former Attorney General William Barr and others, alleging they put him back in jail to prevent him from promoting his upcoming book while under home confinement.\n\nCohen was serving the remainder of his sentence for lying to Congress and campaign violations at home, due to Covid-19 concerns, when he started an anti-Trump social media campaign in summer 2020. In retaliation, Cohen said he was sent back to prison and spent 16 days in solitary.\n\nA federal judge on November 14 threw out the lawsuit. District Judge Lewis Liman said he was empathetic to Cohen’s position but said Supreme Court precedent bars him from allowing the case to move forward.\n\nMary Trump: Accusations of deception regarding inheritance – Trump victory\n\nIn 2020, Mary Trump sued her uncle Donald Trump, his sister Maryanne Trump Barry, a retired judge, and the executor of her late uncle Robert Trump’s estate, alleging “they designed and carried out a complex scheme to siphon funds away from her interests, conceal their grift, and deceive her about the true value of what she had inherited.”\n\nOn November 14, a New York state judge threw out the lawsuit, saying that Mary Trump’s claims are barred by an earlier settlement she reached over 20 years ago.\n\nMary Trump has appealed the ruling.\n\nPersonal retaliation: Peter Strzok lawsuit\n\nFormer top FBI counter-intelligence official Peter Strzok, who was terminated by the FBI in 2018 after the revelation of anti-Trump texts Strzok exchanged with a top lawyer at the bureau, Lisa Page, has sued DOJ alleging he was improperly terminated. Strzok is now seeking to depose Trump for the case, though the judge has not said yet how she’ll rule on a DOJ request to block the deposition.\n\nStrzok and Page were constant targets of verbal attacks by Trump and his allies as part of the larger ire Trump expressed toward the FBI during the Trump-Russia investigation. Trump repeatedly and publicly called for Strzok’s ouster until Strzok was fired in August 2018.\n\nPersonal retaliation: Alexander Vindman – Trump allies victory\n\nA federal judge recently dismissed a lawsuit from star Trump impeachment witness Alexander Vindman, who had accused Donald Trump Jr., Rudy Giuliani and former Trump White House staffers of smearing him so that he lost his federal job. Former President Trump was not named in the suit.\n\nVindman alleged the defendants conspired against him to cause him harm after Trump’s first impeachment proceeding.\n\nJudge James Boasberg of the DC District Court wrote that Vindman wasn’t able to show the group worked together with the “specific goal of intimidating Vindman from testifying or performing his job” or injure him by taking unlawful action.\n\nTrump-filed lawsuits: Hillary Clinton, Democrats, ex-FBI officials and more\n\nA federal judge in September dismissed Trump’s lawsuit against Hillary Clinton, the Democratic National Committee, several ex-FBI officials and more than two dozen other people and entities that he claims conspired to undermine his 2016 campaign by trying to vilify him with fabricated information tying him to Russia.\n\n“What (Trump’s lawsuit) lacks in substance and legal support it seeks to substitute with length, hyperbole, and the settling of scores and grievances,” US District Judge Donald Middlebrooks wrote.\n\nTrump is appealing the decision, but Middlebrooks this month also ordered Trump lawyers Alina Habba, Michael Madaio, Peter Ticktin, Jamie Alan Sasson and their law firms to pay $50,000 in penalties to the court and $16,274.23 in legal fees to Charles Dolan, one of more than two dozen people or entities named as defendants in the lawsuit.\n\nTrump-filed lawsuits: The New York Times, Mary Trump and CNN\n\nThe former president is suing his niece and The New York Times in New York state court over the disclosure of his tax information.\n\nDonald Trump’s lawsuit – which is seeking “damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but believed to be no less than One Hundred Million Dollars” – alleges that Mary Trump’s disclosure of the tax information to the Times amounted to an illegal breach of contract, among other claims, because the disclosure allegedly violated the 2001 settlement agreement among the Trump family.\n\nThe Times has planned to fight the lawsuit.\n\n“The Times’s coverage of Donald Trump’s taxes helped inform the public through meticulous reporting on a subject of overriding public interest,” the Times said in a statement. “This lawsuit is an attempt to silence independent news organizations and we plan to vigorously defend against it.”\n\nDonald Trump also sued CNN last month in a southern Florida court, accusing the network of a “campaign of dissuasion in the form of libel and slander” that “escalated in recent months.”\n\nA CNN spokesperson declined to comment on the lawsuit.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Dan Berman"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/21/politics/january-6-committee-subpoena-donald-trump/index.html", "title": "January 6 committee announces it has sent a subpoena to former ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol announced on Friday that the panel has officially sent a subpoena to former President Donald Trump as it paints him as the central figure in the multi-step plan to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe committee issued the subpoena to try to compel Trump to sit for a deposition under oath and to provide documents. The panel is ordering Trump turn over documents by November 4 and either appear in person or virtually for “one or more days of deposition testimony beginning on or about November 14.”\n\nTrump’s attorneys said Friday afternoon that they will review the subpoena “and respond as appropriate to this unprecedented action.”\n\nWhile it is not clear if Trump will comply with the subpoena, the action serves as a way for the committee to set down a marker and make clear they want information directly from Trump as the panel investigates the attack. Trump could also fight the subpoena in court, possibly setting up a hugely significant battle that could go to the highest level of the nation’s Judicial Branch, but it’s also possible such a legal challenge would outlast the committee’s mandate.\n\nAhead of the subpoena’s release, the committee’s vice chairwoman, Republican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming said at a Harvard event earlier this week she assumes Trump will fulfill his legal obligation and honor the committee’s subpoena, “but if that doesn’t happen, then we’ll take the steps we need to take after that, but I don’t want to go too far down that path at this point.”\n\nUnlike with previous subpoena announcements, the committee released on Friday the entire subpoena it sent to Trump along with the documents it is requesting.\n\n“As demonstrated in our hearings, we have assembled overwhelming evidence, including from dozens of your former appointees and staff, that you personally orchestrated and oversaw a multi-part effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election and to obstruct the peaceful transition of power,” Cheney and Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the committee’s chairman, write in the subpoena letter.\n\nThe panel summarizes what it presented in its hearings to demonstrate why it believes Trump “personally orchestrated and oversaw” the efforts to overturn the election.\n\nIt says Trump “purposely and maliciously” disseminated false claims that the 2020 election was stolen in order to help his plan to overturn the election and to solicit contributions. The committee paints Trump as “orchestrating and overseeing” the effort to obtain false state electors. On pressure campaigns Trump enacted, the panel highlight says Trump attempted to “corrupt the Department of Justice,” by getting officials to make “false statements,” illegally pressured state officials to change election results, pressured former Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to count electoral votes on January 6 “despite knowing specifically that it was illegal,” and pressured members of Congress to object to valid electors.\n\nTrump’s attorney David Warrington released a statement Friday afternoon, saying, “We are going to be handling this matter as counsel for President Donald J. Trump. We understand that, once again, flouting norms and appropriate and customary process, the Committee has publicly released a copy of its subpoena. As with any similar matter, we will review and analyze it, and will respond as appropriate to this unprecedented action.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Trump reacts to committee's unanimous vote to subpoena him 01:54 - Source: CNN\n\nThe former president posted a lengthy response criticizing the committee on Truth Social after members voted unanimously to subpoena him but did not say whether he would comply. Trump also recently shared a Fox story on Truth Social that claimed he “loves the idea of testifying.” But Trump could also fight the subpoena in court, and such a legal challenge would likely outlast the committee’s mandate.\n\nIn its subpoena, the committee specifically demands Trump turn over any communications, sent or received during the period of November 3, 2020, to January 20, 2021, with more than a dozen of his close allies who have emerged as key players in the broader plan to overturn the 2020 election:\n\nThe panel’s request for communications includes Trump’s Signal communications. The committee also notes that it wants Trump to testify about his interactions with several individuals, including people on the same list, who invoked their Fifth Amendment rights when questioned by the committee about their dealings with the former President.\n\n“This subpoena calls for testimony regarding your dealings with multiple individuals who have now themselves invoked their Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination regarding their communications with you, including Roger Stone, Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, U.S. Army (Retired), John Eastman, Jeffrey Clark and Kelli Ward,” the committee wrote in a letter to Trump.\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat who serves on the committee, was asked Friday if she and her colleagues are open to the former President testifying before the panel. She told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on “The Situation Room” that it’s “subject to negotiation,” but reiterated that Trump must respond to the subpoena first.\n\n“We asked for the documents first, so that we can consider what additional questions we may wish to pose to him,” Lofgren added.\n\nThe House committee latest public hearing, where members voted to subpoena him, served as a closing argument to the American public ahead of the midterm election that Trump is at the center of the multifaceted plot to overturn the 2020 presidential election.\n\n“It is our obligation to seek Donald Trump’s testimony,” Thompson said ahead of the subpoena vote during the hearing.\n\nCheney said during the hearing that seeking Trump’s testimony under oath remains “a key task” because several witnesses closest to the former President invoked their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in response to their interactions with Trump.\n\n“We are obligated to seek answers directly from the man who set this all in motion,” Cheney said, referring to Trump.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Annie Grayer Zachary Cohen Sara Murray", "Annie Grayer", "Zachary Cohen", "Sara Murray"], "publish_date": "2022/10/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/13/politics/trump-subpoena-jan-6-committee-what-matters/index.html", "title": "Trump subpoenaed by Jan 6 committee.

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe House January 6 committee took the extraordinary and theatrical step of voting to subpoena former President Donald Trump on Thursday.\n\nA coda to its public hearings, the subpoena might not lead to Trump’s testimony and handing over of documents, but it will act as a teaser for what’s to come.\n\nRELATED: 7 takeaways from the January 6 hearing\n\nThe committee still has a report to publish and could also request that the Justice Department pursue charges against Trump or his former aides for their roles in helping to incite the attack on the Capitol and their efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nAs the subject of a congressional subpoena, it must be painfully clear to Trump that he is a former president. Just another citizen. The kind who can be issued a subpoena.\n\n“They are trying to make the case that Trump is Oz,” said CNN’s John King, interpreting the committee’s subpoena of Trump. “He presents himself as all powerful, but when you look, it’s actually a little guy behind a curtain trying to pull a machine.”\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nTrump could decide to comply. The committee would then negotiate a time, place and method. That would take time.\n\nIf he refuses to comply with the subpoena, here’s what could happen:\n\nContempt. The full House, which is controlled by Democrats until at least January, could vote to hold him in contempt of Congress, something it’s done with several other uncooperative witnesses.\n\nReferral. After a contempt of Congress referral, the Justice Department could then prosecute, as it did with Trump’s former aide After a contempt of Congress referral, the Justice Department could then prosecute, as it did with Trump’s former aide Steve Bannon and plans to do with his once economic adviser Peter Navarro.\n\nProsecution. If found guilty, as Bannon was, Trump could theoretically face a minimum of 30 days in jail. Bannon will be sentenced for failing to comply with the House subpoena later this month.\n\nThis sequence of events seems far-fetched for Trump.\n\n“None of that is going to happen,” the Trump critic and conservative lawyer George Conway predicted during an appearance on CNN Thursday. “This is about laying a marker. This is about triggering a response (from Trump).”\n\nTrump responded on social media, calling the committee a “BUST” and a “laughing stock” and accusing members of dividing the country.\n\nConway did point out the Supreme Court has already made clear where it stands on Trump’s status as a former president when it ignored his attempt to block the National Archives from sharing information with the committee.\n\nThe court, notably, also declined on Thursday to intervene on Trump’s behalf in the Mar-a-Lago classified documents inquiry.\n\nOther investigations\n\nBut the Justice Department, rather than go after Trump for ignoring congressional subpoena, if it comes to that, has arguably larger and more important inquiries that involve his treatment of classified documents after he left the White House and his effort to overturn the election as president.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming said the January 6 committee feels it has enough information to make referrals to the Department of Justice for prosecutions stemming from the committee’s work. And she noted that more than 30 witnesses have invoked Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination with regard to their dealings with the former President.\n\nCheney, who serves as vice chair of the House committee, singled out people who invoked the Fifth Amendment or refused to testify rather than elaborate on their communications with Trump on January 6, 2021, including:\n\nRoger Stone, the provocateur and Trump confidante who helped organize some events that day. Trump previously pardoned Stone in a different matter.\n\nAnother recipient of Trump’s pardon, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, who fueled conspiracy theories after the 2020 election.\n\nThe mastermind of Trump’s plan to overturn the Electoral College count, John Eastman.\n\nTrump’s ally at the Justice Department, Jeffrey Clark, and Trump’s then-Chief of Staff Mark Meadows.\n\nPresidents who gave congressional testimony\n\nWhile presidents and former presidents have testified before congressional committees, they’ve always done so voluntarily.\n\nMost recently, in 1974, Gerald Ford testified voluntarily as president before a House subcommittee about his decision to pardon former President Richard Nixon.\n\nFord later testified as a former president in 1983 to a Senate subcommittee. That hearing, 39 years ago, was the last time a president took questions from lawmakers in the committee setting, according to the Senate Historical Office and Senate Library.\n\nPresidents who were subpoenaed\n\nSubpoena served on Thomas Jefferson to testify at Aaron Burr's trial for treason on June 13, 1807. Library of Congress\n\nPresident Thomas Jefferson declined to appear at former Vice President Aaron Burr’s trial for treason even though he was subpoenaed by then-Chief Justice John Marshall. Jefferson did ultimately provide some documents. Burr was eventually acquitted.\n\nPresident Bill Clinton sidestepped a subpoena by voluntarily appearing before Whitewater investigators.\n\nNixon’s resignation from the presidency made his Watergate subpoena moot.\n\nBut Trump is no longer president\n\nThe case with Trump is very different. For starters, it is a congressional committee, not a court or a prosecutor issuing the subpoena.\n\nAlso, Trump is no longer president.\n\nBack when he was president, the Supreme Court punted in 2020 when it sent a dispute over House subpoenas for Trump’s financial records back to lower courts. Justices told lower courts to consider separation of powers even in cases involving the president’s private information. The House Oversight Committee recently reached an agreement with Trump to get access to the documents.\n\nThe Supreme Court did rule New York investigators could get access to the financial documents. Trump’s company will go on criminal trial this month on charges of violating tax laws.\n\nTrump testified in a civil case. He took the Fifth\n\nIf Trump testifies to House investigators, it would actually be his second time answering questions before lawyers this year.\n\nA judge forced him to comply with subpoenas from New York Attorney General Letitia James as part of her civil inquiry into his business practices. He invoked the Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination during that deposition.\n\nTrump, his three oldest children and the Trump Organization were subsequently sued by James. On Thursday, James asked a state court to block Trump from moving assets to shield them from the lawsuit.\n\nAll of those battles have dragged on for years, a timetable that the House January 6 committee doesn’t have. The Justice Department will not publicly engage in any activity this close to an election, and voters could well hand control of the House to Republicans in November.\n\nThat means the January 6 committee must plan to wrap up all of its work by January 3, 2023, when the next Congress begins and the January 6 committee may be no more.", "authors": ["Zachary B.

No other justices made an objection public.\n\nThe Biden White House supports releasing the records to the committee, after determining the disclosure is in the nation’s best interest and declining to assert executive privilege.\n\n“The Supreme Court’s action tonight is a victory for the rule of law and American democracy,” Reps. Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, and Liz Cheney, a Wyoming Republican – who are chair and vice chair of the panel – said in a joint statement Wednesday. “The Select Committee has already begun to receive records that the former President had hoped to keep hidden and we look forward to additional productions regarding this important information.”\n\nThe select committee is seeking more than 700 pages of disputed documents as it explores Trump’s role in trying to overturn the 2020 presidential election. That includes his appearance at a January 6 rally in which he directed followers to go to the US Capitol where lawmakers were set to certify the election results and “fight” for their county.\n\nThe documents include activity logs, schedules, speech notes and three pages of handwritten notes from then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows – paperwork that could reveal goings-on inside the West Wing as Trump supporters gathered in Washington and then overran the Capitol, disrupting the certification of the 2020 vote.\n\nTrump is also seeking to keep secret a draft proclamation honoring two police officers who died in the siege and memos and other documents about supposed election fraud and efforts to overturn Trump’s loss of the presidency, the National Archives has said in court documents.\n\nWhite House spokesman Mike Gwin said in a statement after the ruling that Trump’s “actions represented a unique and existential threat to our democracy, and President Biden has been clear that these events require a full investigation to ensure that what we saw on January 6th can never happen again. Today’s ruling by the Supreme Court is an important step forward in that process, and in ensuring accountability for an unprecedented assault on our democracy and the rule of law.”\n\nThe National Archives and lawyers for Trump have not responded to CNN inquiries about the Supreme Court’s order.\n\nThe move effectively moots former Trump’s pending appeal in the case that centered on keeping the documents secret. Lawyers for Trump say the documents are sensitive and privileged records.\n\n“The disagreement between an incumbent President and his predecessor from a rival political party is both novel and highlights the importance of executive privilege and the ability of Presidents and their advisers to reliably make and receive full and frank advice, without concern that communications will be publicly released to meet a political objective,” Trump’s lawyer, Jesse R. Binnall told the justices.\n\nHe stressed that Congress had no valid legislative purpose for requesting the documents. “Congress may not rifle through the confidential presidential papers of a former President to meet political objections,” Binnall added.\n\nBut the Biden administration argued that withholding the records based on executive privilege is not in the interest of the United States. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar said that in light of the “extraordinary events” of January 6, President Joe Biden had decided that that an assertion of executive privilege is “not justified.”\n\nA federal appeals court ruled against Trump, holding that he “has provided no basis for this court to override President Biden’s judgment and the agreement and accommodations worked out between the Political Branches over these documents.”\n\nThe court noted that the events “marked the most significant assault on the Capitol since the War of 1812,” but agreed to freeze its ruling until the Supreme Court acted.\n\n“Under any of the tests advocated by former President Trump, the profound interests in disclosure advanced by President Biden and the January 6th Committee far exceed his generalized concerns for Executive Branch confidentiality,” the panel of the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit wrote.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Supreme Court cited part of that sentence. “Because the Court of Appeals concluded that President Trump’s claims would have failed even if he were the incumbent, his status as a former President necessarily made no difference to the court’s decision,” the Supreme Court said.\n\n“Tonight’s ruling is a major setback for former President Trump in his efforts to block the National Archives from turning over documents to the January 6 Committee,” said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law. “Although the justices did not rule on whether the court of appeals correctly rejected his suit, by not blocking the handing over now, the justices have allowed that ruling to be the final word.”\n\nImplications for the House investigation\n\nThe Supreme Court’s order is a major blow to Trump, at a moment when the select committee is gaining steam as it gathers information from hundreds of witnesses and communications providers.\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren, a member of the panel, said Wednesday that she expects the committee will get the records from the Trump White House “very promptly” and called the ruling “a very big deal for getting the truth out.”\n\n“I was glad to see the court respected the decision made by the appellate court,” she told CNN’s Erin Burnett on “Out Front.” Asked about the four pages of Trump documents that were set to be released from the National Archives on Wednesday, Lofgren said the panel has “not yet had a chance to look at it, but yes, the material is starting to flow in.”\n\nWednesday’s order could also send a signal to other witnesses that they have very little ability to challenge January 6-related subpoenas on executive privilege grounds, potentially opening the possibility for more former White House officials to testify.\n\nThe Supreme Court left unresolved key questions about an ex-President’s ability to claim executive privilege – claims that top advisers of Trump have used to refuse or to hold off on testifying to the House.\n\nCurrently, former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows is challenging subpoenas from the January 6 committee, in part because he said the questions about Trump’s ability to assert privilege in the investigation as a former President remain unsettled. He also faces a five-week-old criminal contempt referral from the House to the Justice Department, though the DOJ has not filed any criminal charges.\n\nThe DC Circuit’s opinion in the Trump case last month undermined some of Meadows’ arguments, but now the Supreme Court has scaled back the reach of that appellate opinion, saying that the DC Circuit’s discussion of his status as a former president is not binding precedent.\n\nKavanaugh statement\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh, writing alone, said that he agreed with the court’s decision to reject Trump’s request, noting that the order was not based on Trump’s status as a former President.\n\nBut in a statement accompanying the court’s ruling, the Trump nominee said he didn’t agree with a suggestion by the appeals court that a former President may not invoke privilege over documents that occurred during his presidency.\n\n“I respectfully disagree with the Court of Appeals on that point,” Kavanaugh said. “A former president must be able to successfully invoke the Presidential communications privilege for communications that occurred during his Presidency even if the current President does not support the privilege claim,” he said.\n\nKavanaugh added, however, that to say that a former President can invoke privilege over such communications “does not mean that the privilege is absolute or cannot be overcome.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Ariane De Vogue Katelyn Polantz Tierney Sneed", "Ariane De Vogue", "Katelyn Polantz", "Tierney Sneed"], "publish_date": "2022/01/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/23/politics/donald-trump-rough-day-in-court-analysis/index.html", "title": "Analysis: Donald Trump's rough day in court ends with a double ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nDonald Trump had a bad day in court on Tuesday – or, more accurately, courts.\n\nThe former president absorbed a stunning defeat at the Supreme Court over his long-running campaign to hide his tax returns, which are now set to land before a Democratic-run House committee. Republican-appointed appeals court judges, meanwhile, appeared cool to his latest bid to slow the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case. A New York judge set an October 2023 trial date for the state’s $250 million case alleging fraud against Trump, three of his children and his organization, which will fall just before Republican presidential primary season. And as the hangover lingers from his false claims of fraud in 2020, Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham testified to a Georgia grand jury probing the ex-president’s alleged election stealing bid.\n\nGiven Trump’s massive legal exposure, and habit of using the courts’ deliberative pace to postpone accountability, it’s not unusual for him to have a tough time on the same day in simultaneously running cases.\n\nBut Tuesday’s developments marked the first time that the legal chaos and jeopardy that surround him has come fully into focus since he declared his third bid for the Republican presidential nomination last week. It’s the first test of whether the swirling courtroom peril facing him on multiple fronts will detract from his capacity to mount a credible campaign and whether it will put off GOP primary voters who may consider an alternative candidate.\n\nSeveral developments on Tuesday – including in the documents case and the reality that Trump’s tax returns will soon make it into the hands of Democrats weeks before Republicans take control of the House – suggest two consistent Trump legal strategies may begin to fray. The first is his contention that he, as an ex-president, deserves different treatment under the law than other American citizens. The second is that his delay, delay, delay approach may be reaching the limits of its utility. Still, the former president has long managed to keep scandals that might have felled other politicians at arm’s length. And he is sure to leverage fresh twists in the cases to bolster the persecution narrative that is central to his new campaign for the White House.\n\nBut outgoing Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who is also considering a 2024 Republican presidential primary campaign, said on CNN on Tuesday that the fresh evidence of turmoil surrounding Trump could be a turn-off for GOP voters.\n\n“It’s dizzying for the public to see this kind of chaos surrounding a candidate for president,” Hutchinson told CNN’s Brianna Keilar. “To me, it’s very problematic and just is reflective of all of the challenges that go with a Trump candidacy.”\n\nTrump reaches end of road in tax fight\n\nTrump’s refusal to follow precedent by showing the public his tax returns during the 2016 presidential campaign was one of the first signs of his determination to shatter norms. So the Supreme Court’s decision not to block the Internal Revenue Service from releasing his tax documents to the House Ways and Means Committee represented a significant personal defeat, as well as a political one.\n\nThe Democratic leadership of the committee says it wants the returns to decide whether there is a case for changes to tax laws regarding sitting presidents. The possibility of hidden conflicts of interests or obligations owed by presidents or missed or under payments on such returns could be problematic given a chief executive’s power in setting tax policy. A lower court had previously found that the committee had a legitimate legislative purpose for seeing the returns. But with only a few weeks left before Republicans take over the House, it is unclear how much time Democrats would have to examine the returns or potentially make changes to the law.\n\nIt’s also not a certainty that the public will get to see the returns Trump has long tried to shield. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, a Texas Democrat who sits on the committee, told CNN’s Erin Burnett on Tuesday that the documents were subject to privacy protections. But he also said the panel did have the option of releasing the documents publicly and that “the time pressure here creates an added reason to consider doing that.”\n\nOn the substance of the case, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, a Massachusetts Democrat, said that the Supreme Court had upheld a vital norm. “Since the Magna Carta, the principle of oversight has been upheld, and today is no different. This rises above politics, and the committee will now conduct the oversight that we’ve sought for the last three and a half years.”\n\nBut the top Republican on the committee, Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas, warned that by stepping aside, the court established a precedent that would mean that no citizen could be safe from a majority political party.\n\n“By effectively granting the majority party in either chamber of Congress nearly unlimited power to target and make public the tax returns of political enemies – political figures, private citizens, or even justices of the Supreme Court themselves – they are opening a dangerous new political battleground where no citizen is safe,” Brady said in a statement.\n\nOne interesting wrinkle will be whether Trump’s loss in the tax returns fight will influence how future Republican presidential candidates will deal with their financial records. By releasing them, they could not just reestablish a modern tradition of transparency for presidents. They could potentially outflank Trump.\n\nBad signs for the ex-president in documents case appeal\n\nTrump’s other major disappointment came in the Mar-a-Lago documents matter, with the major protections the ex-president secured from a lower court judge in Florida now appearing in jeopardy. The DOJ is investigating the ex-president for potential obstruction of justice, criminal handling of government records and violations of the Espionage Act, which prohibits unauthorized storage of national defense information.\n\nA three-judge panel at the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals expressed skepticism of Trump’s arguments for why he was entitled to a third party, known as a special master, to sift through around 22,000 pages of materials taken from his Florida resort. A key question at issue here is whether Trump, as a former president, is entitled to the kind of judicial intervention that could slow countless routine legal cases involving other Americans if it were widely adopted.\n\nIn one comment widely noted by legal analysts, the chief of the appellate court, Judge William Pryor, cast doubt on Trump’s arguments.\n\n“We’ve gotta be concerned about the precedent that we would create that would allow any target of offense of a federal criminal investigation to go into district court and to have a district court entertain this kind of petition, exercise equitable jurisdiction (that allows a court to intervene) and interfere with the executive branch’s ongoing investigation,” Pryor told Trump lawyer James Trusty.\n\n“Other than the fact that this involves a former president, everything else about this … is indistinguishable,” Pryor told Trusty during the arguments.\n\nAnother judge, Britt Grant, rebuked Trusty for calling the FBI search of Trump’s property “a raid,” as the former president has repeatedly done. “Do you think a raid is the right term for the execution of a warrant?” Grant asked. Trusty apologized for using the “loaded term.”\n\nRyan Goodman, a former special counsel at the Department of Defense, told CNN’s Burnett the court could decide to overrule Judge Aileen Cannon, who appointed the special master, in what would be a severe blow to the ex-president.\n\n“They would basically be saying, you never should have exercised jurisdiction in the first place, Judge Cannon, you didn’t have it,” Goodman said.\n\nAny such move could significantly speed up the documents case after Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed a special counsel to oversee it last week.\n\nIt might also offer the prospect of clarity to the public, who must now evaluate yet another unprecedented political scenario involving Trump. The former president’s multiple legal challenges have slowed both cases, but Tuesday offered signs that each could be moving closer to resolution.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/11/23"}]}

He suggested that future Twitter polls could be restricted to paid users of Twitter Blue, the company’s subscription service.\n\nMusk’s poll asking users whether he should resign as CEO came after a massive backlash to Twitter’s abrupt suspension of several journalists who cover him, as well as Twitter’s decision to ban, and then un-ban, links to other social media platforms including Facebook, Instagram and Mastodon, a fast-growing Twitter rival that has octupled in size since October.\n\nMusk’s brief tenure as CEO has resulted in sweeping, occasionally erratic shifts at one of the world’s most influential social media companies.\n\nUnder his leadership, Twitter has laid off the majority of its staff, alienated major advertisers, welcomed former President Donald Trump back to the platform after his suspension in the wake of the Jan. 6 Capitol riots and released internal communications to journalists about Twitter’s operations before Musk took ownership of the company.\n\nMusk forced remaining employees to take a pledge to become “extremely hardcore” in their work, and stopped enforcing Twitter’s policy against Covid-19 misinformation.\n\nOver a matter of days, Twitter launched, and then was forced to un-launch, a paid verification feature that was instantly manipulated by satirical accounts impersonating verified major brands, athletes and other public figures on the platform.\n\nMusk’s penchant for making major product changes based on little more than informal Twitter polls has highlighted his ad hoc and improvisational management style. But that approach has attracted growing criticism from many Twitter users. Last week, Twitter suspended several journalists who had reported on Musk’s permanent ban of an account that tracked his jet.\n\nGrowing criticism of Musk culminated in Sunday’s poll that served as an effective, if unscientific, referendum on Musk’s handling of the company since he closed his purchase of Twitter in late October.", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/12/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/19/tech/elon-musk-twitter-ceo-poll/index.html", "title": "Elon Musk's poll results are in: He should step down, Twitter voters ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nA Twitter poll created by Elon Musk asking whether he should “step down as head of Twitter” ended early Monday morning with most respondents voting in the affirmative.\n\nMusk had said he would abide by the results of the unscientific poll, which began Sunday evening and concluded with 57.5% voting yes, 42.5% voting no.\n\nMore than 17 million votes were cast in the informal referendum on his chaotic leadership of Twitter, which has been marked by mass layoffs, the replatforming of suspended accounts that had violated Twitter’s rules, the suspension of journalists who cover him and whiplash policy changes made and reversed in real time.\n\nMusk did not immediately react to the outcome of the vote.\n\nHours before launching the poll, Musk was publicly criticized even by some former supporters in the tech industry for a controversial new policy that had banned links to certain other social media platforms. The policy was deleted less than 24 hours after its introduction. Musk also said that “going forward,” he would poll Twitter’s users to let them decide on policy changes.\n\nThe unusual turn of events highlights how Musk has seemingly abandoned a more careful deliberation process in favor of operating by his own whims. Musk, who has a history of erratic behavior and controversial remarks, has recently engaged in an apparent one-way feud with Apple, spread a conspiracy theory about the violent attack on Paul Pelosi, and made at least one decision about who to allow on Twitter based on his own feelings.\n\nMusk’s rhetoric and changes to the platform have created more uncertainty around advertisers, who make up the vast majority of Twitter’s business. Since Musk completed his Twitter takeover in October, a number of brands have paused advertising on the platform. Musk has frequently stated that Twitter’s finances are dire. Twitter is on pace to lose $4 billion a year after the advertiser exodus, estimates Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities.\n\nReplying to a tweet Sunday, in which MIT artificial intelligence researcher Lex Fridman said he would take the CEO job, Musk hinted he hasn’t been completely happy with his new gig.\n\n“You must like pain a lot,” Musk tweeted, noting the company “has been in the fast lane to bankruptcy since May.”\n\nThe poll inspired other volunteers, as well. The rapper Snoop Dogg created his own Twitter poll Sunday evening, asking: “Should I run Twitter?” As of early Monday morning, it had 1.3 million votes with over 80% of respondents saying yes.\n\nYet Musk denied that he has a new CEO in mind.\n\n“No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,” Musk tweeted. “The question is not finding a CEO, the question is finding a CEO who can keep Twitter alive.”\n\nMusk has sold billions of dollars worth of Tesla stock, most likely to pay for his purchase of Twitter. That has sent Tesla’s stock sinking 11% over the past month. But Tesla shares were up 5% in premarket trading after the poll results were revealed.\n\n“This has been a black eye moment for Musk and been a major overhang on Tesla’s stock which continues to suffer in a brutal way since the Twitter soap opera began with brand deterioration related to Musk a real issue,” Ives said in a note to clients Monday.\n\nWith or without the CEO title, however, Musk will almost certainly continue to control the company’s direction.\n\nAfter taking over Twitter, Musk dissolved the company’s board and its C-Suite emptied out. As the sole board director and owner of the company, Musk can appoint the next CEO – and also tell that person what to do in the role.\n\nIn place of Twitter’s former leadership, Musk tapped venture capitalists and friends to work with him as he weighed a number of significant changes to the company. The list includes investor Jason Calacanis, Craft Ventures partner David Sacks and Sriram Krishnan, an Andreessen Horowitz general partner focused on crypto and Twitter’s former consumer teams lead.\n\nSome of those individuals could now be on the shortlist to take over as CEO if Musk makes good on his promise and steps down.\n\nShortly after Musk posted his latest poll, Calacanis posted a poll of his own asking who should become Twitter’s next CEO: himself, Sacks, or Calacanis and Sacks together as co-CEOs.\n\nAs of this publication, a fourth option was winning by a wide margin: “Other.”", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/12/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2022/12/19/elon-musk-polls-twitter-users-whether-he-should-stay-charge/10924009002/", "title": "Elon Musk Twitter poll: Results show users favor CEO stepping down", "text": "More than half of 17.5 million Twitter users who responded to a poll that asked whether Elon Musk should step down as head of the social media platform voted in favor of him doing so, according to results posted Monday morning.\n\nSome 57.5% of them voted \"Yes,\" while 42.5% voted \"No\" against Musk stepping down as chief of the micro-blogging platform after the billionaire launched the poll on his Twitter account Sunday.\n\nNeither Twitter or Musk immediately responded publicly about whether Musk would step down, but the Tesla and SpaceX CEO initially said that he would abide by the results.\n\nMeanwhile, scores of users appeared to be awaiting his response with baited breath.\n\n\"So…Bye?\" one user posted.\n\n\"Doesn't mean immediately right? Could be 3, 6, 9 months from now,\" another asked.\n\nThe move asking users for their opinion comes on the heels of Musk clashing with some users on multiple fronts, including him acknowledging he made a mistake in launching new speech restrictions that banned mentions of rival social media websites.\n\nIn yet another significant policy change, Twitter had announced that users will no longer be able to link to Facebook, Instagram, Mastodon and other platforms the company described as “prohibited.”\n\nThe decision generated so much immediate criticism, including from past defenders of Musk, that he promised not to make any more major policy changes without an online survey of users.\n\nThe action to block competitors was Musk's latest attempt to crack down on certain speech after he shut down a Twitter account last week that was tracking the flights of his private jet.\n\nBanned platforms included Facebook, Instagram, and newly created rivals Mastodon, Tribel, Nostr, Post and former President Donald Trump's Truth Social. Twitter gave no explanation for why the blacklist included those seven websites but not others such as Parler, TikTok or LinkedIn.\n\nWhat is Mastodon? What to know about the decentralized site some see as a Twitter alternative\n\nTikTok bans:Restrictions on the popular video app are spreading across the US\n\nTwitter had said it would at least temporarily suspend accounts that include the banned websites in their profile a practice so widespread it would have been difficult to enforce the restrictions on Twitter's millions of users around the world. Not only links but attempts to bypass the ban by spelling out “instagram dot com” could have led to a suspension, the company said.\n\nA test case was the prominent venture capitalist Paul Graham, who in the past has praised Musk but on Sunday told his 1.5 million Twitter followers that this was the “last straw” and to find him on Mastodon. His Twitter account was promptly suspended, and soon after restored as Musk promised to reverse the policy implemented just hours earlier.\n\nMusk said Twitter will still suspend some accounts according to the policy but “only when that account’s (asterisk)primary(asterisk) purpose is promotion of competitors.”\n\nTwitter previously took action to block links to Mastodon after its main Twitter account tweeted about the @ElonJet controversy last week.\n\nMastodon has grown rapidly in recent weeks as an alternative for Twitter users who are unhappy with Musk’s overhaul of Twitter since he bought the company for $44 billion in late October and began restoring accounts that ran afoul of the previous Twitter leadership's rules against hateful conduct and other harms.\n\nThat social network, which has gained more than 1 million new users since Oct. 27, now hosts 1.9 million monthly active users, according to the Mastodon website.\n\nIn comparison, Twitter had more than 237 million daily active users in the quarter ending June 30, the company said in July. Users were up 16.6% compared to a year ago.\n\n'Assassination coordinates'\n\nLast week, Musk banned the @ElonJet account then changed Twitter's rules to prohibit the sharing of another person’s current location without their consent. He then took aim at journalists who were writing about the jet-tracking account, which can still be found on other social media sites, claiming they were broadcasting “basically assassination coordinates.”\n\nHe also suspend accounts of voluminous journalists who cover Twitter including reporters working for CNN, The New York Times, and The Washington Post. Many of those accounts were restored following an online poll by Musk.\n\nOver the weekend, The Washington Post’s Taylor Lorenz became the latest journalist to be temporarily banned. She said she was suspended after posting a message on Twitter tagging Musk and requesting an interview.\n\nThe paper's executive editor, Sally Buzbeecalled it an “arbitrary suspension of another Post journalist” that further undermined Musk’s promise to run Twitter as a platform dedicated to free speech.\n\nThe promise to let users decide his future role at Twitter through an unscientific online survey appeared to come out of nowhere Sunday, though Musk had also promised in November a reorganization was happening soon.\n\nMusk was questioned in court on Nov. 16 about how he splits his time among his companies. Musk had to testify in Delaware’s Court of Chancery over a shareholder’s challenge to Musk’s potentially $55 billion compensation plan as CEO of the electric car company.\n\nMusk said he never intended to be CEO of Tesla, and that he didn’t want to be chief executive of any other companies either, preferring to see himself as an engineer instead. Musk also said he expected an organizational restructuring of Twitter to be completed in the next week or so. It’s been more than a month since he said that.\n\nIn public banter with Twitter followers Sunday, Musk expressed pessimism about the prospects for a new CEO, saying that person “must like pain a lot” to run a company that “has been in the fast lane to bankruptcy.”\n\n“No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,” Musk tweeted.\n\nContributing: Associated Press writers Matt O'Brien and Brian P. D.

He also heeded user votes in a poll to restore the accounts of tech journalists that he had suspended on Friday.\n\nBut since a clear majority of Twitter users voted for Musk to step down as Twitter CEO in another poll on Sunday, Musk has remained conspicuously (and uncharacteristically) silent. Now, he appears to think the problem isn’t him, but who gets to vote in the polls.\n\nIn a tweet Monday, roughly 12 hours after his CEO poll ended, Musk suggested that he would change how polling on Twitter works so that only those who pay for Twitter’s updated subscription service can vote. After one Twitter user said, “Blue subscribers should be the only ones that can vote in policy related polls,” Musk responded, “Good point. Twitter will make that change.”\n\nWhile it’s unclear how he would restrict voting to only those who pay for the company’s subscription service, such a change could dramatically reduce the number of Twitter users who could vote in polls. It would also skew those who can vote to the users who are willing to pay up for Twitter Blue, which includes the controversial paid verification feature Musk pushed to introduce. Musk’s Monday tweet immediately prompted comparisons to poll taxes.\n\nThe incident is yet another example of the inconsistencies and chaos in Musk’s management of Twitter since acquiring the company in October. After coming under fire this weekend for a controversial new policy restricting users from posting links to rival platforms, Musk pledged to effectively crowdsource “major policy changes” at Twitter by polling users about them and soon launched the poll about whether he should remain as CEO.\n\nNow, Musk appears to be ignoring the results of the CEO poll and looking to overhaul how polls work without first polling users about what is arguably another “major policy change.”\n\nMusk’s poll, and his limited reaction to it so far, could add to the growing uncertainty about his commitment to remaining Twitter’s CEO. Musk has faced criticism from Twitter users and advertisers for his decision to eliminate much of the company’s staff, restore the accounts of a number of incendiary users, and the whiplash from seemingly rushing out new policies and features only to pull them later. The Tesla CEO is also facing pressure from the carmaker’s shareholders to find a replacement at Twitter, after Tesla’s stock has declined significantly this year.\n\nMusk has not directly commented on the user vote that he should step down from running Twitter. Musk said last month that he expects to “reduce my time at Twitter, and find somebody else to run Twitter, over time.” But in a tweet Sunday he said: “No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor.”\n\nCNBC reported Tuesday that Musk is “actively searching” for a new Twitter CEO, citing anonymous sources. Twitter, which recently cut most of its public relations team, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Musk responded to the story on Twitter with two crying laughing emojis.\n\nThe most obvious potential candidates for a new Twitter CEO are the Musk lieutenants who have been helping to run the company since his takeover. The short list likely includes investor Jason Calacanis, Craft Ventures partner David Sacks and Sriram Krishnan, an Andreessen Horowitz general partner focused on crypto and Twitter’s former consumer teams lead.\n\nA range of other wild card candidates have publicly offered to take on the job, including former T-Mobile CEO John Legere and rapper Snoop Dogg.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/12/20"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/958980/elon-musk-told-to-step-down-as-twitter-ceo-by-users", "title": "Twitter users vote for Elon Musk to quit platform | The Week UK", "text": "We will use the details you have shared to manage your registration.

But Tesla’s steep stock selloff this week proved that the problems at Musk’s car company go well beyond Twitter.\n\nEven as Musk signals he may give up his CEO title at Twitter, investors became concerned that the outlook for Tesla’s sales and profit is taking a turn for the worse. A sign of the weakening demand: Tesla has announced a rare sale. The company offered two rebates for buyers who take delivery of a vehicle before the end of the year, initially offering a $3,750 discount earlier this month. Tesla then doubled that rebate to $7,500 Thursday.\n\n“Tesla clearly is starting to see demand cracks in China and in the US at a time that EV competition is increasing across the board,” said Dan Ives, tech analyst with Wedbush Securities and a Tesla bull who cut his price target for the stock Friday from $250 to $175. “The price cuts that Tesla enacted was the straw that broke the camel’s back on the stock.”\n\nAnother reason Tesla’s stock is sinking: The US economy could tip into recession next year, hurting car sales. Musk said on an Twitter Spaces call Thursday he foresees the economy will be in a “serious recession” in 2023.\n\n“I think there is going to be some macro drama that’s higher than people currently think,” he said, according to Reuters, adding that homes and cars will get “disproportionately impacted” by economic conditions.\n\nTesla’s questionable valuation\n\nPart of the problem with Tesla’s stock price is that critics question whether it was ever worth the trillion-dollar valuation it had at the start of the year. At its peak, Tesla was worth more than the 12 largest automakers on the planet combined, despite having a fraction of the sales of any of them. Today it is worth $399 billion.\n\n“It got ahead of itself in the near-term,” said Gene Munster of Loup Ventures, another Tesla fan. “I still believe this can be a much bigger company. I think it will see those kinds of numbers again. But it could take a long, long time to get there.”\n\nTesla’s growth prospects - a target of 50% sales growth annually, helped drive that valuation. It conceded in October that it will miss that sales target for this year.\n\nThe stock’s climb to dizzying heights – rising 743% in 2020 alone – was driven by Musk’s reputation as a genius who would disrupt the massive global auto industry.\n\n“Tesla was viewed as a disruptive technology company, not as an automaker, and a large part of that premium is related to Musk,” said Ives.\n\nOverpromising and underdelivering\n\nCritics of Tesla said much of its sky-high valuation was based on promises that Musk made about future products, many of which came years after they were originally promised.\n\nA prime example is the Cybertruck, the Tesla pickup truck, first unveiled three years ago with promises that production would start in 2021. Now it is slated to start production next year, with a ramp-up in production in 2024, putting it years behind other electric pickup offerings from Ford and upstart EV maker Rivian, both of which have electric pickups available for purchase today. It could also trail planned electric pickup offerings from General Motors.\n\n“Elon Musk has a pathological problem with the truth,” said Gordon Johnson, one of the largest critics of Tesla among analysts. “When people say he’s a genius and innovator, it’s based on all his promises he never lives up to.”\n\nJohnson said Tesla shares will have a much steeper fall ahead, once it starts being priced like other automakers rather than on its promises. He said that for Tesla to hit its growth targets it needs to be building new plants almost every year, but that new factories in Germany and Texas that opened in spring are still not operating at full capacity. And he said that its plant in China has had to scale back production due to weak sales in the market in the face of the Covid restrictions.\n\n“Demand in the US has collapsed,” he said. “Two months ago, your wait time was two or three months. Now you can get one immediately. They’re going to build more cars than they sell for a third straight quarter. It’s the definition of excess capacity.”\n\nTesla is still by far the largest EV maker worldwide, although that title is being challenged in some key markets, by Volkswagen in Europe and by BYD in China. And more competition is coming from established automakers such as Ford and GM.\n\nThe Twitter factor\n\nThat’s not to say Twitter has played no role in Tesla’s stock price demise this year: Tesla shares have lost 66% of their value since Musk’s interest in Twitter was first disclosed in April, with a 45% decline since he closed on the deal in late October.\n\nInvestors have been disappointed that Musk appears to be paying for so much of his $44 billion purchase of Twitter by selling Tesla stock. Musk, Tesla’s largest shareholder, has sold $23 billion worth of Tesla shares since his interest in Twitter became public in April.\n\nOn Thursday’s Twitter Spaces call, Musk promised he was done selling shares of Tesla stock until at least 2024, if not beyond. But he hasn’t lived up to a previous promise in April that he was done selling Tesla shares, selling $14.4 billion of that stock since that time.\n\n“It’s been a Pinocchio situation for Musk saying he is done selling stock. Investors want to see him walk the walk and not just talk the talk,” said Ives.\n\nAnother Twitter factor: Musk named himself CEO of Twitter, the third major company he leads, along with Tesla and SpaceX. So, many people assumed that Musk’s loss of focus on Tesla has spooked its former fans on Wall Street.\n\nBut this week began with Musk running a poll - on Twitter of course - asking if he should give up the CEO title at his social media plaything. He promised he would comply with the result, and 57.5% of those who voted said they want him gone.\n\nThat departure may take a while - Musk tweeted he will resign “as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!” And the same tweet he cautioned that even if he gives up the CEO title at Twitter, he’s not walking away totally, saying that he plans to “just run the software & servers teams” after finding a new “fool” to be CEO.\n\nThe poll results late Sunday were enough to lift Tesla shares in early trading Monday, but the shares ended the day slightly lower, and have lost significantly more ground every day since. Tesla shares fell 9% Thursday, and it ended the week down 18% after another 2% drop on Friday.\n\nAnd then there’s the question of how much damage the debacle at Twitter has done to the Tesla brand. Musk has fired thousands of employees, banned journalists while allowing Donald Trump and other previously banned accounts back online, called for the prosecution of Dr. Anthony Fauci, embraced conspiracy theories and made anti-trans statements in his short tenure as CEO.\n\nIt may have endeared him to some but angered other potential buyers, including liberals who might be willing to pay a premium for a more environmentally friendly vehicle.\n\n“I think it was measurable damage,” said Munster, who believes the publicity over his time at Twitter cost Tesla 5% of its sales.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/12/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/17/tech/twitter-elon-musk-timeline/index.html", "title": "Twitter takeover: A timeline of Elon Musk's bumpy road | CNN ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nA board seat accepted and then rejected. A stunning $44 billion takeover offer with uncertain financing. And a surprise early morning tweet putting the deal on hold, temporarily.\n\nEven by the standards of Twitter, a company that has known plenty of chaos and dysfunction in its history, the weeks-long effort by billionaire Elon Musk to buy the company has proven to be uniquely tumultuous – and there’s no clear end in sight.\n\nShould the deal go through, it would place the world’s richest man in charge of one of the world’s most influential social media platforms. The acquisition has the potential to upend not just Twitter itself but politics, media and the tech industry. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO has repeatedly stressed that his goal is to bolster what he calls “free speech” on the platform, by which he means all legal speech that complies with local laws in the markets where Twitter operates. He has also said he would reverse Twitter’s ban of former President Donald Trump.\n\nBut the attempt by Musk, a wildly successful entrepreneur with a history of erratic behavior, to buy Twitter has been viewed with some skepticism from the start. On the day he made his offer, Musk said: “I’m not sure I’ll actually be able to acquire it.” Some have questioned how he would finance the deal, especially as shares of Tesla (TSLA), which he’s partially using to back his financing of the Twitter deal, and the broader tech sector have declined in the weeks since.\n\nAfter Musk recently said he was temporarily pausing the deal so he could assess the amount of spam and fake accounts, it prompted speculation that the billionaire might be looking to renegotiate the deal – or back out of it entirely. His actions in the days that followed only reinforced that thinking.\n\nHere is a look back at the many twists and turns in one of the most high-profile tech deals in recent memory.\n\nJanuary 31: Musk begins building up his Twitter stake\n\nMusk starts quietly buying up Twitter shares, building his stake in the company. But it would be months before he disclosed this fact to the public.\n\nMarch 14: Musk’s Twitter stake tops 5%\n\nMusk’s stake in Twitter tops 5%, but that fact is not disclosed until the following month. Musk was obligated to disclose his stake within 10 days of crossing the 5% threshold, but waited 21 days to do so. During that time, he continued building up his stake.\n\nMarch 24: Asking whether Twitter should change\n\nThe billionaire begins to make pointed statements about the platform from his account. “Twitter algorithm should be open source,” he wrote, with a poll for users to vote “yes” or “no.”\n\nThe following day, Musk tweets out another poll to his followers: “Free speech is essential to a functioning democracy. Do you believe Twitter rigorously adheres to this principle?”\n\nA sign is posted on the exterior of Twitter headquarters on April 27, 2022 in San Francisco, California. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nMarch 26: Musk reaches out to Jack Dorsey\n\nMusk reaches out to Twitter cofounder and former CEO Jack Dorsey to “discuss the future direction of social media,” according to a company filing later put out by the company. The two tech founders are known to have a bit of a billionaire bromance on and off Twitter.\n\nApril 3: Twitter leadership meets to discuss Musk\n\nTwitter’s board and some of its leadership team meet with representatives from Wilson Sonsini, a law firm, and J.P. Morgan to discuss the possibility of Musk joining the company’s board, according a later securities filing. Dorsey is said to have told the board that “he and Mr. Musk were friends,” according to the filing.\n\nIn the meeting, the Twitter board discussed wanting Musk to agree to “‘standstill’ provisions”,” according to the filing. This would effectively “limit his public statements regarding Twitter, including the making of unsolicited public proposals to acquire Twitter (but not private proposals) without the prior consent of the Twitter Board.”\n\nApril 4: Surprise! Musk becomes Twitter’s largest shareholder\n\nMusk is revealed to be Twitter’s largest individual shareholder, with a more than 9% stake in the company.\n\nNews of the purchase sends shares of the social media company soaring more than 20% in early trading and kicks off a wave of speculation about how Musk might push for changes on the platform.\n\nApril 5: Musk agrees to join the board\n\nTwitter CEO Parag Agrawal announces Musk will join Twitter’s board of directors. “Through conversations with Elon in recent weeks, it became clear to us that he would bring great value to our Board,” Agrawal says in a post on Twitter.\n\nAs part of the appointment, Musk agrees not to acquire more than 14.9% of the company’s shares while he remains on the board. His term on the board is set to go through 2024, according to a regulatory filing.\n\nTwitter CEO Parag Agrawal (left) and former CEO Jack Dorsey in an undated photo. From Twitter\n\nApril 10: Just kidding. Musk ditches the board\n\nAgrawal announces that Musk has decided not to join the board after all. “I believe this is for the best,” Agrawal writes in a letter to the Twitter team.\n\nThe reversal opens the door for Musk to pursue a greater stake in the company – and frees him to tweet his many thoughts about the company.\n\nApril 14: Musk offers to buy Twitter and ‘unlock’ its potential\n\nMusk stuns the industry by making an offer to acquire all the shares in Twitter he does not own at a valuation of $41.4 billion. The cash offer represents a 38% premium over the company’s closing price on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed that he had become the company’s biggest shareholder.\n\n“I invested in Twitter as I believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe, and I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy. However, since making my investment I now realize the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form. Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company,” Musk writes in his offer letter. “Twitter has extraordinary potential. I will unlock it.”\n\nApril 15: The poison pill\n\nTwitter’s board of directors adopts a “poison pill” provision, a limited-term shareholder rights plan that potentially makes it harder for Musk to acquire the company.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk speaks during the official opening of the new Tesla electric car manufacturing plant on March 22, 2022 near Gruenheide, Germany.

He said he is “seeking to negotiate” a definite acquisition agreement and “is prepared to begin such negotiations immediately” — an apparent reversal from his statement in his acquisition offer letter that it would be his “best and final” offer.\n\nAlthough he is the richest person in the world, much of Musk’s wealth is tied up in Tesla stock, and some followers of the company speculate that it could be challenging for Musk to raise debt against the historically volatile stock.\n\nApril 25: Twitter agrees to sell itself to Elon Musk\n\nTwitter announces that it has agreed to sell itself to Musk in a deal valued at around $44 billion. At a conference later in the day, Musk describes his offer to buy Twitter in characteristically sweeping terms as being about “the future of civilization,” not just making money.\n\nAt an all-hands meeting that afternoon, Twitter employees raise questions about everything from what the deal would mean for their compensation to whether former US President Donald Trump would be let back on the platform.\n\nApril 29: Musk cashes out billions in Tesla stock\n\nFilings reveal Musk sold $8.5 billion of his Tesla stock in the three days after Twitter board agreed to the sale for an average of $883.09 per share. The filings did not disclose the reason for the sale, but Musk appeared to be raising funds to buy Twitter.\n\nTesla cars sit in a dealership lot on March 28, 2022 in Chicago, Illinois.

The new investors include Oracle founder Larry Ellison, cryptocurrency platform Binance and venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, according to a filing.\n\nMay 6: Musk’s lofty goals for Twitter, revealed\n\nMusk aims to increase Twitter’s annual revenue to $26.4 billion by 2028, up from $5 billion last year, according to a New York Times report, citing Musk’s pitch deck presented to investors. To achieve that lofty goal, Musk intends to bolster Twitter’s subscription revenue and build up a payments business while decreasing the company’s reliance on advertising sales, according to the report.\n\nMay 10: Musk says he would reinstate Trump’s account\n\nMusk confirms what many have assumed for weeks: he would reverse Twitter’s Trump ban if his deal to buy the company is completed.\n\n“I do think it was not correct to ban Donald Trump, I think that was a mistake,” Musk said. “I would reverse the perma-ban. … Banning Trump from Twitter didn’t end Trump’s voice, it will amplify it among the right and this is why it’s morally wrong and flat out stupid.”\n\nFormer President Donald Trump looks at his phone during a roundtable with governors on the reopening of America's small businesses, in the State Dining Room of the White House in Washington, June 18, 2020. Alex Brandon/AP\n\nMay 12: A partial hiring freeze and executive departures\n\nTwitter confirms to CNN Business that the platform is pausing most hiring and backfills, except for “business critical” roles, and pulling back on other non-labor costs ahead of the acquisition. In addition, Twitter says general manager of consumer, Kayvon Beykpour, and revenue product lead, Bruce Falck, are leaving the company.\n\nMay 13: Twitter deal ‘temporarily on hold’\n\nMusk tweets that the deal is on hold, linking to a Reuters report from nearly two weeks earlier, about Twitter’s most recent disclosure about its amount of spam and fake accounts. The figure cited in the report, however, is in line with prior quarterly disclosures.\n\n“Twitter deal temporarily on hold pending details supporting calculation that spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of users,” Musk tweeted.\n\nShares of the social media site plummet after Musk’s announcement, dropping more than 10% at market open. Two hours after announcing the hold, Musk says he remains set on purchasing Twitter. “Still committed to acquisition,” he wrote.\n\nLater in the day, Musk says his team is testing Twitter’s numbers and “picked 100 as the sample size number, because that is what Twitter uses to calculate <5% fake/spam/duplicate.”\n\nMay 14: Oops. NDA problems?\n\nMusk tweets out that Twitter’s legal team accused him of breaking a nondisclosure agreement when the billionaire revealed the platform’s sample size for automated user checks is allegedly just 100 users.\n\n“Twitter legal just called to complain that I violated their NDA by revealing the bot check sample size is 100! This actually happened,” wrote Musk.\n\nMay 16: Poop emoji\n\nThe standoff over bot accounts continues as Musk exchanges a series of tweets with Agrawal over the issue. After Agrawal carefully explains how Twitter attempts to combat and measure spam accounts, Musk responds with a poop emoji.\n\nMusk follows up with a somewhat more thoughtful question. “So how do advertisers know what they’re getting for their money?” Musk asked. “This is fundamental to the financial health of Twitter,” he added.\n\nMay 17: Musk says Twitter deal ‘cannot move forward.’ Twitter disagrees\n\nMusk announces that his acquisition of Twitter “cannot move forward” until he sees more information about the prevalence of spam accounts, claiming that the social media platform falsified numbers in filings. Without citing a source, he claims in a tweet that Twitter is “20% fake/spam accounts” and suggests Twitter’s previous filings with the SEC were misleading.\n\nLater in the day, Musk posts a poll to his Twitter followers: “Twitter claims that >95% of daily active users are real, unique humans. Does anyone have that experience?” before calling on the SEC to evaluate the platform’s numbers. “Hello @SECGov, anyone home?” Musk tweets, in an apparent attempt to get the regulator to look into the matter.\n\nIn a statement, Twitter says it remains “committed to completing the transaction on the agreed price and terms as promptly as practicable.” Later, the company says it intends to “enforce the merger agreement.”\n\nJune 6: A threat to walk away\n\nIn a letter to Twitter’s head of legal, Musk threatens to walk away from his purchase of the platform, alleging that Twitter is “actively resisting and thwarting his information rights” as outlined by the deal.\n\nIn the letter, an attorney for Musk accuses the social media company of breaching the merger agreement by not providing the data he has requested on Twitter spam bots, stating that the lack of information gives him a right “not to consummate the transaction” and “to terminate the merger agreement.”\n\nJuly 8: Actually trying to walk away\n\nMusk moved to terminate the acquisition agreement. A lawyer representing him claimed in a letter to Twitter’s top lawyer that the company is “in material breach of multiple provisions” of the deal over its alleged failure to provide all the data Musk says he needs to evaluate the number of spam and fake accounts on the platform.\n\n“For nearly two months, Mr. Musk has sought the data and information necessary to ‘make an independent assessment of the prevalence of fake or spam accounts on Twitter’s platform,’” the letter reads. “This information is fundamental to Twitter’s business and financial performance and is necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. … Twitter has failed or refused to provide this information.”\n\nTwitter was not having it.\n\n“The Twitter Board is committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with Mr. Musk and plans to pursue legal action to enforce the merger agreement,” Twitter board chair Bret Taylor said in a tweet Friday, echoing earlier statements by the company that it planned to follow through with the deal. “We are confident we will prevail in the Delaware Court of Chancery.”\n\nJuly 12: Twitter sues Musk\n\nTwitter sued the Tesla billionaire in Delaware court in an attempt to force him to complete the deal.\n\nThe 62-page lawsuit, sprinkled with memes, tweets and a poop emoji, effectively highlighted the bizarre spectacle of the deal from the start. The company paints Musk as a non-serious potential owner — alleging at one point that he has “disdain” for the company, and at another saying, “Musk’s strategy is … a model of bad faith” — while seeking to compel him to become its owner. (Twitter’s board has an obligation to its shareholders to try to see the deal through if they believe it is in their best interest. The dispute could also end in a settlement.)\n\nJuly 29: Save the date\n\nTwitter’s lawsuit against Musk over his move to terminate their $44 billion acquisition agreement will go to trial on Oct. 17 and run for five days, a Delaware judge ruled.\n\nThe decision came after Judge Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick, who is overseeing the case, previously ruled in Twitter’s favor that the proceedings could be expedited and take place in October. Twitter initially pushed for an October 10th start.\n\nMusk’s legal team had asked for the trial to take place in 2023. Twitter’s legal team argued it was necessary to expedite the case in order to limit the “harm” to its business and to ensure the deal can be completed before Oct. 24, the “drop dead” date by which the two sides had previously agreed to close the deal.\n\nPeiter \"Mudge\" Zatko, former head of security at Twitter, is sworn-in as he testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee on data security at Twitter, on Capitol Hill, September 13, 2022 in Washington, DC.

Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n\nSeptember 13: Whistleblower testifies before Congress\n\nTwitter whistleblower Peiter “Mudge” Zatko testifies before Congress in his first public appearance after his bombshell allegations against the social media company were reported in August by CNN and The Washington Post.\n\nIn a whistleblower disclosure sent to multiple lawmakers and government agencies in July, Zatko accused Twitter of failing to safeguard users’ personal information and of exposing the most sensitive parts of its operation to too many people, including potentially to foreign spies. Zatko — who was Twitter’s head of security from November 2020 until he was fired in January — also alleged company executives, including CEO Parag Agrawal, have deliberately misled regulators and the company’s own board about its shortcomings.\n\nZatko claimed in his testimony that Twitter is extremely vulnerable to being penetrated and exploited by agents of foreign governments, as well as detailed some of the personal information Twitter collects on users and alleged that the company does not know where the majority of its collected data goes.\n\nDays earlier, a judge allowed Musk’s legal team to add arguments based on the whistleblower disclosure to its case.\n\nOctober 3: Musk wants Twitter at the full price?\n\nMusk sends a letter to Twitter proposing to complete the deal as originally signed for $54.20 per share, citing people familiar with the negotiations. News of the letter, revealed in a security filing the next day, sends Twitter stock surging more than 20%, approaching the deal price for the first time in months.\n\nSuch an agreement could bring to an end a contentious, months-long back and forth between Musk and Twitter that has caused massive uncertainty for employees, investors and users of one of the world’s most influential social media platforms.\n\nOctober 6: The clock is officially ticking\n\nMusk has until October 28 to close his acquisition of Twitter or face a trial that was previously delayed to allow both parties to close the deal, Judge McCormick rules.\n\n“If the transaction does not close by 5 p.m. on October 28, 2022, the parties are instructed to contact me by email that evening to obtain November 2022 trial dates,” the judge said in the order.\n\nOctober 27: Elon now owns Twitter\n\nMusk completes his $44 billion deal to buy Twitter, according to a source familiar with the matter. Musk immediately fired Agrawal, CFO Ned Segal and policy head Vijaya Gadde, according to sources.\n\nMusk appeared to acknowledge the takeover in a tweet saying, “the bird is freed.”", "authors": ["Jennifer Korn"], "publish_date": "2022/05/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/28/tech/elon-musk-twitter-changes/index.html", "title": "Elon Musk now owns Twitter. Here's what he could change | CNN ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nAfter spending months attempting to get out of his deal to buy Twitter, Elon Musk officially owns the hugely influential platform. Now the question is: What will he actually do with it?\n\nMusk’s takeover — which was finalized Thursday night, a source familiar with the matter told CNN — not only has the potential to create upheaval for Twitter (TWTR) employees but also for the hundreds of millions of people around the world who use the platform daily. It could also impact the upcoming US midterm elections, if Musk makes good on his promise to restore the accounts of users who were previously banned from the platform, most notably former US President Donald Trump, and limit the company’s content restrictions.\n\nIn the first weeks after agreeing to buy the company in April, and before his initial move to bail on the deal, Musk repeatedly stressed that his goal was to bolster “free speech” on the platform and work to “unlock” Twitter’s “extraordinary potential.” The Tesla CEO suggested he would rethink Twitter’s approach to content moderation and permanent bans, with potential impacts on civil discourse and the political landscape. He also talked about his desire to rid the platform of bots, even as he later made the number of bots central to his argument to abandon the deal.\n\nDuring Tesla (TSLA)’s earnings call last week, Musk acknowledged that although finalizing the $44 billion deal meant “overpaying” for the social media firm, “the long-term potential for Twitter, in my view, is an order of magnitude greater than its current value.” He added that he believes Twitter has “languished for a long time, but has an incredible potential.”\n\nMusk’s plans for boosting Twitter’s value could involve cutting down its workforce, something he’s hinted at before. Previous reporting suggested that he’d planned to cut 75% of staff, although he is said to have told Twitter staff this week that’s not the case. Either way, anxieties are running high. Musk immediately fired CEO Parag Agrawal, CFO Ned Segal and policy head Vijaya Gadde.\n\nIn private and public statements over the past six months, Musk has tossed out a wide range of other possible changes for the platform, from enabling end-to-end encryption for Twitter’s direct messaging feature to suggesting this week that Twitter become part of an “everything” app called X, possibly in the style of popular Chinese app WeChat.\n\nThere have been more far-fetched suggestions, too. In one text exchange with his brother Kimbal Musk, revealed last week in court documents, the two appeared to discuss the possibility of asking users to pay for each tweet they post with small amounts of the cryptocurrency DogeCoin.\n\nNow that Musk has completed the deal, some of those theoretical changes could soon become reality. Here’s what users should know:\n\nA big shift for content moderation\n\nFor years under former CEO and co-founder Jack Dorsey, Twitter emphasized its work to bolster “healthy conversations.” The company banned many accounts promoting abuse and spam, added labels for false or misleading information, and banned the misgendering of transgender people.\n\nUnder Musk’s ownership, Twitter could unwind steps taken to make the platform more palatable for its most vulnerable users, typically women, members of the LGBTQ community and people of color, according to safety experts.\n\nMusk has said Twitter, under his leadership, would have more lenient content moderation policies. “If in doubt, let the speech exist,” Musk said in one on-stage interview in April. “If it’s a gray area, I would say, let the tweet exist. But obviously in the case where there’s perhaps a lot of controversy, you would not necessarily want to promote that tweet.”\n\nMusk on Thursday sought to reassure advertisers that he doesn’t plan to turn the platform into a “free-for-all hellscape” despite his promises to reduce content moderation. The remarks follow questions about whether advertisers might leave the platform for fear of their paid posts ending up alongside potentially objectionable content.\n\n“In addition to adhering to the laws of the land, our platform must be warm and welcoming to all, where you can choose your desired experience according to your preferences,” he said in an open letter posted to Twitter. Allowing all legal speech may not be so straight forward — content rules vary across the world and, in Europe, the new Digital Services Act imposes high moderation standards.\n\nMusk has also said he wants to make Twitter’s algorithm open source and make it more transparent to users when, for example, a tweet has been emphasized or demoted in their feed. (Leaders at Twitter have previously expressed support for moving in that direction, and the company often makes clear when it is demoting certain tweets or types of content.)\n\nUnbanning Trump and other accounts\n\nBut the most striking early change could come from who is and is not allowed on a Musk-owned Twitter.\n\nMusk has said he thinks Twitter should be more “reluctant to delete things” and “very cautious with permanent bans.” That could mean a long list of controversial far right figures and conspiracy theorists, among others, soon find their way back on the platform.\n\nMusk, for his part, has focused on bringing back one of Twitter’s most prominent former users: Trump.\n\n“I do think it was not correct to ban Donald Trump, I think that was a mistake,” Musk said in May. “I would reverse the perma-ban. … But my opinion, and Jack Dorsey, I want to be clear, shares this opinion, is that we should not have perma-bans.”\n\nDorsey tweeted following Musk’s May remarks that he does “agree” there shouldn’t be permanent bans on Twitter users. “There are exceptions … but generally permanent bans are a failure of ours and don’t work,” he said.\n\nTrump has said he does not want to rejoin Twitter and will instead remain on his own social media platform, Truth Social.\n\nBut if Trump were to accept a Musk offer to return to Twitter, it could restore a significant following he hasn’t had since being banned from the platform in January 2021, just as the 2024 US Presidential race ramps up. On Truth Social, Trump has only 4 million followers; on Twitter, he reached an audience of more than 88 million followers.\n\nAn owner with an erratic and controversial history on the platform\n\nAnother notable change is simply who may be making these sensitive decisions.\n\nMusk has a mixed reputation in the tech industry. He is undoubtedly one of the most ambitious and successful innovators and entrepreneurs of this era. But he has also courted controversy, often from his own Twitter profile, where he has more than 100 million followers.\n\nOver the years, Musk has used Twitter to make misleading claims about the Covid-19 pandemic, to make a baseless accusation that a man who helped rescue children from a cave in Thailand was a sexual predator, to mock people who display their gender pronouns on the platform, and to make countless jokes involving the numbers 420 and 69. He has also tweeted a (since deleted) photo comparing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to Adolf Hitler and has compared the now-ousted Agrawal to Joseph Stalin.\n\nMusk also previously sought to remove a Twitter account dedicated to tracking the movements of his private jet by offering to pay off the college freshman running the account (the account owner declined).\n\nThe same day he sent his letter to Twitter attempting to revive the deal, Musk was widely panned for comments he made on the platform about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. He suggested making Crimea, a region Russia invaded and annexed from Ukraine in 2014, “formally part of Russia.” Most followers responded “no” to his poll and Ukraine’s Ambassador to Germany Andrij Melnyk replied in a tweet: “F— off is my very diplomatic reply to you.” In a followup tweet, an apparently frustrated Musk seemed to blame the results of his poll on a “bot attack.”\n\nUntil now, Twitter has, at least to some extent, been accountable for its policy decisions to advertisers, shareholders and its board.

He was offered a seat on the board of directors but declined and made an unsolicited bid to buy the company for $54.20 a share.\n\nHe did not say how he planned to finance the purchase.\n\nThe company said the poison pill “does not prevent the Board from engaging with parties or accepting an acquisition proposal if the Board believes that it is in the best interests of Twitter and its shareholders.”\n\n– Jessica Guynn\n\nBuyout firm may also want Twitter\n\nThere might be another player seeking to buy Twitter.\n\nPrivate equity firm Thoma Bravo has reached out to the social media platform about a possible acquisition that would rival Tesla CEO and major Twitter shareholder Elon Musk, according to Reuters.\n\nIt’s not known how much Thoma Bravo, which reportedly has more than $103 billion in assets under management at the end of 2021, would be prepared to offer, Reuters reported.\n\nThe news about a potential second bidder came after Musk tweeted Thursday that he’s offering to buy Twitter for roughly $43 billion, higher than the social media company’s current $34 billion valuation. Both Twitter and Tesla stock dropped at market closing Thursday before seeing slight rises during after-hours trading.\n\nOn Friday, Twitter put in place a corporate strategy known as a \"poison pill,\" designed to slow or block Musk's bid.\n\nBoth Thoma Bravo and Twitter on Friday declined to comment.\n\n– Terry Collins\n\nElon Musk says he may not be able to buy Twitter after all\n\nMusk, Twitter’s largest shareholder, launched a takeover bid for the social media company Thursday, offering to buy it for $54.20 a share and take it private.\n\nBut hours after he made the $43 billion takeover offer, Musk said he was not sure he would be able to buy Twitter after all.

The liability they would thereby assume would be titanic in scale.\"\n\nHe also tweeted a yes or no poll: \"Taking Twitter private at $54.20 should be up to shareholders, not the board.\"\n\n– Jessica Guynn\n\nMark Cuban's Twitter rant about Musk\n\nLeave it to fellow straight-shooting billionaire Mark Cuban to sum up his thoughts on Musk’s quest to buy Twitter.\n\nThe tech entrepreneur, the owner of the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks and co-star of TV’s Shark Tank, went on a multi-hour Twitter rant/opine about Musk just moments after the Tesla CEO announced he filed with the Securities Exchange Commission to buy the underperforming (according to financial analysts) but influential social network.\n\nCuban believes that Musk, Twitter’s largest shareholder, is opening a Pandora’s Box, tweeting that “every major tech company” including Google and Facebook, is on the phone with their antitrust lawyers asking if they could buy Twitter and get it approved.\n\n“And Twitter is on the phone with their lawyers asking which can be their white knight,” Cuban tweeted. “Gonna be interesting.”\n\nCuban also said a potential Twitter sale won’t be limited to tech types as filthy-rich foreign investors may also be interested in the global and cultural cache Twitter provides.\n\nBut he also thinks that Twitter “will do everything possible not to sell the company” and that the company will “try to get a friendly” investor they prefer “to come in and buy Elon's shares and get him out.”\n\nCuban concludes that Musk is “f------ with the SEC,” as Musk’s filing increases Twitter’s share price, “His shares get sold. Profit SEC like WTF just happened.”\n\nStay tuned.\n\n– Terry Collins\n\nElon Musk Twitter offer rejected by Saudi prince Alwaleed bin Talal\n\nSaudi Arabian investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, one of the major shareholders in Twitter, rejected billionaire Musk’s bid to take over the social media company.\n\n“I don't believe that the proposed offer by @elonmusk ($54.20) comes close to the intrinsic value of @Twitter given its growth prospects,” he tweeted. “Being one of the largest & long-term shareholders of Twitter, @Kingdom_KHC & I reject this offer.”\n\nMusk replied on Twitter and pinned the tweet.\n\n“Interesting. Just two questions, if I may,\" he wrote. \"How much of Twitter does the Kingdom own, directly & indirectly? What are the Kingdom’s views on journalistic freedom of speech?”\n\n– Jessica Guynn\n\nHow much Twitter stock does Elon Musk own?\n\nSo, with all of the melodrama surrounding Elon Musk’s pursuit of Twitter, just how much stock of the social media platform does the Tesla CEO own?\n\nMusk's 9.2% stake in Twitter comes out to about 73.5 million shares, according to Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives.\n\nTwitter’s largest shareholder, Musk shook up the tech industry on Thursday by offering to buy it for $54.20 a share and take it private. That estimate comes out to about $43 billion, far higher than Twitter's current market value of about $34 billion.\n\nAfter a spike for most of the day, Twitter shares closed down at 1.68% but as high as 4% during market after hours on Thursday. Meanwhile, Tesla’s stock dove more than 3.6% following Musk’s announcement.\n\nTwitter was expected to hold an all-hands meeting Thursday where Musk will surely be the main topic of discussion.\n\n– Terry Collins\n\nWhat Elon Musk said about Twitter at TED20in Vancouver\n\nMusk on Thursday made his first public statement at the TED2022 conference in Vancouver, Canada since disclosing his takeover offer for Twitter.\n\nOn why he wants to buy Twitter: “It’s very important for there to be an inclusive arena for free speech. Twitter has become the de facto town square so it’s just really important that people have the reality and the perception that they are able to speak freely within the bounds of the law.”\n\nOn why Twitter matters: “It’s important to the function of democracy. It’s important for the function of the United States of us as a free country and many other countries and to actually help freedom in the world more broadly than the US. So I think the civilizational risk is decreased the more we can increase the trust of Twitter as a public platform.\n\nOn how Musk defines free speech: “A good sign whether there is free speech is: Is someone you don't like allowed to say something you don't like? If that is the case, then we have free speech.\"\n\nOn why his takeover attempt is not about the money: \"My strong intuitive sense is that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization. I don't care about the economics at all.\"\n\nOn how he would make tough moderation calls: \"If it's a gray area, I would say let the tweet exist.”\n\nOn making Twitter more transparent: “In my view, Twitter should match the laws of the country and really there is an obligation to do that. Going beyond that, and having it be unclear who’s making what changes to where, having tweets mysteriously be promoted and demoted with no insight into what's going on, having a black box algorithm promote some things and not other things, I think this can be quite dangerous.”\n\nOn whether Twitter should ban users: “I do think we want to be very reluctant to delete things, and just be very cautious with permanent bans. Timeouts, I think, are better than permanent bans.\"\n\nOn a top priority if he buys Twitter: “Eliminating the spam and scam bots and the bot armies that are on Twitter. They make the product much worse. If I had a doge coin for every crypto scam I saw, I would have 100 billion doge coins.”\n\nOn whether he will be able to buy Twitter: “I am not sure I will actually be able to acquire it.”\n\n– Jessica Guynn\n\nTwitter CEO doesn’t believe company is being ‘held hostage’ by Musk\n\nHours after Elon Musk’s bombshell tweet saying he wants to take over Twitter, CEO Parag Agrawal tried to ease his employees' concerns apparently without much luck, according to multiple reports.\n\n“I don’t believe we are being held hostage,” Agrawal told employees during an emergency all-hands meeting Thursday, according to the New York Times.\n\nThe newspaper also reported that many Twitter workers believed the nearly 30-minute question and answer session lacked substance. Agrawal was legally not allowed to provide details.\n\nThe Twitter chief encouraged employees to look beyond the chaos surrounding the social network.\n\n“This provides all of us with this moment where we feel distracted, where we feel a loss of control. I am personally going to spend my time focusing on things I can control, and I believe it will matter,” Agrawal said.\n\nAgrawal, who took over as CEO for Jack Dorsey in November, didn’t say when Twitter’s board would have an answer to Musk’s $43 billion offer or which way the board was leaning, frustrating many employees seeking more details during the Q&A, the Verge reported.\n\nAgrawal said the board would follow a “rigorous process,” the tech news site also reported.\n\nDuring the Q&A, one Twitter employee asked how the company decided to offer Musk a board seat, according to Reuters.\n\n\"Are we just going to start inviting any and all billionaires to the board?\" Reuters reported. Agrawal said the company will act in the best interest of shareholders.\n\n\"I have a strong point of view that people who are critical of our service, their voice is something that we must emphasize so that we can learn and get better,\" he said.\n\nA Twitter spokesman declined to comment about Thursday's meeting.\n\n– Terry Collins\n\nIs Elon Musk a Republican?\n\nWhat are Elon Musk’s politics? No one really knows. But conservatives have claimed him as one of their own.\n\nThe billionaire Tesla CEO has sided with critics of mainstream social media who accuse Facebook, Twitter and Google of anti-conservative bias.\n\nConservative commentator Dinesh D’Souza began lobbying Musk to buy Twitter in January.

An earlier version was published in November.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe future of Title 42, and the situation at the US-Mexico border, remains in limbo for now.\n\nThe Supreme Court said Tuesday that the controversial Trump-era border restriction will remain in effect while legal challenges play out, a move that ensures federal officials will be able to continue to swiftly expel migrants at US borders at least for the next several months.\n\nThe high court stepped in days before Title 42 was set to end earlier this month after an emergency appeal filed by a group of Republican-led states.\n\nThat means the public health restrictions remain in effect – for now – as the court weighs arguments from the states and responses from the Biden administration and the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nHere’s a look at some of the key questions and answers about Title 42’s history, what the court is weighing, what’s happening on the ground and what could happen next.\n\nWhat is Title 42?\n\nIn the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a public health order that officials said aimed to stop the spread of Covid-19. The order allowed authorities to swiftly expel migrants at US land borders. The policy is widely known as Title 42, for the portion of US code that allowed the CDC director to issue it.\n\nMigrants encountered under Title 42 are either expelled to their home countries or into Mexico. Under the policy, authorities have expelled migrants at the US-Mexico border nearly 2.5 million times in less than three years, according to US Customs and Border Protection data.\n\nIn a ruling last month, US District Judge Emmet Sullivan ordered the government to end the “arbitrary and capricious” policy. He granted a request for a five-week reprieve, setting a deadline of December 21.\n\nNow after an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court from 19 GOP-led states, that deadline is on hold pending further legal review.\n\nThe Biden administration is continuing to prepare for the policy’s end, a White House official said earlier this month.\n\n“While this stage of the litigation proceeds, we will continue our preparations to manage the border in a safe, orderly, and humane way when the Title 42 public health order lifts,” the Department of Homeland Security said.\n\nHow could lifting Title 42 change what’s happening at the border?\n\nOfficials predict that lifting Title 42 is likely to spur a significant increase in the number of migrants trying to cross into the US.\n\nLast month the Department of Homeland Security was projecting between 9,000 to 14,000 migrants may attempt to cross the US southern border daily when Title 42 ends, more than double the current number of people crossing, according to a source familiar with the projections.\n\nThere’s no doubt Title 42 has become a policy officials frequently turn to at the border, but it’s not the only way migrants’ cases are handled. A CNN analysis of 10 months of data earlier this year found that the public health restrictions were applied in about 50% of migrant encounters at the southwest border.\n\nImmigrants from Haiti, who crossed through a gap in the US-Mexico border barrier, wait to be processed by the U.S. Border Patrol on May 20, 2022, in Yuma, Arizona. Mario Tama/Getty Images\n\nIf Title 42 is lifted, the way migrants are processed at the border would go back to how it was before 2020. Under that system, migrants are either removed from the country, detained or released into the US while their cases make their way through immigration court.\n\nBut officials have also been weighing the possibility of implementing additional policies. Among them: a proposal that would bar migrants from seeking asylum at the US-Mexico border if they could have received refuge in another country they passed through on their journey, mirroring Trump-era asylum limits.\n\nIs there a connection between Title 42 and what’s been happening in El Paso?\n\nEl Paso Deputy City Manager Mario D’Agostino told reporters two weeks ago that about 2,500 migrants were crossing the border there daily.\n\nAt this point there isn’t any known connection between the rise in crossings there and the looming end of Title 42.\n\nBut El Paso officials say they’re worried what they’re seeing now at the border will only intensify once the policy is lifted.\n\nMigrants warm themselves by a fire next to the US-Mexico border fence on Thursday, December 22, in El Paso, Texas.

Jose Luis Gonzalez/Reuters In pictures: El Paso sees surge in border crossings Prev Next\n\nD’Agostino said already what his city is seeing is different than past surges of migrants across the border\n\nBefore, D’Agostino said, increases in migrant populations crossing the border were gradual and over a series of months. This time, he said, it has been rapid and over a few days.\n\n“Our infrastructure cannot keep up,” he said.\n\nWhy is Title 42 controversial?\n\nThe border restrictions were controversial from the moment the Trump administration announced them. Immigrant rights advocates argued officials were using public health as a pretext to keep as many immigrants out of the country as possible. Public health experts also slammed the policy, saying it wasn’t justified by the circumstances.\n\nIn April, the policy became a political lightning rod and a topic of fierce debate as the Biden administration announced plans to end it. But ultimately, the policy remained in place after a federal judge in Louisiana blocked the administration’s plans to roll it back.\n\nDebate resurged after Sullivan’s November ruling, and again several weeks later as word spread of the increasing number of migrants crossing in El Paso.\n\nMigrants cross the Rio Grande near El Paso, Texas, on Sunday. Officials say the city is bracing for the end of Title 42 next week. Jose Luis Gonzalez/Reuters\n\nThose who support Title 42 point to border arrests as they argue how essential the pandemic policy has been for blocking illegal immigration. Those who oppose the policy argue official statistics about encounters at the border inflate the severity of the situation, because the data include people crossing the border multiple times. They argue Title 42 has actually caused more border crossings.\n\nThe GOP-led states trying to block the lower court from ending the policy argue they’ll suffer “irreparable harm” and be forced to spend more money on law enforcement, education and healthcare if Title 42 is lifted. They told the Supreme Court that a “crisis of unprecedented proportions” would unfold at the border if the court failed to issue a stay while justices considered the case.\n\nThe DC Circuit US Court of Appeals on Friday had denied the states’ request to intervene, ruling that they waited an “inordinate” amount of time before trying to wade into the case. Now the Supreme Court will weigh those states’ claims and responses from the government and the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing migrant families in the case.\n\nWho has been subjected to Title 42?\n\nEarlier this year, Title 42 drew attention when authorities at first were using it to turn away Ukrainians at the border, then largely started granting exceptions that allowed thousands of Ukrainians seeking refuge to cross.\n\nAdvocates argued a racist double standard was at play as many migrants from Central America and Haiti continued to be turned back under the policy. Federal officials denied that accusation and said each exemption is granted on a case-by-case basis.\n\nIn August, CNN’s analysis found that migrants from outside Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador were far less likely to be subjected to Title 42.\n\nBut for some migrants, that’s started to change in recent months. Nearly 6,000 Venezuelan migrants were expelled under Title 42 in October after the Biden administration announced a new policy toward migrants from the South American nation.\n\nAdvocates say for many of those who are expelled, the situation is dire.\n\nSince Biden took office, Human Rights First says it’s identified more than 13,000 incidents of kidnapping, torture, rape or other violent attacks on people blocked or expelled to Mexico under Title 42.\n\nWhere does the Biden administration stand on Title 42?\n\nThe Biden administration has sent mixed messages on Title 42. It has criticized Title 42 and vowed to end its use at the border, but more recently came to rely on the policy.\n\nMany advocates expected President Biden would lift the order as soon as he took office, given his campaign promises to build a more humane immigration system. Instead, his administration extended the policy more than a year into his presidency and defended it for months in court.\n\nIn April 2022, the administration announced plans to end the policy, stating that it was no longer necessary given “current public health conditions and an increased availability of tools to fight Covid-19.”\n\nAfter the federal judge in Louisiana blocked that effort, the Justice Department vowed to appeal.\n\nBut in October, facing mounting political pressure over a marked increase in migrants crossing the border, the administration announced it was expanding the use of Title 42 to expel Venezuelans into Mexico.\n\nNow once again officials say they’re preparing for the policy to end. But they’re also appealing the federal judge’s recent ruling, arguing that public health restrictions limiting migration are legal.\n\nWhatever happens next is sure to face intense political scrutiny.\n\nAlready the increasing number of migrants crossing in El Paso in recent weeks are intensifying debate over the border once again.", "authors": ["Catherine E.

The annual Moundville Native American Festival will be held from Wednesday to Saturday at the University of Alabama Moundville Archaeological Park. This will mark the first in-person festival since 2019, as the event was held online only the past two years because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thousands of visitors are expected at the festival, which began 34 years ago. “The festival is one the largest events that brings people to the park every year,” said Clay Nelson, director of the UA Moundville Archaeological Park. Holding the festival online was the best option for the past couple of years, but Nelson said there’s no substitute for seeing up close the park’s attractions, which include 29 massive flat-topped earthen mounds. “We can describe the earthen mounds as much as we want, but seeing them in person really helps illustrate what great engineering feats the indigenous peoples of Alabama were doing in the 13th century,” he said. The festival will feature artists, craftsmen and educators from around the nation, who’ll share their knowledge of Native American culture. People will be able to buy Native crafts and food, as well as traditional festival fare.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A fall storm packing strong winds damaged roofs and windows in parts of western and northwest Alaska and resulted in flooding of roads in the far northern city of Utqiagvik, according to damage reports, with a new storm expected to hit the Arctic coast this week. Water levels dropped by midday Saturday across the region, said Jonathan Chriest, a National Weather Service meteorologist. The system forecasters are tracking is expected to bring elevated surf and strong winds to the Arctic coast Tuesday through Thursday, though water levels and winds weren’t expected to be as high as with the last storm, he said Sunday. There commonly are strong storms in northern and western Alaska between September and December, he said. But the storm that just hit parts of western and northwest Alaska and the remnants of Typhoon Merbok, which caused widespread damage in parts of western Alaska last month, were “exceptionally strong” for the areas that each impacted, he said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Abortions can take place again in the state, at least for now, after an appeals court on Friday blocked enforcement of a pre-statehood law that almost entirely criminalized the procedure. The three-judge panel of the Arizona Court of Appeals agreed with Planned Parenthood that a judge should not have lifted the decades-old order that prevented the older law from being imposed. The brief order written by Presiding Judge Peter J. Eckerstrom said Planned Parenthood and its Arizona affiliate had shown they are likely to prevail on an appeal of a decision by the judge in Tucson to allow enforcement of the old law. Planned Parenthood had argued that the lower court judge should have considered a host of laws restricting abortions passed since the original injunction was put in place following the U.S. Supreme Court’s 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade that said women have a constitutional right to an abortion. Those laws include a new one blocking abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy that took effect last month. The previous limit was 24 weeks, the viability standard established by now-overruled U.S. Supreme Court cases. “Arizona courts have a responsibility to attempt to harmonize all of this state’s relevant statutes,” Eckerstrom wrote, mirroring arguments made by attorneys for Planned Parenthood.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Two deputies who were caught on video violently arresting a suspect outside a convenience store in August have been fired, Crawford County Sheriff Jimmy Damante said Thursday. Damante told Fort Smith television station KHBS that Levi White and Zachary King had been fired but did not elaborate on the decision. A bystander recorded White, King and Mulberry Police Officer Thell Riddle arresting 27-year-old Randal Worcester outside a convenience store in the small town of Mulberry, about 140 miles northwest of Little Rock, near the border with Oklahoma. Mulberry Police Chief Shannon Gregory said Riddle remains on administrative leave. The bystander’s video of the Aug. 21 arrest shows one of the deputies repeatedly punching and kneeing Worcester in the head before grabbing his hair and slamming him against the pavement. As that was happening, another officer was holding Worcester down, while a third kneed him over and over. Damante has said Worcester was being questioned for threatening a clerk at a convenience store in the nearby small town of Alma. Damante said Worcester tackled one of the deputies and punched him in the head before the arrest. The deputy suffered a concussion, Damante said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The California Geological Survey has released updated tsunami hazard maps for seven counties to help users determine whether they are in areas at risk for inundation and for planning. The revised interactive maps released Friday cover San Diego, Santa Cruz, Ventura, Marin, Sonoma, Solano and Napa counties. The new maps reflect new data and improved computer modeling since an earlier series of maps was published in 2009, as well as threats from tsunamis originating far away and locally, the Geological Survey said in a press release. In one example of the updates, new modeling for Santa Cruz County shows that a subduction zone earthquake off the Aleutian Islands could unleash a tsunami 18-25 feet above the Santa Cruz Boardwalk, more than double the height suggested in 2009, the agency said. The Geological Survey said California’s shores have been struck by more than 150 tsunamis since 1800, and while most were minor, some have been significantly destructive and deadly. On March 28, 1964, a tsunami triggered by a powerful earthquake in Alaska smashed into Crescent City, California, hours later. Much of the business district was leveled, and a dozen people were killed.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A police officer who arrested a woman who was seriously injured when the parked patrol car in which she was placed was struck by a freight train said he did not realize he had stopped the vehicle on the railroad tracks, according to police body camera video. In video obtained by KUSA-TV on Thursday, Platteville Sgt. Pablo Vazquez told another officer he thought he had cleared the tracks when he stopped Yareni Rios-Gonzalez on Sept. 16 in a suspected road rage case involving a gun. He said he pulled up right behind her truck and was focused on her because he was concerned about weapons. Vazquez also said he did not know another officer had put Rios-Gonzalez in Vasquez’s patrol vehicle until after it was hit by the train. He said the “saving grace” was that the other officer put Rios-Gonzalez on the side of the vehicle not usually used for arrested people. Rios-Gonzalez’s injuries included nine broken ribs, a broken arm and a fractured sternum. Her lawyer has said he plans to file a lawsuit against police. Previously released video from Vazquez’s body camera shows he asks the other officer several times over the sound of the train’s rumbling whether Rios-Gonzalez was in the patrol vehicle, and she responds, one hand to her face, “Oh my God, yes, she was!”\n\nConnecticut\n\nWaterbury: Jurors concluded their first full day of deliberations without reaching a verdict Friday in a trial to determine how much conspiracy theorist Alex Jones should pay for spreading the lie that the 2012 Sandy Hook School shooting was a hoax. Jurors are scheduled to return Tuesday. After deliberating just briefly Thursday afternoon, the panel got back to business Friday with a request for a dry-erase easel, markers, an eraser and a copy of the jury instructions. Last year, Jones was found liable for damages. The jury’s task is to decide how much Jones and his company Free Speech Systems should pay to relatives of eight Sandy Hook victims and to an FBI agent who responded to the massacre. The plaintiffs testified they have been tormented and threatened by people who believed that one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history was a con staged to build support for gun restrictions. Jones repeatedly publicized that false notion on his “Infowars” show. Twenty children and six adults were killed when a gunman stormed Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, on Dec. 14, 2012. Jones testified in the trial, saying he was “done saying I’m sorry.” His lawyers have argued that he’s not responsible for the deeds of anyone who tormented the victims’ families, and that they are overstating how much harm it caused them.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: New state laws allowing universal voting by mail and Election Day registration are unconstitutional, Delaware’s Supreme Court ruled Friday. In a three-page order, the justices said the vote-by-mail statute impermissibly expands the categories of absentee voters identified in Delaware’s constitution. The same-day registration law conflicts with the registration periods spelled out in the state constitution, they said. The order, which will be followed later by a formal opinion, came after justices heard arguments in the case Thursday. Vice Chancellor Nathan Cook last month upheld the same-day registration law but said the vote-by-mail law, the result of legislation Democrats rammed through the General Assembly in less than three weeks, violates constitutional restrictions on absentee voting. Both bills were passed in June, each receiving exactly one Republican vote, and were signed by Democratic Gov. John Carney in July. Democratic Attorney General Kathleen Jennings appealed Cook’s ruling striking down the vote-by-mail law. GOP attorneys representing voters, a state House candidate and a Department of Elections employee appealed Cook’s decision upholding same-day registration. The Supreme Court upheld Cook’s ruling on the vote-by-mail law but said his decision allowing same-day registration should be reversed.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The National Air and Space Museum will reopen half of its flagship building to the public on the National Mall on Friday, WUSA-TV reports. When the museum partially reopens, visitors can check out eight new and renovated exhibitions, along with the planetarium on the museum’s west end. Highlights include “Destination Moon,” which will display the Apollo 11 space suit; “Kenneth C. Griffin Exploring the Planets Gallery,” which will feature an immersive experience called Walking on Other Worlds; and the “Thomas W. Haas We All Fly” exhibition, which will include the Challenger III and the Lear Jet 23. The museum has been undergoing a seven-year renovation that began in 2018 and includes redesigning all 23 exhibitions and presentation spaces, replacing outdated mechanical systems and other repairs and improvements. “You should be excited to engage with these pieces of history, these real artifacts, these real things,” said Beth Wilson, an educator with the museum. “Come and see them.” Free timed-entry passes are required to visit the National Air and Space Museum.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: Florida officials began planning to transport migrants to other states in July and told potential contractors their task would be to relocate them on a voluntary basis, according to state documents. The documents released Friday night provide new details about the program that culminated in the Sept. 14 flight of 48 mostly Venezuelan migrants from San Antonio, Texas, to Martha’s Vineyard, an island off Massachusetts. The flight has spawned an investigation by a Texas sheriff and two lawsuits amid criticism that the program was a political stunt by Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to appeal to his conservative base. DeSantis is running for reelection this year and is frequently mentioned as a potential 2024 presidential candidate. According to the documents, the program as outlined in July was intended to “assist in the voluntary relocation of Unauthorized Aliens who are found in Florida and have agreed to be relocated” elsewhere in the country. It made no mention of finding migrants in Texas. Ultimately, state officials chose Vertol Systems Co., based in Destin, Florida, and has so far paid the firm $1.56 million for the Martha’s Vineyard flight and possibly for a second flight to Delaware, the home state of President Joe Biden, that didn’t happen. No other flights have been announced.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The Georgia prosecutor investigating whether then-President Donald Trump and others illegally tried to interfere in the 2020 election filed paperwork Friday seeking to compel testimony from a new batch of Trump allies, including former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis filed petitions in court seeking to have Gingrich and Flynn, as well as former White House lawyer Eric Herschmann and others, testify next month before a special grand jury that’s been seated to aid her investigation. They join a string of other high-profile Trump allies and advisers who have been called to testify in the probe. Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor and Trump attorney who’s been told he could face criminal charges in the probe, testified in August. Attorneys John Eastman and Kenneth Chesebro have also appeared before the panel. U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham’s attempt to fight his subpoena is pending in a federal appeals court. And paperwork has been filed seeking testimony from others, including former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. Willis has said she plans to take a monthlong break from public activity in the case leading up to the November midterm election.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Mauna Loa, the largest active volcano on the planet, is in a “state of heightened unrest” but is not erupting, and there are no signs of an imminent eruption, the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said Friday. Earlier in the week week, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park closed the Mauna Loa summit backcountry until further notice, calling it a “precautionary measure” amid “elevated seismic activity.” The observatory said the heightened unrest began in mid-September, “as recorded by an increase in earthquakes below Mauna Loa summit.” The volcano, which stands about 13,680 feet above sea level on the island of Hawaii, last erupted in 1984, the observatory said. Since 1843, it has erupted 33 times, with the time between eruptions ranging from months to decades, according to the observatory. The park’s online portal says this is the volcano’s “longest quiet period since written records have been kept.” “Mauna Loa will erupt again,” Ken Hon, scientist-in-charge at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. “As long as there is heightened unrest, it is more likely to erupt. But it could be weeks or months – or it could eventually die off.” The latter happened the last time there was elevated seismic activity and summit expansion on Mauna Loa, in early 2021.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state Supreme Court heard arguments in lawsuits over three of Idaho’s abortion laws Thursday, sharply questioning attorneys about the value placed on a pregnant person’s health, the state’s interest in ensuring that pregnancies are carried to term and Idaho’s long history of anti-abortion laws. The high court earlier this year allowed the laws to go into effect, and as a result Idaho is one of several states where abortion is almost entirely outlawed. A final ruling on the laws – including one that criminalizes all abortions but allows physicians to defend themselves by showing the abortion was needed to save the pregnant persopn’s life, one that criminalizes most abortions after about six weeks’ gestation, and one that allows even extended potential relatives of a fetus or embryo to sue an abortion provider – could be handed down sometime in the coming months. “For 50 years, generations of Idaho women have had control over their bodies and lives with respect to the most intimate personal and private decision imaginable whether to carry a pregnancy to term or whether to terminate it,” Alan Schoenfeld, the attorney representing a regional Planned Parenthood affiliate, told the court. “The Idaho Legislature seeks to upend women’s lives and strip them of this fundamental right – one that’s necessary to the exercise of numerous other rights that all Idahoans cherish.”\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A man accused of walking into a Chicago police station and pointing a gun at officers, leading police to shoot and wound him, appeared in court Friday on assault charges, where a judge ordered his bond set at $200,000. The police department said in a news release that 43-year-old Terrick Bland, of nearby Maywood, is charged with five counts of aggravated assault of a peace officer and one felony count of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. According to police, Bland walked into the lobby of the Ogden District station in the Lawndale neighborhood on the city’s West Side and began shouting anti-police statements Wednesday. When officers ordered him to drop a gun that he had wrapped in a plastic bag, he pointed it at officers, and at least three of them opened fire. Bland was shot once in the shoulder and was treated at a hospital for non-life-threatening injuries. According to the Cook County State’s Attorney’s office, Bland was represented at Friday’s hearing by an attorney with the county public defender’s office. An official from the office said she could not immediately determine who represented Bland. It was the second time in a little more than a week in which Chicago officers shot an armed suspect inside of a police station.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Health officials are warning northern Indiana residents to take precautions to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes after detecting a rare and potentially deadly mosquito-borne virus in the region. State public health and animal health officials issued the warning Thursday after determining that the eastern equine encephalitis virus was active in multiple northern Indiana counties, with four horses testing positive for the virus. State veterinarian Dr. Bret Marsh said the virus “is a serious threat to both horses and people in northern Indiana” until the first hard freeze of the fall season occurs. As of Tuesday, the Indiana State Board of Animal Health said two horses in LaGrange County and one horse in Kosciusko County had tested positive for the virus. No human cases of the virus disease or mosquitoes infected with the virus have been reported in Indiana this year. But officials said that because northern Indiana contains suitable habitat for mosquitoes that can transmit the virus, “humans and horses in all northern Indiana counties are potentially at risk.” Residents were urged to avoid being outdoors when mosquitoes are present and take other steps, including eliminating breeding grounds for the insects. While rare, the virus can cause serious illness with long-term complications and has a fatality rate of around 33% or higher.\n\nIowa\n\nCedar Falls: Paddlers on the Cedar River now will be floating on designated waters. The river, from Janesville to around La Porte City – about 46 miles – has been formally recognized as a designated water trail as part of the Cedar Valley Nature Trail. A 14-mile stretch of Black Hawk Creek from Hudson to the Cedar River was also designated as an official water trail. The Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier reports members of the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, Black Hawk County Conservation, Iowa Northland Regional Council of Governments and Partnership for a Healthy Iowa paddled from Washington Park in Cedar Falls to the Waterloo Boat House in celebration of the new identification. Kayla Lyon, director of the Iowa DNR, said there are more than 1,000 miles of designated water trails in the state. The state’s first designated water trail was the Cedar Valley Paddler’s Trail in Black Hawk County, which begins at the Fisher Lake Boat Ramp. The 10-mile trail was recognized in 2005. Peter Komendowski, executive director of the Partnership for a Healthy Iowa, said the waterway was first paddled by 26 eighth graders and adults, and it took them more than six hours. It travels through a chain of lakes, down the Cedar River and through George Wyth State Park before looping back to the start.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: A Wichita police officer was arrested early Saturday on suspicion of drunken driving, becoming the city’s third officer to be apprehended within about two weeks. Police said in a release that the officer, who was off-duty, is also facing a charge of possession of a gun while intoxicated. The officer, who has been with the department for two years, has been placed on administrative leave while a criminal and internal investigation is conducted, the Wichita Eagle reports. The incident follows two other arrests of Wichita officers within five days at the end of last month. A detective and 15-year veteran of the force was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence Sept. 23 after she collided with a city bus in downtown. A police recruit was arrested on suspicion of criminal threat Sept. 28 when police responded to a domestic violence call.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Three Jewish women from Louisville filed a lawsuit Thursday to block Kentucky’s laws banning most abortions from remaining in effect, arguing they are a violation of their religious rights under the state constitution. Under current Kentucky laws, the protected human life of “an unborn child” begins when an egg is fertilized by a sperm, with abortion strictly prohibited once fetal cardiac activity is detected at roughly six weeks. Exceptions are only allowed to prevent a pregnant woman’s death or a “substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.” The plaintiffs in the case say Jewish law, known as Halakha, for millennia has not defined human life as beginning at conception but rather at birth, while the abortion ban passed into law in Kentucky “has imposed sectarian theology on Jews.” Their complaint, filed in Jefferson County Circuit Court, says Kentucky law particularly contradicts their constitutional religious rights when it comes to their past and intended future use of in vitro fertilization, in which a human egg is fertilized with sperm in a laboratory and then implanted in the uterus. “As a mom, as a woman, this directly affects me; it affects my health care,” lead plaintiff Lisa Sobel said. “And then it’s a personal affront to my personal religious views, on top of it.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The Democratic challenger to U.S. House Majority Whip Steve Scalise released a campaign ad on social media that includes video of her giving birth. Katie Darling said she was seven months pregnant when she decided to join the congressional race in reaction to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June that ended constitutional protections for abortion. The 75-second video documents Darling traveling from her family farm in St. Tammany parish in September to a hospital, where she grips the side of a bed while in labor. “I wanted to share that this is real for me,” Darling, 36, said in an interview with the Associated Press. “I am literally the one hooked up to the machines and the IVs in the hospital bed, going through childbirth, and nobody else should be deciding how I handle that.” In a voiceover, Darling highlights her concerns about climate change, Louisiana underperforming in education and the state’s near-total abortion ban – the only exceptions are if there is substantial risk of death or impairment to the patient if they continue with the pregnancy and in the case of “medically futile” pregnancies. There are no exceptions for rape or incest. “Louisiana deserves better than the path it’s on,” Darling says in the video. “I want that better path,” she adds, “for you” – as the ad pans to her husband in the delivery room. “For her,” as a the video shows her 6-year-old daughter. “And for him,” she says directly into the camera from her hospital bed as she cradles her newborn.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Wildlife agencies are finding elevated levels of a class of toxic chemicals in game animals such as deer, prompting health advisories in some places where hunting and fishing are ways of life and key pieces of the economy. Authorities have detected the high levels of PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, in deer in several states, including Maine, where legions of hunters seek to bag a buck every fall. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency launched an effort last year to limit pollution from the chemicals, linked to health problems including cancer and low birth weight. In Maine, where the chemicals were detected in well water at hundreds of times the federal health advisory level, legislators passed a law in 2021 requiring manufacturers to report their use of the chemicals and to phase them out by 2030. The state issued a “do not eat” advisory last year for deer harvested in the Fairfield area, about 80 miles north of Portland, after several of the animals tested positive for elevated levels. The state is now expanding the testing to more animals across a wider area, said Nate Webb, wildlife division director at the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife. “Lab capacity has been challenging,” he said, “but I suspect there will be more facilities coming online to help ease that burden.”\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The office of the state’s attorney general is supporting an appeal by a slain woman’s family after a Baltimore judge overturned a man’s murder conviction in a case chronicled by a groundbreaking podcast. Hae Min Lee’s brother, Young Lee, has asked the Maryland Court of Special Appeals to halt court proceedings for Adnan Syed, whose conviction in Lee’s 1999 killing was reversed by Baltimore Circuit Judge Melissa Phinn in September. Young Lee is asking the appellate court to suspend an Oct. 18 deadline for prosecutors to decide whether to drop the charges against Syed or retry him. Lee argues that his family didn’t get adequate notice of the Sept. 19 hearing at which Phinn overturned Syed’s conviction. Attorney General Brian Frosch’s office, which represented the state in opposing Syed’s appeals, said in a court filing Friday that Young Lee has a right to appeal given his status as the victim’s representative, the Baltimore Sun reports. The filing argues that Lee’s appeal should be addressed before any circuit court rulings render it moot. Syed, who has always maintained his innocence, has served more than 20 years of a life sentence. He was convicted of strangling Lee, whose body was found buried in a Baltimore park. Syed and Lee were students at a Baltimore County high school.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Health officials said Friday that they’re concerned about elevated levels of the coronavirus in the city’s wastewater. The concentration of the virus in local wastewater had increased by 3.1% over the prior week and by nearly 100% over the past two weeks, according to new data from last week from the Boston Public Health Commission. New COVID-19 cases in Boston had decreased slightly over the prior week, though the data did not include positive results from at-home tests, the commission said. Boston hospitals had 170 new hospital admissions related to COVID-19 last week. Dr. Bisola Ojikutu, the public health commissioner, said the elevated concentration in the wastewater is “very concerning” because increases in COVID-19-related hospitalizations, combined with flu season, will cause “major strain” on Boston’s health care system. Ojikutu said it’s important to try to get ahead of the issue and recommended that people get booster shots and flu shots, wear a mask indoors, get tested for COVID-19 and isolate if they test positive to help reduce transmission. Nearly 79% of Boston residents are fully inoculated against the disease. The commission began noticing elevated coronavirus levels in the wastewater in late September.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has signed another extension of a law that makes people convicted of crimes, typically with low incomes, responsible for a portion of local court expenses. The law, which raises millions of dollars for local governments, doesn’t apply to others who use Michigan’s court system. It has been criticized, even by judges, as unfair at minimum and unconstitutional at worst. The state Supreme Court last spring heard a challenge by a man who was ordered to pay $1,200 in Alpena County. But instead of settling the matter, the court said it would hear more arguments during its 2022-23 term. The Legislature in September voted to keep the law going for an additional 18 months. Only 17 lawmakers opposed it. Whitmer, a Democrat, said she signed the extension last week. Rep. Sarah Lightner, R-Springport, acknowledged it puts another “Band-Aid on this issue” while a long-term court funding solution can be explored. A group called the Fines and Fees Justice Center tracks how states impose fines and fees in courts. Co-director Lisa Foster said Michigan stands out because judges who preside over a criminal case are also given power to order financial penalties that benefit local government. People convicted of crimes can be ordered to pay a portion of staff salaries and building maintenance.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: State Attorney General Keith Ellison sued Fleet Farm on Wednesday, alleging the retailer negligently sold firearms to two straw buyers, including one gun that was used in a shootout in a St. Paul bar that left one person dead and 14 bystanders injured. The lawsuit, filed in Hennepin County District Court, alleges that Fleet Farm ignored multiple red flags that should have tipped off chain officials, including sales of multiple guns in single purchases. It alleges that Fleet Farm stores sold the two at least 37 firearms over a 16-month period. Most of the guns have not been recovered, Ellison said. Ellison, a Democrat, is facing a stiff reelection challenge from Republican candidate Jim Schultz, who has made violent crime his top issue. “We comply with all applicable gun laws and devote substantial resources to training and compliance,” countered Fleet Farm spokesman Jon Austin. He said that after the St. Paul shooting Ellison highlighted, “we were told by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms that our team members had ‘done nothing wrong’ and had complied with all applicable gun laws.” The Midwestern company has 17 stores in Minnesota that sell firearms. Straw buyers purchase firearms from licensed retailers and resell them to people who can’t legally buy them or on the black market.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The city is heading off the threat of a garbage pileup by agreeing to pay its overdue bill for collections the past six months. Even as Jackson struggles with a troubled water system, Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba and the City Council have been feuding over the garbage contract for the city of 150,000 residents. Richard’s Disposal has picked up Jackson garbage since April without compensation. The company said it would stop collections after Saturday unless it receives payment. City Council President Ashby Foote told the Associated Press on Friday that the city will pay $4.8 million, and garbage collection will continue. Lumumba awarded an emergency contract early this year to Richard’s after the council voted multiple times against hiring the New Orleans-based company. Jackson has had water problems for years, and most of the city lost running water for several days in late August and early September because torrential rainfall exacerbated problems with the main water treatment plant. Crews are still making emergency repairs to the water plant, and questions remain about the quality of water in the city where 80% of residents are Black, and a quarter live in poverty.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A mother whose son died less than an hour after he was transported from a jail to a state prison has won a $1.2 million settlement in a case that helped lead to suspensions, firings and reforms. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports Angela Malcich claimed in the suit that nurses and guards at the St. Louis County Justice Center repeatedly ignored the serious medical distress of her son, Daniel Stout. He was arrested June 3, 2019, on a parole revocation and spent the next eight days in the county jail. The night before his death, Stout complained of stomach pains but was told he would have to wait until the morning to see a nurse, the suit claims. That morning, though, jail staff told a worsening Stout that he would need to wait for care again until he could be transported more than an hour to the state prison in Bonne Terre. Upon arriving, he was vomiting blood and died before emergency crews could get there. An autopsy blamed complications of an ulcer that perforated his intestine. Four other inmates also died in the county jail in 2019, with an internal report finding that all of them had acted “strangely” beforehand and that most were denied medical care.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A draft report from Gov. Greg Gianforte’s housing task force details a slew of ideas to boost housing supply in an effort to tackle Montana’s affordability crunch, previewing legislation that could be advanced during next year’s legislative session, the Montana Free Press reports. Several of the task force’s recommendations involve scaling back local zoning restrictions such as minimum lot sizes, building height limits and parking requirements to make it easier to develop more dense housing developments in urban areas with existing access to services like water lines, streets and fire departments. The report released last week calls for legislation that places “sideboards” on the development restrictions towns and cities have the power to enact and also suggests providing financial incentives to local governments that implement “key regulatory reforms.” The group also suggests putting some state money toward supporting affordable housing efforts. It generally avoids suggestions that seek to address housing challenges with new government regulations, such as restricting AirBnB-style short-term rentals. The task force, which is set to formally present its recommendations to the governor in the coming weeks, is looking for public comment to consider as it finalizes its initial report by a Saturday deadline.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The city will have a new tallest building once Mutual of Omaha completes its planned $600 million headquarters tower downtown in 2026. Mutual CEO James Blackledge told the Omaha World-Herald it recently became clear that the insurance company’s new skyscraper would eclipse the 45-story First National Bank tower. The new Mutual building is projected to be 677 feet tall. That would make it 43 feet taller than the First National building that opened in 2002. Mutual didn’t set out to build the city’s tallest building, but Blackledge said he’s proud of the impact the project will have on Omaha’s downtown and its image. “I think people see skylines, and it does create an impression of all the things we want Omaha to be perceived as – a vibrant, growing, thriving place where people can live and work and prosper,” he said. The new building will be designed to hold roughly 2,400 of the company’s 4,000 headquarters workers at any one time, reflecting the rise of working from home. It will also be a little less than half the size of Mutual current 1.7 million-square-foot headquarters complex in midtown Omaha. In conjunction with the Mutual project, Omaha leaders have pledged to build a $306 million, 3-mile-long streetcar line to connect midtown with downtown by sometime in 2026.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Victims of a quick series of stabbings on the Las Vegas Strip described the shock and horror of the unexpected attack Thursday on a group of showgirls and others outside a casino that left two people dead and six injured. Police arrested Yoni Barrios, 32, after a short chase blocks from where they say he attacked four showgirls and ended up stabbing eight people. An arrest report released Friday said Barrios told police some of the victims had laughed at him, and he “let the anger out.” Prosecutors said he’ll be charged with two counts of murder and six counts of attempted murder. “I couldn’t believe that this was happening to me,” said Victoria Caytano, one of the showgirl impersonators who was released from the hospital Friday after she was treated for a stab wound. “I got up, and I started running,” Caytano told KLAS-TV. “I started yelling, ‘He has a knife!’ ” The coroner’s office identified those killed as Las Vegas residents Brent Allan Hallett, 47, and Maris Mareen DiGiovanni, 30. Hallett was stabbed in the back, and DiGiovanni died from a chest wound, authorities said. DiGiovanni was part of the Best Showgirls in Vegas modeling and talent agency, according to Cheryl Lowthorp, who runs the business. She said two others with the agency were among the wounded, and a third escaped without injury.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A former juvenile parole officer has been sentenced to 11 years in federal prison for possession of child pornography and trying to send an explicit image to a child. Jason Ellis pleaded guilty in June. Prosecutors agreed in a plea agreement to drop a third charge of distributing child pornography. Ellis was fired from his job as a juvenile parole officer earlier in the year after he was arrested. An affidavit said Ellis sent online messages in 2020 and 2021 to undercover investigators posing as a 13-year-old girl and her father. Detectives uncovered more than 100 images of child sex abuse material on his phone, WMUR-TV reports.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state would sell off all of its pension fund investments in oil, gas and other fossil fuel companies under a bill approved by a New Jersey Senate committee Thursday. The bill targets any pension money invested in 200 of the largest publicly traded fossil fuel companies based on each of their carbon content in oil, gas and coal reserves. It was passed 3-2 along party lines with Democrats in support and Republicans against. “The clock is ticking, and there is not that much time left,” said state Sen. Bob Smith, D-Middlesex, the bill’s sponsor. “We’ve got to get our industry to change and our economy to change.” The pension fund was valued at $92.9 billion as of May 31, but it is not known exactly how much is invested in fossil fuel company stocks. A state Treasury Department spokeswoman did not return a request for that information Thursday. Divest NJ, a group advocating for the measure, estimates it’s between $3 million and $4 million, based on documents it has obtained. The measure had languished in Trenton for almost five years and still has a long road ahead of it. It was moved to the Senate Budget Committee on Thursday and would still need to be approved by the full Senate, the Assembly and Gov. Phil Murphy. It would take effect 12 months after being signed into law.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has asked the federal Department of Justice to assign more FBI agents to the state in response to violent crime. Lujan Grisham said Wednesday in a statement that she wants to replicate the success of a recent surge in FBI resources and agents in Buffalo, New York. The Sept. 15 letter to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland describes a recent spate of homicides in Albuquerque and says that “additional federal agents are needed to alleviate the current strain on New Mexico’s law enforcement offices.” Lujan Grisham sent a similar request in June to FBI Director Christopher Wray. Lujan Grisham spokeswoman Nora Meyers Sackett said the governor’s office did not receive a response from the Department of Justice as of Wednesday evening. Concerns about crime are a prominent theme in the race for governor ahead of the Nov. 8 general election as Lujan Grisham seeks a second term in office. Republican nominee and former television meteorologist Ronchetti has painted a dire portrait of public safety conditions, railing against the state’s bail system and vowing a different approach to judicial appointments.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state police superintendent resigned Friday, days after Gov. Kathy Hochul said he was being investigated for his handling of internal personnel matters. In a statement, Hochul thanked Kevin Bruen for “his years of public service” and said that First Deputy Superintendent Steven Nigrelli will take over as acting superintendent on an interim basis. Bruen had been in charge of the state police since June 2021. A 20-year veteran of the department, he was appointed superintendent by Hochul’s predecessor, Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Bruen’s resignation is effective Oct. 19, the state police said. Hochul told the Albany Times Union’s editorial board on Tuesday that she had ordered her counsel’s office to investigate allegations against Bruen. Among them, according to the newspaper, is whether he had shielded a senior human resources official from complaints about her own handling of personnel issues.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state’s two top Democratic officials are urging the Republican-led Legislature to decriminalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana in light of President Joe Biden’s pardon Thursday of thousands of Americans convicted of “simple possession” under federal law. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper and Attorney General Josh Stein, the state’s top lawyer who is considering a run for governor in 2024, shared their support for the president’s decision at a Friday task force meeting on racial equity and criminal justice. Established by Cooper in June 2020 after George Floyd’s murder, the 24-member panel of law enforcement officers, attorneys, civil rights advocates and state officials had recommended in a 2020 report that state lawmakers replace the misdemeanor charge for possessing up to 1.5 ounces of marijuana with a civil offense on par with a traffic infraction. The General Assembly did not act on this recommendation. “Conviction of simple possession can mar people’s records for life and maybe even prevent them from getting a job,” Cooper told the task force Friday. “The General Assembly didn’t pass your recommendations on this last session, but I believe they should. North Carolina should take steps to end this stigma.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state’s five American Indian tribes are seeking exclusive rights to host internet gambling and sports betting in North Dakota – a monopoly worth millions – just a year after legislators turned aside a push by one big national player to allow gambling in the state. The tribes are turning to Republican Gov. Doug Burgum to approve the idea under tribal-state agreements known as compacts, the first of which was signed in 1992. The current compacts expire at the end of this year, and only Burgum can approve them, said Deb McDaniel, North Dakota’s top gambling regulator. The tribes argue their casinos have been hurt by the explosion of electronic pull tab machines statewide after they were legalized in 2017, with North Dakotans pouring almost $1.75 billion into the machines in fiscal 2022. Their proposal, obtained by the Associated Press, is still in draft form. A public hearing on a final proposal is set for Oct. 21, McDaniel said. DraftKings, a big player in the U.S. mobile gambling market, supported legislation and a failed resolution last year to allow sports betting in North Dakota to join about two dozen other states. The company said at the time that sports wagering already is taking place in North Dakota through illegal offshore markets.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: A law banning virtually all abortions will remain blocked while a state constitutional challenge proceeds, a judge said Friday in a ruling that will allow pregnancy terminations through 20 weeks’ gestation to continue for now. Hamilton County Common Pleas Judge Christian Jenkins issued the preliminary injunction from the bench after a daylong hearing where courthouse guards screened spectators, and one abortion provider testified to wearing a Kevlar vest over fears for her safety. In impassioned remarks announcing his decision, Jenkins knocked the state’s arguments that the Ohio Constitution doesn’t ever mention abortion and thus doesn’t protect the right to one. He said a right doesn’t have to be named to be protected. “This court has no difficulty holding that the Ohio Constitution confers a fundamental right on all of Ohioans to privacy, procreation, bodily integrity and freedom of choice in health care decision-making that encompasses the right to abortion,” he said. He said the state failed to prove that the ban on most abortions after detection of fetal cardiac activity is narrowly tailored enough not to infringe on those rights. Rather, Jenkins said, the law is written “to almost completely eliminate the rights of Ohio women. It is not narrowly tailored, not even close.” The state is expected to appeal.\n\nOklahoma\n\nBlanchard: Jody Miller, whose “Queen of the House” won the 1966 Grammy Award for best country performance by a woman, died Thursday at age 80. Miller died in her hometown, Blanchard, of complications from Parkinson’s disease, according to Universal Music Group, owner of Capitol Records, which released most of her hits. “Queen of the House” was released in 1965 as an answer to Roger Miller’s hit “King of the Road.” The hit opened up a crossover career for Jody Miller, who wasn’t related to the “King of the Road” composer and singer. Her 1965 teen protest song “Home of the Brave” was her biggest-selling single, despite being banned from some radio stations’ playlists. Another hit was “Long Black Limousine,” a song about a man’s funeral procession. In the 1970s, Miller moved to Epic Records, where she had hits with “Baby I’m Yours,” “There’s a Party Goin’ On,” “Darling, You Can Always Come Back Home,” and the Grammy-nominated crossover hit cover of “He’s So Fine.” She retired in the 1980s to spend more time with her husband and children. After her husband’s death, she recorded a 2018 single, “Where My Picture Hangs on the Wall,” with daughter Robin Brooks Sullivan and Miller’s two grandchildren.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A serial rapist is set to be released from prison in mid-December after serving nearly 36 years behind bars, almost all of his maximum sentence. Richard Gillmore, arrested in 1986 and called the “jogger rapist” because he staked out victims as he ran by their homes, admitted to raping nine girls in the Portland area in the 1970s and ’80s but was only convicted in one case because of the statute of limitations. In 1987, a jury found him guilty of raping 13-year-old Tiffany Edens, his last known victim, in December 1986. The Associated Press generally does not name people who have been sexually assaulted unless they come forward publicly. Edens has spoken out about the assault and recently wrote on social media that she received a voicemail in August from the state’s Victim Information and Notification Service telling her of his impending release. “I have been slowly processing the reality of it all,” she wrote. The Oregonian, citing prison officials, reported that Gillmore was transferred in August from Two Rivers Correctional Institution in Umatilla to the minimum-security Columbia River Correctional Institution in Portland to help him prepare for his reentry into the community. He will be 63 at the time of his release in December. KOIN reports Gillmore will remain under supervision until 2034.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: An Italian heritage group has vowed to appeal a judge’s ruling that officials can remove a 13-foot statue of Christopher Columbus from a city park. Attorneys for the Italian Sons and Daughters of America have argued that the mayor doesn’t have the power to override an ordinance passed by the City Council in 1955 that cleared the installation of the 800-pound statue of the explorer. Common Pleas Judge John McVay Jr. ruled about a week ago that because the statue erected in 1958 is in a city-owned park, it represents government speech – citing a 2009 U.S. Supreme Court ruling on a Utah city rejecting a monument proposed for a city park by a religious group. The Italian Sons and Daughters of America filed the lawsuit in October 2020 after the Pittsburgh Art Commission voted to remove the statue. Then-Mayor Bill Peduto then also recommended its removal. McVay had for two years urged the two sides to work toward a solution, including its relocation to a different location. The statue has been vandalized numerous times and is wrapped in plastic. “Based on the court’s ruling, the mayor can put up or take down any statue he wants on any city-owned property without regard for other branches of the city government,” the Italian Sons and Daughters of America argued. “Obviously, this cannot be correct.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The Rhode Island Festival of Children’s Books and Authors returns to an in-person format this year for the first time since 2019, kicking off Friday with a virtual appearance by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor at Lincoln School. Sotomayor, who has written several children’s books in addition to a 2013 memoir, will speak to and answer questions from Rhode Island children. Free signed copies of her books “Just Ask” and “Just Help” will be given to children who attend the 4:30 p.m. event. The festival will continue Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. at Lincoln School, where participants can listen to 30-minute talks by authors, purchase books and have them signed; make book crafts; and buy lunch from a variety of vendors. Authors and illustrators at the event will be Mary Jane Begin, Gaia Cornwall, Anika Aldamuy Denise, Christopher Denise, Rita Hubbard, Kekla Magoon, Juana Martinez-Neal, Oge Mora, Hayley Rocco, John Rocco, Bob Shea, Melissa Stewart, Chris Van Allsburg and Rhode Island’s poet laureate, Tina Cane, as well as members of Rhode Island Black Storytellers. Admission to the two-hour kickoff event with Sotomayor is free, but space is limited, and advance registration is recommended online. Admission to Saturday’s festival is $5.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Write-in U.S. House candidate Lee Turner rallied in downtown Greenville on Saturday to spread the word about her campaign. Turner had no intention of running for Congress, she said, but after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, details of incumbent U.S. Rep. William Timmons’ personal life went viral online, and Democratic candidate Ken Hill dropped out of the race, Turner said: “I’ve got to do something.” Turner said she’s running a campaign based on finding solutions, common ground and bringing elected officials from across the aisle together. “I became more sure that this district needed someone like me, who was a problem solver, versus somebody like Mr. Timmons, who’s just going to tow the party line,” Turner said. While she has run for office as a Democrat in the past, Turner said she is truly an independent who believes people are more alike than they are different and hopes to create legislation with mutual benefits across political ideologies to help the masses. “Mutual benefit is the strongest glue ever,” she said. “It needs no legislation to even sustain itself, but if you do legislate it, it’s not likely to be overturned by the next party in power because it’s mutually beneficial.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A new free online tutoring program is available for K-12 students in the state, administered by the Board of Regents and funded by the Department of Education. The Dakota Dreams Online Tutoring Program is staffed by college students at Black Hills State University and Northern State University who are preparing to become teachers. The program uses a secure online platform for students and tutors to connect for virtual sessions in English, language arts, math, science and social studies. Secretary of Education Tiffany Sanderson said the program will allow K-12 students to receive individualized support after the school day has ended. “Once a parent has registered their child, students can access a tutor from home, the local library or after-school program, or even their favorite coffee shop,” Sanderson said. “I think parents are going to like this one-on-one support as much as their students.” To access the free service, parents first need to register their students to use the platform. Once registered, sessions can either be scheduled in advance or on-demand, depending on tutor availability. Tutors will be available Monday through Sunday afternoons and evenings. The service will not be available on holidays and during Christmas and spring breaks.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Country music icon Loretta Lynn was buried in her family’s cemetery on her Hurricane Mills estate Friday morning. The private ceremony of about 100 guests took place in the unincorporated Humphreys County town she bought in the 1960s after achieving worldwide fame with “Coal Miner’s Daughter.” Lynn died Oct. 4 at the age of 90. She left instructions for her funeral ceremonies, including plans for a large memorial where fans will be invited. “A public memorial is being planned,” family spokesperson Ebie McFarland said. “The family did have a private ceremony Friday with no other details available to share at this time.” McFarland said details about the public ceremony will be released soon. Loretta Lynn’s Ranch is one of the largest campgrounds in the state and draws streams of tourists throughout the year to the rural expanse, where she built an event center and other attractions. Lynn, who owned roughly 3,500 acres in Humphreys County, lived in the estate’s mansion until 1988 before turning it into a tourist center and moving into a smaller house on the property. She also built a museum and replica of the Butcher Hollow, Kentucky, cabin where she grew up for tourists to visit.\n\nTexas\n\nUvalde: The city’s school district suspended its entire police force Friday amid fresh outrage over the hesitant law enforcement response to the gunman who massacred 21 people at Robb Elementary School. The extraordinary move follows the revelation that the district hired a former state trooper who was among hundreds of officers who rushed to the scene of the May 24 shooting. School leaders also put two members of the district police department on administrative leave, one of whom chose to retire instead, according to a statement released by the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District. Remaining officers will be reassigned to other jobs in the district. Uvalde school leaders’ suspension of campus police operations one month into a new school year in the South Texas community underscores the sustained pressure that families of some of the 19 children and two teachers killed have kept on the district. Brett Cross, the uncle of 10-year-old victim Uziyah Garcia, had been protesting outside the school administration building for two weeks, demanding accountability over officers allowing a gunman with an AR-15-style rifle to remain in a fourth grade classroom for more than 70 minutes. Families have said students in the district are not safe so long as officers who waited so long to confront and kill the gunman remain on the job.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A jury found two animal rights activists not guilty on charges of burglary and theft after they allegedly took two sick piglets from an industrial pig farm. Activists Wayne Hsiung and Paul Picklesimer, with the California-based group Direct Action Everywhere, had argued during their trial that nothing of value was stolen because the 3-week old piglets were in poor condition and likely to die. The not guilty verdict was delivered Saturday following a weeklong trial. The group took a 360-degree virtual reality video of the March 2017 incident at Smithfield Food’s Circle Four Farms near Milford and promoted it online, as part of a tactic known as “open rescue” that’s meant to shed light on abusive farming practices. Investigators used the video to identify the defendants and three other activists who were charged and took plea deals rather than go to trial. Hsiung and Picklesimer faced up to 51/ 2 years in jail if they had been convicted, The Salt Lake Tribune reports. In 2017 a federal court struck down a Utah law banning secret filming at farm and livestock sites, claiming the restrictions were an unconstitutional violation of free speech.\n\nVermont\n\nRichmond: Residents of a small community were blindsided last month by news that one official in their water department quietly lowered fluoride levels nearly four years ago, giving rise to worries about their children’s dental health and transparent government – and highlighting the enduring misinformation around water fluoridation. Katie Mather, who lives in Richmond, a town of about 4,100 in northwestern Vermont, said at a water commission meeting last week that her dentist recently found her two kids’ first cavities. She acknowledged they eat a lot of sugar but said her dentist recommended against supplemental fluoride because the town’s water should be doing the trick. Her dentist “was operating and making professional recommendations based on state standards we all assumed were being met, which they were not,” Mather said. Kendall Chamberlin, Richmond’s water and wastewater superintendent, told the Water and Sewer Commission in September that he reduced the fluoride level because of his concerns about changes to its sourcing and the recommended levels. He said he worries about quality control in the fluoride used in U.S. drinking systems because it comes from China – an assertion that echoes unfounded reports about Chinese fluoride that have circulated online in recent years.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: A Civil War reenactor pleaded not guilty Friday to charges that he planted a pipe bomb at a battlefield in 2017 and threatened to disrupt additional events. A federal indictment against Gerald Leonard Drake, 63, of Winchester, Virginia, was unsealed Thursday. The indictment accuses Drake of planting a pipe bomb at Cedar Creek Battlefield during an annual reenactment in October 2017. The bomb did not detonate but resulted in cancellation of the reenactment after its discovery. The indictment also charges him with writing letters threatening violence at subsequent Cedar Creek reenactments, as well as an annual Remembrance Day Parade in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. At a press conference Thursday announcing the charges, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Virginia Christopher Kavanaugh said Drake falsely claimed connections to Antifa in his threatening letters not only to hide his actual identity but also to create additional political angst. In reality, according to the indictment, Drake was a Civil War reenactor who regularly participated in events at Cedar Creek until he was expelled from his unit in 2014. The indictment, though, does not explicitly state that bitterness over his expulsion motived his alleged misconduct.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia National Park: Park officials have closed recreational fishing indefinitely because waters have reached historic lows. The National Park Service announced it would halt all recreational fishing starting Thursday on the Ozette, Bogachiel, South Fork Calawah, Sol Duc, North Fork Sol Duc, Dickey, Quillayute, Hoh, South Fork Hoh, Queets, Salmon and Quinault rivers. The Cedar, Goodman, Kalaloch and Mosquito Creeks within Olympic National Park are also closed, The Seattle Times reports. The region for months has seen above-average temperatures and low rainfall. Seattle has had 0.48 inches of rain from July to September, while the average for that period is 3.16 inches, making it the driest such stretch on record. Park officials said they hope the closure will help protect fish, especially those trying to make upstream spawning migrations in the low water levels.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMorgantown: A West Virginia University fraternity has been cleared of hazing allegations but will be sanctioned separately on other violations, the school said. Pi Kappa Phi and the school agreed to end the fraternity’s interim suspension related to alleged hazing. The chapter will be on deferred suspension through February and lose some privileges through June, the school said Thursday. “In this case, our inquiry found no evidence of hazing, but exposed recruitment and alcohol behaviors which violate our Student Conduct Code,” said Jill Gibson, director of the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities. The fraternity agreed to participate in education, training and harm reduction programs, WVU said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A Dane County judge refused Friday to issue a temporary order that would allow local election clerks to accept partial witness addresses on absentee ballots. A group called Rise Inc. filed a lawsuit in September seeking a judicial order requiring the Wisconsin Elections Commission to tell local clerks that they must accept ballots as long as the witness address includes enough information that clerks can reasonably discern where the witness can be contacted. The day after the group filed the lawsuit, its attorneys asked Judge Juan Colas to issue a temporary injunction mandating that the commission issue that guidance to clerks. Colas refused to issue the order during a hearing Friday morning, online court records indicate. The case will continue with a scheduling conference set for Oct. 17. Rise Inc., which encourages students to vote, sued after a Waukesha County judge last month sided with Republicans and said clerks are barred from filling in missing witness information on ballot envelopes. The judge struck down guidance the elections commission put in place six years ago, saying nothing in state law allows clerks to do that. The practice was unchallenged until Donald Trump lost Wisconsin to Joe Biden in 2020. About 1.4 million voters cast absentee ballots in that election.\n\nWyoming\n\nMammoth Springs: Yellowstone National Park is postponing the opening of a renovated road at its north entrance as it continues to repair the damage from this summer’s catastrophic flooding, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. The park has pushed back the road’s opening date from Oct. 15 to Nov. 1, according to the newspaper, as park officials said they need more time to ensure that over 5,000 feet of guardrail are properly installed for traffic safety. “We have set incredibly aggressive time frames for these repairs, and our contractors have worked at lightning speed to get this road safely reopened,” Yellowstone National Park Superintendent Cam Sholly said in a news release. “It’s essential that we do not cut corners and we ensure the road meets required safety standards prior to opening.” Unprecedented flooding in June severely damaged roads, swept away homes and forced the park to close as it evacuated about 10,000 visitors. The National Park Service said the most significant damage occurred at the Yellowstone’s north and northeast entrances, where access was cut off. The flooding washed out segments of the roadway between the north entrance and Mammoth Hot Springs. To reconnect the two areas, authorities have paved and expanded an old stagecoach route from the 1880s called Old Gardiner Road.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/10"}]}

By comparison, officers at the airport found 110 guns total in carry-on luggage during all of last year. In 2019, officers found 77 guns at TSA checkpoints in the airport. Most of the guns found at airport security checkpoints are loaded, according to a TSA statement.\n\n“It ebbs and flows, and, obviously, it has to do with the increase in travel,” TSA spokesperson Patricia Mancha said. “We're seeing more travelers, so we're seeing more guns. But I think, all in all, it really does come down to the fact that people are just being careless. I mean, I don't know how else to put it.”\n\nMore:Legal fight raging as Austin wants to raze airport's South Terminal to make way for expansion\n\nMancha said when a gun is found at a security checkpoint, the TSA has to shut down screening and call in the Austin Police Department to confirm there is a firearm in the luggage and then take appropriate action. That action might be different if the person carrying the gun has a criminal record or is a repeat offender at the airport, Mancha said.\n\nThe TSA also reserves the right to issue a civil penalty to travelers who bring weapons with them to a checkpoint, including fines that can be thousands of dollars, according to the agency. This applies to travelers with or without concealed gun carry permits because even though an individual might have a concealed carry permit, it does not allow a firearm to be carried onto an airplane.\n\nMancha said it's not clear why more guns are turning up in luggage at Austin-Bergstrom International Airport, but speculated that Texas gun laws that allow open carry of weapons could play a role.\n\nMancha said the most common excuse for guns found in luggage is that the passenger didn’t realize the weapon was in the bag.\n\n“We really need people to just empty their carry-on bag before they start packing so they know what's in it,” she said.\n\nMore:Still struggling to keep up, Austin airport tells travelers to arrive 2.5 hours before flights\n\nMancha said people who want to travel with firearm can do so by checking a bag and following proper procedures. Guns must be unloaded, placed in a hard-sided and locked case, and be packed separately from ammunition in a checked bag. The locked case must be taken to the airline check-in counter and properly declared. The TSA has details on how to properly travel with a firearm posted on its website.\n\n“Our main goal at TSA is to prevent anything that can be used as a weapon on a plane,” Mancha said. “We always err on the side of caution. And so anybody who's (bringing prohibited items) is not only impacting themselves, but they're also impacting everybody else who travels.”\n\nNationwide, TSA officers detected 5,972 guns at airport security checkpoints last year, and 86% of those guns were loaded, according to the TSA.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2020/12/30/jfk-passenger-flees-tsa-find-loaded-gun-carry-on/4085708001/", "title": "JFK passenger tries to flee TSA after they find loaded gun in carry-on", "text": "If you're going to run from TSA officers after they catch you with a loaded gun in your carry-on at the airport, don't forget to grab your ID and boarding pass before you high-tail it out of the security checkpoint.\n\nA male passenger at New York's JFK International Airport learned that lesson the hard way Monday after officers found a loaded 9mm handgun in his carry-on.\n\nIn a press release, TSA spokesperson Lisa Farbstein said the agency learned the man's identity and address because he left everything behind when he fled, including his ID and passport.\n\nAccording to his boarding pass, the Brooklyn man was headed to Atlanta. Officials were able to catch his friends and interview them before they boarded the flight.\n\n“Fleeing the checkpoint does this man no good,” John Bambury, TSA’s Federal Security Director for the airport, warned in the press release. “It was foolish of him to run. We know who he is and he now faces a stiff financial federal civil penalty.”\n\nAccording to the TSA, the first time a passenger is caught with a loaded gun at a security checkpoint, they can face a fine of $4,100, though that sum can triple depending on the circumstances and the suspect's level of cooperation. The agency noted that that concealed carry permit holders are not exempt from penalties, either.\n\nIt is legal to transport guns in checked bags if they are unloaded and in a locked case. There are federal civil penalties for improperly placing a gun in a carry-on bag, and violators can lose the use of faster-screening programs such as TSA PreCheck, but criminal charges are usually left to local authorities.\n\nIn 2019, 4,432 guns were found in carry-on bags, or about 12.1 per day, and 87% were loaded. Incidents are up 5% from 2018.\n\nThat trend has continued in 2020.\n\nIn August, TSA Administrator David Pekoske voiced concern that there had been a significant increase in loaded guns at checkpoints. He said screeners are already working in conditions of heightened risks due to the COVID-19 pandemic and that \"no one should be introducing new ones.”\n\nHe added, “Even more concerning is that 80% of the firearms coming into the checkpoint are loaded, and it’s just an accident waiting to happen.\"\n\n'Accident waiting to happen:’ TSA is finding more loaded guns in luggage as flyers return", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/12/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2021/12/22/unruly-airline-passengers-lose-tsa-precheck/8994662002/", "title": "Unruly airline passengers: TSA, FAA threaten to revoke PreCheck ...", "text": "Unruly airline passengers face fines and an airline ban from flights, but the deterrents haven't put an end to the high-profile air rage incidents this year.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration and the Transportation Security Administration hope a new penalty will help.\n\nBeginning immediately, airline passengers who refuse to wear a mask, threaten or assault flight crews and otherwise behave badly face the loss of their TSA PreCheck perks.\n\nThe trusted traveler program, which costs $85 for five years and requires a background check, is a fast-pass through airport security.

The program is free, but employees attend on their own time and pay their own hotel expenses.\n\n“Though we all hope most flight crew members will never have to employ the skills they learn in this course, the disturbing increase and intensity of disruptive incidents aboard planes has accentuated the need for such training,\" the letter said. \"It is our hope that you will require and provide for flight crew members to attend this training as part of your ongoing efforts to uphold safety and restore consumer confidence in air travel.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/12/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/flights/todayinthesky/2017/01/12/tsa-finds-guns/96482178/", "title": "TSA finds record 3,391 guns at checkpoints in 2016", "text": "Bart Jansen\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nTransportation Security Administration officers found a record-setting 3,391 guns — more than nine per day at airport checkpoints nationwide, the agency announced Thursday.\n\nThe results represented a nearly 30% increase from the 2,612 found in 2015, TSA said. About 83% of the guns found last year were loaded, TSA said.\n\nFirearms and ammunition aren’t allowed in carry-on bags. TSA can assess fines up to $12,000 for bringing a gun to a checkpoint, but local law-enforcement officers press any criminal charges for the incidents.\n\nFor example, TSA officers at Washington Dulles International Airport found a 9mm handgun loaded with six bullets that a Hamilton, Va., man tried to bring on a flight to Dallas on Dec. 28. Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority police confiscated the gun and issued the man a summons.\n\n“If you’re grabbing a bag, suitcase, briefcase, jacket or other item you haven’t used in a while, be sure to give it the once-over so you don’t accidentally take something prohibited to the checkpoint,” TSA blogger Bob Burns said. “Many people who have brought guns, ammunition, knives and other prohibited item say that they did so unknowingly.”\n\nGuns and ammunition can be packed in checked luggage if the firearms are unloaded, stored in a hard-sided container and reported to the airline at check-in.\n\nTSA finds record 2,653 guns at airport checkpoints in 2015\n\nDramatic video appears to show first seconds of airport rampage\n\nThe shooting deaths of five people Jan. 6 at Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood International Airport focused attention on firearm security because the gunman allegedly brought his weapon in checked luggage on a flight from Alaska and began shooting in the baggage-claim area.\n\nThe most guns were found in carry-on bags at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, with 198, at Dallas/Fort Worth International with 192 and at George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston with 128, according to TSA.\n\nPhoenix Sky Harbor International had 101, Denver International had 98 and Orlando International Airport had 86, according to TSA.\n\nThe discoveries came as TSA screened 738 million passengers, 43 million more than during 2015.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/01/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/flights/2016/01/27/tsa-guns-weapons/79362942/", "title": "Guns at checkpoints: Texas airports tops for TSA 'catches'", "text": "Harriet Baskas\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY\n\nYou’d think by now that word would be out that you can’t take a gun — especially a loaded gun — past airport security checkpoints and onto airplanes.\n\nBut apparently not.\n\nAccording to a report issued last week by the Transportation Security Administration, during 2015 the agency found a record 2,653 firearms in carry-on bags at airport checkpoints.\n\nThat was an increase of 20% over the number of firearms found in 2014.\n\nMore alarming: 2,198 of the firearms (82.8%) found at checkpoints in 2015 were loaded. And, as we learn from the TSA Blog and its regular Week in Review feature, many of the loaded guns found in carry-ons at airport checkpoints have a round chambered.\n\nDuring 2015, TSA officers found firearms at checkpoints in 236 airports — a dozen more than in 2014. And, with 153 firearms discovered, Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport tops the 2015 list of airports with what the TSA refers to as gun “catches.”\n\nHartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport is also on the TSA’s 2015 top 10 list, with 144 firearms found, followed by Houston’s George Bush Intercontinental (100), Denver International (90), Phoenix Sky Harbor (73), Nashville International and Seattle-Tacoma International, with 59 “catches” apiece, Dallas Love Field (57), Austin-Bergstrom International (54) and Houston’s William P. Hobby Airport (52).\n\nTSA doesn’t tally the explanations or excuses but says, when caught, most people claim they just “forgot” they had a firearm in their bag.\n\nThat may be the case, but “in 2015 I think we really started to see some patterns,” said Jeffrey Price, an aviation security expert and a professor at Metropolitan State University of Denver.\n\nHe note that airports in states with liberal concealed or open carry laws are among those where the most weapons are found at checkpoints.\n\nTexas airports get ready for state�s new 'open carry' gun law\n\n“That makes sense, because when you carry and are used to carrying you sometimes actually forget you have the weapon with you, particularly if it lives in your laptop bag or purse,” said Price.\n\n“Unfortunately, some people buy a gun for protection when they see a news story that scares them or there’s an active shooter. Then they toss it in their personal bag and eventually forget about it until they go through a checkpoint,” he added.\n\nUnintentional or not, having a weapon in a carry-on is prohibited and, in addition to any criminal penalties local law enforcement may levy, TSA can impose fines up to $11,000 if they find not only loaded or unloaded firearms, but flares, starter pistols, stun guns, gunpowder, fireworks, tear gas, flammable liquids, cattle prods and a long list of other prohibited items in a carry-on.\n\nTSA spends a lot of time, energy and resources reminding travelers of the rules. And in addition to media events at airports where prohibited items discovered are discussed and displayed, the agency has an Instagram account, a blog and a Twitter feed that are quite popular.\n\nBut, when you scroll through the photos of weapons and prohibited items passengers have tried to take through airport checkpoints, it’s clear that a lot of travelers just aren’t paying attention.\n\nOr, given reports of screening failures and flaws found in the system, a lot of travelers think TSA officers just aren’t paying attention.\n\nWhy else would someone hide daggers underneath the insoles of their shoes or put fireworks, live ammunition, bear repellant, a meat slicer or really big knives in their carry-on bags? Or disassemble a .22 caliber gun and conceal some parts of it in a shaving kit in their carry-on bag and the rest of it with socket wrenches and saw blades in a checked bag?\n\nThe good news, said Price, is that the year-end numbers show “TSA is actually now finding these weapons and seemingly in more numbers than before. Perhaps the screening failure rates that made news last summer has put TSA on notice that they need to do a better job.”\n\nThe bad news?\n\n“Many of the weapons being found are ‘artfully concealed’ — a TSA term meaning the person was trying to hide the item in their bag,” notes Price. “This doesn’t necessarily mean they are a criminal or terrorist, but it is concerning that people think they can get their weapon past the screeners.”\n\nWill TSA end 2016 with another record for firearms found at airport checkpoints? The year is still young, but last week TSA officers found 51 firearms in carry-on bags and 46 in the week before that.\n\nHarriet Baskas is a Seattle-based airports and aviation writer and USA TODAY Travel's \"At the Airport\" columnist.

The city recorded a 41% increase in overall major crime through the first months of 2022 compared to the same period last year, including a nearly 54% increase in robberies, a 56% increase in grand larceny incidents and a 22% increase in rape reports, the data shows.\n\n“We’ve got to get it right,” Adams said Friday. “Two months in, we’re executing our plan and we’re going to defeat crime. I’m clear on that.”\n\nMurders increased by 10%, while citywide shooting incidents decreased by 1.3%, with 77 incidents in February 2021 and 76 incidents last month, NYPD data shows.\n\nAs the violent crime wave continues, most of the incidents are occurring in a small fraction of the city’s neighborhoods, according to Christopher Herrmann, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and a former crime analyst supervisor with the NYPD.\n\n“The violent crime problem isn’t spreading much,” Herrmann said. “The huge increase in hate crimes and subway crimes are all really just an increase of more people being outside.”\n\nThe city reported 85 hate crimes through the first two months of 2022, a significant increase from the 35 hate crimes reported during the same period last year, NYPD data shows.\n\n“The men and women of the New York City Police Department are proactively addressing the deep-rooted causes of criminal behavior,” said Police Commissioner Keechant L. Sewell in a statement. “The NYPD will never relent, and the department has made far too much progress over the decades – and invested far too much in the communities it serves – to fall back by any measure.

The department recovered 85 ghost guns so far this year compared to 20 recovered during the same period in 2021, the city said.\n\nNYPD Inspector Courtney Nilan said that the increase in ghost guns is “alarming” as they become a daily encounter for police. Officers are recovering ghost guns in responding to domestic violence incidents, robberies involving a firearm and car stops, Nilan said.\n\nTransit crimes increase as mayor rolls out safety plan\n\nCrime in New York reached historic lows over the past three decades before numbers started to go up in 2020, a spate that has continued over the last two years and mirrors what is being felt in big cities around the country. The number of major crimes reported in February 2022 – 9,138 – represents a 19.7% from 2020 and a nearly 47% increase from 2019, city data shows.\n\nSince the beginning of 2022, there have been 375 transit crimes, a jump of nearly 73% compared to the same period in 2021 that recorded 217 transit crimes, according to city data. This comes as ridership in the city’s transit system continues to increase but has yet to reach pre-pandemic levels.\n\nThe Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) recorded the highest ridership on March 1 since the start of the pandemic, with over 3.1 million riders on the subway, compared to just 1.7 million on the same day in 2021, MTA data shows.\n\nThe MTA reported 1,778 transit crimes in 2021, a slight increase over the 1,759 crimes reported in 2020 and a decrease from 2,524 transit crimes in 2019. In March 2020, before the lockdown hit, there were over 5 million riders on the subway, city data shows.\n\nThe New York City subway system, the nation's largest, has come under increasing scrutiny following the violent death of 40-year old Michelle Go in the Times Square subway station. Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nThe significant increase comes as Adams begins to roll out his comprehensive plan to combat crime and address homelessness in the subway system that will expand response teams of health, police and community officials across the city.\n\n“We are days into the first part of a long-term effort to connect New Yorkers to services and set them on a path to permanent housing and stability,” Adams said in a statement on Friday. “The systemic challenges facing people experiencing homelessness and living with serious mental illness developed over decades, and will take time to fix.”\n\nAdams unveiled the plan alongside Gov. Kathy Hochul last month, highlighting the local, state and federal resources the city will employ to combat mental health and safety amid a concerning spate of violent crime incidents occurring within the transit system.\n\nAfter the city’s announcement in late February, eight violent incidents occurred in a three-day period the following weekend on various subway platforms spanning several boroughs, including at least six people who were stabbed or slashed, CNN reported.\n\nThe joint initiative involves the deployment of up to 30 inter-agency collaborative teams that bring together the Department of Homeless Services (DHS), the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), the NYPD and community-based providers in “high-need” locations, the plan states.\n\nMayor revives ‘anti-crime unit’ in response to violence\n\nIn January, major crimes were up by nearly 38% when compared to January 2021, NYPD data shows. While there were six fewer murders in January 2022 than in the previous year, there were increases seen across every other major crime category tracked by the NYPD for the same period.\n\nThe mayor’s plan to combat gun violence in the city aims to bolster the NYPD’s efforts to fight crime with “targeted, precision policing,” focusing on the 30 precincts where 80% of the violence occurs while expanding the anti-violence Crisis Management System (CMS) to address the symptoms of gun violence, Adams said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden visited New York City in February to discuss combating gun violence with state and local leaders, which included an appearance at a public school in Queens for a talk with community leaders.\n\nThe mayor resurrected the NYPD’s controversial anti-crime unit in January in response to a wave of violence during his first month in office, including a Harlem shooting that left two police officers dead after responding to domestic incident and the death of Michelle Alyssa Go, a woman who was pushed to her death in front of a Times Square subway train.\n\nThe anti-crime unit, which was disbanded in August 2020 following racial justice protests and unrest across the country, was rebranded as Neighborhood Safety Teams tasked with patrolling high-crime neighborhoods.\n\n“We cannot rely on NYPD to arrest its way out of our ongoing increasing crime wave,” said Herrmann of John Jay College. “We need to try other crime prevention programs and develop new neighborhood and community partnerships that focus on crime prevention as a longer-term strategy.”", "authors": ["Emma Tucker Mark Morales", "Emma Tucker", "Mark Morales"], "publish_date": "2022/03/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2021/09/09/tsa-double-fines-refusing-mask-up-transportation/8264147002/", "title": "TSA to double the fines for refusing to mask up while flying", "text": "President Joe Biden's latest executive order directs the Transportation Security Administration to double the fines travelers face who refuse to mask up in airports and \"on certain modes of public transportation\"\n\nThe TSA's travel mask mandate requires masks on airplanes, trains, buses and in airports and train stations.

That's a complaint rate of 12.27 per million passengers.\n\nFrequent Business Traveler magazine polls readers about their TSA experiences and, in one 2015 survey, 87% of air travelers gave the TSA a \"fair or poor\" rating.\n\nThe TSA isn't a happy place to work, either. A 2016 survey found the agency ranked 303rd out of 305 federal agencies, a 5.2% drop from the previous year. Only the Office of Intelligence and Analysis and the U.S. Secret Service scored lower.\n\nIf you fly, you probably don't just know someone who has been browbeaten by an agent — you have a few stories of your own to share.\n\nKarin Kemp, a retired graphic designer from Charlotte, remembers the time an agent opened her wallet and rifled through the money. \"Don't ask me why she was doing that; it was never explained to me.\"\n\nGayle Sommers, a retired social worker from University Place, Wash., recalls the welcome she and her fellow passengers received when transferring from an international flight from Paris in Chicago.\n\n\"A TSA staffer literally bellowed in English for people to line up,\" she says. The screening area was confusing and chaotic as it filled with incoming passengers. The agent became even louder and more rude as the weary travelers piled in.\n\n\"The first exposure French tourists were getting to the U.S. was this guy,\" she laments.\n\nI have a few experiences of my own, too. I've been barked at (\"You're in the wrong line!\"), ordered around like a recruit in boot camp (\"Take out your laptop! Take off your shoes!\") and shamed (\"Did you forget to take this out of your bag, sir?\"). How can they make \"sir\" sound like an insult?\n\nThe answer to the problem is simple: Better etiquette training for TSA employees. Also, why not reward the agents for being nice to the passengers they're supposed to serve? The agency may even consider incorporating the word \"service\" into its mission, because it is providing a necessary security service.\n\nBut then, maybe we could stand to take a lesson or two ourselves.\n\n\"I wonder if the rude agent is a reflection of an even ruder traveler,\" muses David Kazarian, a pharmacist from Tampa.\n\nI wonder, too.\n\nHow to handle a rude agent\n\n• Report the agent to a supervisor. Ask for a Supervisory Transportation Security Officer (STSO) immediately. That's what Shirley Kroot does when she meets an unpleasant agent. \"I have encountered my share of rude TSA agents, especially in Chicago,\" says Kroot, a retired real estate appraiser from Huntley, Ill. \"After I get through security, I report them to their supervisor.\"\n\n• Complain in writing. You can send an email directly to the TSA (tsa.gov/contact-center/form/complaints). You'll want to select the category \"Professionalism/Customer Service\" when you do. Make sure you note other details, such as the name of the agent and the time and the terminal where the screening took place.\n\n• Contact your elected representative. Congress keeps a careful watch on the TSA and its activities. You can contact your representative online at house.gov/representatives/find. Congress has tried to hold the agency accountable for its actions in the past, and its vigilance is bipartisan.\n\nChristopher Elliott is a consumer advocate and editor at large for National Geographic Traveler.

What is the role of the captain and the flight crew in those incidents, and what would you advise flyers do if they notice other passengers behaving badly? Is there more the airlines or FAA can do to get this situation under control?\n\nUnruly passengers pose a direct safety threat to passengers and crew. Increasingly during the pandemic, we have seen a rise in unruly, dangerous passengers on airliners.\n\nAirline crewmembers have rules and regulations that they must follow and so, too, must passengers.\n\nEarlier this year, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Department of Transportation (of which the FAA is part) and Transportation Security Administration have said all travelers must wear their masks – properly – while in the airport, during boarding, inflight, and deplaning. And yes, that rule goes for vaccinated passengers, too.\n\nMore recently, the TSA said passengers must continue doing so until Sept. 13.\n\n► Memorial Day travel: Yes, airports will be mobbed. No, masks aren't optional. What to know about summer flights\n\nThe mask requirement is reasonable for the health of all onboard. It is no different than prohibiting smoking, or requiring that seat belts be buckled when the seat belt sign is on.\n\nIf a passenger refuses to comply with the requests of the flight attendant, then the captain will call security to remove the passenger. It is the captain’s decision whether or not a passenger is accepted for transportation.\n\nNo, it does not matter that you have paid for a seat; the captain has the authority to have you removed if you do not comply. Nor will a threat to sue change the outcome once the captain has made the decision to remove you.\n\nNo captain wants to have a passenger removed, however, if the safety of the flight is or could be compromised, then it is necessary.\n\nNo, it does not matter that you have paid for a seat; the captain has the authority to have you removed if you do not comply. Nor will a threat to sue change the outcome once the captain has made the decision to remove you. You're getting off the plane.

Prosecution can include fines and/or imprisonment. Additionally, a violator can be ban from future flights.\n\nI fully support the strict enforcement of these rules, regulations and laws. Harsh penalties are necessary and the FAA and federal authorities are right to aggressively pursue those passengers who endanger others.\n\nWe work too hard to improve aviation safety to allow a few uncontrollable passengers to reduce safety in our aviation system.\n\n► Mask fights and BYOB breaches: FAA proposes $64,500 in fines against five unruly airline passengers", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/05/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/todayinthesky/2013/08/06/gun-seizures-up-at-raleigh-and-airports-across-the-us/2624311/", "title": "Gun seizures up at Raleigh and airports across the U.S.", "text": "The Associated Press\n\nRALEIGH, N.C. (AP) - Raleigh-Durham International Airport security officers have found 16 guns at checkpoints so far in 2013, already passing the number of guns seized in each of the past two years.\n\nMost of the time, the guns are given up without a problem. While the traveler faces a fine of up to $7,500 from the Transportation Security Administration, criminal charges usually aren't filed or are dropped, according to court records reviewed by The News & Observer of Raleigh.\n\nThe increase in gun seizures are part of a nationwide trend. In the first six months of 2013, the TSA has found 894 guns at airports, most of them loaded. It is a 30% increase over the first six months of 2012. Security at the Raleigh-Durham International Airport confiscated 11 guns in both 2011 and 2012, compared to the 16 guns seized in the first seven months of this year.\n\nIn North Carolina, violators can be charged with illegally carrying a concealed weapon, a misdemeanor punishable by 30 days of community service. But Wake County District Attorney Colon Willoughby said he has no problem with dropping charges if the gun was brought into the airport inadvertently.\n\nWhat worries him more is how careless people have gotten with their guns.\n\n\"We've become such an armed society that people actually aren't thinking about the fact that they're carrying weapons with them,\" Willoughby said. \"That's a little bit sobering, to think that we are so accustomed to carrying a firearm with us that we often don't think about it or realize that we have it.\"\n\nEd Nicely of Whispering Pines said he felt terrible when he went to the airport with a .22 caliber over-and-under derringer in his carry-on bag. The 55-year-old gun dealer said he got the weapon at a Charlotte gun show and put it in the bag, then forgot all about it until two months later when he packed that bag in the dark for a gun show in Las Vegas in January. The TSA screener found the gun at the airport.\n\n\"Me being a gun dealer, I know the laws,\" Nicely said. \"I just didn't see it in my bag. I was so amazed it was there. It was a total accident. It was stupid, yes.\"\n\nThe misdemeanor charge against Nicely was dropped. He was fined by the TSA, but didn't want to say how much. A judge decides if the guns are returned, and in Nicely's case, he didn't get the weapon back.\n\n\"Everybody should know not to go on a plane with a gun,\" said Steele Myers, interim police chief at Raleigh-Durham International Airport. \"Some people are forgetful, or they're thinking that a concealed handgun permit gives them authority to do things they can't.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/08/06"}]}

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nAfter making groundbreaking discoveries about the mysterious interior of the red planet, the InSight lander’s mission has officially ended.\n\nThe stationary lander spent nearly 1,500 days on Mars. Mission managers declared the program’s end on Wednesday after the lander failed to respond to two messages from mission control at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.\n\nThe mission, short for Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport, ended more than four years after it first landed on November 26, 2018.\n\nThomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate in Washington, said in a statement that “while saying goodbye to a spacecraft is always sad, the fascinating science InSight conducted is cause for celebration. The seismic data alone from this Discovery Program mission offers tremendous insights not just into Mars but other rocky bodies, including Earth.”\n\nDesigned to last for only two years, InSight’s mission was extended twice. But a heavy accumulation of dust on its solar panels caused a steady drop in the lander’s power source.\n\nMars is a frigid desert where weather is driven by swirling dust. Over the course of InSight’s time on Mars, it survived dust storms and swirling dust devils. The clever mission team, and wind on Mars, helped clear the solar panels from time to time.\n\nNASA's InSight Mars lander took this selfie on April 24. NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nEventually, nothing could keep the red dust from building up an impenetrable layer on InSight’s solar panels, as captured by one of the mission’s final selfies in April.\n\nDespite these challenges, InSight conserved power to keep capturing science from its home in a plain called Elysium Planitia along the Martian equator. Slowly, it shut off its instruments, one by one, while listening for the rumble of Marsquakes to the very end.\n\nMartian milestones\n\nUnlike its roaming rover cousins, InSight was designed to stay in its landing spot and perform the first “checkup” of Mars, bedecked with 7-foot solar arrays, a suite of instruments and a robotic arm.\n\nInSight made history by detecting the first quakes on another planet and heard Mars rumble more than 1,300 times during its mission.\n\nMarsquakes are like the earthquakes we experience on Earth, just a little bit different when it comes to why they occur on each planet.\n\nWhen we experience earthquakes, it’s because the tectonic plates on Earth are shifting, moving and grinding against one another. So far, Earth is the only planet known to have these plates.\n\nThink of the Martian crust as a single giant plate. This crust has faults and fractures within it because the planet continues to shrink as it cools. This puts stress on the Martian crust, stretching and cracking it.\n\nThe lander’s incredibly sensitive seismometer, called the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure, could detect marsquakes from hundreds and thousands of miles away.\n\nIn May, InSight captured “the big one,” a marsquake with a magnitude of 5, which sent vibrations through the planet for at least six hours.\n\nInSight also heard space rocks as they slammed into Mars and left behind fresh, gaping craters. One revealed a treasure trove of buried ice near the warm Martian equator.\n\nWhen the seismic waves of marsquakes traveled through different materials within the Martian interior, it allowed scientists to study the planet’s structure.\n\nThe data collected by InSight also revealed new details about the unexplored Martian core, mantle and crust, including why Mars’ core is still molten. The findings can shed light on whether it was ever able to support life and how rocky planets like Mars and Earth formed in the solar system.\n\nOvercoming challenges\n\nIt wasn’t always an easy path for the lander and its instruments.\n\n“The mole,” or the self-hammering heat probe, was designed to reach at least 16 feet beneath the surface to record how heat escapes from the interior, according to NASA.\n\nThe InSight team tirelessly tried every trick in the book, including banging on it, to send the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package beneath the Martian soil for nearly two years. But the soil’s odd clumping prevented the mole from having the friction it needed and it was essentially retired in January 2021.\n\nAlthough dust ultimately ended InSight’s mission, as with other solar-powered Martian robotic explorers like the Opportunity rover, the lander made an in-depth study of its enemy.\n\nInSight collected the most comprehensive weather data of any mission sent to the surface of Mars, according to NASA.\n\nOver four years, it captured daily weather forecasts on Mars, recorded the eerie sounds of wind, rode out Martian winters, and observed thousands of sunrises and sunsets.\n\nInSight has allowed scientists a more complete picture of Mars and gathered information that will be instrumental when humans land on the red planet.\n\n“We’ve thought of InSight as our friend and colleague on Mars for the past four years, so it’s hard to say goodbye,” said Bruce Banerdt, the mission’s principal investigator. “But it has earned its richly deserved retirement.”", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/12/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/28/world/mars-winter-nasa-photos-scn/index.html", "title": "NASA images showcase eerie beauty of winter on Mars | CNN", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nMars may seem like a dry, desolate place, but the red planet transforms into an otherworldly wonderland in winter, according to a new video shared by NASA.\n\nIt’s late winter in Mars’ Northern Hemisphere, where the Perseverance rover and Ingenuity helicopter are exploring an ancient river delta that once fed into Jezero Crater billions of years ago.\n\nAs the planet’s main feature, dust also drives Martian weather. Dust usually heralds winter’s arrival, but the planet is no stranger to snow, ice and frost. At the Martian poles, the temperature can dip as low as minus 190 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 123 degrees Celsius).\n\nThere are two types of snow on Mars. One is the kind we experience on Earth, made of frozen water. The thin Martian air and subzero temperatures mean that traditional snow sublimates, or transitions from a solid directly to a gas, before touching the ground on Mars.\n\nPatchy carbon dioxide frost, or dry ice, can be seen inside a crater during winter in the Martian Southern Hemisphere. NASA/JPL-Caltech/University of Arizona\n\nThe other type of Martian snow is carbon dioxide-based, or dry ice, and it can land on the surface. A few feet of snow tend to fall on Mars in its flat regions near the poles.\n\n“Enough falls that you could snowshoe across it,” said Sylvain Piqueux, a Mars scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, in a statement from a NASA release. “If you were looking for skiing, though, you’d have to go into a crater or cliffside, where snow could build up on a sloped surface.”\n\nSo far, no orbiters or rovers have been able to see snow fall on the red planet because the weather phenomenon only occurs at the poles beneath cloud cover at night. The cameras on the orbiters can’t peer through the clouds, and no robotic explorers have been developed that could survive the freezing temperatures at the poles.\n\nINTERACTIVE: Mars and other places to search for life in the solar system\n\nHowever, the Mars Climate Sounder instrument on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter can detect light that’s invisible to the human eye. It has made detections of carbon dioxide snow falling at the Martian poles. The Phoenix lander, which arrived on Mars in 2008, also used one of its laser instruments to detect water-ice snow from its spot about 1,000 miles (1,609 kilometers) away from the Martian north pole.\n\nThanks to photographers, we know snowflakes on Earth are unique and six-sided. Beneath a microscope, Martian snowflakes would likely look a little different.\n\n“Because carbon dioxide ice has a symmetry of four, we know dry-ice snowflakes would be cube-shaped,” Piqueux said. “Thanks to the Mars Climate Sounder, we can tell these snowflakes would be smaller than the width of a human hair.”\n\nThawing frost created unique patterns on Martian dunes during spring in July 2021. NASA/JPL-Caltech/University of Arizona\n\nIce and carbon dioxide-based frosts also form on Mars, and they can occur farther away from the poles. The Odyssey orbiter (which entered Mars’ orbit in 2001) has watched frost forming and turning to a gas in the sunlight, while the Viking landers spotted icy frost on Mars when they arrived in the 1970s.\n\nAt the end of winter, the season’s buildup of ice can thaw and turn into gas, creating unique shapes that have reminded NASA scientists of Swiss cheese, Dalmatian spots, fried eggs, spiders and other unusual formations.\n\nDuring winter in Jezero Crater, recent high temperatures have been about 8 F (minus 13 C), while lows been about minus 120 F (minus 84 C).\n\nMeanwhile, at Gale Crater in the Southern Hemisphere near the Martian equator, the Curiosity rover, which landed on Mars in 2012, has been experiencing highs of 5 F (minus 15 C) and lows of minus 105 F (minus 76 C).\n\nSeasons on Mars tend to last longer because the planet’s oval-shaped orbit around the sun means that a single Martian year is 687 days, or nearly two Earth years.\n\nIce frozen in the soil left polygon patterns on the Martian surface. NASA/JPL-Caltech/University of Arizona\n\nNASA scientists celebrated the Mars new year on December 26, which coincided with the arrival of the spring equinox in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\n“Scientists count Mars years starting from the planet’s northern spring equinox that occurred in 1955 — an arbitrary point to begin, but it’s useful to have a system,” according to a post on the NASA Mars Facebook page. “Numbering Mars years helps scientists keep track of long term observations, like weather data collected by NASA spacecraft over the decades.”", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/12/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/world/ingenuity-helicopter-mars-storm-scn/index.html", "title": "Ingenuity helicopter flight stalled for first time due to unusual Mars ...", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nFor the first time ever, a flight delay has occurred on another planet due to bad weather.\n\nThe Ingenuity helicopter, which was slated to take to Martian skies on January 5, had to push its 19th flight back because of an unusually strong regional dust storm on Mars, according to NASA.\n\nNow, the team anticipates that this flight will take place on Sunday, January 23.\n\nWhile Mars is smaller and has a less dense atmosphere than Earth, the red planet still experiences the changing of the seasons and high winds, dust storms and ice clouds.\n\nOrbiters circling the planet and instruments aboard missions like the Perseverance rover and InSight lander are helping scientists to better understand weather on Mars, but much like the uncertainty factor that meteorologists experience on Earth, forecasting weather on another planet is even more difficult.\n\nUnderstanding weather and seasonal changes ahead of Ingenuity’s flights has been crucial to the success of its previous 18 aerial forays. The little 4-pound (1.8-kilogram) chopper has flown through spring and summer conditions on Mars, and autumn will begin on February 24.\n\nAs the seasons change, the air density goes through a cycle of ups and downs on Mars. Air density is one of two crucial factors when it comes to calculating favorable conditions for flight on Mars. Wind speed is the other factor.\n\nPerseverance carries its own weather station called MEDA, or the Mars Environmental Dynamics Analyzer, to help NASA teams calculate air density and measure wind speed over the course of a day as well as how they shift through the progression of the seasons.\n\nThe arrival of autumn on Mars is known as the “dusty season” on Mars because it’s when the amount of dust lofted in the atmosphere increases globally and remains this way through winter.\n\nDust is the greatest threat to Mars missions. A planet-encircling dust storm ended the Opportunity rover’s impressive 15-year journey in 2019 by draining and preventing its batteries from recharging.\n\nDust in the atmosphere can decrease the amount of sunlight that reaches the solar panels powering missions like Ingenuity. This lofted dust, which is heated by sunlight, also warms the atmosphere and reduces the air density even more.\n\nThe gathering storm\n\nThe Ingenuity team was in for a surprise when an unusually strong dust storm cropped up in the Jezero Crater region on the first day of 2022, arriving well ahead of the dusty season.\n\n“In fact, we have never seen a storm of this strength so early in the Mars year before,” wrote Jonathan Bapst and Michael Mischna, members of the Ingenuity Weather and Environment Team at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, in an update.\n\nPerseverance first spotted the approach of the January storm as dust lifted around the two robotic explorers in Jezero Crater.\n\nNASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter took images on January 9 showing the presence of a regional dust storm over the location of Perseverance rover and Ingenuity helicopter ( marked by the white circle). NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS\n\nFrom orbit, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter observed an expanding regional dust storm moving from the southern hemisphere to the northern hemisphere on Mars. From the orbiter’s perspective, it appeared that the storm may be heading for the crater and the two robots within it.\n\nAfter a dust storm reduced the sunlight that could reach its solar panels, the InSight lander, which is more than 2,000 miles (3,219 kilometers) to the east of Perseverance, entered safe mode on January 7.\n\nThe team made the call to delay the flight, and it turn out they were right to do so. Just after they postponed Ingenuity’s aerial hop, the dust storm passed over the crater. Perseverance’s weather station reflected the changes caused by the storm.\n\nThe storm has since cleared and Ingenuity is once again preparing for flight.\n\nWhat’s next\n\nThe experience of this event has helped the helicopter’s team to prepare for what to expect once the dusty season arrives. Storms that spring up during this time can morph into global storms that have swept across Mars in 2001, 2007 and 2018.\n\nAbove all else, the team wants Ingenuity to continue its history of safe, groundbreaking flights as it serves as an aerial scout for Perseverance on its journey to seek potential evidence of ancient life on the red planet.\n\nPebble-sized debris can be seen obstructing the sample collection process on the Perseverance rover. NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS\n\nPerseverance is troubleshooting its own issues right now in the form of some pesky stray pebbles that have prevented the rover from storing its seventh sample, collected initially on December 29. Ultimately, the rover may have to dump the current sample in the tube and attempt to collect another one from the same rock.\n\nDuring Flight 19, Ingenuity will essentially continue a reversed version of its journey so far. Both Perseverance and the chopper are retracing their initial steps in Jezero Crater to begin the next phase of their joint adventure: exploring the remains of an ancient river delta that once fed into the lake that filled Jezero Crater more than 3 billion years ago.\n\nSamples from the delta could help scientists better understand when water existed on Mars – and if life ever existed on the red planet.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/01/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/28/world/mars-ingenuity-helicopter-landing-gear-scn/index.html", "title": "Ingenuity helicopter takes photos of debris field on Mars | CNN", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe Ingenuity helicopter has captured a unique bird’s-eye perspective of the gear that helped land the Perseverance rover on Mars.\n\nDuring its one-year anniversary flight on April 19, the little chopper took photos of the striped parachute used during Perseverance’s landing – often referred to as “7 minutes of terror” because it happens faster than radio signals can reach Earth from Mars – on February 18, 2021. It also spotted the cone-shaped backshell that helped protect the rover and Ingenuity on the trip from Earth to Mars and during its fiery, plunging descent to the Martian surface.\n\nCables attaching the backshell (center) to the parachute (top left) appear to still be intact. NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nThe engineers working on the Mars Sample Return program, an ambitious and multimission process to return Martian samples collected by Perseverance to Earth by the 2030s, asked if Ingenuity could gather these images during its 26th flight.\n\nStudying the components that allowed for a safe landing can help them prepare for future missions to the red planet that will require landing and even launching from the Martian surface for the first time.\n\n“NASA extended Ingenuity flight operations to perform pioneering flights such as this,” said Teddy Tzanetos, Ingenuity’s team lead at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, in a statement.\n\n“Every time we’re airborne, Ingenuity covers new ground and offers a perspective no previous planetary mission could achieve. Mars Sample Return’s reconnaissance request is a perfect example of the utility of aerial platforms on Mars.”\n\nDuring entry, descent and landing, the spacecraft faces scorching temperatures and gravitational forces as it plunges into the Martian atmosphere at almost 12,500 miles per hour (20,000 kilometers per hour).\n\nPreviously, we’ve only seen images of the discarded landing gear from a rover’s perspective, like an image taken by Perseverance showing the parachute and backshell from a distance. Aerial images, captured for the first time by Ingenuity from 26 feet (8 meters) in the air, provide more detail.\n\n“Perseverance had the best-documented Mars landing in history, with cameras showing everything from parachute inflation to touchdown,” said Ian Clark, former Perseverance systems engineer and current Mars Sample Return ascent phase lead at JPL, in a statement.\n\n“But Ingenuity’s images offer a different vantage point. If they either reinforce that our systems worked as we think they worked or provide even one dataset of engineering information we can use for Mars Sample Return planning, it will be amazing. And if not, the pictures are still phenomenal and inspiring.”\n\nThe backshell and its debris field can be seen from Ingenuity's position above the landing site. NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nThe backshell can be seen among a debris field it created after hitting the Martian surface while moving at about 78 miles per hour (126 kilometers per hour). But the backshell’s protective coating appears to be intact, as are the 80 suspension lines connecting it to the parachute.\n\nThe orange and white parachute can be seen, covered in dust, but the canopy doesn’t show any damage. It was the biggest parachute used on Mars to date, at 70.5 feet (21.5 meters) wide. The team will continue to analyze the images to determine if the parachute experienced any changes over the next several weeks.\n\nDuring Ingenuity’s 26th aerial excursion, the chopper flew a total of 1,181 feet (360 meters). So far, it has logged 49 minutes of total flight time and traveled 3.9 miles (6.3 kilometers) over the past year.\n\n“To get the shots we needed, Ingenuity did a lot of maneuvering, but we were confident because there was complicated maneuvering on flights 10, 12, and 13,” said Håvard Grip, chief pilot of Ingenuity at JPL, in a statement. “Our landing spot set us up nicely to image an area of interest for the Perseverance science team on Flight 27, near ‘Séítah’ ridge.”\n\nPerseverance captured this photo of the rover's parachute in the distance on April 6. NASA/JPL-Caltech/ASU/MSSS\n\nThe helicopter and rover have arrived at an ancient river delta where water once flowed into Jezero Crater millions of years ago.\n\nThe imposing delta rises more than 130 feet (40 meters) above the crater floor and is riddled with boulders, pockets of sand and jagged cliffs – and it could be the best place to search for signs of ancient life if it ever existed on Mars.\n\nIngenuity has the crucial task of surveying two dry river channels to see which one Perseverance should use to climb to the top of the delta. It can also share images of features that could become potential science targets for the rover.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/04/28"}]}

She also accused Depp of sexual violence during their relationship.\n\nDepp claimed multiple times on the stand that he has never struck a woman, denied Heard’s allegation of sexual battery and called himself a victim of domestic abuse by Heard, which she denies.\n\nDepp and Heard met in 2009 on the set of their film “The Rum Diary” and were married from 2015-2016 before divorcing.\n\nPhotographs as well as audio and video recordings painted a picture of two people in a relationship with what was characterized as “mutual abuse” by Laurel Anderson, a clinical psychologist who worked with Depp and Heard in 2015 as their marriage counselor, in testimony played on April 14. (To illustrate how contentious this trial has been, the witness’s use of the term itself has spurred criticism.)\n\nEntertainment agent Darryl Marshak thinks film studios might – at least, initially – be hesitant to engage with the actors entangled in a controversy that has played out so publicly.\n\n“Robert Downey Jr. won an Academy Award and then aired his personal business out in the world and people kind of recoiled,” said Marshak, who has previously represented stars like Leonardo DiCaprio and Hilary Swank. “I think Hollywood is a strange place. When you air your dirty laundry in front of the machine, the executives, all the people that make the parts move, they sort of recoil from a hot flame.”\n\nDepp claims a 2018 op-ed by Heard in which she described herself as “a public figure representing domestic abuse” defamed him. He has starred in two films since the op-ed, which did not mention him by name, “Waiting for the Barbarians” and “Minamata,” both independent films.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'Every word of it is true': Heard speaks on op-ed after break in defamation trial 04:33 - Source: CNN\n\nHeard, whose countersuit claims she was defamed by an attorney for Depp who called her abuse allegations a “hoax,” will appear in the sequel to “Aquaman,” scheduled for release in 2023.\n\nMarshak said he believes Depp’s “unbelievable talent” will help him return to movie screens.\n\n“Hollywood is also forgiving and as it moves forward and this thing stops airing and Johnny is able to move fluidly back into the business. I think he’ll reemerge again,” he said. “Hollywood is a fickle place.”\n\nThe courtroom performance by the legal teams for Depp and Heard – a live-streamed trial watched by millions – may also shape industry perspective on the two stars.\n\n“Globally, people have seemingly become polarized by the trial, we have watched this unfold in the press prior to its culmination in the courtroom, ” Amanda K. Ruisi, founder and president of AKR Public Relations & AKR Ventures, told CNN.\n\nRuisi believes Depp’s representatives have been more effective.\n\n“Mr. Depp’s legal and strategic communications team have done an incredible job in delivering a consistent message in the courtroom and throughout the media, which I believe has helped corral the support from his fan base.”\n\nNot that Depp’s supporters needed the nudge. The scales of social media justice are heavily tipped in his favor, so much so that the imbalance has prompted headlines pondering the reason behind it. One writer for The Cut asked, “Here is a woman recounting, in agonizing detail, how an extremely famous man allegedly abused her. Why, in 2022, do so many people seem to hate her for it?”\n\nSociologist Nicole Bedera offered a few theories – both on Twitter and in an article for Harper’s Bazaar – about why both female survivors of domestic abuse and many women period have seemed to support Depp.\n\n“It can be scary – and for victims, re-traumatizing – for women to empathize with an abuse survivor. If violence really *is* everywhere and if it *feels* like it can happen to anyone, then a lot of women will start to worry that they will be next,” she wrote. “So is it surprising that a lot of women are coming to Depp’s defense? No. Not at all.”\n\nHeard has had her supporters, but notably fewer vocal ones than Depp – both in the entertainment business and in and around the courthouse.\n\nHeard’s former co-star David Krumholtz has come to her defense publicly, actress Ellen Barkin testified for her defense team and comedian Kathy Griffin wrote in response to a pretrial tweet from Heard, “I’m thinking about you and sending all the love.”\n\nFor two working actors, the question once court is adjourned is will producers send them scripts as reliably as onlookers have been sending tweets?\n\nFranchise futures in peril?\n\nThe crux of both Heard and Depp’s lawsuits rests in claims that their careers – specifically their futures in respective film franchises – have been adversely affected.\n\nDuring the past several weeks of testimony, Depp’s team has tried to prove that Depp, who portrayed Jack Sparrow in five films, was dropped from a potential sixth film in the “Pirates of the Caribbean” franchise due to Heard’s op-ed.\n\nJohnny Depp in \"Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales.\" Peter Mountain/Walt Disney/Kobal/Shutterstock\n\nJerry Bruckheimer, who produced the “Pirates of the Caribbean” films, told The Times that “the future is yet to be decided” regarding Depp’s involvement in a possible next installment.\n\nThe producer said that the creative team is “developing two ‘Pirates’ scripts” – one that would potentially have Margot Robbie as the lead and “one without” Robbie.\n\nThe last film was 2017’s “Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales.”\n\nIn a taped deposition played for the court, Depp’s former agent, Christian Carino, who began representing Depp in October 2016 and even represented Depp and Heard at the same time, testified that he believed accusations of domestic violence made by Heard against Depp cost the actor a paycheck that would have been worth tens of millions of dollars.\n\nAnd when an attorney for Heard pressed Carino on other issues Depp may have had while working on previous “Pirates” films, he dismissed them.\n\n“I’m aware of him being tardy but he’s been tardy on everything his entire life,” Carino said. “I think it’s troublesome to everybody, but everyone has learned how to produce a film to deal with it.”\n\nOther witnesses saw his behavior as more detrimental.\n\nTracey Jacobs, who testified in a recorded deposition and represented Depp for 30 years as his talent agent before being terminated, said as a witness that she was honest with Depp that showing up late consistently to sets and his behavior, including drug and alcohol use, was hurting his career.\n\n“His star had dimmed due to it getting harder to get him jobs given the reputation that he’d acquired due to his lateness and other things,” Jacobs testified. “People were talking and the question was out there about his behavior.”\n\nA Hollywood director, who hasn’t worked with Depp but has met him, told CNN that he doesn’t think Depp will ever helm another major franchise.\n\n“I believe that Johnny Depp will be able to be cast in various independent films because he still has significant name value and there’s an audience for him, however the studios will be more cautious because of insurance reasons and because of the potential to stop protection and they would be more concerned about public backlash as opposed to smaller independent companies,” he said.\n\nJason Momoa and Amber Heard in 2018's \"Aquaman.\" Warner Bros/Moviestore/Shutterstock\n\nWhen it comes to Heard, the director believes the attention around the trial hasn’t helped her image.\n\nCurrently, there’s a petition to have Heard dropped from the upcoming “Aquaman” sequel, which has already been filmed and is in post-production. (CNN and Warner Bros. are both part of Warner Bros. Discovery.)\n\nThat likely won’t happen. But Walter Hamada, the head of DC Films, which produced “Aquaman,” testified that the creative team had concerns about Heard resuming her role in the franchise over a lack of chemistry with co-star Jason Momoa.\n\nHe also said the studio never planned to portray Heard as a co-lead in the second film and that Heard’s role was not reduced in the forthcoming film, titled “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom.”\n\nWhatever decision the jury renders, Juda Engelmayer, founder of Herald PR, who has represented celebrities like disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein, told CNN that Depp’s time in court – which included quirky, meme-able moments involving doodling and jelly beans – has bolstered his image.\n\n“His testimony, whether true or an act, has caused a resurgence of fans who missed him,” he said. “For his reputation and career, studios see he still has a fan base,” he said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'I knew it was wrong': Amber Heard testifies in defamation trial 04:46 - Source: CNN\n\nAs for Heard, whose career was less established than Depp’s when their relationship and troubling accusations began, that’s harder to say, according to sources.\n\nAlmost a decade ago, before the drama with Depp came to light, Heard told Vanity Fair she was up for the ebbs and flows of an acting career.\n\n“Do you think you would have pursued it if you knew it was gonna be this much of a circus?” Heard was asked in a 2013 interview.\n\n“Absolutely,” Heard responded. “I love very much the struggle that you’re constantly…you’re constantly put in a state of fight or flight. It’s a constant struggle. So I don’t know if I could have it any other way.”", "authors": ["Chloe Melas"], "publish_date": "2022/05/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/04/27/corrections-clarifications-2019/3031465001/", "title": "Corrections & Clarifications 2019", "text": "USA TODAY\n\nWe recognize that mistakes may happen – or that new information can emerge after a story is published – and we pledge to address all concerns quickly, fairly and transparently.

I was originally thinking of just adding the information to this article but this one has apparently gotten so long that I’m getting a ton of lag when I’m editing it through our content management system. Technology, man. Anyway, I plan on updating both guides with new info so feel free to check back regularly!\n\nORIGINAL ARTICLE\n\nAs someone who has always pined for a Monster Hunter role-playing game for years, I was quite intrigued when Monster Hunter Stories was announced.\n\nGranted, not every Monster Hunter fan feels the same way (for traditionalists, make sure to check out our Monster Hunter Generations and XX Guide). As they say, however, variety is the spice of life. (For more about my thoughts on this game, check out my Monster Hunter Stories review.)\n\nSpeaking of variety, there are a lot of things for even veteran Monster Hunter players to pick up in Monster Hunter Stories. Yes, there are a lot of familiar touches for sure but this is a totally different game that’s founded on JRPG mechanics with a dash of monster collecting.\n\nFirst, let’s go over some of the basics.\n\nThe campaign\n\nYou start out as an aspiring apprentice Rider from the remote village of Hakum with your friends Lillia and Cheval. As you train to prepare for your trials and initiation, however, an ancient evil returns in the form of the Black Blight, which slowly corrupts the land and its creatures.\n\nSolving the mystery behind the dark Blight serves as the foundation of the campaign, which takes you from the sleepy village of Hakum to other towns and destinations around the world.\n\nGame flow\n\nHakum Village serves as the central hub at the beginning of the game. From here, you can branch out to do one of three activities.\n\nStory Quests: This one’s a pretty straightforward journey as well as all you need to do is follow the main Story quest markers to fill them. To give you an idea, I’ve included the Story Quests for the initial portions of the campaign that you can scroll down to in this guide. To give you an idea, I’ve included the Story Quests for the initial portions of the campaign that you can scroll down to in this guide.\n\nSubquests: These are optional missions that help you earn extra experience, money and items. Subquests can be accepted through the Mission Board in town as well as NPCs and range from finding items to slaying monsters.\n\nFree exploration: Monster Hunter Stories features several areas and locales that you can explore with your Monsties and buddy Navirou to your heart’s content. These areas feature gathering, mining and fishing points for collecting materials used in item combining as well as weapon and armor crafting. They also serve as home for a wide range of monsters that you can fight and defeat for experience and materials. Of special interest are Monster Dens, which contain Egg Nests that you can raid to find Monsties that you can hatch and call your own. Areas also include initially inaccessible portions that you can get to later on once you have a Monstie with the requisite skill or Riding Actions such as Jump or the ability to climb vines. To help travel more easily later on, you can also find umbrella stations that serve as hailing points for the Catavan, allowing to quick travel to places you’ve already been to.\n\nLater on, you will also unlock the ability to do Local or Online Battles against other players using your Monstie allies, giving you another activity to do.\n\nBattling\n\nCombat is a big part of Monster Hunter Stories, which uses turn-based battling that features its own unique twist on the classic JRPG system. With the exception of boss or story battles, you have the option of initiating combat by touching the enemy. You’ll want to approach and tag them from the butt, er, behind, if possible, in order to trigger an ambush with free hits. Conversely, you’ll want to avoid enemy contact on your behind as you can be ambushed as well.\n\nYour party typically consists of your main character and Monstie of choice. You can also switch Monsties anytime without penalty if you want to take advantage of attack typing or swap out a monster with low health. Knowing your Monsties attack preference, as well as the tendencies of enemy monsters, is important as this allows you to take advantage of the battle system’s rock-paper-scissors typing mechanic. This is especially important as you can not directly control your Monsties attacks (with the exception of certain skills or abilities) so you’ll want to be aware of what attack types they normally like to use to increase the chances of an advantageous matchup.\n\nAttack types: Attacks in Monster Hunter Stories come in three basic forms: Power, Speed and Technical. Each has a type advantage and disadvantage with another attack, which you’ll want to remember. Essentially, Speed beats Power, Power beats Technical and Technical beats Speed.\n\nVelocipreys always attack with Speed so you’ll want to counter them with a Technical attack to inflict more damage while taking less damage yourself. More advanced monsters will eventually mix up their attacks, adding a risk-reward element to fights. Yian Kut-Ku, for example, typically uses Technical attacks but likes to throw in Speed once in a while. This means that you can go for the safe play, which is to use Technical because it earns a draw with Technical and beats Speed so you’re never at a disadvantage. Otherwise, you can go for the riskier play, which is throw in Power once in a while because Yian Kut-Ku tends to use Technical more often. In fact, I’ve noticed such monsters typically have a pattern to their move swapping as well. Yian Kut-Ku, for example, seems to use a “2-1” pattern of Technical-Technical-Speed. I’ve also seen some monster alternate between doing “3-2” patterns like Power-Power-Power-Tech-Tech.\n\nNote that if your partner uses an attack with a type advantage and you use the same attack when the enemy uses an attack with a disadvantage (e.g. Power+Power vs. Technical), it will trigger a Double Attack, which does more damage and raises your Kinship Level more significantly. If you hit a foe with advantageous attacks three times, they will be Downed, leaving them helpless for a turn. A downed monster will also drop an item when hit. Keep in mind that you can be downed the same way as well.\n\nSpecial Situation: Once in a while, a special situation will arise in the midst of battle that requires you to input some QTE actions. The first you’ll likely see is a Power Clash, which requires you tap the A button rapidly to win the clash. The next is an Air Showdown, which requires you to alternately tap the L and R buttons to win. Last is the Breath Blast, which requires you to rotate the Circle Pad quickly. Win any of these and you will deal extra damage and gain Kinship meter.\n\nWeapon Combos: Each weapon has its own unique combo that triggers based on a sequence of attacks you pick for consecutive turns. Picking Power one turn, Power again next turn and Technical after that triggers a combo attack when using the Great Sword. Here is a list of combos per weapon.\n\nGreat Sword: Power-Power-Technical, Technical-Technical-Speed or Speed-Speed-Power.\n\nSword & Shield: Speed-Speed-Speed, Speed-Technical-Power or Speed-Power-Technical.\n\nHammer: Power-Power-Power, Power-Speed-Technical or Power-Technical-Speed.\n\nHunting Horn: Changes depending on weapon Melodies, which you can check in the Rider menu during battle.\n\nRide: When you fill you Kinship Gauge during battle, you will get the option to mount your Monstie. You lose access to several moves and commands like skills and item use. But your attack and defense gets buffed in exchange. Successful attacks fill out your Kinship Gauge further, with Double Attacks and Special Situation Attacks boosting the fill rate even faster. You can then trigger your Monstie’s special attack, with the effect increasing the higher the Level of your Kinship Gauge. Using this special ends your mount and separates your Rider and Monstie once again. A ride also can be ended if your life bar is depleted but the Rider will regain his or her original life bar prior to the mount.\n\nRetreat: Once in a while, enemies you fight will retreat after you beat them. This will cause their den to appear nearby, allowing you to steal their egg. Using a Paintball on a weakened monster will increase the chance for a retreat as well as certain actions (e.g. inflicting status) depending on the monster. I discuss this more in the Monstie section below.\n\nBattle Pouch: The Battle Pouch is where you put items that you want to use in battle such as Herbs, Potions and Flash Bombs. Just because you have those items in your general inventory doesn’t mean you can use the in battle so make sure to put the items you want to use in your Battle Pouch.\n\nSynergy Effects: Using skills is great and all but the drain on your Kinship gauge can make you wonder if it’s worth it sometimes. By using gear that matches your Monstie, however, you trigger a Synergy Effect, which lowers the cost to your Kinship Gauge when you give your Monstie an order.\n\nGear\n\nYou can acquire weapons and gear by buying them from the Smithy. In addition to buying gear, you also have the option of upgrading the gear you own if you want to squeeze more use out of them. Upgrading requires materials from the field, with each additional level upgrade requiring rarer materials. This is why it’s important to do Subquests with material rewards, hunt monsters in the field and also gather from the spots you see in the field as you never know when the mats might come in handy. Once you reach the Hunter city of Gildegaran, for example, you can also start doing Forge Quests in order to make new weapon or armor sets using the mats you get. These include full sets of weapons and armor that improve your synergy when fighting with the same Monstie that your set is based on (e.g. using Zamtrios gear while fighting alongside a Zamtrios).\n\nAcquiring Monsties\n\nIn order to acquire a certain type of Monstie, you will need to find its egg and hatch it. There are 11 types of eggs such as Herbivore, Fanged Beast, Bird Wyvern and Neotperon Eggs. Each egg type sports the same pattern for that type. All Bird Wyvern Eggs, for example, feature the same speckle marks while all Herbivore Eggs feature long stripe with rounded edges. Despite the pattern similarities, however, the colors can change depending on the kind of monster inside the egg. In addition to the colors, the name can have variations as well. A Humble Brd Wyv Egg, for example, has the same pattern but different colors than a Burning Brd Wyv Egg. Depending on where you find the egg, the Humble version can contain a Velocidrome while the Burning egg can contain a Yian Kut-Ku. You can also have two similarly named eggs that contain a different variant based on color. A Burning Brd Wyv Egg with a Purple or Yellow shell with Blue speckles, for instance, could hatch a normal Yian Kut-Ku. A Burning Brd Wyv Egg with a green shell and yellow or blue spots, however, might contain a Blue Yian Kut-Ku variant.\n\nMonstie Eggs can be found at Egg Nests located inside Monster Dens that randomly pop up in the field. Note that you can swap the egg you find a few times before you run out in case you don’t get the shell pattern, weight or smell you want at first (pay attention to Navirou's comments about weight and smell as heavier and nicer smelling eggs will have more Bingo slots and better genes respectively). In addition to regular Monster Dens, you will run into Rare Monster Dens, which are denoted by a Golden Cave. These give you a chance to acquire higher-quality Monsties with better genes. Monster Den locations also reset when you enter a town or dungeon. Some monsters retreat to their dens after you beat them, allowing you nab their egg. Later on, you'll also get the recipe for making Paintballs. The item can be used to make low-health hatchable monsters retreat if thrown three times before they faint, allowing you to find their dens. This strategy is great when combined with a Qurupeco, which allows you to call a monster in the field to battle. You can start hatching a Qurupeco once you reach Monsonne Plains near Gildegaran.\n\nInitially, you can only command Rarity 1 Monsties like Aptonoth and Velocidrome. As you progress through the campaign and increase your Rider rank, however, you can command higher level Monsties.\n\nBelow is a list of all the Monsties you can acquire on the game. I’ve included not just the location of their eggs but where you can normally find them monster themselves in case you want to fight them for a chance to make them retreat to their den. For the latter, I include paintball probabilities as well as other things you can do to raise your chances to trigger a retreat for a particular monster. Note that higher rarity monsters won’t show up in certain areas until High Rank and/or after you finish certain subquests. I added methods to make some of them pop up but not all. When in doubt, just clear your Quest Board and NPC requests as they come and all of these Monsties should show up as you get farther into the story (or, in the case of some monsters, clear it).\n\nApceros\n\nMonster Habitat: Monsonne Plains\n\nEgg Nest Location: Perennial Pass, Trese Desert\n\nRetreat Probability: Paintball (High).

Defeat while blinded (Slight).\n\nRite of Channeling\n\nOnce you reach Darj Snowfield, you will eventually learn how to do the Rite of Channeling. This allows you to transfer genes from one Monstie to another, at the cost of releasing the monster that served as the gene source back into the wild. Gene transfers allow you to unlock hidden skills and also teach Monsties moves that they normally don’t learn. By channeling the genes of a Yian Kut-Ku, for example, you can make a Lagombi learn the Fireball skill.\n\nFilling a straight line of slots with skills of the same color or pattern will also awaken secret skills. Here’s a sampling of “Bingo” bonuses you can unlock depending on what straight-line combinations you fill the slots with.\n\nFire Bingo: Fire Damage Up with straight line of Fire genes.\n\nFire Damage Up with straight line of Fire genes. Water Bingo: Water Damage Up with straight line of Water genes.\n\nWater Damage Up with straight line of Water genes. Thunder Bingo: Thunder Damage Up with straight line of Thunder genes.\n\nThunder Damage Up with straight line of Thunder genes. Ice Bingo: Ice Damage Up with straight line of Ice genes.\n\nIce Damage Up with straight line of Ice genes. Dragon Bingo: Dragon Damage Up with straight line of Dragon genes.\n\nDragon Damage Up with straight line of Dragon genes. Power Bingo: Power Attack Damage Up with straight line of Power genes.\n\nPower Attack Damage Up with straight line of Power genes. Speed Bingo: Speed Attack Damage Up with straight line of Speed genes.\n\nSpeed Attack Damage Up with straight line of Speed genes.

Anything Bingo: Max HP Up when completing a line with any gene combination.\n\nMax HP Up when completing a line with any gene combination. Non-Elem Bingo: Speed Up when completing a line with non-elemental genes.\n\nRite of Channeling is good for min-maxers or finding use for duplicate Monsties that are clogging up your stable. It also encourages you to raid those random Monster Dens and catch more monsters due to the randomness of Monstie gene slots and traits.\n\nLater on, you can also acquire Beads, which are channeling gems that grants different skills such as attack boosts and resistances. You can also acquire different H. Crystals for creating channelling gems. For even more Monstie perfection, you can find stims for unlocking gene slots, which is especially ideal for competitive players who want to further fine tune their monsters post-game.\n\nExpedition Parties\n\nOnce you reach Albarax, you will have the option to start sending your Monsties to Expedition Parties. You basically pick 5 Monsties to send out per expedition, giving them the opportunity to gather items, as well as experience. You can even whether you want them to get fewer or more items, which shortens or lengthens the time they are away. You can also instruct them to focus on gaining experience or concentrate on specific item types such as plants, mushrooms, ore, berries, fish, bugs, bones or treasure. This is a great way for squeezing in some extra gathering or leveling up Monsties that you don’t have in your battle party. The timer also keeps running even when your 3DS is in sleep mode so you can keep sending Monsties out even when you’re not playing, then check back every 20 or so minutes.\n\nRecipe Books\n\nYou can acquire books during the course of the game that contain recipes for items such as Potions, Mega Potions, Antidotes and Large Barrel Bombs.

Gives Ancient Potion.\n\nShady (068): This not-so-slim Shady with green tiger stripes is at Wintertide Tunnel.

Gives you Frozen Mushroom.\n\nWalkthrough\n\nHere’s a quick walkthrough of Story Quests from the game to help get you started. The walkthrough currently covers the events from Pondry Hill to Dovan Volcano. A list of monsters and their locations is included after the walkthrough.\n\nPONDRY HILL TO WHISTILL FOREST\n\n1 Year Later: A year has passed since the Nargacuga’s attack. Hakum Village is slowly rebuilding back to its former glory. Today is the day of the Rite of Kinship! It’s the final step to becoming a Rider, but what will you do? Head to the back of Hakum Village toward the Room of Trials.\n\nA Rider’s Trial: You have obtained a Monstie, but the Rite of Kinship is far from over! Now you must head to the Mt. Pondry Caves and immerse the Kinship Stone given to you by Chief Omna in the water there. But what could be waiting in the caves…? The cave is located on the western side of Pondry Hills. For the boss fight, make sure to check the monster list below for some quick strategies. You can now include Rarity 2 Monsties in your party.\n\nAll in One Basket: You have overcome the trials and become a Rider. Your first task, given by Dan, is to find a monster egg and bring it back to the village. Hatching eggs will get you new Monsties! Get on your Monstie and head to Pondry Hills. Just follow the marker to get to your first Monster Den. Monsties you can start hatching in this region include Aptonoth, Velocidrome, Yian Kut-ku, Blue Yian Kut-Ku and Arzuros.\n\nMy First Combo: Your Rider training has only just begun! Today’s lesson: Combining for Beginners! Select Combine from the Camp Menu and make 5 Potions! Potions are made from Herbs and Blue Mushrooms. If you don’t have enough, go find more in Pondry Hills. Use your Aptonoth’s Plant Search field skill to more easily find them.\n\nChasing the Blue Bear: You have finally been entrusted with an important mission from Chief Omna! The location: Whistill Forest. You are excited about your first expedition, to confront an angry Arzuros known as The Glutton. Steel yourself and set out on your mission! Check out the Arzuros data at the Monster list below for its tendencies.\n\nCheval and Lilia: Cheval, his hatred of Black Blight deepening, has run away from Hakum Village. Lilia chased him, heading into Whistill Forest, where the Blackgrass was found! You must go after them quickly! Check the monster list below for the Iodrome’s tendencies.\n\nYian Kut-Who? You have passed Dan’s first test… Today’s training is slightly different: You will be investigating a Yian Kut-Ku! Head to the Old Mine in the rocky section of Pondry Hills!\n\nACatavan Quandary: A Catavaner is in trouble at the Old Mine: A Yian Kut-Ku has stolen part of his cart! The sly bird, known as The Veteran, waits on the other side of the lake. Do whatever you can to fix the cart!\n\nThe Forbidden Land: The Black Blight continues its inexorable advance. Now is the time for action! If you sneak away from Chief Omna and head to the Forbidden Land before Dan, youl’ll be able to solve the problem and prove yourself a true Rider! Check the monster list below once again for battle strategies against a familiar foe. You can now include Rarity 3 Monsties in your party.\n\nDARJ SNOWFIELDS TO WINTERTIDE TUNNEL\n\nThe Mountain Hermit: While on the way to Gildegaran, you reach the White Plains of Darj Snowfields. Chief Omna told you of a Wyverian who knows the secrets to the Rite of Channeling living here. All you know is that he is “a young handsome man.” Where could he be? Monsties you can start hatching in this region include Popo, Bulldrome, Lagombi, Zamtrios, Khezu and Red Khezu.\n\nThe Mysterious Rider: As you enter the Wintertide Tunnel, you find a girl collapsed there. Enveloped by her Barioth, she remains unconscious. You can’t leave her like this, so you decide to head to the nearby cabins.\n\nA Barioth Leads the Way: On leaving Wintertide Tunnel, the girl’s Barioth is waiting! It seems to be telling you to follow it. Perhaps if you follow the Barioth, it will lead you to the cabins.\n\nAvinia’s Test: The Rider, who introduces herself as Avinia, claims to be from a different village. To prove to her that you are a rider, you must collect Mountain Herbs. It seems they are found in precarious places that can be only reached while riding.\n\nThe Darj Rock Baths: The Riddlemaster appears suddenly. He says if you can bring him Hot Spring Dumplings, he will let you stay in the cabins! You set out to the Darj Rock Baths to find some. Maybe there will be a way to heal Avinia’s wounds, too.\n\nA Monstrous Riddle: The riddle reads “My fur is white like snow, my ears long as icicles.” You vaguely remember a white monster matching that description… It was somewhere around the lake… What was is called? La… La… La-something.\n\nThrough Wintertide Tunnel: Now that your Monstie has been powered up by the Rite of Channeling, it’s time to move to Gildegaran! But beware, The Khezu that attacked Avinia lurks in Wintertide Tunnel.\n\nGILDEGARAN\n\nArrival in Gildegaran! You’ve finally reached Gildegaran, but the townspeople seem afraid of your Monsties! You have to ease their minds somehow… For now, you decide to follow Navirou’s advice and go to the Hunter’s Guild to introduce yourself to the Guildmaster! There are a couple of Lost Poogies in this building so make sure not to miss them. Monsties you can start hatching in this region include Apceros, Gypceros, Gendrome, Royal Ludroth, Cephadrome, Qurupeco, Nerscylla, Barroth and the Queen of the Skies, Rathian.\n\nMajek’s Request: The Guildmaster, Majek (The Gathering), has asked you to go out and slay a Royal Ludroth that has appeared on the coast of Monsonne Plains. Go and deal with it, and report to Majek when you’re finished. Royal Ludroth likes to start with Water Soak then use Power and Technical attacks.\n\nTotally Rad ‘Shroom Hunt: You accepted a challenging request from Reverto, or so you thought. Collecting mushrooms in the Babda Rainforest… It doesn’t sound too difficult, butmybe there’s some kind of hidden plan at work here… Get ready to fight a Nerscylla, which likes to use Technical and Power Attacks. It also likes to use a Sealing attack that prevents you from using one of your moves.\n\nScrivener’s Request: Captain Simone of the Royal Scriveners has asked you to help with a royal pain, er, monster survey. A Qurupeco has been sighted acting strangely in the Monsonne Plains. You decide to check it out. As Monster Hunter pros know, the Qurupeco in itself is not a problem. Instead, it’s the monster that it calls in that’s the real pain. In this case, the cheeky bird not only decides to call in a Rathian, it actually calls one that is blighted to boot (this guy…). I recommend taking out the Qurupeco first, which should be pretty easy. It likes to spam Technical attacks then throw in Speed. If you’re quick, maybe you can take it out before it buffs the Rathian (ungh). The Rathian will have two targets, by the way, which is its head and main body. To make the fight easy, bring in a Red Khezu as its lightning attacks do massive damage on the Rahian. Its Kinship Attack also hits multiple targets allowing you to kill two birds (or maybe a bird and dragon) with one stone. You can also equip Blue Kut-Ku armor and the Khezu Shock Sword to do extra damage and laugh off fire attacks. Rathian likes to use Speed Attacks, by the way, then occasionally throws in Power.\n\nOASUM TO ALBARAX\n\nTo Oasum: The Black Fiend has been sighted in Revero’s hometown, Albarax. It may be connected to the Black Blight! First you musts head to Oasum, where Hunters are assembling to plot their next move. Monsters that you can run into here include Daimyo Hermitaur, Barroth and Diablos.\n\nQuicksand Search: A whirlpool of quicksand stands between you and the village of Albarax. Large monsters must have caused this! Find the 3 monsters that hide underground: Barroth, Daimyo Hermitaur and Cephadrome, and get rid of them. You’ll need to go to opposing ends of the map here so make sure to find those Catavan points to make your trip easier. Daimyo Hermitaur is susceptible to Fire and Lightning and tends to use Technical attacks as well as Power. Watch out when it assumes a blocking position as it will usually counter when attacked from this stance. Barroth likes to use Speed and Power. It is also weak against Fire attacks.\n\nThe Blighted Cephadrome: The source of the quicksand was the Cephadrome! A mysterious scientist appeared with some kind of mecha-monster and a strange mood descended… The Black Blight still needs to be purified! Prepare yourself and head for the quicksand! Cephadrome likes to use Power Attacks and is weak against Ice. A Speed-loving Lagombi would be perfect against it. You can also use a Zamtrios (which is what I did as my Lagombi was underleveled) but make sure to order the guy to use a skill if it starts using Technical attacks while Cephadrome is about to do a head-to-head attack. Bring Sonic Bombs, by the way, to fish it out when it digs.\n\nThe Black Fiend: You made it through to Albarax! There, the Black Fiend, a blighted Diablos lies in wait. It will not be an ordinary fight, but you must show everyone your true power as a Rider. This guy will probably be the first legitimate challenge you face as far as bosses go. Fortunately, the right preparation will ensure you take it down on your first try. My main tip for this battle is to make sure your health is topped off, especially when it gets enraged. Diablos does its Fierce Stab move twice on the same turn when mad, which can KO targets that are not in full health. It also likes to use Power and Technical and is weak to Ice attacks. I ended up using my Zamtrios here since it was at a higher level than my Lagombi, as well as Zamtrios armor and the Zamtrios hammer. If using Zamtrios, order it to use Ice Armor on the first turn or if it wants to use a Technical Attack and you have a feeling Diablos will use Power. Besides the extra defense, the armor also imbues Ice into Zamtrios’ regular attacks, too. His Spread Frost Breath and Kinship Attack hits all of Diablos’ parts, too, making it easier to take down the head and tail. Lastly, bring Sonic Bombs to stun it when it digs underground. (After this battle, you can start adding Rarity 4 Monsties to your party. Tigrex and its eggs will also start showing up in Darj Snowfields.)\n\nBring the Water Back: Finally, peace has returned to Albarax. But the village is still in ruins. Maybe breaking the rock holding back the spring will restore the village… Do you have a monster with the Rock Breaker ability, like the Yian Kut-Ku or Lagombi?\n\nRebuilding: Albarax is nearly restored to its former glory. Now, you must gather the Grand Felvine using your Monstie Expedition Party at the Stables. Grand Felvine should convince the Felynes to help!\n\nGEO-FULKRIGHT & DOVAN VOLCANO\n\nA New Rider: According to Lilia, another Rider was seen in Gildegaran. Could it be Cheval? Or maybe Avinia? Lilia seems concerned, so you should search for that Rider…\n\nInto the Volcano! Ratha, the monster you forged a bond so long ago, is alive! Ride the grown-up Ratha and fly to the Dovan Volcano. According to Simone, Dr. Manelger is there! Head for the village in the volcano, Geo-Fulkright!\n\nOdd Rock, Odder Felyne: The entrance to Dovan Mines is blocked by a large rock. You should be able to enter via the Mine Path on the clifftop. But how does Navirou know the way when he claims to have never been here before? Something is strange…\n\nChase the Assistant! In the mines, you ran into Manelger’s assistant! Just as Captain Simone said, the Doctor’s hideout should be just through here, so chase the assistant.\n\nBig Barrel Bombs: Dr. Manelger was here after all! And the rock that was blocking the way… Wait, it moved?! Now that the route is open, you are able to meet up with Dommel and the others. If you bring him some Flame Rocks, he will destroy the rock with a Big Barrel Bomb UG!\n\nEscape from the Lava Cave! The large rock was actually a modified Uragaan! Manelger and his assistant ran away toward Dovan Volcano! Navirou is acting strangely again, but now you must slip through the lava and give chase! The main thing you need to do here is bring something to counter the heat like Cool Mist, for example (don’t forget to put it your Battle Pouch). Otherwise, it’s gonna be a long day as your actions get cancelled by overeating. The Uragaan is strong against fire but incredible weak against water. He also has a head part that lets him use an electric attack if you don’t break it. I was using a Red Khezu, however, and the monster is good at resisting the lightning attack (Khezu’s tendency to use Technical attacks, however, is a disadvantage against Uragaan’s Power attacks). For regular attacks, Uragaan tends to use Power most and then Technical attacks. He also likes to set a Powder Stone on the field that will damage you if you don’t destroy it beforehand. When enraged, Uragaan uses Power 70 percent of the time compared to Technical at 30 percent of the time when using a normal attack. For special attacks, it tends to use the tail swipe 70 percent of the time and its megaton stomp 30 percent of the time while enraged.\n\nSubquests\n\nThis being a Monster Hunter game, there are a variety of quests and subquests for you to partake in. A good number are posted on the main Quest Board that can be accessed in towns but there are also some that have to be initiated with NPCs.

And even looked up a little bit to try and get the lay of the land … I’m saying, ‘How did all that happen in just those few seconds?’ It didn’t make any sense. Like, I just don’t understand it.”\n\nHarris died just days before the 50th anniversary of the catch, and the Steelers had planned to retire his No. 32 jersey during halftime of their game against the Raiders on Saturday.\n\nThe NFL Network in 2019 named the Immaculate Reception the top play in the 100 years of the league.\n\nThe play was not without controversy: There were no convincing replays to determine who deflected the ball when two opposing players collided and whether the ball actually hit the ground when Harris caught it.\n\nIn the interview, Russo said some believe that the nose of the football hit the turf, “But you’re saying that’s not the case, correct?”\n\n“I have no idea, I have no idea,” Harris said. “I remember nothing. That’s what baffles me…”\n\nRusso noted Harris was “a long way away from where the ball ricocheted.” If another Steeler had touched the ball, Harris’ catch would not have been legal.\n\n“I have no recollection of seeing the ball at all,” Harris said. “I have no visual of the ball. I have no recollection. But look at … how fast it came back.”\n\nHarry Cabluck/AP\n\n‘You don’t practice stuff like this’\n\nLooking at the film, Harris says, “I’m thinking that it could only have been” Raiders defender Jack Tatum “that the ball bounced off of” before Harris made the shoestring catch. Tatum had collided with Steelers fullback Frenchy Fuqua.\n\nIn explaining how he made the play, Harris noted that he “always had great reflexes but you don’t practice stuff like this. … So it kind of blows my mind.”\n\nThe Steelers won the game 13-7 for the team’s first-ever playoff victory but lost their next game. Still, the team went on to dominate the 1970s, winning four Super Bowls.\n\nRusso, the host, opened the interview by asking, “How are you today, OK pal?” It was likely the last interview Harris did before his death was announced on Wednesday. His cause of death was not provided.\n\n“Doing great. Fantastic,” Harris said, though he was coughing here and there. “And, like as you said, 50 years ago, and, and it still feels brand new.”\n\nHarris then went on to talk about the game-winning drive, how it started off poorly and left the Steelers in a desperate spot.\n\n“So, things didn’t go too well on those first three plays, as you know. And then it gets down to fourth down. A long way to go. 22 seconds.\n\nAnd I go into the huddle and I tell myself, ‘Franco, this will probably be the last play of the season. It was a good season. Just play it till the end.’\n\nAnd (the coach) called that 66 halfback option.”\n\nHarris’ assignment was to stay in and block.\n\nHe recalled that “there wasn’t much … adrenaline” in the huddle.\n\nWe were winning the whole game and right at the end (the Raiders) scored. It seemed more of a letdown than anything.”\n\nHarris joined the Seattle Seahawks in 1984. Barry Sweet/AP\n\nRusso noted that Harris “did block well” on the play and noticed that quarterback Terry Bradshaw was scrambling under pressure from the defense.\n\n“My thought was to release to be an outlet pass,” Harris said. “And Bradshaw, being as, you know, big and as strong as he is, you know, guys trying to bring him down, he’s able to fight them off and get the ball into the air.”\n\nHarris said when the ball was in the air, “I tell myself, right, I tell myself ‘Go to the ball, go to the ball.’”\n\nHarris said that was his instinct because that was what he was taught as a running back in college, under Joe Paterno at Penn State University.\n\n“That’s what Joe preached to us all four years at Penn State. You know, always go to the ball … And so I start taking some steps to the ball and I remember nothing after that… which blows my mind, that I have no visual, no recollection of anything until I am stiff arming (Raiders defender) Jimmy Warren, going into the end zone.”\n\nSome old-time Raiders still salty\n\nHarris noted how important it was that he didn’t dive for the ball. In those days when a player hits the ground while possessing the ball, he was officially down and could not advance it.\n\n“How lucky am I that I was conscious that, you know, catch it that low without diving for it,” Harris said.\n\nHarris said that after the players collided and the ball deflected into the air, some of the Raiders started to clap and celebrate.\n\n“And the Raiders stop, just for a few seconds, and that few seconds that they stopped gave me the head start to get into the end zone.”\n\nAll these years later, when some old-time Raiders still assert that the catch wasn’t a legal catch, Harris says he pays it no mind.\n\n“As a matter of fact,” Harris said, “I feel good that they’re still sulking about that.”", "authors": ["David J.

He was 72.\n\nHarris’ son Dok told The Associated Press his father passed away overnight. No cause of death was given.\n\nHis death comes two days before the 50th anniversary of the play that provided the jolt that helped transform the Steelers from also-rans into the NFL’s elite and three days before Pittsburgh is scheduled to retire his No. 32 during a ceremony at halftime of its game against the Las Vegas Raiders.\n\n\"We are shocked and saddened to learn of the unexpected passing of Franco Harris,\" NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement. \"He meant so much to Steelers fans as the Hall of Fame running back who helped form the nucleus of the team's dynasty of the '70s, but he was much more. He was a gentle soul who touched so many in the Pittsburgh community and throughout the entire NFL. Franco changed the way people thought of the Steelers, of Pittsburgh, and of the NFL.\n\n\"He will forever live in the hearts of Steelers fans everywhere, his teammates, and the city of Pittsburgh. Our condolences go out to his wife, Dana, and their son, Dok.\"\n\nFollow every game: Latest NFL Scores and Schedules\n\nHarris ran for 12,120 yards and won four Super Bowl rings with the Pittsburgh Steelers in the 1970s, a dynasty that began in earnest when Harris decided to keep running during a last-second heave by Steelers quarterback Terry Bradshaw in a playoff game against Oakland in 1972.\n\nWith Pittsburgh trailing 7-6 and facing fourth-and-10 from their own 40 yard line and 22 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter, Bradshaw drifted back and threw deep to running back Frenchy Fuqua. Fuqua and Oakland defensive back Jack Tatum collided, sending the ball careening back toward midfield in the direction of Harris.\n\nWhile nearly everyone else on the field stopped, Harris kept his legs churning, snatching the ball just inches above the Three Rivers Stadium turf near the Oakland 45 then outracing several stunned Raider defenders to give the Steelers their first playoff victory in the franchise’s four-decade history.\n\n“That play really represents our teams of the ’70s,” Harris said after the ”Immaculate Reception” was voted the greatest play in NFL history during the league’s 100th anniversary season in 2020.\n\nWhile the Steelers fell the next week to Miami in the AFC Championship, Pittsburgh was on its way to becoming the dominant team of the 1970s, twice winning back-to-back Super Bowls, first after the 1974 and 1975 seasons and again after the 1978 and 1979 seasons.\n\nHarris, the 6-foot-2, 230-pound workhorse from Penn State, found himself in the center of it all. He churned for a then-record 158 yards rushing and a touchdown in Pittsburgh’s 16-6 victory over Minnesota in Super Bowl IX on his way to winning the game’s Most Valuable Player award. He scored at least once in three of the four Super Bowls he played in, and his 354 career yards rushing on the NFL’s biggest stage remains a record nearly four decades after his retirement.\n\nPOWER RANKINGS:Lions' surge continues, while Cowboys booted from top five\n\nPLAYOFF PICTURE:Chiefs wrap up AFC West, Giants clinch spot for Cowboys\n\n4TH AND MONDAY:Sign up for our NFL newsletter to get the latest news and stories sent to your inbox\n\nBorn in Fort Dix, New Jersey, on March 7, 1950, Harris played collegiately at Penn State, where his primary job was to open holes for backfield mate Lydell Mitchell. The Steelers, in the final stages of a rebuild led by Hall of Fame coach Chuck Noll, saw enough in Harris to make him the 13th overall pick in the 1972 draft.\n\n“When (Noll) drafted Franco Harris, he gave the offense heart, he gave it discipline, he gave it desire, he gave it the ability to win a championship in Pittsburgh,” Steelers Hall of Fame wide receiver Lynn Swann said of his frequent roommate on team road trips.\n\nHarris’ impact was immediate. He won the NFL’s Rookie to the Year award in 1972 after rushing for a then-team-rookie record 1,055 yards and 10 touchdowns as the Steelers reached the postseason for just the second time in franchise history.\n\nThe city’s large Italian-American population embraced Harris immediately, led by two local businessmen who founded what became known as “Franco’s Italian Army,” a nod to Harris’ roots as the son of an African-American father and an Italian mother.\n\nThe “Immaculate Reception” made Harris a star, though he typically preferred to let his play and not his mouth do the talking. On a team that featured big personalities in Bradshaw, defensive tackle Joe Greene, linebacker Jack Lambert among others, the intensely quiet Harris spent 12 seasons as the engine that helped Pittsburgh’s offense go.\n\nEight times he topped 1,000 yards rushing in a season, including five times while playing a 14-game schedule. He piled up another 1,556 yards rushing and 16 rushing touchdowns in the playoffs, both second all-time behind Smith.\n\nDespite his gaudy numbers, Harris stressed he was just one cog in an extraordinary machine that redefined greatness.\n\n“You see, during that era, each player brought their own little piece with them to make that wonderful decade happen,” Harris said during his Hall of Fame speech in 1990. “Each player had their strengths and weaknesses, each their own thinking, each their own method, just each, each had their own. But then it was amazing, it all came together, and it stayed together to forge the greatest team of all times.”\n\nHarris also made it a habit to stick up for his teammates. When Bradshaw took what Harris felt was an illegal late hit from Dallas linebacker Thomas “Hollywood” Henderson in the second half of their meeting in the 1978 Super Bowl, Harris basically demanded Bradshaw give him the ball on the next play. All Harris did was sprint up the middle 22 yards – right by Henderson – for a touchdown that gave the Steelers an 11-point lead they would not relinquish on their way to their third championship in six years.\n\nDespite all of his success, his time in Pittsburgh ended acrimoniously when the Steelers cut him after he held out during training camp before the 1984 season. Noll, who leaned on Harris so heavily for so long, famously answered “Franco who?” when asked about Harris’ absence from the team’s camp at Saint Vincent College.\n\nHarris signed with Seattle, running for just 170 yards in eight games before being released in midseason. He retired as the NFL’s third all-time leading rusher behind Walter Payton and Jim Brown.\n\n“I don’t even think about that (anymore),” Harris said in 2006. “I’m still black and gold.”\n\nHarris remained in Pittsburgh following his retirement, opening a bakery and becoming heavily involved in several charities, including serving as the chairman of “Pittsburgh Promise,” which provides college scholarship opportunities for Pittsburgh Public School students.\n\nHarris is survived by his wife Dana Dokmanovich and his son, Dok.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/12/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/22/us/five-things-december-22-trnd/index.html", "title": "5 things to know for December 22: Winter weather, Ukraine, Jan. 6 ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nGet '5 Things' in your inbox If your day doesn’t start until you’re up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix.

Winter weather\n\nA major storm system, which the National Weather Service is calling a “once in a generation type event,” is touching nearly every state in the US. More than 100 million people are currently under winter weather and wind chill alerts as record-breaking temperature drops are being observed. Denver International Airport saw a 37-degree drop in temperature over one hour Wednesday, which officials said is the biggest ever drop recorded at that location. That same day, Cheyenne, Wyoming, also saw a 30-degree drop in temperature in just 10 minutes. Governors in Georgia, Oklahoma and Kentucky have each declared a state emergency, as several other state leaders activate emergency response operations. Major cities in the South – including Nashville, Memphis, Birmingham, Alabama, and Jackson, Mississippi – are all expected to see snow today.\n\n2. Ukraine\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed gratitude for US support in an impassioned address to Congress during his first overseas trip since the Russian invasion of his country began. In his speech Wednesday, Zelensky called for more US help and stronger sanctions against Moscow, telling lawmakers Ukraine “will never surrender,” and that their support “is not charity” but an investment in democracy. Earlier in the day, President Joe Biden had announced the US will send Kyiv a Patriot missile defense system as part of an additional $1.8 billion assistance package, and Zelensky reiterated that air defense systems are crucial to countering Russian attacks. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin declared there would be a substantial investment in his military as the war drags on.\n\n3. January 6\n\nHouse Republicans released a report Wednesday focused on security failures at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, highlighting well-documented breakdowns in intelligence sharing, Capitol security and coordination between various law enforcement agencies responding to the riot. Republicans cast the report as a rebuttal to the bipartisan House select committee’s investigation into the day’s events as they are set to take control of the chamber – and endeavor to take back the narrative. The Democratic-led select committee had planned to release its final report on Wednesday but has delayed the rollout until today. An executive summary released Monday laid blame for the insurrection squarely on former President Donald Trump.\n\n4. Crypto\n\nSam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced co-founder and former CEO of crypto exchange FTX, is expected to soon be arraigned in the US after being extradited from the Bahamas Wednesday night. He faces eight counts of fraud and conspiracy following an indictment by federal prosecutors. In the wake of the company’s collapse, federal prosecutors in New York charged him with defrauding investors and stealing billions from FTX customer assets to pay for losses at his hedge fund. If convicted on all charges, the 30-year-old could face life in prison. Two of Bankman-Fried’s former senior executives were also charged Wednesday for their roles in the yearslong scheme. They pleaded guilty to multiple criminal charges and are cooperating with federal prosecutors, according to court records.\n\n5. Covid-19\n\nParts of China hit hard by rising Covid-19 cases have resorted to rationing the amount of medicine for sale down to the pill as the country faces a huge wave of infections. Local versions of Tylenol and Advil – some of the most common drugs used to alleviate flu-like symptoms – are nearly impossible to get at drugstores across China, fueling anger and concern. In some areas, purchases of ibuprofen are being strictly limited to a maximum of six tablets or 3 ounces of liquid per customer per week. Meanwhile in the US, Covid-19 and other causes have driven life expectancy down to 76.4 years, the lowest it has been since 1996, CDC data shows.\n\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\n\nRunaway llama outsmarts officers in lengthy police chase\n\nThe adventurous llama caused some drama after escaping her enclosure in Fairfax County, Virginia.

Harris was a four-time Super Bowl champion, winning MVP honors in Super Bowl IX after rushing for 158 yards in the game against the Minnesota Vikings to help the Steelers capture their first-ever league title.

The moment his shoe-top grab eternally known as the “Immaculate Reception” entered the lexicon, they rarely lost.\n\nHarris, whose heads-up thinking authored the most iconic play in NFL history, has died. He was 72. Harris' son, Dok, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that his father died overnight. No cause of death was given.\n\nFollow every game: Latest NFL Scores and Schedules\n\nHis death comes two days before the 50th anniversary of the play that provided the jolt that helped transform the Steelers from also-rans into the NFL's elite, and three days before Pittsburgh is scheduled to retire his No. 32 during a ceremony at halftime of its game against the Las Vegas Raiders. Harris had been busy in the run-up to the celebration, doing media interviews Monday to talk about a moment to which he is forever linked.\n\n“It is difficult to find the appropriate words to describe Franco Harris’ impact on the Pittsburgh Steelers, his teammates, the City of Pittsburgh and Steelers Nation,” team President Art Rooney II said in a statement. “From his rookie season, which included the Immaculate Reception, through the next 50 years, Franco brought joy to people on and off the field. He never stopped giving back in so many ways. He touched so many, and he was loved by so many.”\n\nEven in retirement, Harris remained a fixture in the community and a team whose standard of excellence began with a young kid from New Jersey who saw the ball in the air and kept on running. It wasn't uncommon for Harris to stop by the Steelers' practice facility to chat with players who weren't even born before his fateful play.\n\n“I just admire and love the man,” coach Mike Tomlin said. \"There’s so much to be learned from him in terms of how he conducted himself, how he embraced the responsibilities of being Franco for Steeler Nation, for this community ... He embraced it all and did it with such grace and class and patience and time for people.”\n\nHarris ran for 12,120 yards and won four Super Bowl rings with the Steelers in the 1970s, a dynasty that began in earnest when Harris decided to keep running during a last-second heave by Pittsburgh quarterback Terry Bradshaw in a playoff game against Oakland in 1972.\n\nWith Pittsburgh trailing 7-6 and facing fourth-and-10 from its own 40-yard line and 22 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter, Bradshaw drifted back and threw deep to running back Frenchy Fuqua. Fuqua and Oakland defensive back Jack Tatum collided, sending the ball careening back toward midfield in the direction of Harris. Game officials weren’t sure who deflected the pass; replays were inconclusive.\n\nWhile nearly everyone else on the field stopped, Harris kept his legs churning, snatching the ball just inches above the turf near the Oakland 45, then outracing several stunned Raider defenders to give the Steelers their first playoff victory some four decades after founder Art Rooney Sr. brought the still-fledgling NFL to western Pennsylvania.\n\n“That play really represents our teams of the ’70s,” Harris said after the \"Immaculate Reception\" was voted the greatest play in the league's first 100 years in 2020.\n\nThough the Raiders cried foul in the moment, over time they somewhat embraced their role in NFL lore. Oakland linebacker Phil Villapiano, who was covering Harris on the play, even attended a 40th-anniversary celebration of the play in 2012, when a small monument commemorating the exact location of Harris’ catch was unveiled. Villapiano still plans to attend Saturday night's jersey retirement ceremony for his former rival-turned-friend, and is just fine with the mystery that still surrounds what actually happened at 3:29 p.m. on Dec. 23, 1972.\n\n\"There’s so many angles and so many things. Nobody will ever figure that out,” Villapiano said. “Let’s let it go on forever.”\n\nWhile the Steelers fell the next week to Miami in the AFC championship, Pittsburgh was on its way to becoming the dominant team of the 1970s, twice winning back-to-back Super Bowls, first after the 1974 and 1975 seasons and again after the 1978 and 1979 seasons.\n\nAnd it all began with a play that shifted the fortunes of a franchise and, in some ways, a region.\n\n“It’s hard to believe it’s been 50 years, that’s a long time,” Harris said in September when the team announced it would retire his number. “And to have it so alive, you know, is still thrilling and exciting. It really says a lot. It means a lot.”\n\nHarris, a 6-foot-2, 230-pound workhorse from Penn State, found himself in the center of it all. He churned for a then-record 158 yards rushing and a touchdown in Pittsburgh's 16-6 victory over Minnesota in Super Bowl IX on his way to winning the game's Most Valuable Player award. He scored at least once in three of the four Super Bowls he played in, and his 354 career yards rushing on the NFL's biggest stage remains a record nearly four decades after his retirement.\n\n“One of the kindest, gentlest men I have ever known,” Hall of Famer Tony Dungy, a teammate of Harris' in Pittsburgh in the late 1970s, posted on Twitter. “He was a great person & great teammate. Hall of Fame player but so much more than that. A tremendous role model for me!”\n\nBorn in Fort Dix, New Jersey, on March 7, 1950, Harris played collegiately at Penn State, where his primary job was to open holes for backfield mate Lydell Mitchell. The Steelers, in the final stages of a rebuild led by Hall of Fame coach Chuck Noll, saw enough in Harris to make him the 13th overall pick in the 1972 draft.\n\n“When (Noll) drafted Franco Harris, he gave the offense heart, he gave it discipline, he gave it desire, he gave it the ability to win a championship in Pittsburgh,” Hall of Fame wide receiver Lynn Swann said of his frequent roommate on team road trips.\n\nHarris' impact was immediate. He won the NFL's Rookie of the Year award in 1972 after rushing for a then-team-rookie record 1,055 yards and 10 touchdowns as the Steelers reached the postseason for just the second time.\n\nThe city's large Italian-American population embraced Harris immediately, led by two local businessmen who founded what became known as “Franco's Italian Army,” a nod to Harris' roots as the son of an African-American father and an Italian mother.\n\nThough the “Immaculate Reception” made Harris a star, he typically preferred to let his play and not his mouth do the talking. On a team that featured big personalities in Bradshaw, defensive tackle Joe Greene and linebacker Jack Lambert among others, the intensely quiet Harris spent 12 seasons as the engine that helped Pittsburgh's offense go.\n\nEight times he topped 1,000 yards rushing in a season, including five times while playing a 14-game schedule. He piled up an additional 1,556 yards rushing and 16 rushing touchdowns in the playoffs, both second all-time behind Emmitt Smith.\n\nDespite his gaudy numbers, Harris stressed that he was just one cog in an extraordinary machine that redefined greatness.\n\n“You see, during that era, each player brought their own little piece with them to make that wonderful decade happen,” Harris said during his Hall of Fame speech in 1990. “Each player had their strengths and weaknesses, each their own thinking, each their own method, just each, each had their own. But then it was amazing, it all came together, and it stayed together to forge the greatest team of all times.”\n\nHarris also made it a habit to stick up for his teammates. When Bradshaw took what Harris felt was an illegal late hit from Dallas linebacker Thomas “Hollywood” Henderson in the second half of their meeting in the Super Bowl following the 1978 season, Harris basically demanded that Bradshaw give him the ball on the next play. All Harris did was sprint up the middle 22 yards — right by Henderson — for a touchdown that gave the Steelers an 11-point lead they would not relinquish on their way to their third championship in six years.\n\nDespite all of his success, his time in Pittsburgh ended acrimoniously when the Steelers cut him after he held out during training camp before the 1984 season. Noll, who leaned on Harris so heavily for so long, famously answered “Franco who?” when asked about Harris' absence from the team's camp.\n\nHarris signed with Seattle, running for just 170 yards in eight games before being released in midseason. He retired as the NFL's third all-time leading rusher behind Walter Payton and Jim Brown.\n\n\"I don’t even think about that (anymore),” Harris said in 2006. “I’m still black and gold.”\n\nHarris remained in Pittsburgh following his retirement, opening a bakery and becoming heavily involved in several charities, including serving as the chairman of “Pittsburgh Promise,\" which provides college scholarship opportunities for Pittsburgh Public School students.\n\n“I think everybody knows Franco, not just for the work he did on the field but off the field,” Steelers defensive lineman Cam Heyward said Wednesday. “I think he was there making change, being involved in everything he could.”\n\nHarris is survived by his wife, Dana Dokmanovich, and son Dok.\n\n___\n\nAP Pro Football Writer Josh Dubow in San Francisco contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://apnews.com/hub/pro-32 and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/12/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/08/us/2022-in-review-fast-facts/index.html", "title": "2022 In Review Fast Facts | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nHere is a look back at the events of 2022.\n\nNotable US Events\n\nJanuary 3 - The US Food and Drug Administration expands the emergency use authorization for Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine boosters to children ages 12 to 15.
