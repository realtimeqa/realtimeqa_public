In this historic win, his running mate Francia Marquez will now become the first Afro-Colombian to hold executive powers.\n\nDuring his victory speech on Sunday night, Petro said he is open to dialogue with Hernandez. He also called for a Great National agreement to end violence in the country, saying, \"What is coming here is real change, real change. That is what we are committing our lives to. We will not betray the electorate that has demanded that Colombia change from today.\"\n\n\"Let's celebrate the first popular victory. May so many sufferings be cushioned in the joy that today floods the heart of the homeland,\" Petro tweeted in celebration on Sunday night.\n\nOutgoing Colombian President Ivan Duque said he called Petro to congratulate him on his victory and that they had \"agreed to meet in the coming days to initiate a harmonious, institutional and transparent transition.\"\n\nPetro, left, and Noemi Sanin, of the Conservative Party, gesture as they take part in a televized presidential debate in Bogota in May 2010.\n\nShortly after Petro claimed victory, rival Hernandez gave a speech saying he accepted the result.\n\n\"I accept the result as it should be if we want our institutions to be strong. I sincerely hope that this decision that has been taken is beneficial for all and that Colombia is heading towards the change that prevailed in the vote in the first round,\" he said.\n\nHernandez also said he hopes Petro knows how to lead the country and that \"(Petro) is faithful to his speech against corruption and that he does not disappoint those who trust him.\"\n\nBoth candidates had run on promises of change, seeking to take advantage of how many Colombians are fed up with Duque -- a leader whose tenure has been defined by his administration's handling of police conduct, inequality, and clashes between organized criminal groups.\n\nPetro, 62, had already seen two failed presidential bids in 2010 and 2018. Sunday's run-off vote suggests that he has finally overcome the hesitation of voters who once saw him a radical left-wing outsider -- no small feat for a politician looking to win over one of South America's most conservative countries.\n\nThe support Petro has garnered can be partially attributed to Colombia's worsening socioeconomic situation, including deteriorating living conditions, made worse by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and the impact of the war in Ukraine.\n\nWhile Colombia has seen impressive economic growth in recent years, inequality rates remain among the world's highest, with nearly half of Colombians saying that the economy is headed in the wrong direction, according to a recent Gallup poll\n\nPetro has historically campaigned in favor of higher corporate taxes and public subsidies for the working class and the poor, a tactic that might help him draw more people from that demographic to his camp.\n\nPetro's party and allies were already the largest bloc in the Senate -- though they do not control a majority of seats.\n\nA chequered past\n\nBorn in the rural north Colombian town of Ciénaga de Oro, Petro spent his youth in the ranks of a leftist guerrilla movement, the 19th of April Movement (M19) --- founded to protest against allegations of fraud in the 1970 elections.\n\nThe group was part of a so-called second wave of guerrilla movements in the country that swept the region in the 1970s under the influence of the Cuban Revolution.\n\nM19 was associated with illegal activity -- including alleged kidnappings for ransom -- but Petro says he carried out legal activities that aimed to mobilize people to stand up to what he called a \"false democracy,\" even serving as a councilman in the city of Zipaquirá.\n\nPetro was detained by the police in 1985 for concealing weapons. Shortly after, M19 launched an attack to take over Bogota's Supreme Court building that left at least 98 people killed, including 12 magistrates (11 are still missing). Petro denies he was involved in the assault, which took place while he was behind bars.\n\nColombian military protect a group of magistrates leaving the Palace of Justice in Bogota on November 6, 1985.\n\nBy the time Petro was released in 1987, after 18 months in military jail, his ideological perspective had changed. He said that time helped him realize that an armed revolution was not the best strategy to win popular support.\n\nTwo years later, M19 entered peace negotiations with the Colombian state, with Petro ready to fight the system from the inside.\n\nA steady campaign\n\nSince losing the 2018 election, Petro has consistently tried to play down fears that his economic plan -- which also proposes a halt to fossil fuel explorations and renegotiation of international trade agreements -- is \"too radical\" for Colombia. He has since surrounded himself with more traditional politicians who could build bridges with the establishment.\n\nNow, he's presenting himself as a new type of progressive.\n\nIn April, he signed a pledge not to expropriate any private land if elected. He's also tipped a moderate to be his economic minister, and has sought to make international ties with new progressives, such as the United States' Congressional Progressive Caucus, rather than traditional left-wing leaders like Bolivia's Evo Morales.\n\nPetro speaks during his closing campaign rally ahead of the first round of the presidential elections, in Bogota, Colombia on May 22.\n\nHis critics have said he is too intellectual and detached -- if not outright pedantic, with even his own campaign team referring to him as \"the Petroxplainer,\" given his tendency to lecture.\n\nTo counter this, he's been campaigning in some of the country's most impoverished areas, where he's been chatting with locals in conversations streamed on Instagram.\n\nPetro bet on Colombians to believe in him as an evolved politician, telling CNN that he's managed to successfully combine his revolutionary zeal with practice public management.\n\nNext, the former guerrilla -- whose nom-de-guerre Aureliano Buendia is taken from writer Gabriel Garcia Marquez's magical realism classic, One Hundred Years of Solitude -- hopes to trigger a scientific revolution in Colombia, asking economists to run through his proposals.\n\n\"Magical realism comes from the heart while my scientific proposals are from the brain.

At the time, a report from the National Taxpayer Advocate called the situation a “crisis.”\n\nThe individual returns that were filed last year without errors are all expected to be processed by the end of this week. Business paper returns filed in 2021 will follow shortly after.\n\nTo work through the backlog, IRS employees have logged 500,000 hours of overtime so far this year. The IRS shifted 2,000 employees from other parts of the agency to help process returns and also hired more than 1,500 new workers.\n\n“Completing the individual returns filed last year with no errors is a major milestone, but there is still work to do,” said IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig in a statement.\n\nThere are millions of remaining tax returns to process that were filed this year. While the agency is behind compared with years prior to the pandemic, it is ahead of last year by about 1 million returns.\n\nThe IRS has been able to keep pace with electronically filed returns – processing them on average within eight to 21 days – but it takes longer to process the returns filed on paper. However, the agency has automated the correction of common mistakes made on paper tax returns, speeding up that process. Last filing season, an IRS tax examiner required roughly one hour to clear 70 returns.

No punitive compensation was awarded.\n\nHuth first filed the case in 2014, claiming sexual battery and both intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress. The original filing stated that the incident happened in 1974 when Huth was 15 years old, but the timeline was later revised to 1975, when Huth was 16.\n\nJudy Huth (left) arrives outside the courthouse for the start of her civil trial against actor Bill Cosby, on June 1, 2022 at Los Angeles Superior Court in Santa Monica, California.

After befriending Huth and a friend, Cosby allegedly invited them to join him at his tennis club. From there, Huth alleged, the comedian invited them to a house where he served the young women multiple alcoholic drinks and then took them to the Playboy Mansion.\n\nHuth alleged that though Cosby knew her age and that of her friend, he directed the teens “that if any of the Playboy bunnies asked their age, they should say they were 19.”\n\nHuth further claimed that Cosby took her to a bedroom in the mansion where he sexually molested her.\n\nCNN has reached out to Cosby’s attorneys for comment on the verdict.\n\nHuth was all smiles when she briefly spoke to reporters outside a Santa Monica courthouse.\n\n“I was elated,” she said of the verdict. “It has been so many years, so many tears.”\n\nThis case “proves that you can run but you can’t hide,” said Nathan Goldberg, an attorney for Huth.\n\nCosby’s spokesman and attorney were loudly jeered by onlookers as they gave statements to the media.\n\n“What happened today wasn’t a victory, because they didn’t get the punitive damages,” said Cosby’s spokesperson Andrew Wyatt, insisting that Cosby is happy with the verdict.\n\nCosby was not present for the trial or the verdict, and his team plans to file an appeal.\n\nSince 2005, more than 50 women have come forward to accuse Cosby of sexual assault.

It is a situation compounded by the Taliban seizing power in August 2021, which led the United States and its allies freezing about $7 billion of the country’s foreign reserves and cutting off international funding.\n\nThe situation has crippled an economy already heavily dependent on aid. Following the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan last year, its economy has gone into freefall with the World Bank forecasting in April that a “combination of declining incomes and increasing prices has driven a severe deterioration in household living standards.”\n\nMany of the areas' traditional houses are made of mud and other natural materials, making them vulnerable to damage.

The shot was administered in his thigh. He cried for a few seconds but then his attention turned toward a golden retriever that was on site as a comfort dog provided by the hospital.\n\n“I’m feeling really thrilled that we have this opportunity,” DeRoo, a pediatrician at Children’s National Hospital in Washington, DC, told CNN’s Suzanne Malveaux on Tuesday about her son’s vaccination.\n\nDeRoo added that her family now will feel more comfortable participating in certain activities, knowing that their youngest son has started his Covid-19 vaccine series.\n\n“It will certainly allow us to have more freedom with our personal lives and what we do,” DeRoo said. “And for the baby, we’ll feel like we have cloaked him in as much protection as we can.”\n\nCovid-19 vaccinations for children younger than 5 are beginning Tuesday across the United States, marking a milestone in the nation’s fight against the disease.\n\nLast week, the US Food and Drug Administration expanded the emergency use authorizations for Moderna’s vaccine to include children 6 months through 17 years and Pfizer/BioNTech’s for children 6 months through 4 years.\n\nThen on Saturday, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky signed off on Covid-19 vaccinations for children under 5, clearing the way for vaccinations to be administered in that age group.\n\nAbout 17 million kids under the age of 5 are now eligible for Covid-19 vaccines.\n\n“This is a big day. We’ve been waiting a long time for children to have access to the vaccine. We now have every age group, 6 months and above, in the country which is now eligible to get protection from the Covid-19 vaccine. And I’ll tell you as a dad of a 4-year-old, this is a big deal for my family as well,” US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy told CNN’s Brianna Keilar on Tuesday morning.\n\nAs of the end of Tuesday, the US Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) has delivered approximately 2.7 million doses of vaccine for children under 5 nationwide.\n\n“Another 1 million doses have been shipped and will soon be received by administration sites,” Tim Granholm, an HHS spokesperson, wrote in an email to CNN on Wednesday morning.\n\n“HHS has received orders for approximately 4.2 million doses to date,” Granholm wrote. “We will continue to deliver vaccines expeditiously as we fulfill orders and take new ones. We made 10 million doses of vaccine available for ordering initially, with millions more available soon, so supply should not be a barrier to someone getting their young child vaccinated.”\n\nVaccines given in child-sized doses\n\nUnder the FDA’s authorization, the Moderna vaccine can be given as a two-dose primary series, with doses given four weeks apart, at 25 micrograms each dose, to infants and children 6 months through 5 years of age.\n\nWhile the FDA has authorized Moderna’s vaccine for children ages 6 to 17, the CDC has not yet recommended it for that age group, so those shots can’t be administered yet. The FDA authorization would allow children ages 6 to 11 to receive doses are 50 micrograms each. For those ages 12 and older, it would be administered as 100-microgram doses.\n\nThe Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine now can be given as a three-dose primary series, at 3 micrograms each dose, for use in infants and children 6 months through 4 years. The vaccine is administered as a two-dose primary series at 10 micrograms per dose for children 5 to 11 and at 30 micrograms per dose for adolescents and adults ages 12 and older.\n\nCompleting the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine series is a longer process, as the first two doses are administered three weeks apart, and then the third dose is given eight weeks later.\n\nDr. Jeannette Lee of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, who serves on the FDA’s vaccine advisory committee, expressed concern about children not completing all three doses.\n\n“Three doses will certainly benefit. I have a lot of concern that many of these kids will not get a third dose,” Lee said. “My concern is that you have to get the three doses to really get what you need.”\n\nAs for children who might turn from age 4 to 5 at any point while completing their Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine series, the CDC recommends two options. The child could complete the two-dose primary series authorized for children ages 5 to 11, or they could complete the three-dose series for younger kids, but each of doses 2 and 3 may be either the dosage for younger children or ages 5 to 11.\n\nThe FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee determined that the benefits of both vaccines outweigh the risks and noted that the vaccines have been “well-tolerated” among the children who got them in clinical trials.\n\nAccording to clinical trial data, common side effects for both vaccines include pain at the injection site, headache, fever, chills and fatigue. The vaccines appeared to elicit similar immune responses in children as has been seen in adults.\n\nWhere young children can get vaccinated\n\nPediatricians’ offices and pharmacies are the main sites where young children could get vaccinated.\n\n“We know that parents are going to want to get their children vaccinated in pediatricians’ offices. Some people will go to a pharmacy, some people will go to a children’s hospital or some sort of a community health center,” Dr. Ashish Jha, the White House’s Covid-19 response coordinator, said Monday on CBS.\n\n“But the bottom line is, I think a majority of parents are going to want to get their child vaccinated in their pediatrician’s office,” Jha said. “So, many pediatricians are going to be offering the vaccine.”\n\nAs for the pharmacy locations offering these child-sized vaccines, CVS and Walgreens have announced plans to provide vaccinations.\n\nCVS will begin administering Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccines to children under five on Tuesday, a communications representative told CNN.\n\n“We will begin administering the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine for eligible children 18 months through four years of age at our 1,100 MinuteClinic locations starting on Tuesday,” Matt Blanchette, senior manager of retail communications with CVS Pharmacy, told CNN in an email.\n\n“MinuteClinic is located inside select CVS Pharmacy stores in 35 states and Washington, DC,” Blanchette said. Appointments will be available on a rolling basis according to vaccine supply.\n\nBlanchette said children over 5 will still be able to access Covid-19 vaccines in CVS pharmacies.\n\nOn Saturday, Walgreens announced in a news release that appointments for vaccinations in young children will be available starting June 25. Walgreens will be vaccinating children 3 and older at “select” locations, and appointments can be scheduled online.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nHy-Vee pharmacies will have Covid-19 vaccinations available for children under 5 once doses are available, a communications representative told CNN on Monday.\n\n“Hy-Vee anticipates receiving its allocations for the newly approved age groups in the coming days,” Tina Potthoff, senior vice president of communications, wrote in an email.\n\n“As soon as we receive vaccine and our appointment scheduler is open for these age groups, we will post an update on our COVID-19 vaccine landing page, post on our Hy-Vee store Facebook pages, and contact media outlets in our eight-state region to make them aware of our pediatric hubs that are accepting appointments.”\n\nDue to federal regulations, she wrote, Hy-Vee will only be providing vaccinations to children 3 and older.\n\n“Under the PREP Act, retail pharmacies, including Hy-Vee pharmacies, are only authorized to administer vaccines to patients ages 3+,” Potthoff wrote in the email. “Patients younger than age 3 should visit their pediatrician or health care provider to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.”", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/06/21"}]}
