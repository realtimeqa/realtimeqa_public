Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nA NASA spacecraft has intentionally slammed into an asteroid in humanity’s first test of planetary defense.\n\nThe impact occurred at 7:14 p.m. ET greeted by cheers from the mission team in Laurel, Maryland. The DART mission, or the Double Asteroid Redirection Test, launched 10 months ago.\n\nWhile the asteroid, Dimorphos, was not at risk of impacting Earth, this demonstration could determine how to deflect space rocks that could pose a threat to Earth in the future.\n\n“We’re embarking on a new era of humankind, an era in which we potentially have the capability to protect ourselves from something like a dangerous, hazardous asteroid impact,” said Lori Glaze, director of NASA’s Planetary Science Division. “What an amazing thing. We’ve never had that capability before.”\n\nA detailed view of Dimorphos can be seen seconds before the DART spacecraft hit the asteroid. NASA\n\nAt the time of impact, Didymos and Dimorphos were relatively close to Earth – within 6.8 million miles (11 million kilometers). The team estimates that the spacecraft hit the asteroid at a point about 55 feet (17 meters) away from the space rock’s center.\n\nThe goal of the spacecraft, in addition to impact, is to affect the motion of an asteroid in space, but DART team members say it will take about two months for scientists to determine if the asteroid’s orbit changed.\n\nThe mission is heading for Dimorphos, a small moon orbiting the near-Earth asteroid Didymos. The asteroid system poses no threat to Earth, NASA officials have said, making it a perfect target to test out a kinetic impact – which may be needed if an asteroid is ever on track to hit Earth.\n\nThe event will be the agency’s first full-scale demonstration of deflection technology that can protect the planet.\n\n“For the first time ever, we will measurably change the orbit of a celestial body in the universe,” said Robert Braun, head of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory’s Space Exploration Sector.\n\nINTERACTIVE: One spacecraft’s journey to test Earth’s planetary defenses\n\nNear-Earth objects are asteroids and comets with orbits that place them within 30 million miles (48.3 million kilometers) of Earth. Detecting the threat of near-Earth objects, or NEOs, that could cause grave harm is a primary focus of NASA and other space organizations around the world.\n\nCollision course\n\nAstronomers discovered Didymos more than two decades ago. It means “twin” in Greek, a nod to how the asteroid forms a binary system with the smaller asteroid, or moon. Didymos is nearly half a mile (0.8 kilometer) across.\n\nMeanwhile, Dimorphos is 525 feet (160 meters) in diameter, and its name means “two forms.”\n\nOn the day of impact, images taken by DRACO will not only reveal our first look at Dimorphos, but the spacecraft will use them to autonomously guide itself for an encounter with the tiny moon.\n\nDuring the event, these images will stream back to Earth at a rate of one per second, providing a “pretty stunning” look at the moon, said Nancy Chabot, planetary scientist and DART coordination lead at the Applied Physics Laboratory.\n\nAt the time of impact, Didymos and Dimorphos will be relatively close to Earth – within 6.8 million miles (11 million kilometers).\n\nThe spacecraft will accelerate at about 15,000 miles per hour (24,140 kilometers per hour) when it collides with Dimorphos.\n\nThe DART spacecraft also revealed what Dimorphos looks like for the very first time.\n\n“It looks adorable, it’s so cute,” said Carolyn Ernst, DRACO Instrument Scientist at the Johns Hopkins University’s Applied Physics Lab. “It looks in a lot of ways like some of the other small asteroids we’ve seen.”\n\nThe egg-shaped asteroid’s surface, covered in boulders, looked similar to Bennu and Ryugu, two other asteroids that were visited by spacecraft in recent years. The scientists suspect that Dimorphos is a rubble pile asteroid made of loosely bound rocks.\n\nThe team is eager to learn more about the impact crater left behind, which they estimate to be about 33 to 65 feet (10 to 20 meters) in size. There may even be shattered pieces of the spacecraft in the crater.\n\nIt aims to crash into Dimorphos to change the asteroid’s motion in space, according to NASA. This collision will be recorded by LICIACube, or Light Italian CubeSat for Imaging of Asteroids, a companion cube satellite provided by the Italian Space Agency.\n\nThe briefcase-size CubeSat hitched a ride with DART into space. It recently deployed from the spacecraft and is traveling behind it to record what happens.\n\nThree minutes after impact, the CubeSat will fly by Dimorphos to capture images and video. The video, while not immediately available, will be streamed back to Earth in the weeks and months following the collision.\n\nProtecting the planet\n\nDimorphos was chosen for this mission because its size is relative to asteroids that could pose a threat to Earth. The spacecraft is about 100 times smaller than Dimorphos, so it won’t obliterate the asteroid.\n\nThe fast impact will only change Dimorphos’ speed as it orbits Didymos by 1%, which doesn’t sound like a lot – but it will change the moon’s orbital period.\n\nAn illustration shows NASA's DART spacecraft and the Italian Space Agency's LICIACube before the collision with Dimorphos. Steve Gribben/Johns Hopkins APL/NASA\n\n“Sometimes we describe it as running a golf cart into a great pyramid or something like that,” Chabot said. “But for Dimorphos, this really is about asteroid deflection, not disruption. This isn’t going to blow up the asteroid; it isn’t going to put it into lots of pieces.”\n\nThe nudge will shift Dimorphos slightly and make it more gravitationally bound to Didymos – so the collision won’t change the binary system’s path around the Earth or increase its chances of becoming a threat to our planet, Chabot said.\n\nDimorphos completes an orbit around Didymos every 11 hours and 55 minutes. After the impact, that may change to 11 hours and 45 minutes, but follow-up observations will determine how much of a shift occurred.\n\nAstronomers will use ground-based telescopes to observe the binary asteroid system and see how much the orbital period of Dimorphos changed, which will determine if DART was successful.\n\nSpace-based telescopes such as Hubble, Webb and NASA’s Lucy mission will also observe the event.\n\nIn four years, the European Space Agency’s Hera mission will arrive to study Dimorphos, measuring physical properties of the moon, and look at the DART impact and the moon’s orbit.\n\nNo asteroids are currently on a direct impact course with Earth, but more than 27,000 near-Earth asteroids exist in all shapes and sizes.\n\nThe valuable data collected by DART and Hera will contribute to planetary defense strategies, especially the understanding of what kind of force can shift the orbit of a near-Earth asteroid that could collide with our planet.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/09/26"}]}

Use CNN’s lite site for low bandwidth. You also can text or WhatsApp your Ian stories to CNN +1 332-261-0775.\n\nCNN —\n\nDeadly Hurricane Ian – downgraded Thursday to a tropical storm as it crawls across Florida – smashed into the state’s southwestern coast on Wednesday, destroying homes and cutting power to millions.\n\nAs emergency crews scramble to aid those still trapped in their homes, more than 2.5 million residences and businesses were without power early Thursday. Ian is expected to bring strong winds and heavy rains to parts of Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas over the next few days, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\n“Ian is going to be a life-changing event. This is a very powerful, catastrophic storm that is going to do significant damage,” said Eric Silagy, CEO of Florida Power & Light.\n\nIf you’re without power during the hurricane, here’s what you can do to stay safe.\n\nThe basics\n\nIt’s crucial to ensure electric appliances are disconnected to avoid any harm or damage from power surges, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nFEMA also recommends keeping freezers and refrigerators closed to help maintain cooler temperatures for food preservation.\n\nFor good measure, turn off the main power breaker in your house and do not use any devices that are wet.\n\nWatch out for carbon monoxide\n\nGenerators should only be used outdoors and placed more than 20 feet away from doors and windows, even if they are closed.\n\nThe devices emit carbon monoxide, which is a poisonous gas that can be lethal.\n\n“(Carbon monoxide) is an odorless, colorless gas that kills without warning. It claims the lives of hundreds of people every year and makes thousands more ill,” the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.\n\nThe CDC also recommends ensuring battery-operated carbon monoxide detectors are placed near sleeping areas.\n\nDiscard flooded and too-warm food\n\nFood that has been comprised by floodwater should not be consumed and should be thrown away, officials advise.\n\nRefrigerated food that reaches at least 40 degrees Fahrenheit should be discarded, FEMA says\n\nIf you have medications that require refrigeration, find out how long they can be without it before their safety expires.\n\nUse flashlights instead of candles\n\nAvoid using candles during a blackout if possible. If you must use them, keep them away from anything that could catch fire and do not leave them unattended, the CDC says. Ensure a fire extinguisher is available and those around you know how to use it.\n\nAvoid floodwaters as much as possible\n\nAlthough it can be unavoidable when dangerous flooding is happening, stay out of floodwaters as much as possible.\n\nFloodwaters can lead to the risk of drowning or being washed away from the intensity of flow and winds. They can hide dangerous downed power lines and can also be chemically harmful because they contain germs, dangerous substances, human and livestock waste, the CDC says.\n\nCheck on your neighbors and loved ones\n\nWhen it’s safe, reach out to people around you to make sure they are doing well.\n\nThose who have medical equipment that require power, like respirators, should be taken to locations with generators or a friend’s or neighbor’s home that hasn’t been impacted.\n\nAnd remember: The elderly and young children are especially vulnerable to extreme weather.\n\nProtect your pets\n\nDo not leave your pets behind if you evacuate during a power outage and never tie them outdoors during extreme weather events. “If you leave your pets behind, they may be lost, injured – or worse,” the CDC says.\n\nTake the proactive step to contact your local emergency management office to learn about whether they have opened shelters to accommodate pets. To find a shelter near you, check out the Humane Society website. Be mindful that diseases can spread among pets and humans during extreme weather events.\n\nConserve power when possible\n\nPower can be rationed by turning off and unplugging nonessential lights and appliances. Don’t use large appliances like ovens or washing machines if you can avoid it.\n\nThermostats should be set to 68 degrees because heightened demand could trigger more blackouts – or extend them.", "authors": ["Aya Elamroussi"], "publish_date": "2022/09/29"}]}

He and his husband, Shane, figured that would help them get through the coming winter since their Lake Harmony, Pennsylvania, home is heated by electricity.\n\nIt didn’t turn out that way. The couple is now paying $472 a month on the budget plan, up from around $290 a month last winter. That prompted Bell to resume his part-time job as a police officer on top of his full-time position as a state dog warden. The increase, combined with rising costs for food and other essentials, has left Bell debating whether to take on another part-time gig.\n\n“The prices of everything have escalated to the point that a part-time job may not be enough to supplement the increases of bills that we have budgeted,” said Bell, 41, whose husband works as a certified nursing assistant while studying for his nursing degree.\n\nJason Bell may have to take on a second part-time job, on top of his full-time position, to afford his heating bills this winter. Courtesy Jason Bell\n\nLike Bell, many Americans are bracing for the cold reality that they will have to shell out even more to keep their homes warm this winter.\n\nFamilies are expected to pay an average of 17.2% more for home heat this coming season, compared to last winter, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. That comes on top of a big price increase last winter, bringing the two-year hike to more than 35%.\n\nThose who heat with natural gas are facing the largest spike, with their cost for the winter heating season expected to soar 34.3% to $952, the association said.\n\nThe tab for heating oil is expected to jump 12.8% to $2,115. And those whose heat runs on electricity can expect to see a nearly 7% increase to $1,328.\n\nSome people may not realize that heating their homes will be costlier this winter, especially since gasoline prices had been falling for months.\n\n“In a lot of people’s minds, gasoline and home energy are the same,” said Mark Wolfe, the association’s executive director. “The surprise here is that the prices for heating fuels are going to be popping.”\n\nHigh energy prices\n\nEnergy prices are on the rise in part because of the repeated heat waves that baked much of the United States this summer. That forced utilities to draw down on their natural gas reserves, which are also used to generate electricity, compounding the strain on inventory levels that were already below historical averages.\n\nOil prices, which spiked last winter after Russia invaded Ukraine in February, are declining but are still higher than they were last year.\n\nDan Pfoltzer was paying his landlord $150 a month to cover the cost of oil in the small house he rents in Nassau, New York. But over the summer, knowing that oil prices were up, Pfoltzer increased it to $310 a month so he wouldn’t be hit with a big bill over the winter.\n\n“By the time this tank runs out, the money will be there for the next tank,” said Pfoltzer, 71, who lives alone and drives a school bus.\n\nStill, the increased cost means that he won’t be able to pay all of his other bills, including those stemming from cancer treatment a few years ago. To keep his oil usage as low as possible, he plans to turn down the thermostat a few degrees to 67 and bundle up if he’s cold.\n\nOn the coast of Maine, Dale Christensen, Sr. and his family are already planning to use electric blankets in their living room and bedrooms this winter in an effort to minimize their heating bills. The 53-year-old is also looking at buying space heaters.\n\nChristensen, a rural mail carrier, is already paying back his landlord for the $900 it cost to fill the oil tank when they moved into their rental house earlier this year. He’s expecting to receive a $1,300 bill later this fall to refill it for the start of winter and likely two more after that during the season.\n\nDale Christensen, Sr. expects his family will have to use electric blankets to keep warm this winter in Maine. Dale Christensen, Sr.\n\nHeat wasn’t an issue for the Christensens last winter because they lived in an apartment where it was included, though the couple had to make sure their elderly parents, who are on fixed incomes, stayed warm in their homes.\n\n“Every year, we worry about our parents for the heating costs,” he said. “This year is even more stress and strain because, of course, now we have to pay for our heat.”\n\nThe family has applied for aid from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, known as LIHEAP, to defray part of the cost of their oil bill. But Christensen isn’t counting on it until he hears whether they are approved.\n\nLess federal assistance available\n\nMaking matters worse is there is far less money in LIHEAP’s coffers this year, even though roughly 20 million American households — or 1 in 6 families — are behind on their utility bills.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan Act, which Congress approved in March 2021, provided a $4.5 billion boost to the program for this fiscal year, on top of a $3.8 billion regular appropriation. The stimulus money was mainly used to reduce the pandemic-fueled spike in arrears.\n\nBoth the House and Senate are looking at providing a $4 billion appropriation for LIHEAP for fiscal 2023, though lawmakers have yet to approve the federal government funding bill for the coming year. The Biden administration has asked for an additional $500 million for LIHEAP on top of what lawmakers are considering, while the energy directors association has called for $5 billion more.\n\nRequests for help have been pouring in, even before the cold weather sets in, state energy directors say.\n\nAt this time last year, Energy Services Inc. in Wisconsin was getting a record 300 calls a day to its customer care center. Now, the nonprofit group, the main LIHEAP administrator in the state, is fielding more than 1,000 calls a day. A family of three making up to roughly $52,000 a year is eligible as long as funding is available.\n\n“The need hasn’t gone away. It’s accelerating at such a rapid pace,” said Timothy Bruer, Energy Services’ executive director, who noted that his group ran out of LIHEAP crisis assistance money in fiscal 2022 for the first time in three decades. “Keeping the heat and power on, which is a basic necessity, has become an unaffordable luxury for tens of thousands of Wisconsin’s most vulnerable, at-risk households.”\n\nIn Massachusetts, the Worcester Community Action Council typically doesn’t start receiving LIHEAP applications until the temperature starts to fall, said Mary Knittle, director of energy sources at the nonprofit group. But this year they’ve been coming in “fast and furious,” she said, noting that first-time applications for the upcoming winter are up 60% compared to this time last year.\n\nResidents are bracing for higher charges. One energy provider in the state just emailed its customers to inform them that electric bills will be an estimated $114 higher each month for average usage, compared to last winter — an increase of 64%, she said. It cited higher electric supply prices as the main reason.\n\nEven those who don’t heat with electricity will be affected since it typically takes electricity to run home heating systems.\n\nMartin Silva, Sr. is expecting to pay about 30% more to heat his home this winter. Courtesy Martin Silva\n\nAt the same time, Knittle will have far less money to distribute this winter, though the appropriation hasn’t been set yet. Last fiscal year, her agency received $24.6 million in LIHEAP funding, including a $13.9 million boost from the American Rescue Plan that has since been exhausted.\n\n“Anxiety is very, very high,” Knittle said, noting that a family of three making roughly $68,500 is eligible for help in Massachusetts.\n\nMartin Silva, Sr. is already hundreds of dollars behind on both his water and electric bills for the Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, home he shares with his wife. He’s expecting it will cost around $130 a month for natural gas to heat their drafty, old house, up from roughly $100 last year.\n\nA dump truck driver, Silva hopes to repay his debts by cutting back even more on expenses, including trips to see his ill, elderly parents in New York City twice a month. But the mounting expenses have left him feeling “crushed.”\n\n“You can’t get ahead, no matter how hard you try,” said Silva, 51.", "authors": ["Tami Luhby"], "publish_date": "2022/09/24"}]}

Final results are expected later Monday, but it’s expected to take weeks for a new government to be formed.\n\nMeloni entered Italy’s crowded political scene in 2006 and co-founded the Brothers of Italy in 2012, a party whose agenda is rooted in Euroskepticism and anti-immigration policies.\n\nLeader of Brothers of Italy Giorgia Meloni casts her vote in Rome on Sunday, September 25, 2022. Yara Nardi/Reuters\n\nIn the last election in 2018, the party won just 4.5% of the vote, but its popularity has soared in recent years, underscoring Italy’s longstanding rejection of mainstream politics, seen most recently with the country’s support of anti-establishment parties such as the Five Star Movement and Salvini’s League.\n\nCelebrating the early results on Sunday evening, Salvini said on Twitter, “Center-right in clear advantage both in the House and in the Senate! It will be a long night, but already now I want to say THANK YOU.”\n\nMeloni differs from her coalition partner leaders on the issue of Ukraine. Whereas Berlusconi and Salvini have both said they would like to review sanctions against Russia because of their impact on the Italian economy, Meloni has been steadfast in her support for defending Ukraine.\n\nA 45-year-old mother from Rome, Meloni is deeply conservative, openly anti-LBGT, and has threatened to place same-sex unions, which were legalized in Italy in 2016, under review. She has also called abortion a “tragedy,” raising fears for the future of women’s rights in the country.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Ultra-conservative likely to become Italy's first female prime minister 02:57 - Source: CNN\n\n‘A sad evening’\n\nThe preliminary results showed the center-left coalition, led by the left-wing Democratic Party and centrist party +Europe had won around 22% of the vote, while former prime minister Giuseppe Conte’s bid to revive the Five Star Movement appeared to have been unsuccessful, with around 15%.\n\nIn a Facebook post, Conte promised to lead an “uncompromising opposition.”\n\n“We will be the outpost for the progressive agenda against inequalities, to protect families and businesses in difficulty, to defend the rights and values of our Constitution.”\n\nDebora Serracchiani of the Democratic Party also conceded defeat early Monday morning, calling the results a “sad evening for the country.”\n\n“Undoubtedly we cannot, in light of the data seen so far, not attribute the victory to the right dragged by Giorgia Meloni. It is a sad evening for the country,” Serracchiani told reporters.\n\nSunday’s snap national election was triggered by party infighting that saw the collapse of Prime Minister Mario Draghi’s government in July.\n\nVoters headed to the polls amid a number of new regulations, with voting hours also contained to one day rather than two.\n\nOther changes included a younger voting age for the Senate and a reduction in the number of seats to elect – down from 685 seats to 400 in the Senate and from 315 to 200 in the lower House of Parliament. That parliament is scheduled to meet on October 13, at which point the head of state will call on party leaders to decide on the shape of the new government.\n\nThe buildup to the election was dominated by hot-button issues including Italy’s cost-of-living crisis, a 209 billion euro ($200 billion) package from the European Covid-19 recovery fund and the country’s support for Ukraine.\n\nThe incoming prime minister – the sixth in just eight years – will be tasked with tackling a number of challenges, with soaring energy costs and economic uncertainty among the country’s most pressing.\n\nAnd while Meloni is slated to make history as Italy’s first female prime minister, her politics do not mean that she is necessarily interested in advancing women’s rights.\n\nEmiliana De Blasio, adviser for diversity and inclusion at LUISS University in Rome, told CNN Meloni is “not raising up at all questions on women’s rights and empowerment in general.”\n\nThe Italian results come as other far-right parties in other European countries have marked recent gains. That includes Sweden’s anti-immigration party, Sweden Democrats – a party with neo-Nazi roots – which is expected to play a major role in the new government after winning the second largest share of seats at a general election earlier this month.\n\nAnd in France, while far-right ideologue Marine Le Pen lost the French presidential election to Emmanuel Macron in April, her share of the popular vote shifted France’s political center dramatically to the right.\n\nAlthough Macron and Meloni ideologically diverge, the French president said Monday that France respects Italy’s decision to elect a government headed by Meloni.\n\nSince former German Chancellor Angela Merkel stepped down in December, Macron has increasingly emerged as the top EU leader – a position that would put him at odds with the Euroskepticism expressed by the Brothers of Italy.\n\n“The Italian people have made a democratic and sovereign choice. We respect it,” Macron said, according to the Elysee Palace.\n\n“As a neighbor and friend, we must continue to work together. It’s as Europeans that we will succeed in overcoming our joint challenges,” he added.\n\nIn a social media post early Monday, Meloni dedicated her projected win to “all the militants, managers, supporters and every single person who – in these years – has contributed to the realization of our dream, offering soul and heart spontaneously and selflessly.”\n\nShe added: “We won’t betray your trust. We are ready to lift Italy up.”", "authors": ["Kara Fox Barbie Latza Nadeau Antonia Mortensen Nicola Ruotolo Sharon Braithwaite Valentina Didonato", "Kara Fox", "Barbie Latza Nadeau", "Antonia Mortensen", "Nicola Ruotolo", "Sharon Braithwaite", "Valentina Didonato"], "publish_date": "2022/09/25"}]}

It recovered slightly as European traders came online, rising back to $1.07.\n\nThe currency slump follows British Chancellor of the Exchequer Kwasi Kwarteng’s announcement on Friday that the United Kingdom would implement the biggest tax cuts in 50 years at the same time as boosting government borrowing and spending in the face of high inflation.\n\n“Serious questions are already being asked about the economic competency of the new government,” said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda. “So much so that markets are factoring in a strong chance of a substantial emergency rate hike from the Bank of England in order to shore up the currency and confidence in the markets.”\n\nThe new tax-slashing fiscal measures, which include scrapping plans for an increase in corporation tax and slashing the top rate of income tax, have been criticized as “trickle-down economics” by the opposition Labour Party and even lambasted by members of the Chancellor’s own Conservative party.\n\nKwarteng doubled down at the weekend, hinting in TV interviews Sunday of more tax cuts to come, saying Friday’s measures were “just the start” as the government goes all out for growth.\n\nFormer Tory chancellor Lord Ken Clarke criticized the tax cuts on Sunday, saying they could lead to the collapse of the pound.\n\n“I’m afraid that’s the kind of thing that’s usually tried in Latin American countries without success,” Clarke said in an interview with BBC radio.\n\nThe pound has been hammered by a string of weak economic data, but also the steep ascent of the US dollar, a safe haven investment that sees inflows in times of uncertainty.\n\nThe euro also hit a 20-year low after Giorgia Meloni claimed victory in a general election in Italy. Investors are monitoring what would be the most far-right government since the fascist era of Benito Mussolini, which has raised concerns about cohesion within the European Union.\n\nBut the pound is suffering more than most due to the economic outlook in the United Kingdom, which faces the highest inflation among G7 nations, and the government’s huge fiscal gamble on growth. It has lost nearly 21% so far this year, compared with a fall of 15% in the euro.\n\nThe previous record low for the British pound against the US dollar was 37 years ago on February 25, 1985, when one pound was worth a little over $1.05.\n\n“Should there be any escalation to the war in Ukraine … we would see further sharp downside in the pound as well as the euro,” said Clifford Bennett, chief economist at ACY Securities, an Australian brokerage firm.\n\n“One should not underestimate the crisis that is all of Europe at the moment and the pound is more vulnerable than most,” he said.\n\nAsian markets and currencies crack\n\nThe soaring US dollar also sent major Asian currencies tumbling on Monday.\n\nChina’s yuan slid 0.5% on the onshore market to the lowest level in more than 28 months. The offshore yuan fell 0.4%.\n\nThe rapid declines prompted the People’s Bank of China to impose a risk reserve requirement of 20% on banks’ foreign exchange forward sales to clients, starting Wednesday. That should make it more costly to buy foreign currencies via derivatives, which might slow the pace of the yuan’s decline.\n\nElsewhere in the region, the Japanese yen dropped 0.6% against the dollar to 144. Last Thursday, the Japanese central bank intervened in the currency market for the first time since 1998 to prop up the yen when it hit 145. The yen rebounded slightly following the intervention, but soon resumed the slide.\n\nStock markets in Asia were also in turmoil on Monday, after US stocks sold off on Friday as fears of a recession grew.\n\nSouth Korea’s Kospi declined 2.7%, Japan’s Nikkei 225 (N225) dropped 2.4%, and Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 was down 1.4%. In Europe, London’s FTSE 100 (UKX) was the weakest index, but Germany’s DAX (DAX) and France’s CAC also slipped lower. Italian stocks got a lift after slumping last week ahead of the elections.\n\nThe Federal Reserve on Wednesday approved a third consecutive 75-basis-point hike in an aggressive move to tackle white-hot inflation that has been plaguing the US economy.\n\nEven without the Fed action, Europe is facing a recession due to the war in Ukraine, and China is looking at “a substantially weak growth dynamic” because of domestic factors, the DBS analysts said.\n\n“Add on top of that a sharp decline in US dollar liquidity and sharply higher US interest rates, the world economic outlook looks particularly precarious,” they added.\n\n— Julia Horowitz contributed to this article.", "authors": ["Laura He Jessie Yeung Jonny Hallam", "Laura He", "Jessie Yeung", "Jonny Hallam"], "publish_date": "2022/09/25"}]}

Gone were Green’s iconic go-go boots, replaced by sneakers. Online, mayhem ensued.\n\nNow, M&M’S is making another, bigger change — this time, it’s adding a brand new character to the mix. Meet Purple: She’s peanut, she sings, and she doesn’t wear high heels (she sports lace-up boots).\n\nThe purple peanut M&M is the first new character in 10 years, according to the brand.\n\n“Purple has been in the works for a very long time, for years,” said Jane Hwang, Global Vice President of M&M’S. “This was about ensuring that the entire crew, the entire cast of spokescandies, were reflecting the world that we’re living in.”\n\nM&M'S\n\nPurple has a specific personality — quirky, confident and just a little awkward. Her debut comes with a song, “I’m Just Gonna Be Me,” which can be seen in a video online and streamed on platforms including Spotify and Apple Music.\n\nThis doesn’t mean that a purple M&M is coming to bags of Peanut M&M’S, however.\n\nThe new character will appear in stores, on the M&M’S website and on some limited edition packaging, said Hwang. And customers will be able to buy purple M&M’S online, an option that was already available. But when it comes to a regular bag of peanut M&M’S, purple fans are out of luck.\n\nThat could be a new source of outrage.\n\nIn the mid-90s, people voted for blue to replace tan in bags of the candy. In 2002, M&M’S once again asked people to vote, this time for a color that would be added for just a limited time. Purple won, but didn’t stick around for long.\n\nOnline, people frequently ask why there are no purple M&M’S. Some bemoan the missed opportunity in the 1990s to make purple a permanent addition to the lineup. Some even think the vote was rigged.\n\nStill, the new character, while not an actual new candy, is an acknowledgment from M&M’S that people are pining for purple.\n\n“We’ve heard for a long time that purple is certainly a consumer favorite,” said Hwang.\n\nBut the brand is really focusing on the characters, rather than the actual edible candies, she noted.\n\n‘Give green her boots back’\n\nWhen M&M’S made changes to its characters’ footwear early this year, the idea was to make them more current and relevant, with characters that, Mars hopes, will make people feel like they belong. The new footwear was supposed to help telegraph that message. Orange finally got a pair of shoes with tied laces, Brown got lower heels, and others also got subtle updates to their style.\n\nBut there was an outsized reaction to Green’s new kicks.\n\nAn opinion piece in the Washington Post declared “The M&M’S changes aren’t progressive. Give Green her boots back.” In a provocatively-headlined article, Rolling Stone described the change as “nothing more than tectonic.” Thousands have signed a petition to “keep the green M&M sexy.”\n\nPeople are known to have strong feelings about things online, particularly changes to beloved characters. When Lola Bunny got a new look for the new Space Jam movie, for example, fans were outraged.\n\nBut for M&M’S, reaction to the character makeover was “unprecedented,” said Hwang. “We were incredibly overwhelmed,” she noted. “Now we know for certain that M&M’S is a cultural icon.”\n\nSo when it came to the new purple character, Hwang said, M&M’S didn’t take the reaction to Green into account. Purple “had nothing to do … with the commentaries we saw about Green,” she said.\n\nAnd for now, at least, M&M’S has no plans to restore Green’s look.\n\n“The characters … are continuously evolving to reflect the times that we’re living in,” Hwang said, adding that the brand hopes consumers will “get to know our characters for much more than their footwear.”\n\nSo will the go-go boots ever make a comeback? Hwang answered slyly, “You never know.”", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/09/28"}]}

Ray ChavezMediaNews Group/Getty Images\n\nWhat is pickleball?\n\nDubbed America’s unofficial pandemic pastime, more than one million Americans have picked up a paddle in the last two years.\n\nBut what is the sport which has swept across the country?\n\nThe basic aim of pickleball, like with other racket sports, is to hit the ball over the net and prevent an opponent from hitting it back.\n\nIt can be played in singles or doubles, inside or outside on a 20-foot by 44-foot court – approximately the size of a badminton court – and lasts until one side reaches 11 points, with a two-point cushion.\n\nPickleball began life inauspiciously in 1965 when future US Congressman Joel Pritchard and his friend Bill Bell attempted to entertain their bored children on holiday.\n\nStaying in a property on Bainbridge Island, Washington, with an asphalted badminton court, they mustered together the available equipment – a wiffle ball, ping-pong paddles and a badminton net which they later lowered to 36 inches, closer to the height of a tennis net, once they found that the ball bounced well on the asphalt.\n\nAs the holiday progressed, they began to create rules for the game, with the help of another friend Barney McCallum.\n\nThe ping-pong paddles were deemed too small and substituted for larger plywood paddles they fashioned themselves and a non-volley zone seven feet from the net on either side was created to deter smashing.\n\nAmateur pickleball players play mixed double matches during the Professional Pickleball Association Baird Wealth Management Open. Arden S. Barnes/The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\nThe non-volley zone, or ‘kitchen’, is what gives pickleball much of its distinctiveness.\n\nIt minimizes running, allowing older players to be just as competitive as younger, fitter players and diminishes the role of power so that children can play alongside adults.\n\nPickleball’s popularity has skyrocketed in North America, partly driven by the Covid-19 pandemic as it offers a safe, socially distanced form of exercise.\n\nIt had originally found a solid base among retirement communities where it was beloved for its sociable aspect, moderate exercise, and for simply being fun.\n\nBetween 2018 and 2021, however, USA Pickleball membership nearly doubled and the organization estimates that 4.8 million Americans now play the sport.\n\nMuch of this expansion has been concentrated outside pickleball’s traditional demographic – the fastest rate of increase was among players under 24 from 2020 to 2021 driven by the height of lockdown when portable pickleball nets temporarily sold out as people set up the small courts in driveways and gardens.", "authors": ["Ben Morse Issy Ronald", "Ben Morse", "Issy Ronald"], "publish_date": "2022/09/29"}]}
