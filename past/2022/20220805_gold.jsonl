It said all the missiles hit their target accurately.\n\n“The entire live-fire training mission has been successfully completed and the relevant air and sea area control is now lifted,” China’s statement said. Earlier, the Eastern Theater Command said it had conducted long-range, live-fire training in the Taiwan Strait, state broadcaster CCTV reported, as part of planned military exercises around the island.\n\nTaiwan reported Chinese long-range rockets had fallen near its islands of Matsu, Wuqiu and Dongyin, which are in the Taiwan Strait, but located closer to the mainland than the main island of Taiwan. It later said a total of 11 Dongfeng (DF) missiles were fired to the waters north, south and east of the island between 1:56 p.m. and 4 p.m. local time (from 1:56 a.m. ET to 4 a.m. ET) on Thursday.\n\nThe Chinese missiles flew over Taiwan Island for the first time, a Chinese military expert said on state television channel CCTV on Thursday, representing a major escalation of China’s military intimidation against Taiwan.\n\nThe conventional missiles flew over airspace covered by Taiwanese defense missiles, said Maj. Gen. Meng Xiangqing, a professor of strategy at the National Defense University in Beijing.\n\n“We hit the targets under the observation of US Aegis combat system, which means the Chinese military has solved the difficulties of hitting long-range targets on waters,” Meng said on CCTV.\n\nThe Taiwanese Defense Ministry said in a statement late Thursday night that the trajectory of the missiles was above the atmosphere and therefore posed no risk to Taiwan.\n\n“Using the surveillance and reconnaissance systems, our military can accurately calculate the trajectory of the Dong Feng-series missiles fired by the Chinese Communist Party,” it said.\n\nBecause it was predicted that the missiles would land in the waters east of Taiwan, authorities did not trigger air raid alerts, it said.\n\nChinese state media said that exercises to simulate an air and sea “blockade” around Taiwan had started Wednesday, but offered little solid evidence to back up the claim. Later Thursday, images showed military helicopters flying past Pingtan island, one of Taiwan’s closest points to mainland China.\n\nThe military posturing was a deliberate show of force after Pelosi left the island on Wednesday evening, bound for South Korea, one of the final stops on an Asia tour that ends in Japan this weekend.\n\nWithin hours of her departure from Taipei on Wednesday, the island’s Defense Ministry said China sent more than 20 fighter jets across the median line in the Taiwan Strait, the midway point between the mainland and Taiwan that Beijing says it does not recognize but usually respects.\n\nIn addition, the ministry said that 22 Chinese warplanes had entered its air defense identification zone (ADIZ) on Thursday, and that all of them crossed the strait median line.\n\nThe ministry also said it detected four drones – in three separate batches – flying over “restricted waters” around the Kinmen islands, a group of Taiwan-controlled outlying islands close to China, on Thursday night local time.\n\nTaiwan’s defense ministry said in a statement Thursday night that the military fired flares to warn the drones away – without specifying the origin or type of drone – and that it continues to monitor the situation and remains on high alertness.\n\nTourists look on as a Chinese military helicopter flies past Pingtan island, one of mainland China's closest point from Taiwan on August 4, 2022. Hector Retamal/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOn Thursday, Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said its military was remaining in a “normal” but wary posture, and called the live-fire drills an “irrational act” that attempted to “change the status quo.”\n\n“We are closely monitoring enemy activities around the sea of Taiwan and that of outlying islands, and we will act appropriately,” the ministry said in a statement.\n\nTaiwan also accused China of “following North Korea’s example of arbitrary test-fire of missiles in waters close to other countries” in a statement issued by its Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday.\n\nThe exercises have caused disruption to flight and ship schedules, with some international flights canceled and vessels urged to use alternative routes for several ports around the island.\n\nAnd they have heightened tensions beyond Taiwan’s waters. Japan’s Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi said Thursday that five missiles were believed to have landed within Japan’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).\n\n“This is a serious problem that concerns Japan’s security and the safety of its citizens. We strongly condemn it,” Kishi told reporters during a press conference.\n\nKishi said this was the first time that Chinese ballistic missiles had landed within Japan’s EEZ and that a protest had been lodged with Beijing.\n\nExercises exerting pressure\n\nTaiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen, who met with Pelosi during her visit, called China’s military drills “an irresponsible act,” adding that Taipei does not want to “provoke disputes” but will defend its sovereignty and national safety.\n\nIn a speech on Thursday night, Tsai said the exercises have “undermined the status quo of the Taiwan Strait, intruded (on) our sovereignty, and heightened tensions in the Indo-Pacific region.”\n\nWell in advance of Pelosi’s near 24-hour visit to Taiwan, China had warned her presence was not welcome. The ruling Chinese Communist Party claims the self-governed island as its own territory, despite never having controlled it.\n\nChina issued a map showing six zones around Taiwan that would be the site of drills in coming days. Taiwan’s Maritime and Port Bureau said earlier Thursday that China had added a seventh military drill zone, but later retracted that statement, saying the earlier notice was wrong.\n\nChinese state media on Thursday outlined a broad range of objectives for the exercises, including strikes on land and sea targets.\n\n“The exercises (are) focused on key training sessions including joint blockade, sea target assault, strike on ground targets, and airspace control operation, and the joint combat capabilities of the troops got tested in the military operations,” said an announcement from the Xinhua news agency attributed to the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) Eastern Theater Command, which has responsibility for the areas near Taiwan.\n\nChinese military helicopters fly past Pingtan island in Fujian province on Aug. 4. Hector Retamal/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMeanwhile, the Global Times tabloid said the drills involved some of China’s newest and most sophisticated weaponry, including J-20 stealth fighters and DF-17 hypersonic missiles, and that some missiles may be fired over the island – a move that would be extremely provocative.\n\n“The exercises are unprecedented as the PLA conventional missiles are expected to fly over the island of Taiwan for the first time,” the Global Times said, citing experts.\n\n“The PLA forces will enter areas within 12 nautical miles of the island and the so-called median line will cease to exist.”\n\nAccounts from Taiwan of Chinese military movement included the fighter jets crossing the median line and a report from Taiwan’s government-run Central News Agency, citing government sources, that two of China’s most powerful warships – Type 55 destroyers – were sighted Tuesday off the central and southeastern coast of the island, the closest being within 37 miles (60 kilometers) of land.\n\nBut there was little corroboration or firm evidence provided by China to back up the sort of claims posted in the Global Times.\n\nChina’s state-run television offered video of fighter jets taking off, ships at sea and missiles on the move, but the dates of when that video was shot could not be verified.\n\nSome analysts were skeptical Beijing could pull off what they were threatening, such as a blockade of Taiwan.\n\n“The official announcement (of the blockade) refers to just a few days, which would make it hard to qualify it on practical terms to a blockade,” said Alessio Patalano, professor of war and strategy at King’s College in London.\n\n“Blockades are hard to execute and long to implement. This exercise is not that,” he said.\n\nPatalano said the biggest impact of the exercises would be psychological.\n\n“During the period of time in question, ships and aircraft will likely reroute to avoid the area, but this is one primary objective of the chosen locations: create disruption, discomfort, and fear of worse to come,” he said.\n\nChinese military helicopters fly past Pingtan island, one of mainland China's closest point from Taiwan on August 4, 2022. Hector Retamal/AFP/Getty Images\n\nRerouting planes and ships\n\nChina’s retaliatory exercises have already caused disruption to flight and ship schedules in Taiwan, though the island is trying to lessen their impact.\n\nTaiwan’s transportation minister said agreements had been reached with Japan and the Philippines to reroute 18 international flight routes departing from the island – affecting about 300 flights in total – to avoid the PLA’s live-fire drills.\n\nKorean Air told CNN on Thursday that it has canceled flights from Incheon to Taiwan scheduled for Friday and Saturday due to safety reasons while China conducts its military drills. Flights will resume on Sunday.\n\nChina’s planned live-fire drills were also causing unease in Japan.\n\nJapan’s chief cabinet secretary, Hirokazu Matsuno, said the drills posed a threat to his country’s security.\n\nOne of the six exercise areas set up by China was near Japan’s Yonaguni Island, part of Okinawa prefecture and only 68 miles (110 kilometers) off the coast of Taiwan.\n\nThat same Chinese exercise zone is also close to the Japanese-controlled Senkaku Islands, a rocky uninhabited chain known as the Diaoyus in China, and over which Beijing claims sovereignty.\n\n“In particular, a training area has been set up in the waters near Japan, and if China were to conduct live ammunition exercises in such an area, it could affect the security of Japan and its people,” Matsuno said.\n\nMeanwhile, the United States military was silent on the Chinese exercises and did not provide any answers to CNN questions on Thursday.\n\nJohn Kirby, a spokesperson for the National Security Council, said Thursday that China has “chosen to overreact” to Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan and that the White House expects further provocative actions “in the coming days.”\n\nPelosi met Taiwanese President President Tsai Ing-wen in Taipei on Aug. 3. Taiwan Presidential Office via AP\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he hoped “Beijing will not manufacture a crisis or seek a pretense to increase its aggressive military action.” Speaking at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)-US Ministerial Meeting in Cambodia, Blinken said the US remains committed to its “One China” policy.\n\nOn Wednesday, Chinese ambassador to France Lu Shaye warned that after “reunification” with Taiwan, there would be a “re-education” of the island.\n\nBesides keeping a close eye on Chinese military movements around the island, Taiwan also said it would strengthen security against cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns.\n\nTaiwan’s cabinet spokesperson Lo Ping-cheng said in a Wednesday news conference that the government had enhanced security at key infrastructure points and increased the level of cybersecurity alertness across government offices.\n\nTaiwan is anticipating increased “cognitive warfare,” referring to disinformation campaigns used to sway public opinion, Lo said.\n\n\n\nThis story has been updated with new information.", "authors": ["Brad Lendon"], "publish_date": "2022/08/04"}]}
{"question_id": "20220805_1", "search_result": [{"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/politics/kansas-abortion-amendment-analysis/index.html", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe wording of the question was convoluted, but the answer was crystal clear: No. Voters in Kansas on Tuesday, in dramatic numbers and by an overwhelming margin, rejected a ballot measure that would have allowed lawmakers to ban abortion in the state.\n\nAs Republican-controlled state legislatures around the country race to outlaw the procedure in the aftermath of the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade, traditionally conservative Kansas, given the chance to directly respond at the ballot box, denied their own elected leaders’ the chance to revoke a right that has broad support across swaths of independent polling.\n\nThe rejection of the measure highlighted the increasingly stark divide between the activities of Republican state lawmakers, often in legislatures gerrymandered to effectively guarantee GOP control, and the political and policy desires of American voters. In more immediate terms, the ballot measure’s defeat – on a day of extraordinary turnout – also provides a clear indication that the desire to defend abortion rights could be a potent issue for Democrats in the coming midterm elections.\n\nThe polling, from a variety of sources, is unambiguous and consistent. Across party lines, abortion rights are popular and the Supreme Court’s ruling is not. The most recent CNN poll found that 63% of Americans disapproved – 51% “strongly” – of the court’s decision. The Kaiser Family Foundation came to a similar conclusion, with 61% of respondents to their survey saying they wanted their state to guarantee access to abortion. Only 25% wanted them to restrict it.\n\nThe backlash, and its translation to concrete political terms, could potentially influence elections in a handful of states this fall – including in liberal states like California and Vermont, where the big ticket results are close to a formality but the energy of Democrats could tip races down the ballot.\n\nThe more dramatic downstream effects could be felt in swing states like Michigan – which is embroiled in a court battle over whether a ban from 1931 should be reinstated – and Colorado, where measures addressing abortion are likely to appear on the same general election ballot as key contests for governor and US House seats.\n\nIn Kansas, there was hardly a contest to speak of. The “No” coalition – which opposed a measure that would have removed abortion rights from the state constitution – appears to be on track to win in a landslide. And it’s no low-turnout fluke. The overall vote count on the amendment eclipsed 869,000 at around 1 a.m. ET.\n\nThat figure exceeded Kansas’ general election turnout in the midterm year of 2010 and was approaching the 2014 total overnight. And overall primary turnout in the state two years ago – in the midst of a presidential campaign – clocked in at just over 636,000. In the 2018 midterm primary, the figure was lower: 457,598.\n\nPro-choice supporters cheer as the proposed Kansas Constitutional amendment fails as they watch the call from the networks during the pro-choice Kansas for Constitutional Freedom primary election watch party in Overland Park, Kansas August 2, 2022. - Voters in the traditionally conservative state of Kansas voted Tuesday to maintain the right to abortion, in the first election on the flashpoint issue since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, US media reported. In a significant win for the pro-access side of the US abortion debate, Kansans rejected an amendment that would have scrapped language in the state constitution guaranteeing the right to the procedure and could have paved the way for stricter regulations or a ban. (Photo by DAVE KAUP / AFP) (Photo by DAVE KAUP/AFP via Getty Images) Dave Kaup/AFP/Getty Images\n\nInterest in the ballot measure also heavily outweighed the other big statewide contests on Tuesday – more than doubling the total votes cast in the Republican gubernatorial primary, won by Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt, according to a CNN projection, with about 350,000 votes as of early Wednesday morning.\n\nDemocratic turnout was even lower – another sign that the abortion issue transcends party lines. Fewer than 250,000 voted in the party’s Senate primary and only a few thousand more punched ballots for incumbent Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly, who faces an uphill battle to win a second term.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, in a statement released after the results became clear, piled on.\n\n“The Supreme Court’s extreme decision to overturn Roe v. Wade put women’s health and lives at risk,” he said. “Tonight, the American people had something to say about it.”\n\nWhile Kansas got their word in, millions of Americans in other states are unlikely to have a similar opportunity – at least not anytime soon. Meanwhile, Republican leaders and anti-abortion activists in several states are locked in court battles as they push to implement all manner of new restrictions or preexisting “trigger laws” over the objections of abortion rights groups, many of whom are arguing that those measures violate existing state law or constitutional protections.\n\nHow the Kansas vote resonates in those states remains to be seen. But even before Tuesday night’s thunderclap, there have been hints that even GOP heavyweights are disinclined to escalate the fight.\n\nConservative Govs. Ron DeSantis in Florida and Kristi Noem in South Dakota, both believed to be harboring national ambitions, praised the Supreme Court’s ruling, but have not yet pushed forward with demands from anti-abortion activists for more aggressive action – like the calling of special legislative sessions to pass more or more aggressive laws. Similar quasi-impasses exist in states like Nebraska and Iowa.\n\nThe reasoning behind those decisions has been parsed out and officials like DeSantis have pointed to existing or pending laws, but the broader trend is clear: abortion rights, now as before, are broadly popular across party lines.

An attorney representing Heslin and Lewis has asked the jury to award $150 million in damages.\n\nJones, who was the sole witness for the defense during the trial, did not fare well Wednesday as he was cross-examined by the plaintiffs’ attorney, Mark Bankston.\n\nIn a remarkable moment, Bankston disclosed to Jones and the court that he had recently acquired evidence proving Jones had lied when he claimed during the discovery process that he had never texted about the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting.\n\nBankston said that Jones’ attorney had, in an apparent mishap, sent him two years of cell phone records that included every text message Jones had sent.\n\nThe cell phone records, Bankston said, showed that Jones had in fact texted about the Sandy Hook shooting.\n\n“That is how I know you lied to me when you said you didn’t have text messages about Sandy Hook,” Bankston said.\n\nBankston showed Jones a text message exchange he had about Sandy Hook. But Jones testified that he had “never seen these text messages.”\n\nWhen reminded Jones had testified under oath that he had searched his phone during the discovery phase of the trial and could not locate messages about Sandy Hook, Jones insisted he “did not lie.”\n\nJones baselessly said in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook shooting, in which 26 people were killed, that the incident was staged. Facing lawsuits, Jones has since acknowledged the shooting occurred.\n\nJones said in a 2019 sworn deposition that a “form of psychosis” caused him at the time to believe it was staged.\n\nAnd in court on Wednesday, Jones said that he does believe the Sandy Hook shooting happened, saying it was “100% real.”\n\nIn another notable moment during cross-examination Wednesday, Jones was asked whether he had connected Maya Guerra Gamble, the judge overseeing the trial, to pedophilia and human trafficking.\n\nWhen Jones denied having done so, Bankston played video for the court of an Infowars video which did just that.\n\nIn the video, Jones attacked Gamble’s prior work for Child Protective Services by claiming the agency had been “exposed” for “working for pedophiles.”\n\nGamble, whose office did not respond to an earlier request for comment about the fact Infowars has been attacking her in such terms, laughed when she saw a screengrab from the video in court on Wednesday.\n\n“The person on the left of this image is our judge, correct?” Bankston asked Jones.\n\nJones replied that it was.\n\nAttorneys for the plaintiffs said Tuesday that they intend to ask for sanctions against Jones for being dishonest on the stand. And Gamble on Tuesday had also admonished Jones for having violated his oath to tell the truth twice.\n\n“You are already under oath to tell the truth,” Gamble said Tuesday. “You’ve already violated that oath twice today, in just those two examples. It seems absurd to instruct you again that you must tell the truth while you testify.

At one point, he acted as bin Laden’s personal physician.\n\nZawahiri was sheltering in downtown Kabul to reunite with his family, Biden said, and was killed in what a senior administration official described as “a precise tailored airstrike” using two Hellfire missiles. The drone strike was conducted at 9:48 p.m. ET on Saturday was authorized by Biden following weeks of meetings with his Cabinet and key advisers, the official said on Monday, adding that no American personnel were on the ground in Kabul at the time of the strike.\n\nSenior Haqqani Taliban figures were aware of Zawahiri’s presence in the area, the official said, in “clear violation of the Doha agreement,” and even took steps to conceal his presence after Saturday’s successful strike, restricting access to the safe house and rapidly relocating members of his family, including his daughter and her children, who were intentionally not targeted during the strike and remained unharmed. The US did not alert Taliban officials ahead of Saturday’s strike.\n\nIn a series of tweets, Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said, “An air strike was carried out on a residential house in Sherpur area of Kabul city on July 31.”\n\nHe said, “The nature of the incident was not apparent at first” but the security and intelligence services of the Islamic Emirate investigated the incident and “initial findings determined that the strike was carried out by an American drone.”\n\nThe tweets by Mujahid came out prior to CNN reporting Zawahiri’s death. Mujahid said the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan “strongly condemns this attack on any pretext and calls it a clear violation of international principles and the Doha Agreement.”\n\n‘Justice has been delivered’\n\nBiden, who was kept abreast of the strike against Zawahiri as he isolated with a rebound case of Covid-19, spoke outdoors Monday from the Blue Room Balcony at the White House.\n\nZawahiri, Biden said, “was deeply involved in the planning of 9/11, one of the most responsible for the attacks that murdered 2,977 people on American soil. For decades, he was the mastermind of attacks against Americans.”\n\n“Now, justice has been delivered and this terrorist leader is no more. People around the world no longer need to fear the vicious and determined killer,” he continued. “The United States continues to demonstrate our resolve and our capacity to defend the American people against those who seek to do us harm. We make it clear again tonight, that no matter how long it takes, no matter where you hide, if you are a threat to our people, the United States will find you and take you out.”\n\nThe President said the precision strike targeting was the result of the “extraordinary persistence and skill” of the nation’s intelligence community.\n\n“Our intelligence community located Zawahiri earlier this year – he moved to downtown Kabul to reunite with members of his immediate family,” Biden said.\n\nThe strike comes one year after Biden ordered the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan, prompting Taliban forces to rapidly seize control of the nation.\n\nBiden said on Monday that when he withdrew US troops from the country, he “made the decision that after 20 years of war, the United States no longer needed thousands of boots on the ground in Afghanistan to protect America from terrorists who seek to do us harm, and I made a promise to the American people, that we continue to conduct effective counterterrorism operations in Afghanistan and beyond. We’ve done just that.”\n\nBiden pledged that Zawahiri “will never again allow Afghanistan to become a terrorist safe haven, because he is gone and we’re going to make sure that nothing else happens.”\n\nThe President concluded by expressing gratitude to US intelligence and counterterrorism communities, saying that he hopes Zawahiri’s death will bring some measure of closure to the friends and families of 9/11 victims.\n\n“To those who continue to seek to harm the United States, hear me now: We will always remain vigilant and we will act – and we will always do what is necessary to ensure the safety and security of Americans at home and around the globe,” he concluded.\n\nEmbarrassment for Taliban\n\nA senior counterterrorism analyst told CNN that it would have been impossible for Zawahiri to be in Kabul without the invitation and acquiescence of at least a small number of Taliban, whether from the Haqqani network or another part of the group.\n\nThe analyst said that this strike was embarrassing for the Taliban as they had claimed there were no foreign fighters in Afghanistan and no al Qaeda.\n\nHe added that recent statements from Zawahiri had suggested the al Qaeda leader was feeling more relaxed. The statements had referred to more recent events, the analyst said, adding this potentially revealed a complacency that may have led to the successful strike.\n\nThe issue now arises as to who will be Zawahiri’s successor.\n\nThe current al Qaeda No. 2, Saif al Adel, is thought to have been in Iran, according to United Nations reports.\n\nThe analyst said that this raised an urgent issue for the Iranians who now have to choose between expelling the new al Qaeda leader or harboring him.\n\nA former official in the Afghan government with an intimate grasp of counterterrorism said that he had heard al Adel had already left Iran for Afghanistan.\n\nClose ally of bin Laden\n\nZawahiri comes from a distinguished Egyptian family, according to the New York Times. His grandfather, Rabia’a al-Zawahiri, was an imam at al-Azhar University in Cairo. His great-uncle, Abdel Rahman Azzam, was the first secretary of the Arab League.\n\nHe eventually helped to mastermind the deadliest terror attack on American soil, when hijackers turned US airliners into missiles.\n\n“Those 19 brothers who went out and gave their souls to Allah almighty, God almighty has granted them this victory we are enjoying now,” al-Zawahiri said in a videotaped message released in April 2002.\n\nIt was the first of many taunting messages the terrorist – who became al Qaeda’s leader after US forces killed bin Laden in 2011 – would send out over the years, urging militants to continue the fight against America and chiding US leaders.\n\nZawahiri was constantly on the move once the US-led invasion of Afghanistan began after the September 11, 2001, attacks. At one point, he narrowly escaped a US onslaught in the rugged, mountainous Tora Bora region of Afghanistan, an attack that left his wife and children dead.\n\nHe made his public debut as a Muslim militant when he was in prison for his involvement in the 1981 assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat.\n\n“We want to speak to the whole world. Who are we? Who are we?” he said in a jailhouse interview.\n\nBy that time, al-Zawahiri, a young doctor, was already a committed terrorist who conspired to overthrow the Egyptian government for years and sought to replace it with fundamentalist Islamic rule. He proudly endorsed Sadat’s assassination after the Egyptian leader made peace with Israel.\n\nHe spent three years in prison after Sadat’s assassination and claimed he was tortured while in detention. After his release, he made his way to Pakistan, where he treated wounded mujahadeen fighters who fought against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.\n\nThat was when he met bin Laden and found a common cause.\n\n“We are working with brother bin Laden,” he said in announcing the merger of his terror group, Egyptian Islamic Jihad, with al Qaeda in May 1998. “We know him since more than 10 years now. We fought with him here in Afghanistan.”\n\nTogether, the two terror leaders signed a fatwa, or declaration: “The judgment to kill and fight Americans and their allies, whether civilians or military, is an obligation for every Muslim.”\n\nMastermind of 9/11\n\nThe attacks against the US and its facilities began weeks later, with the suicide bombings of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed more than 200 people and wounded more than 5,000 others. Zawahiri and bin Laden gloated after they escaped a US cruise missile attack in Afghanistan that had been launched in retaliation.\n\nThen, there was the attack on the USS Cole in Yemen in October 2000, when suicide bombers on a dinghy detonated their boat, killing 17 American sailors and wounding 39 others.\n\nThe culmination of Zawahiri’s terror plotting came on September 11, 2001, when nearly 3,000 people were killed in the attacks on the twin towers of the World Trade Center and Pentagon. A fourth hijacked airliner, headed for Washington, crashed in a Pennsylvania field after passengers fought back.\n\nSince then, al-Zawahiri raised his public profile, appearing on numerous video and audiotapes to urge Muslims to join the jihad against the United States and its allies. Some of his tapes were followed closely by terrorist attacks.\n\nIn May 2003, for instance, almost simultaneous suicide bombings in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, killed 23 people, including nine Americans, days after a tape thought to contain Zawahiri’s voice was released.\n\nThe US State Department had offered a reward of up to $25 million for information leading directly to his capture. A June 2021 United Nations report suggested he was located somewhere in the border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan, and that he may have been too frail to be featured in propaganda.\n\n9/11 families group expresses gratitude but calls on Biden to hold Saudis accountable\n\nTerry Strada, the chair of 9/11 Families United – a coalition of survivors and families of victims of the September, 11, 2001, terrorist attacks – expressed gratitude for the strike, but called on the President to hold the Saudi Arabian government accountable for alleged government complicity in the attacks.\n\nThe group has criticized the Saudi-backed LIV Golf tour, which began its third competition at Trump National Golf Club Bedminster at the end of July – some 50 miles from Ground Zero in Manhattan.\n\n“I am deeply grateful for the commitment of intelligence agencies and our brave military’s dedication and sacrifices made in removing such evil from our lives. But, in order to achieve full accountability for the murder of thousands on Sept. 11, 2001, President Biden must also hold responsible the Saudi paymasters who bankrolled the Attacks,” Strada said in a statement.\n\n“The financiers are not being targeted by drones, they are being met with fist pumps and hosted at golf clubs. If we’re going to be serious about accountability, we must hold EVERYONE accountable,” Strada added – appearing to reference the President’s controversial gesture with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments on Monday.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak Kylie Atwood Natasha Bertrand Maegan Vazquez Donald Judd Nick Paton Walsh", "Kevin Liptak", "Kylie Atwood", "Natasha Bertrand", "Maegan Vazquez", "Donald Judd", "Nick Paton Walsh"], "publish_date": "2022/08/01"}]}

Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images\n\nA graduate of Fordham University, Scully began his career with the Dodgers in their original home in Brooklyn, New York, when he was recruited by Hall of Fame broadcaster Red Barber to be the third man on the broadcast crew.\n\nBy 25, he became the youngest person to broadcast a World Series game in 1953 and when, two years later, Barber left to join the New York Yankees, Scully was the voice for the Dodgers.\n\nBarber was an early influence on the young broadcaster as he told the Baseball Hall of Fame: “Red was my teacher … and my father. I don’t know – I might have been the son he never had. It wasn’t so much that he taught me how to broadcast. It was an attitude. Get to the park early. Do your homework. Be prepared. Be accurate.”\n\nFrom the broadcast booth perch, Scully became the narrator for the story of baseball’s greatest franchises. He was there when the “Boys of Summer” won their first World Series in 1955 and called the final innings of Don Larsen’s perfect game in the 1956 World Series. It was one of more than 20 no-hitters that Scully covered in his career, the team noted.\n\nWhen the franchise abruptly left Brooklyn for Los Angeles in 1958, Scully also departed his native city to extend a career that lasted 67 years with the Dodgers, the longest tenure of any broadcaster with a single team, the team said.\n\nIn addition to covering the Dodgers, he also was heard on national TV as an announcer for golf and football as well as baseball.\n\nHis most famous calls included when the Braves’ Hank Aaron’s hit his 715th home run in Atlanta, moving ahead of Babe Ruth, and the injured Kirk Gibson’s bottom-of-the-9th walk-off home run in Game 1 of the 1988 World Series.\n\nFriends and fans pay their respects\n\nDodgers manager Dave Roberts, speaking after the team beat the Giants in San Francisco Tuesday night, said the broadcaster inspired him to be better.\n\n“There’s not a better storyteller. I think everyone considers him family. He was in our living rooms for so many generations. Dodger fans consider him part of their family. He lived a fantastic life, a legacy that will live on forever.”\n\nFellow Southern California sports icon, Earvin “Magic” Johnson, said that “Dodger Nation” had lost a legend. “I’ll always remember his smooth broadcasting style. He had a voice & a way of storytelling that made you think he was only talking to you.”\n\nLos Angeles Lakers’ star LeBron James described Scully as “Another great one who made sports so damn special.”\n\nTennis great Billy Jean King said Scully would be missed: “He was a true sports storyteller,” she said on Twitter\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said his passing marked the end of a chapter in the city’s history. “He united us, inspired us, and showed us all what it means to serve. Our City Hall will be lit up for you tomorrow Vin, our dear friend, the Voice of LA. Thank you from a grateful and loving city.\n\nScully broadcast his final home game for the Dodgers on September 25, 2016.\n\nIn a 2020 interview with CNN, Scully described what it felt like: “When I was leaving Dodger Stadium, my last day at the stadium, I hung a big sign out of the door of the window of the booth and it said, ‘I’ll miss you.’ That’s how I felt about the fans.”", "authors": ["Seán Federico-O'Murchú"], "publish_date": "2022/08/02"}]}

Nyota Uhura in “Star Trek: The Original Series,” has died at age 89, according to a statement from her son, Kyle Johnson.\n\n“Last night, my mother, Nichelle Nichols, succumbed to natural causes and passed away. Her light however, like the ancient galaxies now being seen for the first time, will remain for us and future generations to enjoy, learn from, and draw inspiration,” Johnson said in a statement shared to Nichols’ official site on Sunday. “Hers was a life well lived and as such a model for us all.”\n\nNichols died from natural causes, he said.\n\nNichols portrayed communications officer Lt. Nyota Uhura in the “Star Trek” TV series and many of its film offshoots.\n\nWhen “Star Trek” began in 1966, Nichols was a television rarity: a Black woman in a notable role on a prime-time television series. There had been African-American women on TV before, but they often played domestic workers and had small roles; Nichols’ Uhura was an integral part of the multicultural “Star Trek” crew.\n\nThe Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. called it “the first non-stereotypical role portrayed by a Black woman in television history.”\n\nNichols is widely known for participating in one of the first interracial kisses on US television when her character kissed James T. Kirk, portrayed by White Canadian actor William Shatner. In an interview with CNN in 2014, Nichols said the kiss scene “changed television forever, and it also changed the way people looked at one another.”\n\nAfter “Trek’s” three-season run, Nichols dedicated herself to the space program. She helped NASA in making the agency more diverse, helping to recruit astronauts Sally Ride, Judith Resnik and Guion Bluford, among others.\n\nGeorge Takei, who portrayed the USS Enterprise’s helmsman Hikaru Sulu, posted a touching tribute to his co-star.\n\n“I shall have more to say about the trailblazing, incomparable Nichelle Nichols, who shared the bridge with us as Lt. Uhura of the USS Enterprise, and who passed today at age 89,” wrote Takei on Twitter. “For today, my heart is heavy, my eyes shining like the stars you now rest among, my dearest friend.”\n\n“We lived long and prospered together,” he added with a photo of the pair making the iconic Vulcan salute.\n\nThe National Air and Space Museum called Nichols “an inspiration to many, not just for her groundbreaking work on Star Trek but also through her work with NASA to recruit women and people of color to apply to become astronauts” on Twitter.\n\nStacey Abrams, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee in Georgia, also posted a tribute to the actress. “Godspeed to Nichelle Nichols, champion, warrior and tremendous actor,” wrote Abrams on Twitter alongside a photo of herself with Nichols. “Her kindness and bravery lit the path for many. May she forever dwell among the stars.”\n\nNichols was born Grace Dell Nichols near Chicago in 1932. (Unhappy with Grace, she took the name Nichelle when she was a teenager.) Her grandfather was a White Southerner who married a Black woman, causing a rift in his family.\n\nBlessed with a four-octave vocal range, Nichols was performing in local clubs by the time she was 14. Among the performers she met was Duke Ellington, who later took her on tour. She also worked extensively in Chicago clubs and in theater.\n\nShe moved to Los Angeles in the early ’60s and landed a role in a Gene Roddenberry series, “The Lieutenant.” A number of “Star Trek” veterans, including Leonard Nimoy, Walter Koenig and Majel Barrett, also worked on the show.\n\nWhen Roddenberry was creating “Trek,” he remembered Nichols. She was in Europe when she got the call.\n\n“(My agent said), ‘They’re doing ‘Star Trek,’ and I didn’t know what a ‘Star Trek’ was,” she said in an interview with the Television Academy.\n\nUhura wasn’t in the original script, and Nichols was responsible for the name. She was reading a book called “Uhuru” – “freedom” in Swahili – and suggested her character take the name. Roddenberry thought it was too harsh.\n\n“I said, ‘Well, why don’t you do an alteration of it, soften the end with an ‘A,’ and it’ll be Uhura?’ ” she recalled. “He said, ‘That’s it, that’s your name! You named it; it’s yours.’ ”\n\nNichols is survived by her son, Kyle Johnson.", "authors": ["Zoe Sottile Chris Boyette Todd Leopold", "Zoe Sottile", "Chris Boyette", "Todd Leopold"], "publish_date": "2022/07/31"}]}

Credit cards typically charge high interest rates when balances aren’t fully paid off, making this an expensive form of debt.\n\nThe NY Fed said the credit card binge at least partly reflects inflation as prices rise at the fastest pace in more than four decades.\n\n“The impacts of inflation are apparent in high volumes of borrowing,” NY Fed researchers wrote in a blog post.\n\nHigh inflation is also making it more expensive to carry a credit card balance because the Federal Reserve is aggressively raising borrowing costs. The Fed raised its benchmark interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point last week for the second month in a row.\n\nNot only are credit card balances rising, but Americans opened 233 million new credit card accounts during the second quarter, the most since 2008, the NY Fed report found.\n\nHigh inflation is also forcing consumers to dip into their savings. The personal savings rate fell in June to 5.1%, the lowest since August 2009, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said last week.\n\nDespite rising debt levels, the NY Fed said consumer balance sheets appear to be in a “strong position” overall.\n\nMost of the 2% quarter-over-quarter increase in US household debt to $16.2 trillion was driven by a jump in mortgage borrowing. Student loan balances were little changed at $1.6 trillion.\n\nBy and large, Americans continued to pay down debt on schedule last quarter, a reflection of the very strong job market. The NY Fed said the share of current debt transitioning into delinquency remains “historically very low,” though it did increase modestly.\n\n“Although debt balances are growing rapidly, households in general have weathered the pandemic remarkably well,” the NY Fed said in the report, noting the unprecedented assistance from the federal government during the onset of Covid-19.\n\nThere are hints, however, that some lower-income and subprime borrowers are now struggling to keep up with their bills.\n\nThe report found that the delinquency transition rate for credit cards and auto loans is “creeping up,” especially in lower-income areas.\n\n“With the supportive policies of the pandemic mostly in the past, there are pockets of borrowers who are beginning to show some distress on their debt,” the report said.\n\nHelped by moratoriums and forbearance programs, foreclosures remain “very low,” according to the report.\n\nHowever, credit reports indicate the number of new foreclosures increased by 11,000 during the second quarter, the NY Fed said, potentially signaling the “beginning of a return to more typical levels.”", "authors": ["Matt Egan"], "publish_date": "2022/08/02"}]}

The league is pushing for a full-season suspension instead.\n\nOn Monday, Watson was suspended for six games this season for violating the NFL’s personal conduct policy in private meetings with massage therapists while he was with the Houston Texans.\n\nThe NFL had asked Sue L. Robinson, the former judge hired by the NFL and its players union to decide on Watson’s punishment, for a suspension covering the 17-game regular season and the playoffs.\n\nNo player accused of non-violent sexual misconduct, as Watson has been, has received a suspension longer than six games, Robinson said in her 16-page ruling issued Monday.\n\n“While it may be entirely appropriate to more severely discipline players for nonviolent sexual conduct, I do not believe it is appropriate to do so without notice of the extraordinary change this position portends for the NFL and its players,” she wrote.\n\n“The NFL notified the NFLPA that it will appeal Judge Robinson’s disciplinary decision and filed its brief this afternoon,” league officials said Wednesday. “Commissioner Roger Goodell will determine who will hear the appeal.”\n\nOn Thursday, the league announced Goodell had selected former New Jersey Attorney General Peter C. Harvey to hear the appeal, noting Harvey has arbitrated other cases and has advised the league on the “development and implementation of workplace policies, including the NFL’s Personal Conduct Policy.” Harvey is also a consulting expert with the NFL’s Diversity Advisory Committee, which helps improve racial and gender diversity throughout the league.\n\nWatson has repeatedly denied the accusations.\n\n“I’ve never assaulted, I never disrespected, and I never harassed any woman in my life,” Watson has said. “I don’t have any regrets.”\n\nThe NFL Player’s Association has already said it would not appeal. The union declined to comment Wednesday. The Browns also declined to comment.\n\nThe attorney of Watson’s accusers said the NFL “does not care about the rights of women” following the Cleveland Browns quarterback’s suspension for sexual misconduct allegations.\n\nAppearing Tuesday on ESPN’s “First Take,” attorney Tony Buzbee attacked the investigation, saying he hopes the NFL will appeal the case, but his clients are angered and disappointed by the lenient suspension handed down by a disciplinary officer.\n\n“Don’t expect the NFL to do anything heroic here,” Buzbee said.\n\nTwo grand juries in Texas declined to charge Watson with any crimes.\n\nWatson throws a pass during Browns training camp. Nick Cammett/Getty Images\n\nTwenty-four civil lawsuits have been filed against Watson – 23 have been settled confidentially.\n\nWatson’s attorney Rusty Hardin told CNN he will not comment until after the NFL decides whether to appeal.\n\nJudge Robinson said she was suspending the 26-year-old for his “predatory conduct.”\n\n“Although this is the most significant punishment ever imposed on an NFL player for allegations of non-violent sexual conduct, Mr. Watson’s pattern of conduct is more egregious than any before reviewed by the NFL,” Robinson wrote in the 16-page ruling.\n\nBut, despite those findings, Judge Robinson critiqued the NFL for asking for an unprecedented full-season suspension which would be far lengthier than other players accused of non-violent sexual conduct.\n\nOn Tuesday, Buzbee – the attorney for the plaintiffs in the case against Watson – told ESPN he hopes the NFL moves forward with an appeal because that gesture would be well received by the accusers.\n\n“I think that would change the messaging and I think it would be well received by the women I represent,” he said.\n\nIn her findings, Robinson wrote that her decision is limited by the record that was presented to her by NFL investigators who are former prosecutors with decades of experience investigating sexual assault cases. She noted that Watson had “allegedly worked with more than 60 massage therapists” during the period under consideration, and that the NFL had “only investigated the claims of the 24 therapists suing Mr. Watson for damages.”\n\nAnd of the 24, Robinson wrote that the NFL was only able to interview 12 alleged victims. They relied on the testimony of four of those 12 in the case presented to her for review.\n\nBuzbee attacked the way in which the investigation was conducted.\n\n“None of my clients testified in front of the federal judge. I think that’s a common misconception that four people testified. That’s not the case. Not one of them showed up. Not one of them was asked to show up and testify,” he said. “Since those interviews, we have had no contact whatsoever with the NFL.\n\nBuzbee represents women in the civil cases against Watson, accusing him of sexual assault. Yi-Chin Lee/AP\n\n“They care about the bottom line. They care about making money,” said Buzbee on ESPN.\n\n“They’re trying to manage this as a PR crisis, but as far as trying to do anything to assuage these particular women or women’s rights – or dealing with women’s rights in general – that’s not part of their mission statement and they’ve made that very clear throughout this process.”\n\nOn Tuesday, the Cleveland Rape Crisis Center said it was “disappointed” by the ruling to suspend Watson for only six games.\n\n“The 6-game suspension given dangerously mirrors the flaws in our criminal justice systems and sends a grave message to our communities,” the organization said in a statement to CNN on Tuesday. “Far too often those in positions of power and celebrity who commit violence against others are not held accountable for their actions.\n\n“These ongoing headlines are triggering for so many. To survivors, we say we see you and we believe you. Your story matters. Cleveland Rape Crisis Center is available 24/7/365 online or by calling/texting (216) 619-6192.”\n\nThe ruling comes after a number of women who worked as massage therapists filed lawsuits against Watson alleging sexual assault or misconduct during massage sessions. Last month, 30 women who have made or intended to make claims against the Texans organization over Watson’s alleged misconduct settled their claims, according to a statement from Buzbee and the Texans’ ownership.\n\nWatson, a three-time Pro Bowler, did not play last season while a member of the Houston Texans because of a trade demand as well as the investigations into these allegations.\n\nDays later, the Browns traded three first-round picks for Watson and then signed him to a five-year, fully guaranteed $230 million contract, the most guaranteed money in NFL history.\n\nWatson will not be paid during his suspension, but the Browns structured his new contract so his base salary is $690,000 his first year and then $46 million for each of the next four years, according to the salary tracking website Spotrac.", "authors": ["Ben Morse Jacob Lev", "Ben Morse", "Jacob Lev"], "publish_date": "2022/08/03"}]}

That marks the 50th consecutive day of falling prices.\n\nGas prices have tumbled by 86 cents since hitting a record average high of $5.02 on June 14. Over the past month alone the national average is down by 65 cents.\n\nNineteen states have average gas prices below $4, including Ohio, Iowa and Wisconsin, according to AAA.\n\nThe steady decline in gas prices has been driven by multiple factors, including recession fears that have knocked down oil prices and the fact that some Americans cut back on driving when gas prices spiked above $5 a gallon.\n\n“When people pay and they see $100 for the bill, they panic and become apoplectic,” said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Service.\n\nKloza also credited the unprecedented release of emergency oil by the Biden administration from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, though he conceded it’s difficult to quantify the impact.\n\nNo matter the cause, falling prices at the pump give a boost to consumers grappling with high prices on food, rent and everyday items.\n\nAlthough the average price nationally is $4.16 a gallon, Kloza noted figure is lifted by high prices in places like California. The median price, on the other hand, is $3.99, according to OPIS.\n\nSome analysts argue prices will continue to dip, especially as the summer driving season winds down.\n\n“This streak has more room to run,” said Kloza.\n\nAndy Lipow, president of consulting firm Lipow Oil Associates, expects the national average will drop to $4.10 a gallon in the next seven to 10 days and $4 by Labor Day.\n\nOil tumbles\n\nMeanwhile, oil prices fell sharply on Wednesday, finishing at levels unseen since Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\nThe losses were sparked by a new government report that revealed an unexpected build in stockpiles of crude and gasoline inventories, raising questions about energy demand.\n\nUS crude tumbled 4% to $90.66 a barrel – the lowest close since February 10, two weeks before Russia launched its war in Ukraine. Brent crude, the world benchmark, lost more than 3%.\n\nConcerns about a global economic slowdown have driven oil prices lower in recent days and weeks. Since closing at $123.70 a barrel on March 8, US oil is down by about 27%.\n\nOil prices turned lower on Wednesday after the US Energy Information Administration said weekly oil inventories jumped by 4.5 million barrels last week, compared with expectations for a decline.
