They must now hold on to Wisconsin and win two out of three Democrat-held seats in Arizona, Nevada and Georgia to win the majority.\n\nThe Democratic win in Pennsylvania – the rare swing state where President Joe Biden hit the trail this fall – is also a rebuke of former President Donald Trump, who had endorsed Oz ahead of the primary and also appeared in the commonwealth in the final weekend of the campaign.\n\nSenate Republicans fell short in New Hampshire and Colorado, where Democratic Sens. Maggie Hassan and Michael Bennet will win reelection, CNN projects.\n\nDemocrats also fell short in two Senate states that had proven surprisingly competitive heading into Election Day. Republicans will hold onto North Carolina and Ohio, CNN projects, denying Democrats opportunities to pick up seats that could have mitigated any future losses.\n\nRepublicans had hoped to sweep a trio of Virginia districts on their way to a landslide. They will pick up one in a bellwether district with Republican Jen Kiggans’ defeat of Democratic Rep. Elaine Luria, the only member of the select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection who was facing a competitive general election.\n\nLuria had put the fight to save American democracy at the center of her closing message but she fell short in a district that got slightly better for Republicans in redistricting. The race was among the most closely watched in the country – viewed as an early indicator of Republican strength on Tuesday night.\n\nBut in another key Virginia district, Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger will hold on to her seat, CNN projects, in a district that became bluer in redistricting. And in Michigan, Rep. Elissa Slotkin, another Democrat who came to the House in 2018’s blue wave, will win another term, CNN projected early Wednesday.\n\nElsewhere in the House, the GOP has made slower-than-expected gains, while Democrats have also picked up several seats. New Jersey Republican Tom Kean Jr., the son of a popular former governor, will defeat Democratic Rep. Tom Malinowski in a seat that got worse for Democrats, while Democrats will knock off GOP Rep. Steve Chabot, a perennial target, in an Ohio district that became much more favorable to them.\n\nSome of the most aggressive deniers of the 2020 election results will lose their 2022 gubernatorial races, CNN projects.\n\nThat includes Pennsylvania’s Doug Mastriano, who will fall to rising star Democrat Josh Shapiro, and Michigan’s Tudor Dixon, who falsely claimed Trump won Michigan in 2020 and will fall to Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.\n\nThe fate of several Trump-backed candidates who echoed his lies about the 2020 presidential election was still unclear as ballots were being counted in Arizona and Nevada, but Arizona gubernatorial nominee Kari Lake had already raised unfounded doubts about the vote – in a clear echo of some conservatives’ repeated attempts to cast doubt on Maricopa’s results in 2020.\n\nSeveral secretary of state candidates – including Republican Rayla Campbell of Massachusetts, Kim Crockett of Minnesota, Audrey Trujillo of New Mexico, H. Brooke Paige of Vermont and Kristina Karamo of Michigan – all lost their bids. Before the election, CNN tracked at least a dozen Republican nominees for secretary of state who denied the legitimacy of the 2020 election.\n\nIn Georgia, Republican Gov. Brian Kemp will defeat Democrat Stacey Abrams, CNN projects, in their rematch. Kemp had been targeted by Trump during the primary because he refused to overturn the 2020 presidential results. But Kemp largely ignored those attacks and ran on his record as a conservative who had helped the state’s economy recover after the Covid-19 pandemic. His strategy may offer a template for other Republicans who have crossed Trump.\n\nIn Florida, two early calls underscored GOP strength in the state. Sen. Marco Rubio will be reelected, CNN projects, defeating Democratic Rep. Val Demings. And Gov. Ron DeSantis, a potential challenger to ex-President Donald Trump in the Republican presidential primary in 2024, will win reelection in a victory that will supercharge his national ambitions.\n\nAnd in Alabama, Republican Katie Britt, who was backed by Trump, will easily win the seat being vacated by retiring GOP Sen. Richard Shelby, becoming the first elected female senator from the state. In another history-making race, CNN projects that Arkansas Republican Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Trump’s former White House press secretary, will become the state’s first female governor, a post that was once held by her father, former GOP presidential candidate Mike Huckabee.\n\nHistory was also made in blue states. In Massachusetts, Maura Healey will become the state’s first elected female governor and the nation’s first out lesbian governor, CNN projects. And Democrat Wes Moore will serve as Maryland’s first Black governor.\n\nEarly exit polls revealed a nation in the grip of economic pessimism. Roughly three-quarters of voters felt negatively about the economy with about 4 in 10 deeming it downright poor, according to the preliminary national results of the exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research. A third of the electorate said inflation was the most important issue to their vote while about 27% cited abortion – the issue Democrats hoped could give them a boost after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\nRepublicans have already promised to launch investigations into the administration and cripple its agenda if they win the House majority, and many of their nominees have echoed Trump’s election falsehoods, leading to Biden’s repeated warnings about threats to democracy.\n\nAppearing in Ohio on Monday night for Vance, the former president said he’d be making a big announcement at his Mar-a-Lago resort on November 15. CNN had previously reported his aides were eyeing the third week of November for a campaign launch – timing that would allow Trump to take credit for GOP successes in the midterms.\n\nAhead of a potential rematch with Trump, Biden’s dragging approval ratings had made him an unwelcome presence on the campaign trail in swing states. He spent election eve rallying in Maryland for Moore and in New York several days earlier for Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul.\n\nA divided government in Washington could allow Biden to wield his presidential veto to frustrate Republican plans of prolonging Trump-era tax cuts and any attempt to pass a national ban on abortion. But it could also trigger fiscal showdowns and the threats of government shutdowns. A clash could also be looming over raising the debt ceiling.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Maeve Reston Stephen Collinson", "Maeve Reston", "Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/11/08"}]}

All tropical storm and storm surge warnings have however been discontinued.\n\nMeanwhile, communities are assessing the damage.\n\nAt least 49 beachfront buildings including 24 hotels and condos have been deemed “unsafe” following Hurricane Nicole in Volusia County, officials said in a press release. “The structural damage along our coastline is unprecedented,” county manager George Recktenwald said in the release. “We have never experienced anything like this before, so we ask for your patience as we make our assessments.\n\nAn additional 11 structures on Daytona Beach shores have already been deemed compromised, according to Recktenwald.\n\nVolusia County officials have “declared a curfew in incorporated and unincorporated areas east of the Intracoastal Waterway from 11:22 a.m. Thursday, Nov. 10, through 7 a.m. Friday, Nov. 11,” said a Volusia County storm update.\n\nTwo hundred residents were housed in county shelters, said the update. Three shelters remain open. Roughly 23,000 customers are without power in the county, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nTrack Nicole here >>\n\nIn Indian River County, officials Thursday morning will “be assessing debris and messaging cleanup plans,” said spokesperson Kathy Copeland. In St. Lucie County, there were so far “no serious reports of damages or injuries,” spokesperson Erick Gill said, adding, “Most likely the biggest impact is going to be beach erosion.”\n\nDale laJeunesse stands in front of his home surrounded by flood water after Hurricane Nicole came ashore on Thursday, November 10, in Daytona Beach.

And between 2 to 6 inches are expected from parts of the US southeast to the southern and central Appalachians and western mid-Atlantic, the hurricane center said.\n\nNicole weakened to a tropical storm shortly after landfall, and then became a depression late Thursday. It’s expected to become a post-tropical cyclone over the Southeast.\n\nHere’s what to know now:\n\nResidents outside Florida should now prepare: There are nearly three million people under a tornado watch issued for southeast Georgia, eastern and southern South Carolina and portions of far southern North Carolina. “Given the uncertainty of the storm’s strength and path as it approaches South Carolina, residents need to have their personal emergency plans ready to go just in case we need to take safety precautions later in the week,” said Kim Stenson, who heads the state’s emergency management division.\n\nTens of thousands without power: More than 237,000 homes and businesses in Florida were without power late Thursday, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nLow tide limits storm surge: Nicole’s peak winds coincided with low tide, limiting the storm surge and inundation on the shore. At Port Canaveral, the surge was measured at just under 6 feet around 4 a.m. ET, just after landfall. Later Thursday morning, surge was down to around 3 feet, but water levels are expected to remain high through high tide, between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m.\n\nNicole's storm surge pushes Wednesday into East Boynton Beach in Florida. FB/Boynton Beach Police Department\n\nKing Tide puts structures at risk: The King Tide that affected Volusia County Thursday morning “is of great concern for potentially further damage to structures,” said officials with Volusia County Emergency Management. King Tides is a term used to describe higher than normal tidal cycles that typically occur during a new moon or a full moon when the moon makes its closest pass to the Earth. When they coincide with bad weather including heavy rain, winds and waves, they can cause severe flooding. Because of rising sea levels, King Tides are becoming more frequent and severe.\n\nFlights canceled and schools closed: The storm’s colossal path led to the closure of many schools, colleges and universities, as well as the cancellation of hundreds of flights and the shuttering of amusement parks. Orlando International Airport halted operations Wednesday afternoon, and Miami International Airport warned of cancellations but did not plan to close.\n\nHistoric hurricane: Nicole’s landfall Thursday was the latest in a calendar year a hurricane has ever struck Florida’s Atlantic coast. It broke the record set by the Yankee Hurricane, which hit Florida’s east coast on November 4, 1935.\n\nWhere the storm hit: The storm struck just south of Vero Beach with winds of 75 mph before quickly weakening, the National Hurricane Center said. Its strong winds, downpours and storm surge thrashed some areas hit in September by Hurricane Ian. Nicole on Wednesday brought strong winds and dangerous storm surge to the northwestern Bahamas.", "authors": ["Aya Elamroussi Dakin Andone Alaa Elassar", "Aya Elamroussi", "Dakin Andone", "Alaa Elassar"], "publish_date": "2022/11/10"}]}

It also comes amid a spate of layoffs at other tech firms in recent months as the high-flying sector reacts to high inflation, rising interest rates and fears of a looming recession.\n\n“Today I’m sharing some of the most difficult changes we’ve made in Meta’s history,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote in a blog post to employees. “I’ve decided to reduce the size of our team by about 13% and let more than 11,000 of our talented employees go.”\n\nThe job cuts will impact many corners of the company, but Meta’s recruiting team will be hit particularly hard as “we’re planning to hire fewer people next year,” Zuckerberg said in the post. He added that a hiring freeze would be extended until the first quarter, with few exceptions.\n\nIn September, Meta had a headcount of more than 87,000, per a September SEC filing.\n\nMeta’s core ad sales business has been hit by privacy changes implemented by Apple, advertisers tightening budgets and heightened competition from newer rivals like TikTok. Meanwhile, Meta has been spending billions to build a future version of the internet, dubbed the metaverse, that likely remains years away from widespread acceptance.\n\nLast month, the company posted its second quarterly revenue decline and said that its profit was cut in half from the prior year. Once valued at more than $1 trillion last year, Meta’s market value has since plunged to around $250 billion.\n\n“I want to take accountability for these decisions and for how we got here,” Zuckerberg wrote in his post Wednesday. “I know this is tough for everyone, and I’m especially sorry to those impacted.”\n\nShares of Meta rose 5% in trading Wednesday following the announcement.\n\nMeta is not alone in feeling the pain of a market downturn. The tech sector has been facing a dizzying reality check as inflation, rising interest rates and more macroeconomic headwinds have led to a stunning shift in spending for an industry that only grew more dominant as consumers shifted more of their lives online during the pandemic.\n\n“At the start of Covid, the world rapidly moved online and the surge of e-commerce led to outsized revenue growth,” Zuckerberg wrote Wednesday. “Many people predicted this would be a permanent acceleration that would continue even after the pandemic ended. I did too, so I made the decision to significantly increase our investments. Unfortunately, this did not play out the way I expected.”\n\n“I got this wrong, and I take responsibility for that,” he added.\n\nMeta’s headcount in September was nearly twice the 48,268 staffers it had at the start of the pandemic in March of 2020.\n\nA handful of tech companies have announced hiring freezes or job cuts in recent months, often after having seen rapid growth during the pandemic. Last week, rideshare company Lyft said it was axing 13% of employees, and payment-processing firm Stripe said it was cutting 14% of its staff. The same day, e-commerce giant Amazon said it was implementing a pause on corporate hiring.\n\nAlso last week, Facebook-rival Twitter announced mass layoffs impacting roles across the company as its new owner, Elon Musk, took the helm.\n\nIn addition to the layoffs, Zuckerberg said the company expects to “roll out more cost-cutting changes” in the coming months. Meta, which like other tech giants is known for its vast, perk-filled offices, is rethinking its real estate needs, he said, and “transitioning to desk sharing for people who already spend most of their time outside the office.”\n\n“Overall,” he said, “this will add up to a meaningful cultural shift in how we operate.”", "authors": ["Catherine Thorbecke"], "publish_date": "2022/11/09"}]}

Results posted to Powerball.com similarly said there was one winner who matched all six numbers in California – the odds of which were 1 in 292.2 million, according to the Multi-State Lottery Association.\n\nThe winning numbers, which were announced Tuesday morning after Monday night’s drawing was delayed, were 10-33-41-47-56 and the Powerball was 10, according to the association.\n\nAnd while you likely weren’t the jackpot winner, lotteries are urging players to check their tickets on the chance you won one of the other – albeit smaller – prizes: Per the Multi-State Lottery Association, more than 11.2 million tickets won cash prizes totaling $98.1 million, including 22 tickets that won $1 million prizes for matching the five white numbers but not the Powerball.\n\nThe jackpot was a record $1.9 billion but grew to $2.04 billion by the time of the drawing, the association said in a statement, “making it the world’s largest lottery prize” – just as its organizers intended when they changed the odds in 2015.\n\nIn fact, the jackpot was so large that California lottery officials didn’t have the appropriate signage: At the gas station where the winning ticket was sold, just northeast of Los Angeles, they taped a “B” onto signs that read, “Millionaire made here,” so they would instead read, “Billionaire made here.”\n\nThe winner has yet to come forward, said Carolyn Becker, a spokesperson for the California lottery, adding, “Somebody is holding on to a very important piece of paper this morning.”\n\nThe ticket did, however, make one millionaire: Joseph Chahayed, the owner of the gas station, was awarded his own $1 million for being the retailer who sold the winning ticket.\n\nJoseph Chahayed is the shop owner who sold the winning Powerball ticket. Chahayed now receives a $1 million bonus check. CNN/CNN\n\nChahayed, who came to the US from Syria in 1980 with his wife and two children, told reporters he arrived at the gas station Tuesday morning to find California lottery officials waiting for him.\n\n“They said, ‘Congratulations, your station sent a winner,’” he said, adding he hoped the winner lived in the neighborhood. The grandfather of 11 also said he was happy the lottery benefited California schools.\n\nThe announcement of a winner Tuesday came after officials delayed the drawing Monday night, due to what the Multi-State Lottery Association called a “technical issue.”\n\nThe association initially said overnight the delay was caused when one participating lottery needed more time to process its sales and play data, echoing an earlier statement by the California Lottery, which said one lottery needed additional time to complete the necessary security protocols.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, the Minnesota Lottery announced its sales verification system caused a processing delay, prompting the postponement of the drawing.\n\n“The delay was necessary to confirm the Powerball drawing could be conducted securely and accurately,” the Minnesota Lottery release said. “At no time was the integrity of the process compromised.”\n\nAll 48 participating lotteries are required to submit their sales and plays before the winning numbers can be selected, the Multi-State Lottery Association said in a statement overnight. “Powerball has stringent security requirements to protect the integrity of the game and remains committed to holding a drawing that gives all players a fair chance to win,” the association said.\n\n“Like the rest of America, Powerball is eager to hold its drawing for the world record jackpot,” the association said in a follow-up statement Tuesday morning before the drawing, “however, protecting the integrity of the draw is of upmost importance, even if that means a further delay,” the statement early Tuesday said, urging players to hold on to their tickets.\n\nAccording to the Multi-State Lottery Association, Tuesday’s jackpot was hit on the 41st draw of the run, marking the sixth time the Powerball jackpot was hit in 2022. The last Powerball jackpot was won on August 3 in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe largest Powerball jackpot ever won was in January 2016, when three winners split a prize advertised at $1.586 billion. Each took their share of the cash value, which added up to $983.5 million.\n\nPowerball draws take place every Monday, Wednesday and Saturday at 10:59 p.m. ET.\n\nPowerball is played by charging $2 per ticket and having players choose five white balls between the numbers 1 to 69 and a red Powerball from the numbers 1 to 26. If a player gets all six numbers correct, they win the massive jackpot.\n\nThe odds of winning the jackpot by matching all 5 numbers and the Powerball number are one in 292.2 million.\n\nPrior to 2015, though, the white balls were numbered 1 to 59 and the Powerball was numbered 1 to 35. The change means that now gamblers have better odds of winning small prizes but worse odds of winning the jackpot, making it more likely that the big number will grow to record sizes.", "authors": ["Aya Elamroussi Dakin Andone", "Aya Elamroussi", "Dakin Andone"], "publish_date": "2022/11/08"}]}

Notification is given via official mail and normally takes up to two weeks to be received.”\n\nRussian penal colonies are known for their lack of hygiene and access to medical care, with inmates often required to perform manual labor.\n\nLast month, Griner lost her appeal of her sentence. She was detained in February and convicted in August of smuggling drugs into Russia.\n\nShe has repeatedly apologized for bringing a small amount of cannabis into the country, where she played basketball in the off-season.\n\nIn a statement, Griner’s representatives said they don’t know where she is – or what her condition is.\n\n“Our primary concern continues to be BG’s health and well-being,” Griner’s agent, Lindsay Colas, said. “As we work through this very difficult phase of not knowing exactly where BG is or how she is doing, we ask for the public’s support in continuing to write letters and express their love and care for her.”\n\nUS diplomatic efforts\n\nRussia “unfortunately followed past practice” and did not notify the United States ahead of moving Griner, a senior State Department official said Wedneday. While US officials expected Griner would be transferred, they found out about the move from her legal team and press reports.\n\nUS diplomats have asked Russia for information on Griner but Russia hasn’t provided any answers, the official said.\n\n“We are communicating very clearly to the Russians requesting information on her current location as well as her destination in addition to the message that we expect consistent with their obligations, including under under the Vienna Convention, to have a consistent consular access to Brittney Griner,” the official said.\n\nGriner’s detention has raised concerns that she is being used as a political pawn in Russia’s war against Ukraine.\n\nThe US government condemned the denial of her appeal last week, with a State Department spokesperson calling it “another repudiation of justice, which only compounds the original injustice of her detention.”\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken called news of Griner’s transfer “another injustice layered on her ongoing unjust and wrongful detention.”\n\n“As we work to secure Brittney Griner’s release, we expect Russian authorities to provide our Embassy officials with regular access to all U.S. citizens detained in Russia, including Brittney, as is their obligation,” Blinken said in a statement Wednesday. “Ensuring the health and welfare of U.S. citizen detainees in Russia is a priority, and we will continue to press for fair and transparent treatment for them all.”\n\nBiden says he is ‘determined’ to bring Griner home\n\nPresident Joe Biden said Wednesday he hopes Russia will talk more seriously about a prisoner exchange following Tuesday’s midterm elections.\n\n“My intention is to get her home, and we have had a number of discussions so far. And I am hopeful that now that our election is over, there’s a willingness to negotiate more specifically with this,” Biden said at a news conference.\n\n“I’m telling you, I am determined to get her home and get her home safely, along with others, I might add,” Biden said.\n\nAmerican officials “continue to work relentlessly to bring home” both Griner and Paul Whelan, another American held in Russia, who was sentenced to 16 years in prison after he was convicted of espionage – charges he denies.\n\n“We will not relent until they are reunited with their loved ones,” Blinken said Wednesday.", "authors": ["Abphillip Rhea Mogul", "Rhea Mogul"], "publish_date": "2022/11/09"}]}

But by late morning, users began noticing that the badge had vanished.\n\n“I just killed it,” Musk tweeted in response to a tweet about the disappearances. Musk added: “Please note that Twitter will do lots of dumb things in coming months. We will keep what works & change what doesn’t.”\n\nMinutes later, however, Crawford was forced to clarify what Musk meant.\n\n“The official label is still going out as part of the @TwitterBlue launch – we are just focusing on government and commercial entities to begin with,” Crawford tweeted. “What you saw him mention was the fact that we’re not focusing on giving individuals the ‘Official’ label right now.”\n\nDespite that, accounts including NASA, CNN and the UN had all been stripped of their “official” labels by Wednesday afternoon, fueling the confusion.\n\nThe real-time experiment highlights Musk’s improvisational management style, which he has applied liberally across the company in his initial weeks of ownership.\n\nIn recent days, Twitter and Musk have been met with widespread criticism over the company’s plan to change the meaning of the blue check mark away from identifying confirmed individuals, particularly public figures, toward a new meaning signifying that a user has paid for Twitter Blue, the company’s subscription service.\n\nElection security experts warned of the likelihood that bad actors could pay for a blue check mark, then change their display names to impersonate government officials or other authoritative sources of information.\n\nAfter appearing to ready the feature for rollout over the weekend, Twitter later decided to delay the deployment until after the midterms, CNN has previously reported. Also over the weekend, Musk vowed that accounts caught engaging in undisclosed impersonation would be permanently banned without warning, reversing earlier promises that so-called “permabans” would be extremely rare.\n\nTwitter said Tuesday evening that to resolve ambiguity about which accounts on its platform have been identity-verified — as opposed to those simply paying $8 a month for a blue check mark on their profiles — the company would introduce the gray check mark as part of an “official” label.\n\nAn earlier screenshot posted by Crawford showed how the new label would appear. The screenshot displayed Twitter’s own account profile, which included the standard blue check mark beside its display name as well as a gray check mark and the word “Official” underneath its account handle.\n\n“Not all previously verified accounts will get the ‘Official’ label and the label is not available for purchase,” Crawford tweeted on Tuesday. “Accounts that will receive it include government accounts, commercial companies, business partners, major media outlets, publishers and some public figures.”\n\nCrawford also confirmed that the forthcoming option to pay for a blue check mark will not include an identity verification requirement.\n\n“We’ll continue to experiment with ways to differentiate between account types,” Crawford said.", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/11/08"}]}

One death was reported in Maryland; another person became ill while pregnant and lost their baby, the CDC said in a statement.\n\nTo date, seven listeria infections has been reported in New York, three in Maryland, two in Illinois, two in Massachusetts, one in California and one in New Jersey. Those infected ranged in age from from 38 to 92, with an average age of 74. Over half of those sickened were men.\n\nMost of the people identified in the outbreak so far are of Eastern European descent or speak Russian, the CDC said, adding that the agency is still investigating reasons for why the outbreak appears to be disproportionately affecting this population.\n\nHowever, some infected people who got sick could have recovered without medical care, and thus their cases have gone unreported. “The true number of sick people in this outbreak is likely higher than the number reported, and the outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses,” the CDC added.\n\nIn interviewing those sickened, CDC investigators found that five of the seven people in New York purchased sliced deli meat or cheese from at least one location of NetCost Market, a chain of stores selling international foods. However, that is not the only location of the illness, the CDC said, as people sickened in other states reported buying meats or cheeses from other delis.\n\nListeria monocytogenes is a hardy bacteria that can be easily transferred in food preparation and can be hard to remove, the CDC said. Elizabeth White/CDC/AP\n\nDeli counters and food processing facilities can be a common source of listeria infection, the CDC said, as listeria can easily spread between food and equipment or surfaces and can be hard to remove.\n\nIf you have purchased deli cheese or meat, the agency recommends a careful cleaning of your refrigerator — and any containers or surfaces the meat or cheese may have touched — with hot, soapy water.\n\n“Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any symptoms of severe Listeria illness after eating meat or cheese from a deli,” the CDC said.\n\nSymptoms of listeria usually occur within four weeks of infection but can take as long as 70 days to appear. In some cases, the first signs of infection are diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. Typical symptoms that follow include headache, stiff neck, fever, muscle pain, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions.\n\nWho’s most at risk\n\nListeria is the third leading cause of death from food poisoning in the United States, according to the CDC, and is especially dangerous for anyone older than age 65, with a weakened immune system, or pregnant.\n\nPregnant people are especially at risk. According to the CDC, they are 10 times more likely to get a listeria infection, and the odds are even higher for Hispanic pregnant people, who are 24 times more likely to get listeria.\n\nPregnant people typically experience only flu-like symptoms, but the danger to a developing fetus is high. Infections during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage, premature delivery or stillbirth. Newborns with listeria infection can develop blood infections, meningitis, and other serious and potentially life-threatening complications.\n\nA listeria infection is treated with antibiotics.", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/11/09"}]}
