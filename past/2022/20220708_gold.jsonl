Even then, the Prime Minister insisted that he would continue as caretaker leader while the Conservative Party launches the process of choosing a successor.\n\nSome senior figures in his party say even that will be unsustainable, given the dwindling number of people willing to work for him.\n\nOthers are already lining up to replace him. Party officials say they will announce the timetable for a leadership election by Monday.\n\nSpeaking in front of the famous 10 Downing Street door, the same place where many of his predecessors delivered their own resignation address, Johnson announced that he would be stepping down – without actually saying the words out loud.\n\n“It is clearly now the will of the parliamentary Conservative Party that there should be a new leader of that party and therefore, a new prime minister,” Johnson said.\n\n“The process of choosing that new leader should begin now,” he added, saying the time line will be announced next week.\n\nIn a sign that he is planning to stay in the office for as long as he can, Johnson announced he had appointed a new cabinet “to serve, as I will, until a new leader is in place.” Appointing new cabinet ministers means that the government can continue to function as he prepares to depart.\n\nJohnson spoke of his attempts to stay on as leader and how “painful” it is for him to step down, but made no mention of the scandals that have proved his political downfall.\n\n“In the last few days, I’ve tried to persuade my colleagues that it would be eccentric to change governments when we’re delivering so much… and when the economic scene is so difficult domestically and internationally,” Johnson said.\n\n“I regret not to have been successful in those arguments, and of course, it’s painful, not to be able to see through so many ideas and projects myself,” he said, adding that he’s proud of “getting Brexit done” and “leading the West in standing up to Putin’s aggression in Ukraine.”\n\nJohnson went on to address voters directly, expressing sadness at stepping down after nearly three years.\n\n“To you, the British public: I know that there will be many people who are relieved and, perhaps, quite a few will also be disappointed,” he said. “And I want you to know how sad I am to be giving up the best job in the world, but them’s the breaks.”\n\nJohnson has in recent months been engulfed in a series of scandals that forced even his most stalwart supporters to abandon him. The latest was Downing Street’s botched handling of the resignation by Johnson’s former deputy chief whip, Chris Pincher, who was accused of groping two men last week.\n\nJohnson initially attempted to ride out the crisis – despite an unprecedented flight of middle-ranking ministers from the government, a battering at Prime Minister’s Questions and a bruising appearance before a committee of senior lawmakers in Parliament. On Wednesday, he still insisted he wasn’t going to resign.\n\nHe finally gave in Thursday after some of his most loyal allies told him that the game was up.\n\nUK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said Johnson had made the “right decision” to resign. “We need calmness and unity now and to keep governing while a new leader is found,” she added.\n\nGreg Clark, newly appointed UK Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, said that he had a “duty to ensure that the country has a functioning government.”\n\nThe leader of the opposition Labour Party, Keir Starmer, said it was “good news for the country” that Johnson had decided to resign, adding that “it should have happened long ago.”\n\n“He was always unfit for office. He has been responsible for lies, scandal and fraud on an industrial scale,” said Starmer on Twitter.\n\nThe opposition leader also had scathing words for the Conservatives. “They have been in power for 12 years. The damage they have done is profound. Twelve years of economic stagnation. Twelve years of declining public services. Twelve years of empty promises,” Starmer said.\n\n“Enough is enough. We don’t need to change the Tory at the top – we need a proper change of government. We need a fresh start for Britain.”\n\n‘Needless damage’\n\nConventionally, when a Conservative leader resigns, he or she gives the party time to hold a thorough leadership contest, in which Conservative lawmakers and then party members nationwide vote.\n\nBut some said Johnson should leave office more quickly.\n\n“We now need a new Leader as soon as practicable,” Business and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said on Twitter. “Someone who can rebuild trust, heal the country, and set out a new, sensible and consistent economic approach to help families,” he added.\n\nScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also called for the leadership question to be settled.\n\n“There will be a widespread sense of relief that the chaos of the last few days (indeed months) will come to an end, though notion of Boris Johnson staying on as PM until autumn seems far from ideal, and surely not sustainable?” Sturgeon said in a series of tweets.\n\nConservative MP Steve Baker told CNN that the party needs “to move swiftly to a leadership contest.”\n\nBaker said Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab should be caretaker prime minister, but that Johnson could also continue in office. Raab has deputized for Johnson in the past: When the PM was in intensive care with Covid-19 in April 2020 and then again briefly last month when Johnson underwent “routine” operation and was put under general anesthetic.\n\nRaab said he would not stand as next Conservative party leader, according to Britain’s PA news agency, which would make him a candidate for a caretaker PM if Johnson was to step down early.\n\n“I am absolutely determined that we should not prolong this crisis. If it’s agreed within government that Boris Johnson should continue as caretaker, then that’s fine with me,” Baker told CNN. “Because we need to just end the crisis, get into a leadership contest, and start fresh in September.”\n\nFormer British Prime Minister John Major said it would be “unwise and may be unsustainable” for Johnson to remain in the office of prime minister for long while a new Conservative leader is chosen. He too suggested Raab could serve as the acting prime minister.\n\nHours after Johnson’s announcement, Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat launched his campaign for the top job with an editorial in UK newspaper the Telegraph.\n\nBarrage of criticism\n\nJohnson’s departure will mark a remarkable downfall for a prime minister who was once seen as having political superpowers, with an appeal that transcended traditional party lines.\n\nHe won a landslide victory in December 2019 on the promise of delivering a Brexit deal and leading the UK to a bright future outside the European Union. But his premiership unraveled in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nIn recent months the prime minister has faced a barrage of criticism from all sides over his conduct and that of some members of his government, including illegal, Covid-19 lockdown-breaking parties thrown in his Downing Street offices for which he and others were fined.\n\nNumerous other scandals have also hit his standing in the polls. These include accusations of using donor money inappropriately to pay for a refurbishment of his Downing Street home and ordering MPs to vote in such a way that would protect a colleague who had breached lobbying rules.\n\nLast month, he survived a confidence vote among members of his own party, but the final count of his lawmakers who rebelled against him was higher than his supporters expected: 41% of his own parliamentary party refused to back him.\n\nHe suffered a further blow late last month when his party lost two parliamentary by-elections in a single night, raising new questions about his leadership.\n\nHis reputation was also damaged by the resignation of his second ethics adviser in less than two years.", "authors": ["Jack Guy Luke Mcgee Ivana Kottasová", "Jack Guy", "Luke Mcgee", "Ivana Kottasová"], "publish_date": "2022/07/07"}, {"url": "http://www.cnn.com/2022/07/06/uk/boris-johnson-scandals-intl/index.html", "text": "London CNN —\n\nThe crisis that UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is facing right now might be the gravest for his leadership so far – but it’s definitely not the first.\n\nJohnson’s government has been plagued by a series of scandals, from accusations of his disregard for rules and revelations of illegal lockdown-breaking parties held in Downing Street, to allegations of impropriety and abuse by Conservative lawmakers.\n\nHere is a look at some of the more notable scandals of his government.\n\nIllegal prorogation of Parliament\n\nJohnson’s critics have often accused the Prime Minister of disrespecting government procedure and bending rules when it suits him – such as when he decided to ask the Queen to prorogue – or shut down – Parliament for five weeks at the height of a political crisis over Brexit.\n\nThe monarch rubber-stamped the request in line with her duty to stay out of politics and to act only on the advice of ministers.\n\nBut when the Supreme Court found the prorogation was illegal, it raised the uncomfortable question of whether the Queen had broken the law. The ruling led to accusations Johnson’s government deliberately misled the monarch as part of its strategy to secure Brexit.\n\nJohnson was forced to personally apologize for embarrassing the monarch, according to the Sunday Times.\n\nBut the botched prorogation was just one example of Johnson’s disregard for parliamentary rules and standards.\n\nHe backed Home Secretary Priti Patel after an investigation into allegations that she bullied staff found that she breached the Ministerial Code and did not “treat her civil servants with consideration and respect,” and had committed “behaviour that can be described as bullying.”\n\nJohnson’s ethics adviser Alex Allen resigned over the issue.\n\nThe flat refurbishment\n\nOne of the first scandals Johnson faced was an allegation of corruption after WhatsApp messages revealed he had asked a Conservative Party donor for funds to refurbish his Downing Street residence. British news outlets reported that the work cost around £200,000 ($280,000).\n\nPolitical donations and loans are tightly controlled in the United Kingdom, with loans of more than £7,500 ($10,400) logged and publicly revealed by the commission four times a year.\n\nJohnson did not report the donations and as a result, the Conservative Party was fined £17,800 by the Electoral Commission in December last year.\n\nOwen Paterson lobbying scandal\n\nLast year, Johnson attempted to force Conservative MPs to vote in favor of overturning the suspension of a fellow Conservative Member of Parliament.\n\nOwen Paterson, an influential Conservative backbencher and former cabinet minister, had been facing a 30-day suspension after being accused of an “egregious” breach of lobbying rules.\n\nFollowing a backlash, Johnson U-turned and Paterson ultimately quit as MP.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats won Paterson’s seat – one the Conservatives had held for almost 200 years – at the subsequent by-election in December.\n\nPartygate\n\nJohnson has faced months of damaging revelations of parties held at Downing Street in defiance of coronavirus lockdowns, with leaks and images dripping into the media since January.\n\nA report published in May by senior civil servant Sue Gray criticized a culture of rule-breaking events, and revealed new photographs of him at two separate gatherings.\n\nAmong the parties: A night of heavy drinking on the eve of Prince Philip’s funeral – at a time when strict limits on socializing forced even the Queen to sit alone to say goodbye to her husband of nearly 74 years.\n\nGray wrote that “the senior leadership at the centre” of Johnson’s administration “must bear responsibility” for a culture that allowed the parties to take place.\n\nJohnson himself was fined by London’s Metropolitan Police for attending a party on government premises, making him the first UK premier in history found to have broken the law in office. Sunak, who resigned on Tuesday, was also fined for attending the same event.\n\nJohnson’s handling of the scandal was particularly misguided, with Downing Street first denying there were any gatherings, then saying he didn’t know about them and then claiming he attended them because he believed they were work events.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Damning report reveals Downing Street's party culture 02:54 - Source: CNN\n\nPincher misconduct allegations\n\nThis week’s cascade of resignations was sparked by revelations that Johnson appointed Chris Pincher into his government despite knowing of past allegations of sexual misconduct.\n\nPincher, the Conservatives’ deputy chief whip, resigned last week after allegations that he groped two guests at a private dinner. Pincher did not admit the allegations directly, but told Johnson in a letter that “last night I drank far too much,” and “embarrassed myself and other people.”\n\nDowning Street had struggled to explain why Pincher was in government in the first place, amid a wave of revelations about his previous alleged conduct, denying Johnson knew anything specific about the allegations.\n\nOn Tuesday, it emerged that a complaint had been made against Pincher in the Foreign Office about three years ago and that Johnson was briefed on what happened. Downing Street then said he had forgotten.\n\nJohnson acknowledged it “was a mistake” to appoint Pincher to his government on Tuesday, but the damage had already been done. The wave of government resignations started just minutes after he apologized for the decision, with Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Sajid Javid handing in their notices.

Therefore, we have to face a more difficult and complicated situation than previous negotiations,” Wickremesinghe said in parliament.\n\n“Due to the state of bankruptcy our country is in, we have to submit a plan on our debt sustainability to (the IMF) separately,” he added. “Only when they are satisfied with that plan can we reach an agreement at the staff level.

CNN verified the authenticity of more than two dozen entries from the sample provided by the seller, but was unable to access the original database.\n\nThe Shanghai government and police department did not respond to CNN’s repeated written requests for comment.\n\nThe seller also claimed the unsecured database had been hosted by Alibaba Cloud, a subsidiary of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. When reached by CNN for comment on Monday, Alibaba said “we are looking into this” and would communicate any updates. On Wednesday, Alibaba said it declined to comment.\n\nBut experts CNN spoke with said it was the owner of the data who was at fault, not the company hosting it.\n\n“As it stands today, I believe this would be the largest leak of public information yet – certainly in terms of the breadth of the impact in China, we’re talking about most of the population here,” said Troy Hunt, a Microsoft regional director based in Australia.\n\nChina is home to 1.4 billion people, which means the data breach could potentially affect more than 70% of the population.\n\n“It’s a little bit of a case where the genie is not going to be able to go back in the bottle. Once the data is out there in the form it appears to be now, there’s no going back,” said Hunt.\n\nIt is unclear how many people have accessed or downloaded the database during the 14 months or more it was left publicly available online. Two Western cybersecurity experts who spoke to CNN were both aware of the existence of the database before it was thrust into the public spotlight last week, suggesting it could be easily discovered by people who knew where to look.\n\nVinny Troia, a cybersecurity researcher and founder of dark web intelligence firm Shadowbyte, said he first discovered the database “around January” while searching for open databases online.\n\n“The site that I found it on is public, anybody (could) access it, all you have to do is register for an account,” Troia said. “Since it was opened in April 2021, any number of people could have downloaded the data,” he added.\n\nTroia said he downloaded one of the main indexes of the database, which appears to contain information on nearly 970 million Chinese citizens. But it was difficult to judge whether the open access was an oversight from the owners of the database, or if it was an intentional shortcut intended to be shared among a small number of people, he said.\n\n“Either they forgot about it, or they intentionally left it open because it’s easier for them to access,” he said, referring to the authorities responsible for the database. “I don’t know why they would. It sounds very careless.”\n\nUnsecured personal data – exposed through leaks, breaches, or some form of incompetence – is an increasingly common problem faced by companies and governments around the world, and cybersecurity experts say it is not unusual to find databases that are left open to public access.\n\nIn 2018, Trioa discovered that a Florida-based marketing firm exposed close to 2 TB of data that appeared to include personal information on hundreds of millions of American adults on a publicly accessible server, according to Wired.\n\nIn 2019, Victor Gevers, a Dutch cybersecurity researcher, found an online database containing names, national ID numbers, birth dates and location data of more than 2.5 million people in China’s far-western region of Xinjiang, which was left unprotected for months by Chinese firm SenseNets Technology, according to Reuters.\n\nBut the latest data leak is particularly worrying, cybersecurity researchers say, not only because of its potentially unprecedented volume, but also the sensitive nature of the information contained.\n\nA CNN analysis of the database sample found police records of cases spanning nearly two decades from 2001 to 2019. While the majority of the entries are civil disputes, there are also records of criminal cases ranging from fraud to rape.\n\nIn one case, a Shanghai resident was summoned by police in 2018 for using a virtual private network (VPN​) to ​evade China’s firewall and access Twitter​, allegedly retweeting “reactionary remarks involving the (Communist) Party, politics and leaders.”\n\nIn another record, a mother called the police in 2010, accusing her father-in-law of raping her 3-year-old daughter.\n\n“There could be domestic violence, child abuse, all sorts of things in there, that to me is a lot more worrying,” said Hunt, the Microsoft regional director.\n\n“Might this lead to extortion? We often see extortion of individuals after data leaks, examples where hackers can even try to ransom individuals.”\n\nThe Chinese government has recently stepped up efforts to improve protection of online user data privacy. Last year, the country passed its first Personal Information Protection Law, laying out ground rules on how personal data should be collected, used and stored. But experts have raised concerns that while the law can regulate technology companies, it could be challenging to enforce when applied to the Chinese state.\n\nBob Diachenko, a security researcher based in Ukraine, first came upon the database in April. In mid-June, his company detected that the database was attacked by an unknown malicious actor, who destroyed and copied the data and left a ransom note demanding 10 bitcoin for its recovery, Diachenko said.\n\nIt is not clear if this was the work of the same person who advertised the sale of the database information last week.\n\nBy July 1, the ransom note had disappeared, according to Diachenko, but only 7 gigabytes (GB) of data was available – instead of the 23 TB originally advertised.\n\nDiachenko said it suggested the ransom had been resolved, but the database owners had continued to use the exposed database for storing, until it was shut down over the weekend.\n\n“Maybe there was some junior developer who noticed it and tried to remove the notes before senior management noticed them,” he said.\n\nShanghai Police did not respond to CNN’s request for comments on the ransom note.\n\n\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments Wednesday.", "authors": ["Yong Xiong Hannah Ritchie Nectar Gan", "Yong Xiong", "Hannah Ritchie", "Nectar Gan"], "publish_date": "2022/07/05"}]}

Across the world, there has now been more than 6,000 cases recorded in 58 countries,” Tedros said.\n\n“Testing remains a challenge, and it’s highly probable that there are a significant number of cases not being picked up,” he added. “Europe is the current epicenter of the outbreak, recording more than 80% of cases globally.”\n\nMonkeypox, a viral disease, occurs mostly in central and western Africa, where the virus is endemic – but as part of the latest outbreak, the virus has spread to many regions of the world where it is not typically seen.\n\nCases are also being reported in African countries that previously were not affected by the virus, and in those places where the virus is endemic, record numbers are being recorded, Tedros said Wednesday. WHO teams are following the data closely, he said.\n\nWHO is working with countries and vaccine manufacturers to coordinate sharing of vaccines for monkeypox, which are scarce. The organization is also working with groups to break the stigma around the virus and spread information to help protect people.\n\n“I want to particularly commend those that are sharing videos online via social media channels, talking about their symptoms and experiences with monkeypox,” he said. “This is a positive way to break down the stigma about a virus that can affect anyone.”\n\nEarly data on the outbreak has suggested that gay and bisexual men and other men who have sex with men make up a high number of reported cases, leading to concern about stigmatizing the disease and the LGBTQ community.\n\nHowever, anyone who has been in close contact with someone who has the virus can be at risk.\n\nThe monkeypox virus can spread from person to person through direct contact with infectious body fluids or with the rash, scabs and sores that the disease can cause. Spread can also happen through indirect contact, such as through clothing or bedding contaminated with the virus.\n\nIt can also spread through respiratory secretions during prolonged face-to-face contact or during intimate physical contact, such as kissing, cuddling or sex.\n\nSymptoms of monkeypox can include fever, headache, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes, chills, exhaustion and a rash on the skin that can look like pimples or blisters.\n\nThe rash goes through different stages, developing into pustules before healing.\n\nAbout 41,500 courses of vaccine distributed in US\n\nAbout 41,500 courses of the monkeypox vaccine Jynneos have been distributed to states and other jurisdictions across the United States, according to data published Wednesday by the US Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nA course of Jynneos involves two doses four weeks apart.\n\nThe Biden administration announced last week that the strategy for distributing monkeypox vaccines would focus on areas with the highest case rates and overall risk.

Across the world, there has now been more than 6,000 cases recorded in 58 countries,” Tedros said.\n\n“Testing remains a challenge, and it’s highly probable that there are a significant number of cases not being picked up,” he added. “Europe is the current epicenter of the outbreak, recording more than 80% of cases globally.”\n\nMonkeypox, a viral disease, occurs mostly in central and western Africa, where the virus is endemic – but as part of the latest outbreak, the virus has spread to many regions of the world where it is not typically seen.\n\nCases are also being reported in African countries that previously were not affected by the virus, and in those places where the virus is endemic, record numbers are being recorded, Tedros said Wednesday. WHO teams are following the data closely, he said.\n\nWHO is working with countries and vaccine manufacturers to coordinate sharing of vaccines for monkeypox, which are scarce. The organization is also working with groups to break the stigma around the virus and spread information to help protect people.\n\n“I want to particularly commend those that are sharing videos online via social media channels, talking about their symptoms and experiences with monkeypox,” he said. “This is a positive way to break down the stigma about a virus that can affect anyone.”\n\nEarly data on the outbreak has suggested that gay and bisexual men and other men who have sex with men make up a high number of reported cases, leading to concern about stigmatizing the disease and the LGBTQ community.\n\nHowever, anyone who has been in close contact with someone who has the virus can be at risk.\n\nThe monkeypox virus can spread from person to person through direct contact with infectious body fluids or with the rash, scabs and sores that the disease can cause. Spread can also happen through indirect contact, such as through clothing or bedding contaminated with the virus.\n\nIt can also spread through respiratory secretions during prolonged face-to-face contact or during intimate physical contact, such as kissing, cuddling or sex.\n\nSymptoms of monkeypox can include fever, headache, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes, chills, exhaustion and a rash on the skin that can look like pimples or blisters.\n\nThe rash goes through different stages, developing into pustules before healing.\n\nAbout 41,500 courses of vaccine distributed in US\n\nAbout 41,500 courses of the monkeypox vaccine Jynneos have been distributed to states and other jurisdictions across the United States, according to data published Wednesday by the US Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nA course of Jynneos involves two doses four weeks apart.\n\nThe Biden administration announced last week that the strategy for distributing monkeypox vaccines would focus on areas with the highest case rates and overall risk. The District of Columbia has the most reported cases per capita, by far, and has received the most vaccine doses per capita, the new HHS data shows.\n\nVaccine distribution has also been heavily concentrated in California, Illinois and New York, particularly the three largest US cities: New York, Los Angeles and Chicago.\n\nMassachusetts, Hawaii and Colorado also received a large share of the vaccine distribution to date.\n\nEleven states have not received any monkeypox vaccine, according to the data; none of them has reported any cases to the CDC.\n\nUS monkeypox testing ramps up\n\nEfforts are also underway to ramp up testing for the virus in the US.\n\nThe commercial laboratory company Labcorp will begin monkeypox testing Wednesday at its largest facility in the United States, doubling the nation’s capacity to test for the virus, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe CDC announced Wednesday that Labcorp will be able to accept specimens for testing from anywhere in the United States, and the company expects to perform up to 10,000 tests per week.\n\nThe outbreak has led to 605 probable or confirmed cases in the US as of Wednesday evening.

Fitzpatrick.\n\n“The sentence is 12 years in prison, to be followed by 8 years of court-supervised release,” Fitzpatrick said to CNN in an email.\n\nHarris, a former star of the Netflix reality docuseries “Cheer,” pleaded guilty in February to one count each of receiving child pornography and engaging in sexual acts with a minor.\n\nIn a statement released on Thursday, Todd Pugh, Harris’ attorney, said Harris “is exceedingly grateful” for the judge’s “recognition of his humanity, worthiness, and rehabilitative potential.”\n\n“While Jerry has a difficult road ahead of him, his uncompromising spirit and strength has carried him through challenging times before. He has nothing but empathy and remorse for the people he has harmed and hopes that today’s proceeding provided them some peace,” Pugh said.\n\nPugh also provided to CNN the statement Harris made to the court, in which Harris apologized for the “trauma” his abuse caused.\n\n“I pray that your suffering comes to an end and that these proceeding provide you with needed closure. I am ashamed as I know that I took advantage of your youth and weakness. I was wrong and selfish. I caused you harm and I do not blame anyone,” Harris said in his statement.\n\nIn December 2020, Harris was charged with a seven-count indictment that was filed in U.S. District Court in northern Illinois.\n\n\"Cheer\" Star Jerry Harris is seen in a sketch during his sentencing hearing on July 6, 2022. Lou Chukman\n\nIn a plea agreement with the government, Harris pleaded guilty to two of the charges from that indictment, stating that he received child pornography and engaged in interstate travel to meet a 15-year-old boy with whom he engaged in sexual relations.\n\n“Cheer” follows the cheer team from Navarro College in Corsicana, Texas. Harris is one of several students whose stories were spotlighted in the series, which debuted on the streaming service in January 2020.\n\nThe second season of “Cheer,” released last year, addressed the allegations made against Harris and featured an interview with two of his accusers.", "authors": ["Sonia Moghe Raja Razek", "Sonia Moghe", "Raja Razek"], "publish_date": "2022/07/06"}]}
