Blue for $8/month.”\n\nCNN previously reported Twitter was working to update its existing subscription product, which currently costs $4.99 a month, to include the verification feature, According to internal Twitter planning documents viewed by CNN, Twitter could also take away the blue check marks of currently verified users if they don’t start paying the higher $19.99 price for the subscription product within 90 days.\n\nThe news quickly prompted outrage and disbelief among some longtime Twitter users, including author Stephen King, who has nearly seven million followers on the platform.\n\n“$20 a month to keep my blue check?” he tweeted on Monday, followed by an expletive. “They should pay me. If that gets instituted, I’m gone like Enron.” Following up later in a reply, King wrote, “[i]t ain’t the money, it’s the principle of the thing.”\n\nMusk replied to King early Tuesday morning with his most explicit acknowledgment yet of the proposal to charge for account verification. “[W]e need to pay the bills somehow! Twitter cannot rely entirely on advertisers,” he said. “How about $8?”\n\nOn Tuesday, Musk reiterated the $8 price point and shared more details for his new plan. He said subscribers would get priority in replies, mentions and search, as well as the ability to post longer video and audio content while getting half as many ads as free users. Publishers that work with the platform will also get to bypass the paywall, according to Musk.\n\n“This will also give Twitter a revenue stream to reward content creators,” he added.\n\nThe remarks highlight both how tenuous some of Musk’s initial plans for Twitter may be and also the urgency he faces to boost the revenue and profit for a company that lost money for most of its history. Musk acquired Twitter for $44 billion, an amount that he admitted is “obviously overpaying” for the company. He also lined up a substantial amount of debt financing to pay for the deal.\n\nSince completing the acquisition of the social media platform on last week, the billionaire has moved quickly to shake up Twitter, including disbanding the board and firing its top execs. In tweets over the weekend, Musk polled his followers about whether to bring back Vine, Twitter’s defunct short-form video service, and said “absolutely” in response to a user’s suggestion to rethink the platform’s character limits. It’s unclear how committed Musk is to pursuing any or all of these changes.\n\nOn Sunday, Musk tweeted: “The whole verification process is being revamped right now.”\n\nEven before the deal was completed, Musk suggested the possibility of tying verification to a paid subscription service. In April, Musk said Twitter’s paid subscribers “should get an authentication checkmark.” In another tweet, he said: “Price should probably be ~$2/month, but paid 12 months up front & account doesn’t get checkmark for 60 days (watch for CC chargebacks) & suspended with no refund if used for scam/spam.”\n\nWhile the blue check mark has emerged as a status symbol for users, it’s also designed to ensure people can determine which accounts are authentic and which are not, particularly for celebrities, brands and other influential accounts. If Musk were to create a paid barrier for verification, there are concerns it could make it harder to distinguish whether a notable name is a bot or not.", "authors": ["Jennifer Korn"], "publish_date": "2022/11/01"}]}

Seth Wenig/AP\n\nThree men were convicted in 1966 for the murder of Malcolm X – Mujahid Abdul Halim (known previously as both Talmadge Hayer and Thomas Hagan), Aziz and Islam, and were sentenced to life in prison. Aziz and Islam said they were innocent. Halim acknowledged he took part in the assassination, but he maintained the innocence of the other two men.\n\nAziz was released from prison in 1985; Islam was released in 1987 but died in 2009 and received a posthumous exoneration.\n\n“What’s most important is that Muhammad Aziz and Khalil Islam have reclaimed their good names,” David Shanies, an attorney representing both Aziz and the state of Islam, said in a statement to CNN.\n\nKhalil Islam, center, is booked as the third suspect in the slaying of Malcolm X, in New York on March 3, 1965.

It was imperative that these civil lawsuits be resolved immediately and fairly, and I am gratified that New York City and its lawyers worked with us toward a just resolution,” his statement said.\n\nVance’s review of the case came after the 2020 Netflix documentary, “Who Killed Malcolm X?” raised a slew of new questions.\n\nAziz filed a $40 million civil rights lawsuit in Brooklyn federal court in July, arguing his “wrongful conviction was the product of flagrant official misconduct, including, inter alia, by the NYPD and its intelligence unit, the Bureau of Special Services and Investigations.”\n\nPaperwork for the $26 million settlement is still being finalized, but it will be split evenly between Aziz and the estate of Islam, said Nick Paolucci, press secretary for the New York City Law Department. Court records state the parties in both cases have “accepted the courts settlement recommendation in their respective cases.”\n\nA New York City Law Department spokesman told CNN in a statement: “This settlement brings some measure of justice to individuals who spent decades in prison and bore the stigma of being falsely accused of murdering an iconic figure. Based on our review, this office stands by the opinion of former Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. who stated, based on his investigation, that ‘there is one ultimate conclusion: Mr. Aziz and Mr. Islam were wrongfully convicted of this crime.’”", "authors": ["Gloria Pazmino Nicole Grether Emma Tucker", "Gloria Pazmino", "Nicole Grether", "Emma Tucker"], "publish_date": "2022/10/30"}]}

It’s an ode to the afterlife and a reminder that death is nothing to be afraid of.\n\nIf you enjoyed Disney’s animated film “Coco,” here are the many ways people celebrate the Día de los Muertos holiday.\n\nArtisans make colorful sugar skulls\n\nSkulls made and decorated with sugar decorate altars and are given as gifts for Día de los Muertos. Omar Torres/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSkulls were a powerful symbol in the Aztec culture, and some were used as tribute to Mictecacihuatl, the goddess of death. To celebrate the holiday, artisans spend hours turning sugar, hot water and lime into a sugar paste similar to caramel that they mold into skull-shaped treats of all sizes.\n\nThese treats are then decorated with icing, multi-colored foil and sometimes feathers. Calaveritas are for the most part edible, but people mainly use them to decorate their altars.\n\nPeople carefully build altars for the dead\n\nThe holiday is a time to celebrate the lives of friends, family members and even celebrities who have died. This altar pays tribute to Mexican singer Juan Gabriel who died in 2016. Marl Ralston/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe colorful multi-level memorials are built in homes, schools and public places as a tribute to deceased loved ones. The different levels represent the underworld, Earth and heaven.\n\nA large photo of the deceased is usually placed at the very top of the altar with papel picado. Sugar skulls, candles, pan de muerto (dead man’s bread) and Mexican marigolds are featured throughout the altar.\n\nThe pungent scent and bright color of fresh marigold petals are meant to guide the spirits to their altars, and glasses of water are handy to quench the thirst of the dead after their long journey.\n\nThe ofrendas (offerings), as the altars are called, are carefully assembled using many traditional elements, but each of them is unique on its own. They can be personalized with the dead person’s favorite food, mementos from their lives and their favorite items. Some altars have books, jewelry, music and clothes on display.\n\nCrowds descend on cemeteries\n\nSome people camp out at the tombs of their deceased loved ones. Yuri Cortez/AFP/Getty Images\n\nPeople flock to cemeteries through the holiday to visit the graves of dead relatives and friends. But they are not mourning or empty-handed.\n\nAfter cleaning the graves and headstones, some decorate with flowers, marigold petals and light up candles. While some come to pray in silence, others serenade their lost loved ones with mariachis.\n\nPeople make their way to the gravesites every year to keep the memory of the deceased alive in their hearts and in the minds of their family members. They share stories, drink and eat together as if it were a party.\n\nSkeletons walk among the living\n\nThe Day of the Dead parades and costumes are meant to celebrate life rather than be spooky. Alejandro Medina/AFP/Getty Images\n\nPeople parade the streets with beautiful skulls painted on their faces and wearing costumes to commemorate Día de los Muertos.\n\nWomen usually paint their faces, wear elegant dresses and hats adorned with feathers and flowers. They are actually evoking “La Catrina,” a rich skeleton lady in a fancy floral hat. The image, sketched by Mexican artist José Guadalupe Posada in 1910, was political satire that mocked Mexico’s upper-class and their negative attitude toward indigenous people.\n\nCrowds dance in cheerful parades held during the day in numerous cities, or parade together on their way to cemeteries the night of Halloween.", "authors": ["Nicole Chavez"], "publish_date": "2021/11/02"}]}

Pfizer’s vaccine candidate is administered to pregnant women who then make antibodies that cross the placenta and protect the baby after birth.\n\n“The [study data monitoring committee] recommended, based on the data that we have, that we should go ahead and file, that this offers the potential for a safe and effective vaccine that could really dramatically help to prevent RSV during the winter season,” Dr. William Gruber, Pfizer’s senior vice president of vaccine clinical research and development, told CNN.\n\nIn the trial, the vaccine was given to pregnant people and appeared to be about 80% effective at preventing severe RSV disease in their infants in the first three months of life. It also cut a baby’s risk of needing to see a doctor for an RSV infection by half.\n\nPotential for first new product in decades\n\nIf approved, Pfizer’s inoculation will be the first against RSV and the first new product related to the infection in over two decades.\n\nIn March, the FDA designated Pfizer’s RSV vaccine a breakthrough therapy, a status that speeds its review.\n\n“That puts us in a very good position to essentially have something well in advance of next winter,” Gruber said, noting that both Pfizer and the FDA are conscious of the ongoing heavy RSV season in the US.\n\n“It will be up to them whether or not they can think of any other path that could allow this to come sooner,” he said.\n\nPfizer’s vaccine contains the virus’ F-protein, the site that it uses to attach to human cells. The protein is frozen into the shape it folds into before it fuses with a cell, so the immune system can build antibodies against it. Pfizer’s RSV vaccine is bivalent, containing F-proteins from both the A and B subgroups of the RSV virus, which are the two most commonly circulating strains.\n\nIn a study of 7,400 pregnant people and infants, the vaccine was 82% effective at preventing severe lower respiratory tract infections in hospitalized babies for the first three months of life. It was about 70% effective at preventing severe RSV in hospitalized infants for six months.\n\nBabies were considered to have severe RSV if they were breathing very rapidly, over 70 breaths per minute in a 2-month-old; if their blood oxygen levels fell below 93%; if they required high-flow oxygen, or if they were admitted to the ICU; or if they lost consciousness.\n\nThe vaccine cut the need for infants to need to see a doctor because of RSV by an average of more than 50% compared with a placebo. That result did not fall within a statistical range that was specified by the FDA before the outset of the trial, however, so the company acknowledges that the vaccine missed that particular goalpost.\n\nGruber points out, however, that a 50% reduction in doctor visits due to RSV is still likely to be a noticeable and important benefit in the real world.\n\n“This is clearly sufficient and frankly, great news, for filing for our approval,” he said.\n\nPfizer also recently announced positive results in an ongoing trial of the same vaccine in older adults.\n\nLonger-term research\n\nThe drugmaker’s FDA filing would make it the first in a crowded field of companies developing vaccines against RSV. GSK had been testing a maternal vaccine but paused its study after learning of a safety problem.\n\nGSK said Monday that the trial remains stopped, though it did not share any details on the safety issue.\n\n“Further analysis to better understand safety data from these trials is ongoing,” spokesperson Alison Hunt said in a statement to CNN. “The relevant regulatory authorities and trial investigators have been informed. We’re committed to transparently sharing more data as we have it.”\n\nNo safety issues have been identified with Pfizer’s vaccine, Gruber said, and a panel of independent reviewers that looks over the study findings while the trial is progressing found no problems.\n\n“The vaccine is very tolerable, and no safety signals were identified,” he said, though the full results of the trial have not been published.\n\nAlthough Pfizer will suspend enrollment in the maternal vaccination trial, Gruber says it will continue to follow the infants who are enrolled.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“We know that children that have RSV end up having compromised lung status, and they become more susceptible, in many instances, to other respiratory infections that puts them back in the hospital. So we’re very interested in determining does this not only have a specific effect as the vaccine was intended to have against protection against RSV, but it may have a side benefit of allowing these children to fare better over the longer term,” he said.", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/11/01"}]}

Furthermore, Valisure shows data from the analysis of benzene by directly sampling contaminated air after spraying dry shampoo products, which suggests potential for short- and long-term inhalation exposure to high levels of benzene. The presence of this known human carcinogen in dry shampoo products that are regularly used indoors and in large volumes makes this finding especially troubling,” David Light, Valisure’s chief executive officer, and Qian Wu, Valisure’s head of global analytics, wrote in the FDA Citizen Petition.\n\nThe petition urges the FDA to “expeditiously request recalls” on the affected batches of products containing benzene and better define limits for benzene contamination in other products.\n\nThe FDA normally takes 180 days to respond to a citizen petition.\n\nIn summary, three lots of dry shampoo products from one brand contained spray with more than 100 ppm of benzene, according to the petition, and some samples tested by Valisure showed more than 10 times the FDA drug limit. The petition also mentions that Valisure has detected benzene in other commonly used products as well, including certain hand sanitizers and sunscreens.\n\nCNN contacted the brands listed in the petition and reached out to the FDA for comment but did not immediately hear back from all of them.\n\nIn a statement, Church & Dwight, the maker of Batiste hair products said: “Consumer safety is of the utmost importance. When propellants had been reported to be the source of benzene in competitors’ recalled products, we contacted our propellant suppliers and confirmed with those suppliers that the propellants used in our Batiste products do not contain benzene. We will evaluate the report at the center of the recent claims.”\n\nHaircare brand Not Your Mother’s, listed in the petition, told CNN in a statement, “The safety of our consumers is our highest priority. We are concerned about a recently published report linked to the dry shampoo category, raising questions about levels of benzene detected in propellent used in aerosol products manufactured on or before Fall 2021. This report is inconsistent with the data provided by our suppliers and the rigorous ongoing testing to ensure the safety and integrity of our products. These tests show no traceable amounts of benzene. We are committed to continuous evaluation to ensure the utmost safety and quality of all our products.”\n\nValisure’s Light said in a new release, “The detection of high levels of benzene in dry shampoos should be cause for significant concern since these products are likely used indoors, where benzene may linger and be inhaled for prolonged periods of time.\n\n“These and other issues identified by Valisure, including the detection of benzene in body spray, hand sanitizer, and sunscreen products, strongly underscore the importance of independent testing and its need to be better integrated into an increasingly complex and vulnerable global supply chain.”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nLast year, several deodorants and sunscreen products were recalled due to detections of benzene.\n\nBenzene is formed from both natural and man-made processes. “Natural sources of benzene include volcanoes and forest fires.

This was not a random residential burglary. This is something that was specifically targeted,” San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins said Tuesday.\n\nHere’s what we presently know about the attack.\n\n‘Suicide mission’\n\nDePape, 42, told officers and medics at the scene that he was sick of the “level of lies” coming from Washington, DC, and “came here to have a little chat with [Pelosi’s] wife,” according to a Tuesday court filing.\n\n“I didn’t really want to hurt him, but you know this was a suicide mission. I’m not going to stand here and do nothing even if it cost me my life,” DePape allegedly said.\n\nDePape named several targets, according to the filing, including prominent state and federal politicians and their relatives.\n\nJenkins confirmed to CNN earlier Tuesday that authorities believe DePape had other “targets” besides the House speaker.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'Like something from a Stephen King novel': Analyst describes Pelosi attack 03:06 - Source: CNN\n\nAsked by CNN’s Erin Burnett about the suspect’s alleged plans, Jenkins said that “there were other public officials that were apparently targets of his, and obviously he showed up at the speaker’s house first.” The case, Jenkins said, is still “very fresh” and she declined to give specific details of who had been a potential target.\n\nDePape has been “cooperative” with police and “submitted to a lengthy interview” before obtaining representation through counsel, according to the district attorney.\n\nChilling new details\n\nCourt documents released on Tuesday revealed chilling new details about the encounter. DePape allegedly awoke a startled Paul Pelosi shortly after 2 am at his bedside, carrying a large hammer and several white zip ties, as CNN has previously reported.\n\n“Are you Paul Pelosi?” DePape asked, according to the documents. He then demanded to know, “Where’s Nancy? Where’s Nancy?,” to which a groggy Paul Pelosi replied, “She’s not here.”\n\nHe then threatened to tie up Paul Pelosi and prevented him from escaping via elevator, according to the documents. Paul Pelosi asked DePape why he wanted to see his wife.\n\n“Well, she’s number two from the presidency, right?,” DePape said.\n\nAfter Paul Pelosi confirmed that she was, DePape said, “we’ve got to take them all out,” referring to politicians, according to the court documents.\n\nAt one point, DePape allowed Pelosi to use the bathroom, and it was during this time that he was able to use his cell phone to call 911, according to the court documents. Pelosi spoke cryptically to police during the brief call and was able to subtly identify himself to the dispatcher, who was then able to escalate the call.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Hear details from Paul Pelosi's coded 911 call that led to his rescue 01:58 - Source: CNN\n\nFollowing the call, the two men went downstairs, with DePape walking behind Pelosi and carrying with him the hammer and zip ties, according to the documents. Downstairs, DePape, noting that police would be arriving soon, told Pelosi: “I can take you out.” He then walked over to Pelosi while holding the hammer upright, causing Pelosi to reach out and put his hand on it.\n\nThe officers arrived at the scene at this point, and after Pelosi opened the door and greeted them, one of them turned on their flashlight and saw the two men holding opposite ends of the hammer, according to the court documents. An officer ordered them to drop hammer, but DePape pulled it away from Pelosi, “immediately stepped back and lunged at Mr. Pelosi, striking Mr. Pelosi in the head at full force with the hammer, which knocked Mr. Pelosi unconscious.”\n\n“The officers rushed into the house, tackled (DePape), and disarmed him. Mr. Pelosi remained unresponsive for about three minutes, waking up in a pool of his own blood,” the documents said.\n\nHow US Capitol Police learned of break-in\n\nUS Capitol Police first learned of the break-in at the San Francisco home about 10 minutes after the incident when an officer noticed police lights and sirens on a live camera feed in the Capitol Police’s Washington, DC, command center, according to a source briefed on the attack.\n\nCNN previously reported there may be video of the break-in that US Capitol Police and law enforcement could review as there are security cameras at the home, according to two law enforcement sources.\n\nThe San Francisco Police Department had stopped regularly posting a patrol car outside Pelosi’s house last year, according to two additional sources.\n\nDePape in court\n\nDePape entered a not guilty plea Tuesday to all state charges during his initial appearance in court.\n\nHe also waived his right to a hearing within 10 days at his arraignment in a San Francisco court room. Judge Diane Northway set a hearing for November 4 in San Francisco Superior Court to set a date for the preliminary hearing and bail setting.\n\nDePape has been charged with a litany of crimes, including assault, attempted murder and attempted kidnapping, following last week’s break-in.\n\nThe attempted kidnapping charge carries a maximum of 20 years in prison. He has not yet entered a plea in federal court.\n\nDePape’s attorney, Adam Lipson, said outside the courtroom, “There’s been a lot of speculation, a lot of rumor, simply based on the nature of this case. So I’m not going to add to all the speculation by talking about the facts of this case right now.”\n\n“What I will say is that there’s been a lot of speculation regarding Mr. DePape’s vulnerability to misinformation and that’s certainly something we are going to look into, that we are going to delve into, as his defense team, but again it would be premature to talk about that at this time,” Lipson said.\n\nSecurity concerns mount\n\nUS Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger said Tuesday the agency has “engaged in a review” of the incident and said the current political climate calls for more resources for the physical safety of members of Congress.\n\n“We believe today’s political climate calls for more resources to provide additional layers of physical security for Members of Congress,” Manger said in a written statement.\n\n“This plan would include an emphasis on adding redundancies to the measures that are already in place for Congressional leadership. Hopefully you can understand that we cannot disclose the details about these improvements because our country cannot afford to make it easier for any potential bad actors,” he added.\n\nManger also said the Capitol Police has “worked diligently to investigate reported threats, improve intelligence collection and analysis, and strengthen our partnerships with law enforcement agencies across the country to provide security for Members when they are traveling outside Washington, DC.”\n\nCalifornia Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren told CNN’s Brianna Keilar on Tuesday that lawmakers won’t be any safer “until we call out what is the root cause of this political violence.”\n\n“The head of the RNC, Ronna McDaniel and also Kevin McCarthy, the minority leader, expressed sadness for Paul Pelosi. But then went onto say ‘it’s really a product of crime – that’s the Democrats fault.’”\n\n“That’s like saying Lee Harvey Oswald was connected with crime in Dallas or John Wilkes Booth was the result of a crime problem at Ford’s Theater. Not only is it ridiculous, it is part of the problem of dismissing what is causing this violence,” Lofgren said.\n\nTrump fans conspiracy theory\n\nJust one day after releasing a tepid but grounded statement on the incident, former President Donald Trump fanned the flames of an unfounded conspiracy about the attack.\n\n“It’s weird things going on in that household in the last couple of weeks,” Trump said. “You know, probably, you and I are better off not talking about it. The glass, it seems, was broken from the inside to the out and, you know, so, it wasn’t a break in, it was a break out,” the former President told conservative radio host Chris Stigall.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'Disturbing' conspiracy theory takes root following Pelosi attack 03:37 - Source: CNN\n\nTrump went on to say that he’s “not a fan of Nancy Pelosi,” but that what happened was “very sad.” He added: “The whole thing is crazy. I mean, if there’s even a little bit of truth to what’s being said, it’s crazy. But the window was broken in and it was strange the cops were standing there practically from the moment it all took place.”\n\nIn the days following the attack, several prominent right-wing figures have floated conspiracy theories about the attack – including that Paul Pelosi and the intruder were gay lovers who had gotten into a fight.\n\nThe spurious theory traces back to an incorrect early news report and a handful of pieces of evidence that its proponents have spun wildly out of context. It runs entirely contrary to the explanation police and federal law enforcement have outlined.\n\n“There is absolutely no evidence that Mr. Pelosi knew this man,” San Francisco Police Chief William Scott told CNN in an interview. “As a matter of fact, the evidence indicates the exact opposite.”\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Arizona Republican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake – whose embrace of Trump’s brand of politics has been a central part of her campaign – claimed she was not making light of the assault earlier in the week despite clearly joking about a lack of security at the Pelosis’ home.\n\nIn contrast, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican who drew criticism last week after referencing the attack as part of a political swipe at Nancy Pelosi, expressed regret over his remark.\n\n“At the end of the day, I really wanted to express the fact that what happened to Speaker Pelosi’s husband was atrocious. And I didn’t do a great job,” he told Punchbowl News.", "authors": ["Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/02"}]}
