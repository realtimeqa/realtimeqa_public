Biden\n\nPresident Joe Biden delivered his sharpest rebuke yet of Republicans during a speech in Philadelphia on Thursday, warning that former President Donald Trump and his closest followers are trying to undermine American democracy. “As I stand here tonight, equality and democracy are under assault,” Biden said in his address – just months ahead of midterm elections that will determine control of Congress. Biden attempted to separate Trump’s most loyal MAGA followers from the Republican Party as a whole and also sought to conclude on a more upbeat note, urging it is still within voters’ power to rein in Trump’s staunchest supporters. This comes as Biden’s recent aggressive rhetoric has drawn the ire of Republicans, particularly after he accused Trump loyalists of “semi-fascism” at a fundraiser last week.\n\n2. Hurricanes\n\nFor the first time in 25 years, the month of August did not have a named storm. But now that September has arrived, things appear to have changed quickly in the tropical Atlantic. On Thursday, the National Hurricane Center announced that Tropical Storm Danielle, currently in the North Atlantic, is expected to strengthen into a hurricane by Saturday. Danielle is not a threat to any land at this time, forecasts show, and it is expected to remain fairly stationary through the weekend. Still, current indications show the early stages of the Atlantic hurricane season have been above average and could begin to pick up.\n\n3. January 6\n\nFormer President Trump said he will “very, very seriously” consider full pardons for the rioters who breached the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, if he runs for reelection and wins. “If I decide to run and if I win, I will be looking very, very strongly about pardons. Full pardons,” Trump said on Wendy Bell Radio Thursday. Trump had made a similar promise during his final days in office when some of the January 6 rioters were already in jail. None, however, were pardoned before he left office. Trump’s comments come amid intense speculation about a potential 2024 presidential run, and his continued invocation of the Capitol attack could preview a central part of his future political messaging.\n\n4. Abortion\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is mobilizing his MAGA allies to defend him ahead of the upcoming public hearings by the House select committee investigating the January 6 insurrection. Trump’s team has asked some prominent Republicans to cover for him and push back on the committee while the public hearings play out, according to GOP sources familiar with the request. Committee members have teased that the prime-time hearings could be focused on Trump’s direct role in undermining the election results. The committee has been working toward a thesis that Trump’s obsession with losing the election and his peddling of false claims about the results is what laid the groundwork for the violent and deadly riot at the Capitol. The first public hearing will take place Thursday at 8 p.m. ET.\n\n5. Ukraine\n\nThe baby formula manufacturing plant that has been at the center of the nationwide shortage restarted production Saturday. Abbott, located in Sturgis, Michigan, said in a statement it has started with the production of specialty formulas for babies who can’t tolerate more common ones, with the first batches expected to be available to consumers around June 20. Similac and other products made at the plant will take longer to become available, the company said. The Sturgis plant has been shut down for months following an FDA inspection that found dangerous bacteria – which can be deadly to infants – in several areas at the facility.\n\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\n\nThese cute robots could deliver your next coffee\n\nResearchers say giving alcohol to plants may protect them from dying in a drought.

Tate Reeves. The National Guard was called up to help distribute bottled water as crews work to get the water treatment plant back online, state officials said.\n\nBut the distribution itself proved unsustainable. Residents of all ages were seen waiting in lines more than a mile long at Hawkins Field Airport for at least two hours Tuesday for just one case of bottled water. The event was supposed to span three hours, but barely ran two as people were eventually turned away when the 700 cases of water ran out.\n\n\"I keep saying we're going to be the next Michigan,\" said Jeraldine Watts, 86, who was able to get water at a grocery store Monday night. \"And it looks like that's exactly what we're headed for.\"\n\nWatts was referring to the water crisis in the city of Flint, which has battled water issues since a 2014 water crisis in which lead-contaminated water fed to residents' faucets.\n\nPeople line up for water in Jackson, Mississippi, on August 30, 2022.\n\nJackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba told CNN's Pamela Brown the city is working on more water distribution events. The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency will provide nearly 30 water trucks to help supplement the city events, the mayor said.\n\n\"I have been assured by MEMA that they will supplement those locations with about 28 tanker trucks distributed at various points across the city,\" Lumumba told CNN.\n\nExplanations for Jackson's failing system are complicated: Damage this summer to pumps at the main water treatment facility made failure increasingly likely as the summer progressed, the governor said; and flooding of the Pearl River after heavy rains last week affected treatment processes and therefore the amount of running water the system can provide, Lumumba said.\n\nThis week's troubles come as the water system has been plagued with problems for years and with the city already under a boil water notice since late July for what the state called a water-quality issue.\n\nThe state is \"surging our resources to the city's water treatment facility and beginning emergency maintenance, repairs and improvements,\" Gov. Reeves said. \"We will do everything in our power to restore water pressure and get water flowing back to the people of Jackson.\"\n\nWater for those in the state's most populous city would have to be provided \"for an unknown period of time,\" Reeves said.\n\nThe water shortage is expected to last \"the next couple of days,\" according to the mayor's office.\n\nLumumba also announced Monday the city's public works director -- a role that oversees the water treatment facilities -- has been reassigned. Marlin King will instead serve as deputy director and Jordan Hillman, the city's planning and development director, will be the interim public works director, according to Melissa Payne, the mayor's spokesperson.\n\nKing did not respond to CNN requests for comment. Payne said King's reassignment \"is part of restructuring\" and is not a result of the current water crisis.\n\nResidents say faucet water is discolored\n\nState Rep. Ronnie Crudup Jr. said he didn't have running water Monday, but on Tuesday, discolored water came out of his faucet that he used to flush the toilet. He and his family used bottled water Tuesday morning to brush their teeth, Crudup told CNN's Alisyn Camerota.\n\nCrudup said that although the city has experienced water issues in the past, rain played a part in the current water emergency.\n\n\"It's been building up for years, but we have had an unprecedented amount of rain in the last two to three weeks, and it just kind of created this havoc, what we are dealing with right now,\" he said.\n\nJackson resident Daryl Page told CNN he's been searching for clean, bottled water since the city's been under a boil water notice \"for a whole month.\" He was driving to a distribution site, but as he arrived, he noticed there was nothing there.\n\nFirefighters and recruits for the Jackson Fire Department carry cases of bottled water to residents vehicles, August 18, 2022, as part of the city's response to longstanding water system problems.\n\n\"Everyone is turning around because there is nothing here,\" Page said, adding that his next plan of action was to drive to another site in hopes that he could find cases of water there.\n\nBecause of Monday's failure, officials announced all Jackson public schools will shift to virtual learning Tuesday.\n\nHospitals are also feeling the strain. Jackson's University of Mississippi Medical Center released a statement Tuesday saying the Jackson Medical Mall air conditioning is not functioning properly \"because the water pressure feeding its chillers is too low.\" Portable restrooms are being used in locations experiencing low water pressure, the statement said.\n\nThe university medical center statement also said a fire watch was declared for its Jackson-based facilities, \"because fire suppression systems are fed by the city water system. Low pressure in the systems may cause them to be less effective.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden has been briefed on the water crisis in Jackson and the White House has been \"in regular contact with state and local officials, including Mayor Lumumba, and made clear that the Federal Government stands ready to offer assistance,\" press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\"(The Federal Emergency Management Agency) is working closely with the state officials to identify needs, and the EPA is coordinating with industry partners to expedite delivery of critical treatment equipment for emergency repairs at the City of Jackson water treatment facilities,\" she said.\n\nIn an emailed statement Tuesday, the Environmental Protection Agency said \"ensuring all people have access to healthy and safe water is a top priority.\"\n\n\"We are in communication with officials in Mississippi and stand ready to provide support should the State request federal assistance,\" the EPA statement read. \"In the interim, we are available to provide technical support and information to Mississippi officials as they navigate their plan to address the immediate concerns at the O.B. Curtis Water Plant.\"\n\nLater Tuesday, the governor said FEMA has received the state's declaration asking the federal government to declare the water shortage a federal emergency.\n\nWater system issues go back decades, mayor says\n\nThe problem this week stems from one of two water treatment facilities in the city: the O.B. Curtis plant, which is run by the city of Jackson, according to the governor.\n\nThe main pumps at O.B. Curtis were severely damaged recently, and the facility began operating on smaller backup pumps about a month ago, around the time the latest boil water notice began in July, the governor said, without elaborating about the damage.\n\nThe governor said he was told Friday that \"it was a near-certainty that Jackson would fail to produce running water sometime in the next several weeks or months if something did not materially improve,\" the governor said.\n\nThe O.B. Curtis Water Treatment Plant in Jackson, Mississippi, seen on March 24, 2022.\n\nBut Lumumba said during a Monday news conference that it was only a matter time before the water system failed because Jackson's water system has been faced serious issues for years\n\n\"I have said on multiple occasions that it's not a matter of 'if' our system would fail, but a matter of 'when' our system would fail,\" the mayor said, adding that the city has been \"going at it alone for the better part of two years\" when it comes to the water crisis.\n\nIn early 2020, the water system failed an Environmental Protection Agency inspection . The agency wrote the drinking water had the potential to be host to harmful bacteria or parasites, based on observations of the water's turbidity, or cloudiness, as well as \"disinfection treatment concerns, and/or the condition of the distribution system.\"\n\nthe city to develop a plan to replace and repair monitoring and treatment equipment, to \"address dosing processes for disinfection and pH control\" and to take more coliform bacteria samples, among other things. In March 2020, the EPA issued an order requiringthe city to develop a plan to replace and repair monitoring and treatment equipment, to \"address dosing processes for disinfection and pH control\" and to take more coliform bacteria samples, among other things.\n\nThe city also has endured weather-related shutdowns.\n\nIn February 2021, a winter storm shut down Jackson's entire water system, leaving tens of thousands of residents without water for a month amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Residents have been under some sort of boil water notice or advisory several times since that storm, including the state-ordered notice posted in July\n\n\"We were here two Februarys ago when we had system failures, and the world was watching us and the world is watching us again,\" Lumumba said during Monday's news conference.\n\nThe mayor also pointed to recent flooding from the Pearl River as an event that triggered the latest water pressure issues.\n\nBecause O.B. Curtis received additional water from the reservoir during the flooding from last week to this week, the facility had to change the way it treats the water, which has led to the reduction of water being put out into the system and reduced tank levels. This is affecting the water pressure at residents' homes, he said.\n\n\"As one crisis may be diverted, another one rears its head,\" Lumumba said Monday during a news conference after addressing the flooding in the city.\n\nO.B. Curtis is meant to provide about 50 million gallons for the city daily. The other plant, which usually provides about 20 million gallons daily, has been approved to ramp up its output amid the shortage, authorities said.\n\nIn July 2021, the EPA and the city entered into an agreement to address \"long-term challenges and make needed improvements to the drinking water system.\" The EPA recently announced $74.9 million in federal water and sewer infrastructure funds for Mississippi, mentioning Jackson without naming specific projects.\n\nLumumba declared a water system emergency Monday. The proclamation noted not only the flooding but also numerous previous \"unsuccessful attempts to rectify water system issues.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED CNN meteorologist explains cause of water crisis in Jackson, Mississippi Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH CNN meteorologist explains cause of water crisis in Jackson, Mississippi 02:27\n\nAs for restoring water pressure and flow and performing emergency maintenance and repairs, the state would split the cost with the city, Reeves said Tuesday.\n\n\"We will cash flow the operation, and the city will be responsible for half the cost of the emergency improvements that we make,\" the governor said in a statement released on Twitter.\n\nAt a Tuesday news conference at the plant, Reeves said he is \"encouraged\" and at the same time \"discouraged\" by some of the news coming out of the facility.\n\n\"We do have a plan in place to potentially bring in an additional rented pump that will allow us to put at least 4 million gallons of water additionally, hopefully, which will be installed by tomorrow morning. That is progress and will help,\" he said.\n\nReeves added there is no time frame as of now for safe drinking water, but that over the next 24 to 36 hours residents will see significant truckloads of clean water start to be delivered to Jackson.\n\nOver the next few days, more than 108 semi-trucks of water are coming into Jackson and seven mega distribution sites will have 36 truckloads of water a day for the public to be able to retrieve, according to Lt. Col. Stephen McCraney, the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency director.\n\nSystemic issues also contributed to water crisis\n\nLumumba previously told CNN a lack of political will and years of neglect on a national level has prevented Jackson from getting the help it needs to fix its water and sewer crisis. Besides the infrastructure issues, the plant has also been faced with staffing issues, according to the mayor and governor.\n\n\"A far too small number of heroic frontline workers were trying their hardest to hold the system together, but that it was a near impossibility,\" the governor said Monday.\n\nbefore this month. Jackson's ongoing water system problems already had some residents reporting low to no water pressure and raw sewage flowing in city streets and neighborhoodsbefore this month.\n\nNow, some residents are taking to Twitter -- where #jxnwatercrisis and #jacksonwatercrisis were trending -- to post pictures of buckets and even tubs full of brown water coming out of their drains.\n\nNAACP president Derrick Johnson called out the Mississippi governor on Twitter Tuesday.\n\n\".@tatereeves, what are you waiting for!? We demand on behalf of the Jackson communities that you request federal aid from @FEMA and other agencies to ensure people have access to a basic human right: WATER,\" Johnson's tweet read. \"Make the damn call. This is personal.\"\n\nJackson has undergone drastic changes in the past half century. Its economic decline has occurred rapidly over the past two decades, fueled by population decline and demographic shifts.\n\nThe city's population shrank from almost 200,000 in 1990 to about 160,000 in 2020. Its decline in population in these three decades was driven almost entirely by White flight. The city was 56% Black in 1990.

Areas closer to the plant \"are experiencing almost normal pressure,\" while areas farther away still have low to no pressure, they said.\n\n\"We made some positive gains within the system. We are encouraged,\" Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said in a news conference Thursday.\n\nFEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell will head on Friday to Jackson, CNN has learned. President Joe Biden approved an emergency declaration for Jackson, which the governor said will let Mississippi tap into critical resources to respond to the crisis.\n\nThe tap water problem came to a head Monday, when river flooding nudged an already-damaged main treatment plant to failure, meaning many of Jackson's faucets were delivering barely -- if any -- water. In some cases, the water has been brown.\n\nCity residents already had been told to boil their water since late July because of quality concerns, and the water system has been troubled for years\n\nWater spews Thursday from a drain outside of Metrocenter Mall in Jackson, Mississippi.\n\nThe rental pump installed Wednesday at the treatment plant will help add 4 million more gallons of water a day into the system, authorities said they believe. The state also contracted with outside operators to begin work on critical emergency repairs.\n\nThe treatment plant sends treated water to above-ground tanks spread across the city, and those tanks -- which send water to homes and businesses -- are supposed to be full for optimal pressure, Gov. Tate Reeves has said. Failure of the plant's pumps led tank levels to drop.\n\nMore than half the tanks \"have begun filling back up,\" city officials said Thursday in a news release. The plant's pressure output increased to 78 pounds per square inch as of Thursday morning, while the goal is 87 psi, the release said.\n\nProper pH-measuring also is a challenge, Reeves said Thursday.\n\n\"There have been some challenges with the sensors that are measuring the pH balance of the water coming into the facility,\" Reeves said, adding operators at the O.B. Curtis Water Treatment Plant have worked with and \"seen every pH level and they know exactly what they need to add\" to normalize imbalances.\n\n\"We think there is a potential for a relatively quick fix on that to get those sensors accurate,\" the governor said. Officials are not sure the quick fix will work, but state and local officials want to try it, Reeves said.\n\nBut even as fixes are made, service has fluctuated. \"There will be future interruptions ... they are not avoidable at this point,\" Reeves said Wednesday, adding he also urged residents not to drink the water without boiling it.\n\nLumumba was optimistic Wednesday water service could be restored this week, he said then, but \"there is a huge mountain to climb in order to achieve that.\"\n\nDaily life upended in Jackson\n\nWhile authorities rush to make repairs, get needed parts and deal with staffing shortages at Jackson's water plants, the crisis is upending daily life.\n\nResidents are seeing cloudy, discolored water coming out of their faucets and are being told it should be adequate for sanitation purposes. They can't use the water to drink, cook or wash dishes, but they can shower and wash their hands in it, officials said.\n\n\"Please make sure in the shower that your mouth is not open,\" Jim Craig, senior deputy and director of health protection at the Mississippi Department of Health, told residents Wednesday, adding pets should also not consume the water.\n\nIt's not known when residents will no longer have to boil water, and that can't be assessed until the water pressure returns to normal, the mayor has said.\n\nResidents have endured long lines to get bottled water and non-drinking water at distribution sites operated by the city. Some sites this week ran out of water and turned people away. The state Thursday opened seven new sites for distributing bottled water, in addition to city distribution sites, Reeves said.\n\nNational Guard tankers full of nonpotable water are seen Thursday at the Mississippi State Fairgrounds in Jackson, Mississippi.\n\nJackson resident Anita Shaw, 63, arrived early Thursday at a site where the Salvation Army was to distribute bottled water -- a site the group says ran out of 2,700 cases a day earlier before everyone in a long line could get one.\n\nShaw expressed frustration: Residents have been without clean water service for more than a month; not everyone can afford to keep buying bottles, and lines for free water are long. Water coming from her faucet Thursday was light brown, she told CNN.\n\nShe's still had to pay her $100 water bill, she said.\n\n\"I paid $100 ... and can't use the water,\" Shaw said. \"What good is paying the water bill when you can't use the water?\"\n\nAll Jackson public schools shifted to virtual learning Tuesday. Jackson State University also shifted to online classes this week and set up portable showers and toilets across campus.\n\n\"It's like we're living in a nightmare right now,\" sophomore Erin Washington told CNN. Another student described seeing brown, smelly water coming out of faucets on campus.\n\nBusinesses -- many still trying to recover from Covid-19-related setbacks -- are also struggling. Most affected is the city's hospitality industry, said Jeff Rent, president and CEO at Greater Jackson Chamber Partnership.\n\n\"Hotels and restaurants, already on thin margins, either cannot open or they have to make special accommodations including the purchase of ice, water and soft drinks,\" Rent said.\n\nThe O.B. Curtis Water Treatment Plant is seen Wednesday in Ridgeland, north of Jackson, Mississippi.\n\nLonger-term fixes are needed\n\nAround the same time, the main pumps at O.B. Curtis -- the city's main treatment plant -- were severely damaged, forcing the facility to operate on smaller backup pumps, Reeves said this week without elaborating on the damage. The city announced August 9 that the troubled pumps were being pulled offline.\n\nCity officials and Reeves' office have not responded to CNN's requests for details about the damage and the causes.\n\nLast week, the governor was warned that Jackson would soon fail to produce running water, Reeves said\n\nThen, flooding: Heavy rains last week pushed the Pearl River to overflow and flood some Jackson streets , cresting Monday.\n\nIntake water from a reservoir was impacted by the heavy rainfall, creating a chemical imbalance on the conventional treatment side of the plant, Craig said Wednesday. This affected particulate removal, causing that side of the plant to be temporarily shut down and resulting in a loss of water distribution pressure.\n\nEven with the installation Wednesday of the temporary pump, substantial mechanical and electrical issues remain due to deferred maintenance, including various pumps and motors that must be replaced and sludge in basins that has accumulated to levels that are \"not acceptable,\" Craig said.\n\nStaffing issues have further complicated matters, officials said.\n\nQuad Johnson, center, carries packages of bottled water Wednesday to cars at a water distribution site at Grove Park Community Center in Jackson, Mississippi.\n\nJackson's water system also got walloped in February 2021, when a severe winter storm hit, freezing and bursting pipes and leaving many residents without water for a month.\n\nThat came after the city's water system in early 2020 failed an Environmental Protection Agency inspection, which found the drinking water had the potential to be host to harmful bacteria or parasites.\n\nIn July 2021, the EPA and the city entered into an agreement to address \"long-term challenges and make needed improvements to the drinking water system.\" The EPA also recently announced $74.9 million in federal water and sewer infrastructure funds for Mississippi.\n\nAdvocates have previously pointed to systemic and environmental racism as among the causes of Jackson's ongoing water issues and lack of resources to address them. About 82.5% of Jackson's population identifies as Black or African American, according to census data , while the state's legislature is majority White.\n\nAsked Wednesday about claims that the deterioration of the water infrastructure in Jackson is a result of environmental racism, Reeves said the state does not run the water systems.\n\n\"In the state of Mississippi, we have a large number of municipalities that run their own water system. We have a large number of rural water associations that run their own water system. Prior to Monday of this week, the state of Mississippi runs exactly zero water systems,\" he said.", "authors": ["Nouran Salahieh", "Jason Hanna", "Amir Vera"], "publish_date": "2022/09/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/08/31/jackson-mississippi-clean-water-crisis-residents-rally/7948110001/", "title": "Mississippi water crisis: Locals rally to get Jackson residents water", "text": "Groups across Mississippi rallied Wednesday to support Jackson in beating the sweltering August heat amid the city's ongoing water crisis, and the federal government is also lending a hand.\n\nMayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said at an afternoon news briefing that he had received a pledge of support from President Joe Biden, who the previous night approved Mississippi's emergency declaration, freeing up federal resources to bolster the state's response.\n\nLumumba said both Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris \"assured me that the eyes of Washington are watching the city of Jackson,'' and that their commitment to solve the water crisis extends beyond the immediate needs and toward finding a long-range solution.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the Environmental Protection Agency would send an expert to Jackson to assess its water treatment plants and expedite repairs.\n\nAs the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency and National Guard worked to get drinkable and non-drinking water to more than 150,000 Jackson residents throughout the week, other local organizations stepped in to help.\n\nOn an “uncomfortably humid” day when temperatures were expected to reach 92 degrees, according to AccuWeather, YMCAs across the city offered free showers to local college students, WAPT-TV reported.\n\nExcessive rainfall had doused Jackson and central Mississippi throughout August, and recent flooding on the Pearl River caused pumps to fail at a Jackson water treatment plant, officials said.\n\nHere's what to know about the response to Jackson's water shortage and who's impacted:\n\nWater from the faucets still not drinkable\n\nLumumba said residents of the capital city still need to boil water for drinking, washing dishes and other activities, like brushing their teeth.\n\nAn emergency pump was installed Wednesday at the O.B.

But tests Tuesday night showed issues with the water chemistry, leading to a drop in output and water pressure, and a requirement to boil water for certain uses remained in effect.\n\n\"It is safe to take baths in. It is safe to wash your hands,'' Lumumba said. \"However, if you are drinking or cooking with it, we ask you to boil that water (for at least a minute).''\n\nEven before the service disruption, Jackson residents had been boiling their drinking water for the past month because officials said it could cause digestive problems.\n\nWho is helping Jackson resid ents access drinkable water?\n\nJackson’s residents will receive help from coastal Mississippi, thanks to efforts from Ocean Springs-based restaurant founder Brad Orrison.\n\nOrrison, who runs the Shed BBQ and Blues Joint and a barbecue sauce company, planned to fill 8,000 12-ounce water bottles to send to the state’s capital with the help of anyone who’s available to transport the load upstate, he told the Sun Herald of Biloxi, Mississippi.\n\nBIDEN APPROVES EMERGENCY DECLARATION:Mississippi pump failure leaves 150K people without safe drinking water\n\nThe businessman and his family lived through Hurricane Katrina 17 years ago and recalled going without water, the Sun Herald reported. “It’s an unfortunate thing, but we are doing the best we can to try and help,” Orrison said, according to the Sun Herald.\n\nLocal Jackson organizations like the Immigrant Alliance For Justice And Equity and New Horizon Ministries also planned to distribute water to residents. The Mississippi Food Network, the only food bank in the state, announced a collaboration with Feeding America to get water bottles to people in Jackson.\n\nHow is the water crisis impacting Jackson's communities of color?\n\nThe people of Jackson, where more than 80% of the residents are Black, were first told to boil their water in July after the health department discovered cloudy water that could cause health problems.\n\nLead worries and a cold snap last year left residents without water for weeks.

Lumumba said he has discussed splitting the cost of addressing the crisis with health department leaders and the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency, who mentioned taking on about half the cost.\n\nThe city plans to use funds from the American Rescue Plan to meet its portion of the costs, according to Lumumba.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/03/09/jackson-mississippi-water-crisis-how-started-and-what-know/4641990001/", "title": "Mississippi's capital city enters week 4 of a water crisis: Here's how it ...", "text": "JACKSON, Miss. – A water outage in Jackson, Mississippi, has caused many to lug gallons from distribution sites to their homes just to flush the toilet. Low pressure in faucets has made it difficult to shower or wash dishes. A citywide water boil notice has left thousands of people without immediate, safe drinking water.\n\nOfficials in the city of roughly 160,000 people said the water pressure was being restored after it was depleted by a winter storm that passed through the area three weeks ago. In some pockets of the city, largely among higher elevations, residents were still experiencing little to no water pressure as of Monday.\n\nThe water in Jackson is still unsafe to drink. The city remains under a boil notice issued Feb. 16.\n\nTesting revealed the water contains high levels of turbidity, or cloudiness, which increases the chance it may contain disease-causing organisms.\n\nPublic Works Director Charles Williams said Monday the notice could be lifted for some areas of the city Thursday once water tanks were full and sampling could take place.

Supplies began to run low.\n\nCity spokeswoman Michelle Atoa said Jackson provided more than 26,500 bottles of water and about 7,000 gallons of nonpotable water.\n\nSanitizing water without electricity:Mississippians without power might not be able to boil water, but they can disinfect it. Here's how.\n\nFeb. 23: Governor activates Guard\n\nGov. Tate Reeves suggested a state takeover of Jackson's water system. Reeves tweeted he'd secured tankers to provide nonpotable water. He activated the Mississippi National Guard to assist during the crisis.\n\nFeb. 24: Officials warn of water main breaks\n\nOfficials said most of the city would see water restored by the end of the week, but they warned residents water main breaks could cause delays.\n\nTen water distribution sites popped up.\n\nFeb. 25: Water pressure gradually increasing\n\nWilliams said at a news conference water pressure was increasing gradually at the water treatment plants, which allowed them to pump out more water.\n\nMayor Lumumba and Williams point to Feb. 26 as a more likely date water would be restored.\n\nResidents reflect:'We're just not built for this down here': Jackson water crisis is latest chapter in decades-long saga\n\nMarch 1: Pressure falls back; south Jackson struggles\n\nWilliams said the water system was still stabilizing and pressure was near ideal levels Feb. 28, but those levels had fallen. South Jackson residents struggled with a lack of water and water pressure.\n\nUp to 80 water main breaks were reported since the storm hit. Workers mended the breaks, while volunteers, community members and officials manned water distribution sites.\n\nThe Water System Business Administration announced it would offer residents a chance to have their bills adjusted if storm damage caused a lack of water or broken pipes.\n\nMarch 2: No city data on water outages\n\nOfficials said they did not know the number of residents without water or the date for full restoration.\n\nWilliamssaid south Jackson residents in high-elevation areas were dealing with outages, but he did not know how many residents were without water.\n\nMarch 3: Aging infrastructure at fault, official says\n\nWater intake filters full of clams, mussels, fish and other items forced systems offline to clean the filters, Williams said. Some customers who had seen water pressure return may have lost it again, he said.\n\nWilliams confirmed more than 10,000 water customers did not have any water.

Lumumba said the signs of recovery don't \"mean by any stretch that all residents have pressure or water.\"\n\nOne of the challenges as the city reestablishes water pressure is the possibility of pipes bursting.\n\n\"We know that we have brittle pipes, we have aged pipes, just as our water treatment facilities are aged,\" he said.\n\nThe mayor also explained the process before the boil water notice can be lifted, saying, \"Once pressure is restored to all residents, then the next stage of that process is that the health department gives the OK, gives the go ahead to start the testing process.\n\n\"Once that testing process begins, there are about 120 sites that they begin to take samples from, and you have to have two consecutive days of clear samples before the boil water notice can be lifted.\"\n\nWhat led to this week's outage\n\nThe main pumps at Jackson's primary O.B. Curtis Water Treatment Plant around late July were severely damaged, forcing the facility to operate on smaller backup pumps, Gov. Tate Reeves said this week, without elaborating on the damage, which city officials also have not detailed.\n\nThe city announced August 9 the troubled pumps were being pulled offline.\n\nThen last week, the governor was warned Jackson would soon fail to produce running water, Reeves said.\n\nAnd then came the flooding: Heavy rains last week pushed the Pearl River to overflow, cresting Monday, and to flood some Jackson streets -- while also impacting intake water at a reservoir that feeds the drinking water treatment plant.\n\nA chemical imbalance was created on the conventional treatment side of the plant, Jim Craig, senior deputy and director of health protection at the Mississippi Department of Health, said Wednesday.\n\nIt affected particulate removal, causing a side of the plant to be temporarily shut down and resulting in a loss of water distribution pressure, he said.\n\nStaffing problems have further complicated matters, officials said.\n\nA tanker leaves O.B. Curtis Water Plant on Wednesday.\n\nWhat needs to be done to fix it\n\nA temporary rented pump was installed Wednesday at the plant, and \"significant\" gains were made by Thursday, the city said, with workers making a \"series of repairs and equipment adjustments.\"\n\nAs of Thursday, water pressure had been restored to some residents, with those close to the plant having almost normal pressure, the city said . Those farther away and at higher elevations still had little to no pressure.\n\nAnd much work remained to be done on other pumps and motors, Craig said, noting an unacceptable amount of sludge had accumulated in basins.\n\nEven as workers try to restore water service, there's another, longer-standing issue they're addressing: the water's quality.\n\nA boil-water advisory went into effect in late July -- well before Monday's service disruptions -- after cloudy water at the O.B. Curtis plant was blamed on high levels of the mineral manganese, \"combined with the use of lime,\" the city said. That order has yet to be lifted.\n\nContractors also were making assessments Thursday, according to the city update, and the Environmental Protection Agency and the US Army Corps of Engineers were at the site.\n\nFEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell in Jackson on Friday. President Joe Biden approved an emergency declaration for the city, and it will allow Mississippi to tap into critical resources to respond to the crisis, Reeves said.\n\nHow people are coping without running water\n\nResidents have understandably been angry and frustrated, with no water to drink or brush their teeth or, in many cases, even flush toilets.\n\nSome waited hours in long lines this week for a case of bottled water, only to be turned away when the supply ran out.\n\nJeraldine Watts, 86, was in a line that stretched for 2 miles, she told CNN.\n\nWatts, who was born and raised in Jackson and lives with her daughter and granddaughter, said they have to use bottled or boiled water for everything -- even to cook and wash dishes.\n\n\"We are constantly paying water bills, and we can't use the water,\" Jackson resident Corean Wheeler said. \"We feel like we are living in a third world country in America, and that's kind of bad.\"\n\nSchools switched to virtual learning as of Tuesday, and a medical center was without air conditioning because of a lack of water pressure to feed its chillers, the University of Mississippi Medical Center said Tuesday.\n\nThe governor declared an emergency, and the National Guard was deployed to help distribute water. On Thursday, the state opened seven distribution sites, adding to those operated by the city.\n\nResidents who were getting discolored water from their taps were told it should be used for showering or washing hands only and not for drinking or cooking.\n\n\"Please make sure in the shower that your mouth is not open,\" Craig told residents.\n\nCity water system problems go back years\n\nAn unreliable water supply is nothing new to Jacksonians. The city's water system in early 2020 failed an Environmental Protection Agency inspection, which found the drinking water had the potential to be host to harmful bacteria or parasites.\n\nResidents were without water for a month when pipes froze and burst during a 2021 winter storm. And the late July boil-water advisory remains in effect\n\nThe problems are largely systemic -- old and leaky pipes, malfunctions at treatment plants and insufficient money to fix the problems, according to a report by the Mississippi Center for Investigative Reporting that the Clarion Ledger published in January.\n\nStaffing at the plant also has been a problem, according to Reeves and the mayor.\n\n\"This is something that has been occurring for years, but sometimes it takes these catastrophes to make sure that this disaster comes to light,\" Mississippi state Rep. Ronnie Crudup Jr., of Jackson, told CNN this week.\n\nThe EPA and the city entered into an agreement last year to address \"long-term challenges and make needed improvements to the drinking water system.\" And that agency recently announced $74.9 million in federal water and sewer infrastructure funds for Mississippi, though $2 billion is needed for the work, the mayor has said.\n\nAdvocates have pointed to systemic and environmental racism as among the causes of Jackson's ongoing water issues and lack of resources to address them. About 82.5% of Jackson's population identifies as Black or African American, according to census data.\n\nCities like Jackson suffer the \"benign neglect\" of those in power, Catherine Coleman Flowers, founder of the Center for Rural Enterprise and Environmental Justice, told CNN in April. \"I am concerned that it's just another symbol of what I call one of the relatives of the Confederacy where communities that need help are not given the help, especially if they're marginalized or communities of color.\"", "authors": ["Theresa Waldrop"], "publish_date": "2022/09/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/01/world/gallery/photos-this-week-august-25-september-1/index.html", "title": "Photos this week: August 25-September 1, 2022", "text": "Carlos Barria/Reuters Phillip Young, a resident of Jackson, Mississippi, takes a break while helping local volunteers distribute water bottles in the city on Wednesday, August 31.

Ralph Eubanks is the author of the new book “A Place Like Mississippi: A Journey Through a Real and Imagined Literary Landscape” (Timber Press), as well as “Ever Is a Long Time” and “The House at the End of the Road.” He is a visiting professor of English and Southern Studies at the University of Mississippi. The views expressed here are his. View more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nWhen I am asked what makes Mississippi so special, I always point out the special ways the past and the present intersect on the physical and cultural landscape of this state. The names of Native American tribes like Biloxi and Pascagoula exist alongside the traces of the frontier and African-American culture that shaped the state.\n\nW. Ralph Eubanks headshot Ed Croom\n\nMississippi is a land of fascinating cultural juxtapositions. It birthed people who created high art and popular culture, with artists as varied as Elvis Presley and B.B. King, William Faulkner and Eudora Welty, and Leontyne Price and Tammy Wynette. Scholars like Bill Ferris and Margaret Walker Alexander have even helped preserve the cultural richness of this state and make it available to the world.\n\nYes, Mississippi has something to say and, given our extensive contributions in art and letters to this nation and the world, Mississippi matters.\n\nWhat I did not expect on a recent trip to Jackson earlier this month was to encounter a new way the past and the present are colliding in Mississippi. Instead of the cultural charm and pull of this place that I love so much, I was confronted by the remnants of Jim Crow Mississippi living on in the present.\n\nWhen I arrived at the gleaming Westin Hotel in downtown Jackson for the Mississippi Book Festival – hailed as this state’s “literary lawn party” – I was given two bottles of water, instructed not to drink the water that flowed from my faucet and warned not even to use the hotel’s water to brush my teeth. When I looked somewhat puzzled, the desk clerk let me know that the city was under a boil water alert and sought to reassure me. “Mr. Eubanks, you can come back and get as many bottles as you need,” he reminded me before I went up to my room. When I opened the door to my room, there were already extra bottles on my dresser.\n\nNow, nearly two weeks later, what felt like an inconvenience is a full-blown crisis, albeit one that has been going on for years. More than 150,000 people in the state capital have no access to safe drinking water for the foreseeable future. The main water treatment facility began failing Monday, after torrential rains and years of water system problems had already left the city under a boil water notice in late July for what the state has called a “water-quality issue.”\n\nLooking back, I was witnessing a tale of two cities at the Mississippi Book Festival: one in which writers visiting from around the country were treated like royalty – and Mississippi sure does know how to honor writers – and another one in which its citizens do not have daily access to a basic need like clean drinkable water.\n\nUnlike me and my fellow writers, the poor and disadvantaged of Jackson do not have access to as much water as they need. On Tuesday, people at one distribution site were turned away when supplies of bottled water ran out. For those without cars or reliable transportation, they may not even be able to get to the stations that are providing drinkable water.\n\nAs someone old enough to remember segregated drinking fountains, I can say from memory that the water was rarely as cold as it was at the fountain for Whites. My mother always said, “We don’t drink colored water. Water is colorless, odorless and tasteless. Plus, the water in those fountains is not cold.” The water in the Jim Crow fountains was almost always tepid, even warm, the message being that substandard access to water was all that Black people deserved to have.\n\nGiven the years of neglect to the infrastructure of the state capital – a city that should be the proud shining jewel of the Magnolia State – it is no surprise the state government of Mississippi has ignored the city’s problems with its water system to the point of an absolute failure of the system. Now, unlike the warm water that flowed from Jim Crow era “colored” water fountains, the people of Jackson have no drinkable water at all. It is almost as if Jackson is being told to drink from the “colored” water fountain all over again, except this time drinking the water might make you deathly ill.\n\nThe particulars of this moment in Jackson’s water crisis involve complexities at the municipal and state level, but this isn’t the first time – far from it – that this city’s residents are suffering like this. One could understandably ask, as a number of my fellow writers did of me while they were in Jackson: How could a state ignore the needs of the residents of its capital city and allow things to deteriorate to this point? The answer as I see it is simple: racism.\n\nJackson is a Black majority city and Mississippi is governed by a White Republican supermajority that refuses to invest in Jackson because of who lives there and who governs it. The message derived from the ways Mississippi’s politicians have refused to support the crumbling infrastructure of Jackson again and again over the years is not much different from the late Sen. James K. Vardaman referring to Mississippi’s Black citizens as “lazy, lying, lustful animal[s], which no amount of training can transform into a tolerable citizen.”\n\nRacism creates a vicious cycle: If you know that the White power structure believes you are incompetent, how can you trust them to help you fix a problem, given the ways they continue to oppress you? And suburban Whites, many of whom buy into the narrative of incompetence their political leaders have fed to them for decades, feel no responsibility to help.\n\nDuring the book festival, when I tried to explain the origins of Jackson’s water crisis to a writer visiting from New York, I was asked, “So, what is the endgame to all of this?” I didn’t have an answer. When I told this story to a former student, Brittany Brown – who was in the process of retrieving her mother from Jackson because of the water crisis – her answer was also simple: “The endgame is Black death. This crisis overwhelmingly harms the Black and the poor. The state government should take care of its people, but it has ignored this crisis for so long simply because the majority of people who are affected are Black.”\n\nWhat the endgame should be is safe and clean water for all residents of Jackson. State Sen. David Blount, along with four other senators, has called for a special legislative session, noting that it was time for the state to use a portion of its more than $2.5 billion in surplus funds to help fix Jackson’s water system.\n\nThere is precedent for this, since – as Blount has pointed out – the legislature sent money to Rankin County in suburban Jackson to build a new sewer plant and has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on regional utilities on the Gulf Coast and in DeSoto County in the Mississippi suburbs outside of Memphis. But these are all in White-majority municipalities. Given the racialized politics of Mississippi, I fear those surplus funds will never be used to help Jackson.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nUnfortunately, what is central to the endgame of the Jackson water crisis is power. Power lies at the core of the politics of identity being played by Mississippi’s Republican politicians. What all the parties involved in getting clean water to Jackson’s citizens should be seeking is knowledge and truth, rooted in a shared meaning of Mississippi’s past, even the ugly parts of it that make us all uncomfortable when we look at them through a deep, dark truthful mirror. Until Mississippi begins to see the connection between the Jim Crow past in its present – and see it clearly – the Jackson water crisis will never be resolved.", "authors": ["W.

Maybe", "text": "Patricia Alex\n\nPaterson Press\n\nConcern is growing in Paterson over dangerous lead levels in drinking water that don’t approach other high-profile cases — like Flint and Newark — but may be harder to remediate because of a peculiar feature of the city’s distribution system and the inattention of state and local officials.\n\nTwo-thirds of samples taken in a 2016 study by the New Jersey Community Development Corporation, a Paterson community advocacy agency, found dangerous levels of lead in drinking water supplied to Paterson homes. In addition, lead was found in the water of 94% of Paterson homes tested over the past three years and exceeded federal standards in about 10% of the samples, according to data from the Paterson's water supplier.\n\nThe results provided by the Passaic Valley Water Commission have raised questions about the safety of Paterson's water supply. Still, they do not compare with the situation unfolding in Newark, where dangerously unsafe lead levels have been found in more than 45% of homes tested earlier this year. Those results prompted a crisis-level reaction, including the distribution of bottled water.\n\nBut the lead levels in Paterson’s water are consistently higher than in most neighboring towns served by PVWC — driven by the dangerous heavy metal leaching from aged pipes and plumbing after the water is treated. PVWC officials say the city’s water woes are harder to remediate than elsewhere because Paterson’s 135-year-old distribution system doesn’t allow for the addition of phosphates that reduce the corrosion. Phosphates are used to line pipes to prevent lead leaching into water.\n\n“If Paterson was its own water system it would be shut,” said Joseph Getz, a consultant hired by the water commission in 2014 to help educate the public on the lead threat. “We’re playing Russian roulette.”\n\nNo amount of lead in water is considered safe for human consumption, as it has been linked to damage in the brain and kidneys. The greatest effects of lead exposure are on infants, young children and pregnant women.\n\nThe federal government says there is a cause for concern when lead readings exceed a measurement of five parts per billion. The United States Environmental Protection Agency says action needs to be taken when more than 10% of readings in a system exceed a reading of 15 parts per billion.\n\nPaterson is one of 15 towns that get water from the PVWC, a public agency governed by a seven-member board appointed by the mayors of its three owner cities — Clifton, Passaic and Paterson.\n\nDuring the past three years, the PVWC tested for lead in the water in 306 Paterson homes and came up with results that topped the federal standard of 15 parts per billion (ppb) in 28 of them, or 9.15% of the cases. Officials concede the sampling is small, voluntary and likely does not reflect the scope of the problem in the city. The New Jersey Community Development Corporation study demonstrated significantly higher percentages, with 63 of 101 homes exceeding 15 ppb.\n\nSome advocates wonder why the lead contamination in Paterson’s drinking water has gotten so little attention.\n\n“Paterson is the forgotten child — again,” said Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey Sierra Club.\n\nPVWC said it has been sending reports documenting the presence of lead in Paterson’s drinking water to municipal officials and residents for years. But city officials do not seem to share the alarm expressed by Getz.\n\nPaterson’s health officer, Dr. Paul Persaud, said in a recent interview that he doesn’t consider the quality of Paterson’s drinking water to be a problem. Mayor Andre Sayegh called a press conference on Thursday to announce the receipt of a $25,000 grant that will be used to distribute flyers about the dangers of lead and create a registry of addresses in Paterson where lead is problematic.\n\nThose efforts came against the backdrop of Gov. Phil Murphy’s announcement that day that he wants New Jersey to spend $500 million to remove all lead pipes in the state over the next decade. Amid the growing concern and resources devoted to problem statewide, some Paterson residents and community groups say city officials have been flat-footed in recognizing and addressing the problem.\n\n“They’re clueless, and there is no sense of urgency,” said Theodore “TJ” Best, a Passaic County freeholder, referring to the city’s response to the lead situation. Best said he recently had his 1920s-era home on Paterson’s East Side privately tested and found lead levels in the water exceeded those that prompted action in Newark.\n\n“Something has to happen,” the freeholder said.\n\nLead in New Jersey:Where are the lead lines in New Jersey's drinking water systems? No one knows for sure\n\nBruce Lowry:When will young people stop dying in Paterson?\n\nCan it be done?:Four reasons to doubt Gov. Phil Murphy's promise to clean it up\n\nWidespread problem\n\nThe drinking water crisis in Newark has again focused national attention on lead in public drinking water, but across the United States, it is estimated there may be another 500 systems where dangerous levels are present. In North Jersey, elevated levels recently were found in homes serviced by Suez Water in Bergen County.\n\nIn each case, lead leaches from service-line pipes that connect water mains to homes — well after lead-free drinking water leaves treatment facilities, experts and officials said. Any home built before 1986 could contain lead in its plumbing, either in service lines, solder or fixtures.\n\nBut homes with plumbing from before World War II are most likely to contain lead; the most lead lines were installed from the 1800s through the 1920s, according to experts. About a quarter of the housing stock in Paterson was built before 1940, according to the American Community Survey.\n\nExperts have said the ultimate solution lies in removing service lines and plumbing — a costly and sometimes complicated undertaking that could take years. Interim fixes, however, center on adding the anti-corrosive phosphates to treated water — an industry standard around the country.\n\nPaterson’s water is treated at the PVWC plant in Little Falls and then held at reservoirs — on Garret Mountain and near the Great Falls — until it is distributed in the city. The two reservoirs are also designed to provide an emergency water supply if the main treatment plant stops operating, too. PVWC says the use of the anti-corrosives isn’t possible since those reservoirs are uncovered, and adding phosphates would trigger toxic algae blooms.\n\nNearly a decade ago the federal government ordered PVWC to either cover or re-treat the water it stores in the open-air reservoirs to shield it from environmental contaminants — like animal and bird feces and runoff — and even external tampering. The project has been stalled by opponents in the community who say capping the reservoirs would mar the landscape.\n\nThe utility says the logistics of adding the phosphates after treatment — as it does for Passaic, Clifton and, just recently, Prospect Park — are impossible in the tight geography of Paterson’s water distribution system, particularly surrounding the Levine Reservoir near the Great Falls.\n\nWhile wrangling over the issue has continued in Paterson, almost every other open reservoir that holds treated water in the country has been eliminated. There were 750 in service in 1975. Now there are just seven around the country, including the three used by the PVWC, said Joseph A. Bella, executive director at the utility.\n\nBella said he’s frustrated by the inability to resolve the issue.\n\n“Without the ability to use phosphate-based corrosion inhibitors, Paterson residents remain at an elevated risk of lead in their drinking water,” he said. “Adding phosphates to Paterson’s water supply would lower the lead test results by three or four times.”\n\nStory continues below the video.\n\nReplacing lead lines\n\nMeanwhile, the PVWC has replaced nearly 35,000 utility-owned lead lines throughout its system and has fewer than 200 to go, said Getz. The problem now lies in the plumbing inside homes and in the customer-owned service lines running from the curb to homes and business, officials said.\n\nIt’s been difficult to get an inventory of which properties still have lead service lines in the PVWC system.\n\n“This water company started in 1894 …The data is on index cards, we’re not really sure of the accuracy,” said Getz.\n\nThe PVWC says it has between 180 and 200 known lead service lines in its system. In addition, PVWC says it does not know the primary material of an additional 3,200 of its lines.\n\nThose lines are jointly owned by the PVWC — which has responsibility from the water main to a homeowner's property line — and homeowners, who own the lines that run on their properties. The latter are the responsibility of property owners to replace. PVWC will replace for a $4,000 fee.\n\nSuez in Bergen County is seeking state approval to replace homeowners’ lateral lines for $1,000 and pass alone the difference to all its ratepayers. PVWC officials and experts explained the disparity in prices by saying that they have a smaller base of customers, while utilities like Suez can spread the expense among a larger base of ratepayers.\n\nEssex County has borrowed money to provide funding for lateral line replacements in Newark, and in the southern part of the state American Water is doing free lateral line replacements for homes built before 1950.\n\n“This is more challenging for mid-size systems like PVWC that don’t have the resources” of a larger utility, said Catherine Klinger-Kutcher, national lead campaign director for the Green and Healthy Homes Initiative, a nonprofit advocacy group. “It’s hard to get a sense of urgency around this issue.”\n\nGetz, the PVWC consultant, said public outreach has been particularly difficult in Paterson, where more than 70% of households are rentals. He also cited language barriers, and said the commission has sent out notifications about lead in English, Spanish, Polish, Farsi, Arabic and Bengali.\n\nThe utility has paid Getz’s firm, JGSC Group, $140,000 per year since 2014 to coordinate its lead outreach efforts.\n\nPVWC has offered customers a zero-interest loan to cover the cost of the lateral replacements, but has had few takers. Since 2016, just 186 lateral lines have been replaced and 55 customers have taken the loan, said Getz.\n\nSylvia Perez is among the 186 Paterson homeowners who have had the remediation work completed. She said she jumped at the chance to have new lines installed for free at her three-family home on East 26th Street when PVWC was making repairs on her block near 10th Avenue. Getz said the free replacement is available for homeowners if the utility is replacing its lines on the block.\n\nStory continues below the video.\n\n“I have kids, so I pay attention. I didn’t want to take any chances,” said Perez, an accountant. “But I still buy Poland Spring, and tell my tenants to do the same.”\n\nPaterson has been identified by the state as one of seven cities where children have elevated levels of lead in their blood. The city health officer, Persaud, said most of the problem stemmed from sources other than water, such as dust from lead paint.\n\n“We don’t have cases in Paterson where we attribute the lead poisoning to water, but it does add to the lead burden,” he said.\n\nLocal health officials around the country and even those from the federal Centers for Disease Control have been slow to recognize the lead threat in water even as the Environmental Protection Agency has adopted more stringent standards, said Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, a pediatrician whose research exposed the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, where failure to add anti-corrosives to the water supply spiked lead levels in 2014.\n\n“The legacy of lead lingers in paint, soil and drinking water,” said Hanna-Attisha, author of What the Eyes Don't See. “The scope of the problem becomes overwhelming to folks.”\n\nGovernment support, she said, is needed to address the massive infrastructure retooling needed.\n\nThe recent action in Newark was spurred by a lawsuit filed by the National Resources Defense Council, a nonprofit advocacy group, about the dangerous levels of lead in that city’s drinking water.\n\n“A lot of government officials are in denial that there’s a problem, we’ve seen it time after time,\" said the National Resources group’s senior director of health, Erik Olson.\n\nInattention and inaction\n\nThe inability to add anti-corrosives to Paterson’s reservoir is only part of the equation, experts said.\n\nThe Passaic River, where it bends on the Little Falls-Totowa border, is the main source for PVWC’s water. It is pumped from the river and treated at the utility’s state-of-the-art plant in Little Falls before it goes to the holding reservoirs.\n\nIn the summer, the flow in that highly urbanized section of the river can be 90% effluents — treated sewage that comes from several dozen upstream treatment plants along the Passaic and is tributaries. PVWC buys water from the Wanaque Reservoir to mix in so the system meets quality standards, noted Tittel, director of the New Jersey Sierra Club.\n\nThe dirtier the source water, the more acidic it is because of pollutants, making it more corrosive, Tittel said. The more corrosion, the more lead leaches from the pipes, he pointed out.\n\nThe PVWC reports its lead data on a system-wide basis to the state, so that Paterson’s high lead levels get mixed in and watered down by better numbers for surrounding towns, Getz said. As a system, PVWC exceeded the 15 ppb a half dozen times in the last 10 years.\n\nNewark is giving out bottled water and filters and working to adjust the chemical balance of its water treatment after 169 of its 370 samples reported in the spring exceeded 15 ppb. Some 10% of the Newark homes tested had 57 ppb or greater.\n\nOver the past three years, 10% of Paterson homes had 13.9 ppb or greater.\n\n“The standard is 15 (ppb) — it should be five (ppb) — and we still can’t meet it,” Tittel said.\n\nLong-term solutions\n\nCorrosion control is important, but it can be unreliable, subject to the vagaries of weather and runoff and dozens of other factors, experts say. Filters also are a stop-gap measure, said Chris Sturm, managing director of policy and water for NJ Future, an environmental group.\n\n“Ultimately the issue of interior plumbing needs to be addressed” Sturm said.\n\nThe Jersey Water Works Lead Water Task Force released a package of policy recommendations on Thursday that included multiple approaches, some of which have worked in other states such as legislation that requires disclosure of lead plumbing as a condition of property sale or as part of inspection of rentals.\n\nThe task force also called for a 10-year state program to replace all lead service lines and to create a capital funding plan for the estimated $2 billion cost of doing so across the state.\n\nNewark is considering a plan to make line replacement mandatory and there are a raft of bills now pending in the state legislature dealing with the issue. Funding will be key, particularly for a system like PVWC, where two of the three owner cities are financially distressed.\n\nEven with financing, there are still challenges with getting people on board. Homeowners don’t want their property disrupted. And, because the effects of lead are long-term, officials and water customers don’t feel an urgency on the issue.\n\n“It’s very expensive and it seems daunting but it’s actually a very finite problem,” said Sturm. “It can get done — step by step.”\n\nEditor’s note: The reporting for this story was partly funded by a grant from the nonprofit New Jersey Community Development Corporation to the Citizens Campaign, which owns Paterson Press.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/02/us/jackson-water-crisis-demographics-population-decline/index.html", "title": "Tea leaves unread: Jackson's water crisis follows years of economic ...", "text": "(CNN) What residents of Jackson, Mississippi long viewed as a looming crisis came to a head this week when torrential rains battered the city, causing the Pearl River to flood and its main water supply treatment facility to fail.\n\nThe city has since been without potable running water, and some have said that the water that is accessible from taps is brown and muddy, forcing people to use bottled water — if they can get their hands on it — to cook and brush their teeth. On Thursday, people of Jackson were advised to shower with their mouths closed.\n\nBut the water crisis did not come as a surprise to the city's longtime residents. Jackson has seen a long string of challenges, including sharp economic declines, demographic changes and a shrinking population since the 1990s that have culminated in a city set up to fail its residents.\n\nMississippi state Rep. Ronnie Crudup Jr., a Jackson Resident, told CNN that by Tuesday, his family had running water, but it was discolored and unsafe to drink.\n\n\"This is something that has been occurring for years, but sometimes it takes these catastrophes to make sure that this disaster comes to light,\" he said.\n\nHere's what you need to know about Mississippi's capital city, and why this crisis has hit at a particularly devastating point in its history.\n\nUnlike other Sunbelt cities, Jackson's population has steeply declined\n\nWhile other cities in the South have seen their populations swell over the past decade, Jackson is one of just a few major cities in the region that have experienced a sharp population decline, dipping more than 10% in the past decade. Jackson has just over 150,000 residents, down from nearly 200,000 in 1990.\n\nA report published by the Mississippi Urban Research Center about Jackson's failing water systems says that the city's population decline has led to increased infrastructure issues and rising costs associated with them. The problem, the report states, was \"associated with reduced quality of infrastructure that can further exacerbate population loss and, depending on the location, increase cost burdens on minority and low-income communities.\"\n\nThe city has undergone drastic demographic changes\n\nJackson's population decline has led to dramatic demographic changes, driven almost entirely by White flight. The city was 56% Black in 1990, but by 2020, more than 80% of the city's residents were Black. In 1997, the city elected its first Black mayor, but by 2000, the city's White population was rapidly dwindling, down by 16% from the decade before.\n\nThe shift in demographics has not translated to economic growth for the city's Black population. The city's two Black business districts, as well as the downtown district, both closed by the 2000s, and many of the city's social services have dwindled.\n\nAccording to the Mississippi Urban Institute's report, Black residents have had to bear the brunt of the city's water crisis.\n\n\"There is still the need to equalize the delivery of water services in the older, underserved areas of Jackson, which are predominantly occupied by Black and low-income residents,\" the report says, adding that the aging water lines in these areas were the ones \"most likely to fail, causing inordinately high maintenance cost.\"\n\nHousehold income has shrunk, while nearby suburbs have boomed\n\nJackson's median household income has shrunk as its demographics have shifted. Mississippi is the poorest state in the nation, with 18.7% of residents living below the poverty line -- but in Jackson, that figure is higher still at 24.5%.\n\nMuch of the city's White flight has been to the nearby counties of Madison and Rankin, home to wealthy suburbs that surround Jackson. Madison County's population has doubled since 1990, and according to a December 2021 CNN analysis was the only county in Jackson's metropolitan area with a greater percentage of White people in 2019 than 1990.\n\nJackson's population is aging, becoming more vulnerable to the effects of the city's failures\n\nAnother effect of Jackson's demographic changes is the size of its older population. As the overall population decreases in the city, and fewer new residents take root in the state's capital city, the share of Jackson's population that is made up of people over 60 years old has slowly crept upward. The effects of unclean, unusable drinking water could be especially pronounced for the city's older residents, who may have compounding health issues, and may not be able to wait in long lines for bottled supplies or easily leave their homes.\n\n\"We are hopeful that we will be able to increase the quantity of the water which will ultimately get the tanks more full and ultimately lead to a scenario in which we can do the proper testing and actually produce clean water,\" the governor said. \"But we're not there yet.\"\n\nCNN's Nicquel Terry Ellis also contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Priya Krishnakumar", "Christopher Hickey"], "publish_date": "2022/09/02"}]}

Kathy Hochul in July in response to a controversial ruling by the US Supreme Court striking down a state law restricting carrying a concealed handgun outside the home.\n\nThe law outlines areas deemed “sensitive” where firearm possession will be illegal and they include Times Square, one of the world’s busiest tourist destinations drawing nearly 360,000 people daily.\n\nOther areas the law defines as sensitive include government-owned buildings, schools, health care facilities, places of worship and public transportation. People who carry a gun in a prohibited location could be charged with a felony under the law.\n\nThe New York City Council is still hammering out the details of a bill that would delineate the boundaries of Times Square, which sprawls the Midtown region in the borough of Manhattan.\n\nTo ensure there are guidelines on Thursday, Times Square will be under emergency rules created by the New York Police Department and the city, council spokeswoman Breeana Mulligan told CNN.\n\nThere are several exceptions to the rules, including for those who live in the area, who work in the area or are transiting through Times Square.\n\nNew “gun-free zone” signs are expected to be posted in Times Square on Wednesday. They will be placed at every entry and exit point of the area, according to Robert Barrows, the head of NYPD’s legal operations.\n\nTo help people understand which areas are gun-free zones, the city will also implement video messaging boards in certain locations.\n\nOther aspects of the new law include a strict licensing process to obtain a concealed-carry permit, and it also requires background checks for ammunition sales.\n\nUnder the measure, gun owners will be required to store firearms in safe places in their homes if people under the age of 18 live in the residence – an increase from the previously established age of 16.\n\nEfforts to track gun purchases\n\nThe new law comes at a time New York City is struggling with gun violence, despite Mayor Eric Adams attempts to curb it through a multi-point plan he unveiled in January after taking office.\n\nCity officials moved to implement an elevated focus on resident safety and law enforcement response at subways, where a mass shooting at a Brooklyn station injured 29 people in April.\n\nThe city is also seeing a more than 30% increase in major crimes through August 28 compared to last year, according to data from the NYPD.\n\nIn an effort to crack down on illegal gun purchases, city officials have asked Visa, Mastercard and American Express to approve the creation of a merchant category code for gun shops across the country.\n\nSuch codes are already used for nearly any other good or service that can be purchased. If created for gun transactions, it can potentially make it easier to spot unusually large purchases of firearms and ammunition or purchases made in multiple stores.\n\nPurchases currently made at gun shops come across as “miscellaneous” making it difficult to spot a suspicious sale.\n\n“When you buy an airline ticket or pay for your groceries, your credit card company has a special code for those retailers. It’s just commonsense that we have the same policies in place for gun and ammunition stores,” Adams said in a news release.\n\nMastercard said it is reviewing the proposal and how it could be implemented.\n\n“This will help us continue to deliver a payments system that supports all legal purchases while protecting the privacy and decisions of individual cardholders,” spokesperson Seth Eisen said.\n\nCNN reached out to Visa and American Express for comment.\n\nThe credit card companies are voting members of the International Organization on Standardization, which sets the category codes.\n\nAt least two credit companies must agree for the merchant codes to be applied to gun stores – though they have not supported the proposal in the past, according to New York City Comptroller Brad Lander.", "authors": ["Aya Elamroussi"], "publish_date": "2022/08/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/20/us/five-things-june-20-trnd/index.html", "title": "5 things to know for June 20: Travel chaos, Covid-19, Ukraine ...", "text": "If your day doesn't start until you're up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix.

The killers deliberately choose sites where firearms are forbidden, gun-rights advocates say, and because there are no weapons, no \"good guy with a gun\" will be on hand to stop the crime.\n\nSound bite sophistry\n\nWith its overtones of fear and heroism, the argument makes for slick sound bites. But here's the problem: Both its underlying assumptions are contradicted by data. Not only is there zero evidence to support them, our examination at Mother Jones of America's mass shootings indicates they are just plain wrong.\n\nAmong the 62 mass shootings over the past 30 years that we studied, not a single case includes evidence that the killer chose to target a place because it banned guns. To the contrary, in many of the cases there was clearly another motive for the choice of location. For example, 20 were workplace shootings, most of which involved perpetrators who felt wronged by employers and colleagues. Last September, when a troubled man working at a sign manufacturer in Minneapolis was told he would be let go, he pulled out a 9mm Glock and killed six people and injured another before putting a bullet in his own head. Similar tragedies unfolded at a beer distributor in Connecticut in 2010 and at a plastics factory in Kentucky in 2008.\n\nOr consider the 12 school shootings we documented, in which all but one of the killers had personal ties to the school they struck.\n\nOr take the man who opened fire in suburban Milwaukee last August: Are we to believe that a white supremacist targeted the Sikh temple there not because it was filled with members of a religious minority he despised, but because it was a place that didn't allow firearms?\n\nSuicide factor\n\nProponents of this argument also ignore that the majority of mass shootings are murder-suicides. Thirty-six of the killers we studied took their own lives at or near the crime scene, while seven others died in police shootouts they had no hope of surviving (aka \"suicide by cop\"). These were not people whose priority was identifying the safest place to attack.\n\nNo less a fantasy is the idea that gun-free zones prevent armed civilians from saving the day. Not one of the 62 mass shootings we documented was stopped this way.\n\nShooting wrong person\n\nVeteran FBI, ATF and police officials say that an armed citizen opening fire against an attacker in a panic-stricken movie theater or shopping mall is very likely to make matters worse. Law enforcement agents train rigorously for stopping active shooters, they say, a task that requires extraordinary skills honed under acute duress.\n\nIn cases in Washington state and Texas in 2005, would-be heroes who tried to take action with licensed firearms were gravely wounded or killed. In the mass shooting in Tucson, Ariz., in 2011, an armed citizen admitted to coming within a split second of gunning down the wrong person — one of the bystanders who had helped tackle and subdue the actual killer.\n\nTrue security in our schools and other designated gun-free places might require more. Forbidding firearms alone clearly won't keep violence away — not least because of how easily bad guys can get their hands on guns. Nearly 80% of the mass shooters we documented obtained their weapons legally.\n\nIndeed, America is anything but gun-free. We have more than 300 million firearms in private hands. In the past four years, nearly 100 state laws have loosened restrictions on them. To varying degrees, every state except Illinois now allows guns to be carried in public.\n\nAll of which raises an obvious question: If more guns in more places is a solution to the bloodshed, then why did we just witness the worst year for mass shootings in recent history?\n\nMark Follman is a senior editor at Mother Jones.\n\nIn addition to its own editorials, USA TODAY publishes diverse opinions from outside writers, including our Board of Contributors.

Texas crash\n\nA 13-year-old boy was behind the wheel of a pickup truck involved in a head-on collision in Texas that killed nine people, including six University of the Southwest golfers and their coach, a National Transportation Safety Board official said yesterday. The crash occurred after the college students were returning home from a golf tournament. Two survivors of the crash, both students, are still hospitalized. Preliminary reports indicate a spare tire on the pickup truck failed, causing the vehicle to pull into oncoming traffic on a two-lane roadway. Both vehicles were likely moving close to the posted speed limit of 75 mph, an official said. The University of the Southwest -- a small Christian school with an enrollment of about 1,100 students -- is planning a memorial assembly for next week.\n\nJUST WATCHED Nine people killed in fiery crash involving university golf team Replay More Videos ...

Immigration\n\nThe Biden administration is preparing for the potential of mass migration to the US-Mexico border when a Trump-era pandemic emergency rule ends. The influx is expected because officials are considering the possibility of terminating a public health order known as Title 42 , which border authorities have relied on to turn away migrants, sources familiar with the discussions said. Internal documents, first reported by Axios , estimate around 170,000 people may be coming to the US border and some 25,000 migrants are already in shelters in Mexico. The Department of Homeland Security has asked department personnel to volunteer at the Mexico border in response.\n\n4. Coronavirus\n\nOnly about 1.7 million people in the United States -- less than 1% of the total population -- live in counties where the CDC still recommends universal indoor masking. While this is a positive step toward normalcy, scientists are paying close attention to the uptick in Covid-19 cases in Europe and Asia as a possible indicator of what could happen in the US. Dr. Anthony Fauci, Biden's chief medical adviser, told CNN yesterday that the US \"generally follows what goes on in the UK by about two to three weeks.\" In the UK, cases are rising due to the increased transmissibility of the virus and the waning immunity of vaccines, Fauci said. Covid-19 is also making a resurgence in China, and the country's leader vowed to 'minimize' the economic impact of the spike in cases. Separately, Moderna said it has asked the FDA to allow a fourth vaccine dose for any adults who've gotten an initial vaccine booster.\n\n5. Cuba\n\nCuba's Supreme Court has sentenced more than 100 protesters in Havana to prison terms that ranged between four and 30 years for violence committed during demonstrations last year. Last July, hundreds of Cubans across the country defied the communist-run government and took to the streets to protest chronic shortages and lack of basic freedoms. The Cuban government is now handing out lengthy prison sentences to those who participated. Shortly after the protests started, police and special forces went door to door looking for those who took part. Cuban courts are now trying hundreds of protesters in mass trials that have been criticized by international observers for their lack of transparency and due process.\n\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\n\nSNL star Pete Davidson will no longer fly to space\n\n*Sigh* Some of us were really counting on an epic comedy skit from space.

A Moscow court has extended the arrest of Griner until May 19, according to a Russian state news agency. In 2014, Rezaian was detained in Tehran and spent 544 days in Iran's notorious Evin Prison. He says he sees many parallels between his case and Griner's.\n\nTODAY'S WEATHER\n\nJUST WATCHED Wildfires burn in Texas and severe storms threaten the Southeast Replay More Videos ...

Alex Jones\n\nCourt proceedings against far-right commentator Alex Jones took a dramatic turn Wednesday when a lawyer for two Sandy Hook parents revealed he had recently acquired evidence proving Jones had lied when he claimed under oath that he had never texted about the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting. In another notable moment during cross-examination, Jones was asked whether he had connected the judge overseeing the trial to pedophilia and human trafficking. When Jones denied having done so, lawyers played an Infowars video for the court that featured Jones leveling just such an attack. Jones has been sued by several Sandy Hook families for his relentless peddling of conspiracy theories related to the tragedy. This hearing will determine how much Jones will have to pay one pair of parents who won a default judgment against him earlier this year.\n\n2. January 6\n\nFormer White House counsel Pat Cipollone and former deputy counsel Patrick Philbin have been subpoenaed in the federal criminal probe of the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. Philbin and Cipollone were both key witnesses to former President Donald Trump's actions in the last days of his presidency, and these developments could suggest the Department of Justice's probe could be aiming straight for Trump . This is also significant because, unlike the House probe , the DOJ could bring criminal charges against former Trump administration officials if it sees fit. The probe could also survive a shakeup in November if Republicans win the House and shut down the select committee's investigation.\n\nJUST WATCHED What Toobin says is a 'big deal' development in the Jan. 6 criminal probe Replay More Videos ...

Covid-19\n\nThe CDC is expected to ease its guidance for Covid-19 control as early as this week, which could affect how the virus is handled in schools as a new year begins. A preview of the plans obtained by CNN shows the new recommendations ease quarantine restrictions for infected people and deemphasize social distancing. They also downplay regular screening testing for Covid-19 in schools as a way to monitor the spread of the virus. The recommendations aren't legally binding, so different school districts can still make their own plans, including options like masks. Right now, more than 200 million people -- about 60% of the total population -- live in a county with a \"high Covid-19 community level.\"\n\n4. Taiwan\n\nChina is following through on its promise to punish Taiwan for hosting House Speaker Nancy Pelosi during her congressional visit to Asia this week. The country fired multiple missiles toward waters near northeastern and southwestern Taiwan and has begun exercises that Chinese state media claims simulate an air and sea \"blockade\" around the island. The display has already caused disruption to flight and ship schedules, and is causing unease among nearby powers like Japan. Taiwan, meanwhile, is bracing for further retaliatory attacks from China, which has long laid claim to the self-governing island. The Taiwanese government says it plans to strengthen security against cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns.\n\nJUST WATCHED 'It's clearly intimidation': See what China did after Pelosi left Taiwan Replay More Videos ...

Kyrsten Sinema says she will \"move forward\" with Democrats' sweeping economic package , signaling key support that could give the party enough votes to push the bill through the Senate and on to the House for final approval. The Inflation Reduction Act is much slimmer than President Joe Biden's initial Build Back Better bill, but it would still represent the largest investment in energy and climate programs in US history. It would also extend expiring health care subsidies for three years and give Medicare the power to negotiate prescription drug prices. New taxes would help pay for it all. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer says the final version of the bill will be introduced on Saturday. It will also have to be reviewed by the Senate parliamentarian, who will decide whether the bill is eligible for the filibuster-proof budget process that will allow Democrats to pass it along party lines.\n\n2. Brittney Griner\n\nWNBA star Brittney Griner was sentenced to nine years of jail time by a Russian court after being convicted on Thursday of deliberately smuggling drugs into the country. The case has raised concerns that Griner is being used as a pawn in Russia's war with Ukraine. President Biden called the sentence \"unacceptable\" and said his administration would work to secure Griner's release. Now, Russia has indicated it is ready to discuss a prisoner swap for Griner and another American, Paul Whelan, who has been wrongfully detained in Russia since 2018. There has already been movement in the negotiation process, but that could accelerate in the coming days now that Griner has been sentenced.

Kyle Meany are accused of submitting a false affidavit to search Taylor's home, and conspiring to cover up their actions afterward by creating more false information. Ex-detective Brett Hankison also faces charges. Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency room technician, was shot and killed in her apartment during a flawed forced-entry raid in March of 2020.

However, locals say the peacekeepers have overstayed their welcome, and have failed to rein in the rebel groups or prevent their attacks against civilians. Since the latest wave of unrest, UN peacekeepers in the country have been accused of using violent force against citizens.

During engine bleeds, hydrogen is cycled through the engine to condition it for launch. Three of the four engines were performing as expected, but engine #3 was experiencing an issue. The uncrewed Artemis I mission had been scheduled to lift off today between 8:33 a.m. and 10:33 a.m. ET from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, but several issues cropped up after the rocket began fueling after midnight. The next launch window is September 2. The last crewed landing on the moon, Apollo 17, took place in 1972.\n\n2. Hurricanes\n\nFor the first time in 25 years, the month of August did not have a named storm. But now that September has arrived, things appear to have changed quickly in the tropical Atlantic. On Thursday, the National Hurricane Center announced that Tropical Storm Danielle, currently in the North Atlantic, is expected to strengthen into a hurricane by Saturday. Danielle is not a threat to any land at this time, forecasts show, and it is expected to remain fairly stationary through the weekend. Still, current indications show the early stages of the Atlantic hurricane season have been above average and could begin to pick up.\n\n3. January 6\n\nFormer President Trump said he will “very, very seriously” consider full pardons for the rioters who breached the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, if he runs for reelection and wins. “If I decide to run and if I win, I will be looking very, very strongly about pardons. Full pardons,” Trump said on Wendy Bell Radio Thursday. Trump had made a similar promise during his final days in office when some of the January 6 rioters were already in jail. None, however, were pardoned before he left office. Trump’s comments come amid intense speculation about a potential 2024 presidential run, and his continued invocation of the Capitol attack could preview a central part of his future political messaging.\n\n4. Abortion\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is mobilizing his MAGA allies to defend him ahead of the upcoming public hearings by the House select committee investigating the January 6 insurrection. Trump’s team has asked some prominent Republicans to cover for him and push back on the committee while the public hearings play out, according to GOP sources familiar with the request. Committee members have teased that the prime-time hearings could be focused on Trump’s direct role in undermining the election results. The committee has been working toward a thesis that Trump’s obsession with losing the election and his peddling of false claims about the results is what laid the groundwork for the violent and deadly riot at the Capitol. The first public hearing will take place Thursday at 8 p.m. ET.\n\n5.

January 6\n\nThe House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol was given a letter that said the Secret Service erased text messages the day of the riot and the day leading up to the violence. The letter , obtained by CNN, says the messages were erased \"as part of a device-replacement program\" shortly after they were requested by oversight officials investigating the agency's response to the riot. This comes as the Secret Service has been in the spotlight following testimony describing how then-President Donald Trump angrily demanded that his detail take him to the Capitol following his speech on January 6 -- shortly before rioters breached the building. A police officer in Trump's motorcade has corroborated the details of the heated exchange, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.\n\n2.

The meeting comes as Biden continues to advocate for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, although he says he does not see such an arrangement materializing in the \"near term.\" In a statement, Israel's Prime Minister Yair Lapid said Biden's visit to the Middle East has shown his \"commitment to Israel's military and diplomatic strength\" and had \"moved the entire country.\" A senior administration official said Biden will announce several measures aimed at supporting the Palestinian people, including US aid for hospitals and refugees, as well as efforts to upgrade Gaza and the West Bank to a 4G network.\n\nJUST WATCHED Why Palestinians are pessimistic about Biden's visit Replay More Videos ...

Rajapaksa's departure from office marks a major victory for the protesters, who for months have demanded the removal of both the President and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. Many in Sri Lanka blame Rajapaksa for the country's worsening situation, with runaway inflation and shortages of fuel and food impacting everyday life.

Biden\n\nPresident Joe Biden delivered his sharpest rebuke yet of Republicans during a speech in Philadelphia on Thursday, warning that former President Donald Trump and his closest followers are trying to undermine American democracy. “As I stand here tonight, equality and democracy are under assault,” Biden said in his address – just months ahead of midterm elections that will determine control of Congress. Biden attempted to separate Trump’s most loyal MAGA followers from the Republican Party as a whole and also sought to conclude on a more upbeat note, urging it is still within voters’ power to rein in Trump’s staunchest supporters. This comes as Biden’s recent aggressive rhetoric has drawn the ire of Republicans, particularly after he accused Trump loyalists of “semi-fascism” at a fundraiser last week.\n\n2. Hurricanes\n\nPresident Joe Biden is sending 3,000 US troops to Poland, Germany and Romania to bolster NATO countries in Eastern Europe as tens of thousands of Russian troops amass along Ukraine’s border. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said the deployments included roughly 2,000 troops that would deploy from the United States to Poland and Germany. In addition, approximately 1,000 troops currently based in Germany were moving to Romania.Kirby said the moves, which would happen in the coming days, were not permanent and emphasized, “These forces are not going to fight in Ukraine.” The deployments are a show of support to NATO allies feeling threatened by Russia’s steady military buildup near the Ukrainian border.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 03:52 - Source: CNN 'Not permanent moves': Pentagon discusses European troop deployment\n\n3.

The truckers are a part of the so-called “Freedom Convoy” and are protesting a recent mandate requiring drivers entering Canada to be fully vaccinated or face testing and quarantine requirements. The group is also protesting against other health restrictions, like mask mandates and Covid-19 lockdowns.

President Biden will increase his engagement with Congressional Democrats today, including a meeting with Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, to try and get all the Democratic factions in line. Yesterday, the House also passed a bill to avoid a government shutdown and suspend the US debt limit. The bill is unlikely to pass the Senate, so the country is still approaching a possible shutdown and financial precipice in the coming weeks.\n\n4. Abortion\n\nThe National Archives decided yesterday that it will turn over former Vice President Mike Pence’s records to the committee investigating the January 6 attack on the Capitol as early as next month, after former President Donald Trump said he wanted to keep secret more than 100 documents. This is the first set of records related to Pence’s office that the Archives has cleared for release. The letters reveal tension over what may be key communications about the insurrection at the capitol and Pence overseeing the Electoral College certification in Congress, which Trump wanted to stop. Pence’s team is cooperating with the investigation, officials said. Separately, former Department of Justice official Jeffrey Clark and his attorneys met with the House select committee for nearly two hours yesterday, two months after the panel voted to hold him in contempt for his lack of cooperation.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 01:09 - Source: CNN Former Pence adviser on why Pence needs to be the one to talk to House Jan. 6 committee\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is mobilizing his MAGA allies to defend him ahead of the upcoming public hearings by the House select committee investigating the January 6 insurrection.

Committee members have teased that the prime-time hearings could be focused on Trump’s direct role in undermining the election results. The committee has been working toward a thesis that Trump’s obsession with losing the election and his peddling of false claims about the results is what laid the groundwork for the violent and deadly riot at the Capitol.

Rising concerns about crime and homelessness burst to the forefront in California, as San Francisco voters recalled District Attorney Chesa Boudin . In the Los Angeles mayor's race, Democratic Rep. Karen Bass and real estate developer Rick Caruso will advance to a November runoff. Bass, a longtime Democratic lawmaker who was on President Joe Biden's shortlist for a running mate in 2020, could make history as the first woman and the first Black woman to lead America's second-largest city if elected. Meanwhile, in House primaries across the country, Republicans largely opted to keep their incumbents , rejecting challenges from candidates who attempted to align themselves more closely with former President Donald Trump.\n\n2. Gun laws\n\nA growing number of senators appear to be moving toward a possible deal on gun control legislation -- even though both sides admit there is far more work to do to reach a consensus between Democrats and Republicans on the issue, as any changes to gun laws can be met with stiff GOP resistance . The current changes to gun laws under consideration include hardening school security, providing more funding for mental health care and ensuring that juvenile records can be considered when a person between the ages of 18 and 21 wants to buy a semi-automatic weapon. Federal incentives for states to pass so-called red flag laws are also being discussed. However, despite the ongoing talks, it remains unclear whether there will be enough Republican support to push the legislation forward.\n\nJUST WATCHED Gun owners explain their love of AR-15 style rifles Replay More Videos ...

LOUIS (AP) — Mexican drug cartels are quietly filling the void in the nation's drug market created by the long effort to crack down on American-made methamphetamine, flooding U.S. cities with exceptionally cheap, extraordinarily potent meth from factorylike \"superlabs.\"\n\nAlthough Mexican meth is not new to the U.S. drug trade, it now accounts for as much as 80 percent of the meth sold here, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration. And it is as much as 90 percent pure, a level that offers users a faster, more intense and longer-lasting high.\n\n\"These are sophisticated, high-tech operations in Mexico that are operating with extreme precision,\" said Jim Shroba, a DEA agent in St. Louis. \"They're moving it out the door as fast as they can manufacture it.\"\n\nThe cartels are expanding into the U.S. meth market just as they did with heroin: developing an inexpensive, highly addictive form of the drug and sending it through the same pipeline already used to funnel marijuana and cocaine, authorities said.\n\nSeizures of meth along the Southwest border have more than quadrupled over the last several years. DEA records reviewed by The Associated Press show that the amount of seized meth jumped from slightly more than 4,000 pounds in 2007 to more than 16,000 pounds in 2011.\n\nDuring that same period, the purity of Mexican meth shot up too, from 39 percent in 2007 to 88 percent by 2011, according to DEA documents. The price fell 69 percent, tumbling from $290 per pure gram to less than $90.\n\nMexican meth has a clearer, glassier appearance than more crudely produced formulas and often resembles ice fragments, usually with a clear or bluish-white color. It often has a smell people compare to ammonia, cat urine or even burning plastic.\n\n\"You can look at it and see it has a much more pure look,\" said Paul Roach, a DEA agent in Denver.\n\nThe rise of Mexican meth doesn't mean that American labs have disappeared. The number of U.S. meth labs continues to rise even as federal, state and local laws place heavy restrictions on the purchase of cold and allergy pills containing pseudoephedrine, a major component in the most common meth recipe.\n\nThe crackdowns that began a decade ago have made it harder to prepare large batches, so many American meth users have turned to a simpler method that uses a 2-liter soda bottle filled with just enough ingredients to produce a small amount of the drug for personal use.\n\nBut south of the border, meth is being made on an industrial scale. Sophisticated factories put out tons of the drug using formulas developed by professional chemists. The final product is often smuggled into the U.S. taped beneath tractor-trailers or hidden inside packages of other drugs.\n\nWhile clandestine U.S. labs generally supply rural areas, Mexican meth is mostly targeted to urban and suburban users. Increasingly large quantities are turning up in dozens of American cities, including Dallas, Phoenix, Denver, Chicago, St. Louis and Salt Lake City, according to the DEA.\n\nThe marketing format follows a well-established pattern. By simultaneously increasing the purity and cutting the price, the cartels get people hooked and create a new customer base.\n\n\"They're marketing geniuses,\" said Jack Riley, the agent in charge of the DEA office in Chicago.\n\nWhen Illinois authorities recently confiscated 1,000 pounds of Mexican marijuana, they found 10 pounds of meth hidden among the pot — essentially a free sample for the distributor to give out to drug users, Riley said.\n\nUntil recently, meth was seldom seen in major urban areas, except in biker gangs and parts of the gay community, Riley said.\n\n\"We've never really seen it on the street like we've seen cocaine and heroin,\" Riley said. He worries that if the estimated 180,000 members of street gangs in Chicago get involved in meth trafficking, violence could follow.\n\nLike the U.S., Mexico has tightened laws and regulations on pseudoephedrine, though some labs are still able to obtain large amounts from China and India. To fill the void, cartel chemists have turned to an old recipe known as P2P that first appeared in the 1960s and 1970s in some parts of the western U.S.\n\nThat recipe uses the organic compound phenylacetone. Because of its use in meth, the U.S. government made it a controlled substance in 1980, essentially stopping that form of meth in the U.S. But in Mexico, the cartels can get phenylacetone from other countries, DEA experts said.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2011, 85 percent of lab samples taken from U.S. meth seizures came from the P2P process — up from 50 percent a little more than a year earlier, DEA spokesman Rusty Payne said.\n\nFederal agents say the influx of meth from Mexico illustrates the difficulty of waging a two-front war on the drug in neighboring countries. When one source of the drug is dealt a setback, other suppliers step in to satisfy relentless demand.\n\nConsidering the relatively untapped market of bigger American cities, the rise of Mexican meth is not surprising, said Illinois State University criminologist Ralph Weisheit, a meth expert.\n\n\"It's something that was inevitable,\" Weisheit said. \"This wasn't hard to predict.\"\n\nAmerican authorities are not the only ones taking notice. The sharp spike in meth activity is also evident from the other side of the border. Seizures of labs and chemicals have increased nearly 1,000 percent in the past two years.\n\nLast year, Mexican authorities made two major busts in the quiet central state of Queretaro, seizing nearly 500 tons of precursor chemicals and 3.4 tons of pure meth with a street value of more than $100 million. In Sinaloa, investigators found a sophisticated underground lab equipped with an elevator and ventilation systems as well as cooking and sleeping facilities. The facility was reachable only by a nearly 100-foot tunnel with its opening concealed under a tractor shed.\n\nAnd in February, soldiers in western Mexico made a historic seizure: 15 tons of pure methamphetamine, a haul that could have supplied 13 million doses worth more than $4 billion.\n\nThe meth problem is spilling into other parts of Latin America too. In December and January, Mexican authorities seized nearly 900 tons of precursor chemicals at Mexican ports, almost all of it bound for Guatemala, which seized about 1,600 tons of meth precursors in 2011 — four times the 400 tons seized there a year earlier.\n\nFor now, cocaine remains far and away the cartels' most profitable drug. The RAND Corp. estimates that Mexican traffickers earn $30 billion in annual export revenue from cocaine, $20 billion from heroin, and about $5 billion from meth.\n\nBut cocaine is getting more expensive and less pure. According to the DEA, the price per pure gram of cocaine rose 59 percent from 2007 through September 2011. At the same time, the purity level dropped 25 percent.\n\nCocaine also typically comes from Colombia, meaning Mexican cartels serve as middle men who compete against each other to smuggle it into the U.S. That marginalizes their profits.\n\nBecause methamphetamine is a synthetic drug that the cartels can make for themselves, the profit potential is enormous.\n\n\"It's not plant-based,\" Weisheit said. \"It can be completely produced in Mexico. It's very compact, and that makes it easy to smuggle.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Mark Stevenson in Mexico City and Christopher Sherman in McAllen, Texas, contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2012/10/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/crime/2021/03/31/meth-candles-smuggled-in-us-by-cjng-cartel/7011897002/", "title": "A deadly trick: Mexican cartels sneak meth into US in candles ...", "text": "A violent drug ring based on the West Coast imported candles infused with methamphetamine from Mexico, a method increasingly used by cartels that can lead to fires and explosions across the U.S.\n\nAlleged ring leader Alan Gomez Marentes, 35, and more than a dozen others were arrested in July throughout the Puget Sound region and California and remain jailed while awaiting trial in federal court in Seattle.\n\nThey maintain their innocence on charges of trafficking millions of dollars of meth and heroin supplied by the Cártel Jalisco Nueva Generación, a top U.S. target based in Guadalajara, Mexico.\n\nFederal prosecutors argued against bond, claiming the drug ring is linked to a November 2019 shooting and its members were heard discussing kidnapping plots, according to court records.\n\nDefense attorney Robert Goldsmith, who represents Gomez Marentes, did not return calls this week seeking comment.\n\nInvestigators, led by the Drug Enforcement Administration, intercepted heroin, cocaine, 15 guns and 1,700 suspected fentanyl-laced pills made to mimic OxyContin pain pills — each containing a potential lethal dose.\n\nThey also found 120 pounds of methamphetamine, worth millions on the streets, including the shipments of drug-infused candles.\n\nDrug agents and police are concerned about yet another clever method exploited by Mexican cartels to saturate the U.S. with meth.\n\nThey worry the process of melting the wax, extracting the meth and converting it back to large hardened chunks to package for customers is dangerous — potentially causing fires or explosions.\n\n\"That conversion process almost always involves acetone or some other readily available organic solvent and a heat source, which is a disaster waiting to happen,\" said Ray Donovan, special agent in charge of DEA's New York Field Division.\n\nTraffickers begin by melting the wax and meth into water, causing the drug to separate. They often use myriatic acid or hydrochloric acid.\n\nThey also use acetone and other solvents along with heat to purify the meth.\n\n\"In addition to generating a highly flammable Trojan horse, meth conversion labs create a toxic atmosphere harming everyone around,\" Donovan told The Courier Journal.\n\nNew York agents raided a large conversion lab, set up in a New Jersey warehouse in 2017, before traffickers began to melt the wax.\n\nEven some veteran lawmen were surprised at what they found: a million-dollars worth of meth-infused candles — including several shaped like a red or white penis, encased in plastic wrap and tied with a red satin bow.\n\n\"DEA has seen drugs smuggled in numerous ways: concealed in puppies, lollipops, furniture and produce, but secreting a million dollars’ worth of methamphetamine in wax candles of various shapes is shocking,\" James Hunt, then head of DEA's New York Field Office, said in a news release after the 2017 raid.\n\nMeth became popular decades ago because it offered a quick rush and a jolt of energy, but it also causes paranoia in many users, sometimes leading to violent outbursts. The drug could be made through a simple but volatile process of mixing easy-to-get ingredients, including items on drug store shelves.\n\nHeadlines across the nation about the dangers were common and jarring: \"Fire at suspected meth lab kills three children,\" \"Burns caused by explosions of meth labs taxing hospitals,\" \"Firefighters injured in meth lab fire.\"\n\nThese hazards lessened over the past several years with local labs replaced by purer meth made in Mexican super labs and sneaked into the U.S. by CJNG, the Sinaloa Cartel and their rivals, according to DEA reports. The Courier Journal profiled El Mencho and CJNG in a special report in 2019 that highlighted how the fast-growing cartel made its way into small-town America, including cities across Kentucky.\n\nHowever, the more cartel members today continue to hide the meth in candles, the more traffickers will use conversion labs — reigniting those dangers in the U.S. and beyond.\n\nFather and son charged in drug ring:The rise and fall of a father-son drug ring linked to 4 deaths and the Sinaloa Cartel\n\nIn February, two suspects were charged in Australia after more than $2 million worth of nearly pure meth was found in glass viles hidden in candles in their Sydney homes, according to the New South Wales Police Force website.\n\nThe alleged head of the syndicate has been identified as former Olympic swimmer Scott Miller, 45, who won a silver medal in 1996, according to the newspaper The Australian.\n\n\"The candles looked like normal candles, however they were laced with death and misery,\" Detective Superintendent John Watson, told reporters during a February news conference.\n\nIn another case from February, the National Guard of Mexico intercepted a shipment before it could reach the U.S. They seized 29 candles containing seven kilos of methamphetamine, according to the Mexican news organization CE Noticias Financieras.\n\nThe police raid was in Morelia, a city in Michoacán, the home state of CJNG leader and elusive billionaire fugitive Rúben Oseguera Cervantes, known as \"El Mencho.\"\n\nMore:A ruthless Mexican drug lord’s empire is devastating families with its grip on small-town USA\n\nIn Cincinnati, U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers intercepted a shipment of 11 pounds of meth hidden in religious candles and a decorative box.\n\nMexican traffickers sent a shipment labeled \"candles and crafts\" from San Luis Potosí, a city in central Mexico, to the U.S. headed to a buyer in Dallas, but it never made it to Texas.\n\nInternational mail frequently is inspected at a port of entry and when the package arrived at one in Cincinnati, officers noticed inconsistencies in the density of the candle, according to Customs officials. On July 26, they drilled through the center to find meth embedded in the wax.\n\nThat same day, the officers in Cincinnati found meth in a shipment of dinner plates headed from Mexico City to a home in Rhodes, Australia. The drugs were hidden inside a homemade decorative box made of thick, covered cardboard.\n\nIn the Seattle case, one of the suspected traffickers was shot outside a home used as a meth conversion lab.\n\nJose Elias Barbosa, 35, was shot in the collarbone in November 2019 outside a house near a shopping center in Port Orchard, Washington, 15 miles west of Seattle.\n\nBarbosa didn't tell police who shot him, so no arrests have been made in the incident. However, Barbosa and several others have been charged with drug trafficking.\n\nTraffickers shipped meth candles to a Long Island facility hidden in more than two-dozen boxes, which were later driven to a New Jersey warehouse.\n\nDrug ring members discussed how it would take five days to melt the candles and turn the meth into a crystal form to package and sell, according to a 2017 indictment.\n\nThe group is accused of using the Port Orchard house as a conversion lab. Before the shooting, other alleged drug ring members threatened Barbosa during an argument, assistant U.S. attorneys argued in a court motion.\n\nCartel Midwest 'honey hole':Case shows how Mexican drug cartels turned a Midwest city into their 'honey hole'\n\nProsecutors noted several of the drug ring members traveled back and forth from Mexico to the U.S., even though some had previously been deported.\n\nAgents searched a Mazda used by the alleged traffickers and found two propane tanks, gallons of water, pots and pans, metal spoons and Tupperware, all used to extract the meth from the candles, according to court records.\n\nProsecutors filed a motion this March revealing nearly a dozen more arrests linked to the Gomez Marentes meth case.\n\nFrom the periphery of the heroin and opioid crisis, garnering the national spotlight, meth has quietly resurged more dangerous than ever. Today's meth is different, so even many users don't understand the risks.\n\n\"Methamphetamine (meth) is a powerful, highly addictive drug that causes devastating health effects, and sometimes death, even on the first try,\" health officials warn on the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's website.\n\nMeth on the streets today, dubbed \"ice,\" has a purity often close to 100 percent, much more lethal than the 50 percent purity of local one-pot labs commonplace a decade or more ago.\n\nHigh doses can elevate body temperature to dangerous levels, causing convulsions and overheating major organs, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Meth use also contributes to strokes and heart attacks, even in otherwise healthy young adults.\n\nBut meth-related stroke and heart attack deaths aren't always attributed to drug use. So, health officials say meth doesn't get its share of the blame for the havoc it wreaks.\n\nFor those concerned that a loved one needs help, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration set up a free and confidential national helpline in Spanish and English, 1-800-662-HELP (4357).\n\nReporter Beth Warren: bwarren@courier-journal.com; 502-582-7164; Twitter @BethWarrenCJ.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/03/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/10/21/fbi-cracks-silk-road/2984921/", "title": "How FBI brought down cyber-underworld site Silk Road", "text": "Donna Leinwand Leger\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nSilk Road%27s operator and his customers thought the site was impenetrable\n\nThe feds used both digital and traditional sleuthing\n\nThe site was an online bazaar for drugs%2C guns and porn\n\nCriminals who prowl the cyber-underworld's \"darknet\" thought law enforcement couldn't crack their anonymous trade in illegal drugs, guns and porn. But a series of arrests this month, including the bust of the black market site Silk Road, shows the G-men have infiltrated the Internet's back alley.\n\nComputer experts suspect the government simply beat the cyber-pirates at their own game: hacking.\n\nThe Silk Road website, which has a customer-friendly electronic storefront that displayed bricks of cocaine as deftly as Amazon displays books, was the cyber-underworld's largest black market, with $1.2 billion in sales and nearly a million customers. Beyond illegal drugs, the site served as a bazaar for fake passports, driver's licenses and other documents, as well as illegal service providers, such as hit men, forgers and computer hackers.\n\nFBI Agent Christopher Tarbell of the FBI's cyber-crime unit in New York called Silk Road \"the most sophisticated and extensive criminal marketplace on the Internet today.\"\n\nSilk Road used an underground computer network known as \"The Onion Router\" or \"Tor\" that relays computer messages through at least three separate computer servers to disguise its users. Customers conducted business using a virtual currency called bitcoin. The site repeatedly assured its users that their illegal transactions were wrapped in layers of privacy.\n\nBut the FBI's seizure of Silk Road's servers allowed agents to unwrap the website's innards, exposing the vendors' and customers' private accounts to law enforcement scrutiny.\n\nCourt papers show that federal agents used the full bag of traditional investigatory tricks as well as high-tech cyber-sleuthing to dismantle Silk Road. The site's alleged operator made critical missteps that allowed agents to locate the website and link him to it, court papers show.\n\nFBI, DEA, IRS and Customs agents located six of Silk Road's supposedly off-the-grid computer servers hidden around the world, in places including Latvia and Romania, copied their contents and watched as buyers and sellers completed their illegal transactions. It shut down the website, seized its assets, including 26,000 bitcoins worth about $4 million, and arrested Ross Ulbricht, the alleged operator, in San Francisco on Oct. 1.\n\nThe FBI estimates that Silk Road's operator made $80 million in commissions from the site's users, court papers say.\n\nUlbricht is charged in federal court in New York with money laundering, drug dealing and conspiring to murder a witness. A second indictment filed in a federal court in Baltimore charges Ulbricht with drug dealing and attempting to have a former employee murdered.\n\nUlbrict will be extradited to New York to face the charges. His court-appointed attorney, assistant federal defender Brandon LeBlanc, who said his client denied the charges at a court hearing Oct. 4, did not return phone messages left at his office.\n\nThe investigation into the cyber-underworld swept up suspected drug dealers and buyers in the USA, Britain, Australia and Sweden with alleged ties to Silk Road.\n\n\"These arrests send a clear message to criminals: The hidden Internet isn't hidden, and your anonymous activity isn't anonymous. We know where you are, what you are doing and we will catch you,\" Keith Bristow, director of Britain's National Crime Agency, said after the arrest Oct. 8 of four men for alleged drug offenses.\n\nThe criminals, he said, \"always make mistakes.\"\n\nThe FBI hasn't said how it found Silk Road's servers or compromised them. Members of the FBI's cyber-crimes unit were not available, FBI spokesman Peter Donald said.\n\n\"That is the $64,000 question. They have not explained how they did it,\" says Nicholas Weaver, a researcher at the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley, Calif., who specializes in network security and underground economics.\n\nWeaver suspects from reading the court papers that federal agents found weaknesses in the computer code used to operate the Silk Road website and exploited those weaknesses to hack the servers and force them to reveal their unique identifying addresses. Federal investigators could then locate the servers and ask law enforcement in those locations to seize them.\n\nDREAD PIRATE ROBERTS\n\nAuthorities say Ulbricht started Silk Road on Jan. 27, 2011.\n\nBy then, Ulbricht, 29, who grew up in Austin, had graduated from the University of Texas-Dallas, where he earned a degree in physics in 2006, school records show. He attended graduate school at Penn State, where he earned the prestigious Anne C. Wilson Graduate Research Award for materials science for the 2008-09 academic year, school records show. On his LinkedIn page, he identified himself as an entrepreneur and investor.\n\nStatements Ulbricht made in college and posts he made online show he leaned libertarian. On Facebook in 2010, he posted a page-long essay inspired by Independence Day. \"Always, freedom arises in the absence of limitation,\" he wrote. He embraced Austrian economic theory, whose advocates favor strong protection of private property rights, but minimal economic regulation.\n\nOn Silk Road, federal investigators say, Ulbricht called himself \"Dread Pirate Roberts,\" shortened often to \"DPR.\" The moniker comes from a character in the novel The Princess Bride, depicted as a ruthless pirate who takes no prisoners. Eventually, \"Captain Roberts\" is revealed as a series of people who pass on the \"dread pirate\" alias, and his fearsome reputation, to a successor on retirement.\n\nIn one post to the site, after users complained about a hike in Silk Road commissions, investigators say, Ulbricht wrote, \"Whether you like it or not, I am the captain of this ship. You are here voluntarily, and if you don't like the rules of the game, or you don't trust your captain, you can get off the boat.\"\n\nIn San Francisco, where court papers say he moved in September 2012, Ulbricht lived quietly and cheaply, first bunking with friends, then renting a room for $1,000 a month. He paid in cash. His roommates knew him as \"Josh\" and told authorities he spent a lot of time on his computer.\n\nCourt papers say Ulbricht procured computer hosts for the Silk Road website, wrote most of the computer code and maintained the security on the site by himself.\n\nHOW TOR ENABLED SILK ROAD\n\nCentral to the operation of Silk Road was a complex underground computer routing system known as Tor. Ulbricht allegedly used the system to hide the location of the computer servers that hosted the Silk Road website.\n\nBut Tor is no secret, especially to the U.S. government.\n\nThe U.S. Naval Research Lab developed onion routing, the concept behind Tor, as a way to protect naval communication so an enemy could not trace computer messages and detect a ship's position. Every computer on the Internet has an Internet Protocol, or IP, address that can be used to find its physical location. Tor ensures privacy by randomly routing computer messages through several places on the Internet, wrapped in layers of encryption, so no single point can link the source to the destination.\n\nThe routing system is public and maintained by a non-profit organization that runs on donations from a variety of organizations, including Human Rights Watch, Radio Free Asia, the National Science Foundation and Google. Dissidents in countries that restrict Internet access use Tor to publish out of government reach. Journalists use Tor to communicate with confidential sources. WikiLeaks used Tor to collect documents from whistle-blowers who wanted to remain anonymous. Law enforcement agents use Tor to visit websites without leaving a record of a government computer or IP address in the Web's log.\n\nThough some government agencies may use Tor for their own research or communication, the National Security Agency seeks to unmask anonymous Internet communication, director of National Intelligence James Clapper said in response to documents revealed by fugitive whistle-blower Edward Snowden.\n\n\"The Intelligence Community's interest in online anonymity services and other online communication and networking tools is based on the undeniable fact that these are tools our adversaries use to communicate and coordinate attacks against the United States and our allies,\" Clapper said Oct. 4.\n\nTor also hosts black markets, such as Sheep Marketplace and Black Market Reloaded, that deal in guns, drugs, stolen credit card numbers and child pornography. The United States seeks the extradition of Eric Marques, who was arrested in Ireland for allegedly hosting a website on the Tor network that allowed people to share child pornography.\n\nSilk Road created a private network through Tor by using software to build encrypted connections through relays on the network. The system is created so no single relay, or server, knew the complete path. A computer algorithm on Tor generates a complex Web address that ends in .onion and can be accessed only by downloading Tor software.\n\nOnce logged into Silk Road, buyers and sellers could conduct business in a virtual currency called bitcoin, which, unlike a credit card or a check, leaves little traceable information. Silk Road used a bitcoin tumbler that sent the individual transactions through a complex series of dummy transaction to disguise the link between buyers and sellers.\n\nDEA agents learned of Silk Road within months after it went online. In June 2011, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., called on federal agents to investigate it. Court papers indicate federal agents began making hundreds of undercover purchases from the site in November 2011.\n\nMARKETING A 'SECRET' SITE\n\nTo attract customers and vendors and direct them to the secret site, Silk Road's operator initially had to publicize it on the Web.\n\nOne FBI agent did a simple Internet search and found a post from Jan. 27, 2011, on a forum for people who use magic mushrooms called \"Shroomery\" (www.shroomery.org) in which a user identified as \"altoid\" mentioned Silk Road under the guise of seeking information. The post explained that it's a Tor-hidden service and the address could be found at silkroad420.wordpress.com. \"Altoid\" posted about Silk Road two days later, this time at \"Bitcointalk.org,\" an online discussion forum.\n\n\"Altoid\" posted again Oct. 11, 2011, in \"Bitcoin Forum,\" seeking \"the best and brightest IT pro in the bitcoin community\" to help develop a bitcoin start-up company. This time, the FBI caught a break: \"Altoid\" instructed potential candidates to reply to his Gmail address, rossulbricht@gmail.com.\n\nThe FBI subpoenaed subscriber records from Google for the Gmail address, which was registered to Ulbricht and included a photo that matched a photo of Ulbricht on LinkedIn. His Google profile included YouTube videos from the Mises Institute, an Austrian economic think-tank.\n\nIn his postings on Silk Road's forum, the site operator \"Dread Pirate Roberts' \" signature included a link to the Mises Institute website. \"Dread Pirate Roberts\" often cited Austrian economic theory and the works of Ludwig von Mises as the philosophical underpinning of Silk Road.\n\nThe Google records showed every IP address used to access Ulbricht's Gmail account this year from Jan. 13 to June 20, court papers said. The IP address associated with the Gmail account led to a computer in an apartment on Hickory Street in San Francisco, where Ulbricht had moved in September 2012. The logs indicated Ulbricht accessed his Gmail account from a cafe on Laguna Street, less than 500 feet from the apartment, court papers say.\n\nUltimately, the FBI linked the computer at the Hickory Street apartment and its IP address to code on the Silk Road server that allowed the computer access, court papers say.\n\nThe FBI got insight into Ulbricht's computer code from an undisguised post on a computer programming website. On March 5, 2012, Ulbricht opened an account under his own name on stackoverflow.com, posted 12 lines of computer code and sought advice for fixing a coding problem. Realizing his error, he quickly deleted his real name and changed his user name to \"frosty\" and his e-mail to frosty@frosty.com.\n\nForensic analysts found a revised version of the same code on the Silk Road website, court papers say. The analysis also found encryption keys that end with \"frosty@frosty.\"\n\nTHE STING\n\nThe FBI used one of its tried and true techniques: the sting.\n\nAn FBI agent went undercover in 2012 posing as a drug dealer who wanted to do business on Silk Road. The agent e-mailed \"Dread Pirate Roberts,\" directly seeking help finding a buyer for a kilogram of cocaine. Ulbricht allegedly instructed one of his employees to help. The alleged buyer, who turned out to be the employee, deposited $27,000 in bitcoins in a Silk Road account and arranged a shipment to his home. Federal agents arrested the employee, who is not named in court papers.\n\nOn Jan. 26, the FBI says in court papers, Ulbricht e-mailed the undercover agent to say the employee had been arrested and had stolen funds from other Silk Road users. He allegedly asked the agent to have the employee beaten up and forced to return the money.\n\nThe next day, Ulbricht allegedly asked the FBI agent to have the employee killed because \"now that he's been arrested, I'm afraid he'll give up info.\" The FBI says Ulbricht agreed to pay $80,000 for the hit and on Feb. 4 wired $40,000 from Technocash Limited in Australia to a bank account at Capital One in Washington. Ulbricht deposited another $40,000 after the undercover agent e-mailed him staged photographs of the killing, court papers say.\n\nThat case, filed in May and unsealed with Ulbricht's arrest Oct. 1, charges Ulbricht with a drug dealing conspiracy and attempted murder of a witness.\n\nBy July 23, investigators had located at least one of Silk Road's servers in a foreign country, which the FBI has not identified. IP addresses listed in court papers are linked to servers in Iceland, Latvia and Romania, according to Internet registries. Once the FBI found the server, it executed a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty request that allowed law enforcement in that country to make a copy of the Silk Road server and give it to the FBI. The snapshot gave the FBI records of 1.2 million transactions from Feb. 6, 2011, to July 23 and all of the site operator's e-mail exchanges.\n\nHow the FBI located a Silk Road server remains a mystery. Computer experts don't know for sure how federal investigators defeated a system that most people, including Ulbricht, thought impenetrable. Jerry Brito, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University with expertise in technology regulation, says many experts have speculated that the FBI has identified a flaw, or back door, in the Tor system that computer experts have missed.\n\nMore likely, Brito says, the FBI compromised Silk Road by bypassing the website's security through weaknesses in Ulbricht's computer code, hacking into the site and issuing computer commands that allowed it to act like the site's administrator and talk to the server. The FBI's computer experts knew from the posts on the computer programmer forum that Ulbricht had coding challenges.\n\n\"We know he was not the most proficient coder in the world,\" Brito said. \"It's very easy, if you are a novice programmer, to do things that you're not aware of that can compromise security.\"\n\nSILK ROAD UNRAVELS\n\nFederal investigators also had a stroke of luck. On July 10, as part of a routine search at the Canadian border, customs agents intercepted a package of nine fake IDs. Each of the IDs had different names, but the same picture of Ulbricht. E-mail exchanges found on the Silk Road server indicate \"Dread Pirate Roberts\" had sought IDs in June from several Silk Road vendors so he could rent servers under an assumed name to buttress Silk Road's reliability.\n\nOn July 26, three days after federal investigators located one of Silk Road's servers, investigators from Homeland Security paid Ulbricht a visit at his San Francisco apartment.\n\nCourt papers say Ulbricht refused to answer any questions when investigators confronted him with the fake IDs, except to point out that \"'hypothetically' anyone could go onto a website named 'SilkRoad' on Tor and purchase any drugs or fake identity documents the person wanted.\"\n\nOn Oct. 1, federal agents waited until Ulbricht logged into his computer before sweeping in to the Glen Park branch of the San Francisco Public Library to arrest him, making it easier for agents to simply plug in a thumb drive and download everything on the computer without having to break his passwords.\n\nThe agents found the alleged Dread Pirate Roberts in the science fiction section.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/10/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/08/30/two-headed-turtle-quake-off-oregon-hungry-sharks-and-gators-news-from-around-our-50-states/40046419/", "title": "50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nFairhope: Gov. Kay Ivey said Wednesday that a proposed Mobile Bay toll bridge is “dead” after Baldwin County officials took a decisive stand against the controversial proposal to build one of the nation’s largest bridges. The Eastern Shore Metropolitan Planning Organization voted 8-1 on Wednesday night to remove the bridge from the area’s transportation plan. The project must be in the plan detailing the region’s transportation priorities to qualify for federal funding. The planning group’s decision came after a four-hour meeting in which some residents in Baldwin County expressed outrage over the tolls that could cost up to $6 each way. They described how the cost would make it a struggle to travel to jobs or care for aging relatives on the opposite side of the bay. The crowd applauded after the vote, according to video streamed by news outlets. The proposed Interstate 10 bridge across the Mobile River and Mobile Bay would have spanned about 10 miles and soared hundreds of feet above the water near downtown. State officials had said the tolls were needed to finance the proposed $2.1 billion bridge.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A state regulatory agency has proposed changes that would limit activities at city breweries and distilleries. The Juneau Empire reported Tuesday that the Alaska Alcoholic Beverage Control Board has proposed changes to a state statute that would further prohibit onsite activities at alcohol manufacturing businesses. Officials said the regulation includes prohibiting breweries and distilleries from allowing festivals, games and competitions, classes, public parties, presentations or performances and other social gatherings advertised to the general public. Officials said a regulation draft was discussed in June 2018, and the change being considered is a revised proposal. Some owners oppose the changes saying it prohibits them from creating a new social space for the community. Officials said the plan is open to public comment through Oct. 4.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:Severe weather roared back into the Phoenix area Wednesday night, bringing heavy rain to some areas, mostly on the Valley’s east side, along with wind, dust and lightning, which apparently triggered numerous tree fires. As of 9:30 p.m., the Phoenix Fire Department’s fire dispatch board showed more than 20 tree fire calls, most of them in the north or east Phoenix and Scottsdale, as storms converged into that area. In addition, at least three house fires in Phoenix were caused by lightning strikes. The National Weather Service said on Twitter that some of the storms were moving west and expected to converge over central or northern Phoenix as the night progresses. The storms began building late afternoon in areas of Gila County as they moved west through northwest Pinal County toward Maricopa County. Outflows from the storms began pushing their way into the far southeast Valley. The storms arrive amid one of the drier monsoon seasons in the Phoenix area in recent years. As of Wednesday, just .27 of an inch of rain had officially been recorded at Sky Harbor International Airport.\n\nArkansas\n\nHelena-West Helena: Authorities said a nearly seven-hour standoff at a home ended when state troopers shot and killed an armed man suspected of killing two women who were found dead in the front yard earlier that day. The State Police identified the man killed Tuesday night as 37-year-old Raymond Lewis Williams Jr. and the slain women as 40-year-old Christine Fulmer and 28-year-old Deanna Thomas Banks. Police said the women were found dead Tuesday in the front yard of Williams’ home in Helena-West Helena, about 100 miles east of Little Rock. The city’s police chief, James Patrick Smith, told Memphis, Tennessee, television station WMC that investigators believe Williams shot them before barricading himself inside. State Police said troopers tried to communicate with Williams for hours before they used tear gas in the home. They say Williams emerged from the home with a rifle and a shootout ensued, resulting in Williams’ death.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Coast Guard officials said they have seized $38.5 million worth of cocaine from suspected drug smugglers in the eastern Pacific Ocean. The crew of the Coast Guard Cutter Robert Ward and another cutter recovered more than 2,800 pounds of pure, uncut cocaine in their latest busts. The Robert Ward returned to the Port of Los Angeles on Thursday after 50 days patrolling the coast off Central and South America. Authorities believe cartels have been smuggling the narcotics and said seizing the cocaine will save lives because the drugs won’t reach the streets.\n\nColorado\n\nBoulder: City officials are moving forward with plans to ban the sale of flavored electronic cigarette products containing nicotine. The Daily Camera reported the City Council on Wednesday also completed plans to raise the minimum purchasing age to 21 for tobacco and nicotine products. Only tobacco-flavored vaping products will be allowed under the new rules. The city will also ask voters on the November ballot to approve a 40% sales tax on e-cigarette products. The town of Carbondale earlier this week also banned the sale of flavored e-cigarette and tobacco products. The town will require tobacco retailers to be licensed, and it will raise the minimum purchasing age to 21.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A report predicts a major increase in demand for home care for older residents and people with disabilities. The analysis was conducted by Mercer Human Services Consulting, a firm retained by the Department of Social Services to help plan for future Medicaid-funded services. It projects the growing demand for alternatives to institutional care will lead to excess capacity in nursing homes, reducing need by nearly 6,000 beds by 2040. Office of Policy and Management Secretary Melissa McCaw said Connecticut has been “moving in the right direction on long-term care for a number of years,” including various Medicaid-funded services to help people live at home. McCaw said the state must “continue to adapt” and make sure policies also address excess capacity at nursing facilities, which will still be needed.\n\nDelaware\n\nNew Castle: Authorities found no evidence of hazardous chemicals or substances at a bank that was evacuated after five people complained of headaches and a strong chemical smell. New Castle County Emergency Management coordinator Dave Carpenter Jr. told The News Journal of Wilmington that the manager of the PNC Bank in New Castle evacuated the building early Monday after the people developed headaches. Hazmat teams from local agencies and the state Department of Natural Resources responded to the scene. Carpenter said state and local authorities said they didn’t detect any harmful substances in the bank. No one was hospitalized, and state authorities said they planned to retest the building to determine the source of the strong chemical smell. It’s unclear if they found the source.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Two D.C., agencies knew a row house that appeared to be illegally rented had “life safety violations” for months before a fire killed two tenants last week. City Administrator Rashad M. Young told reporters Tuesday a police officer complained about the home to the city and fire department in March, prompting a city inspector to visit it. He said the inspector never gained entry and contacted the home’s owner, but neither agency fully probed the officer’s complaint. Four workers from the agencies are now on leave. The U.S. attorney’s office is investigating. The officer’s complaint “strongly recommended” inspectors investigate an apparently unlicensed rooming house with possible fire code violations. Authorities have said the house contained a deadly mixture of broken smoke detectors, narrow halls and barred exits.\n\nFlorida\n\nNew Smyrna Beach: Authorities said a surfer caught air on a wave and landed on a shark that, in turn, bit him on the hand and calf. Donald Walsh told The Daytona Beach News-Journal that he had been surfing at New Smyrna Beach for several hours Tuesday when he decided to try going airborne before leaving for the day. Ocean Rescue Capt. Tamra Malphurs said that’s when Walsh landed on the 6.5-foot shark in waist-deep water and suffered cuts that weren’t considered life-threatening. Walsh, 40, said he didn’t see the shark below him as he landed in the water, but the shark’s bite brought it into focus. Walsh said he will be back in the water as soon as his wounds heal a bit.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAugusta: A kayaker said he could only think of paddling faster after realizing he wasn’t alone in a pond. Bo Storey told WRDW-TV, “I just paddled and paddled. …” on Monday to get away from a 10-foot, 360-pound alligator that got as close as 5 feet from the back of his kayak. News outlets reported Richmond County deputies received a call from Storey saying he was being chased by the behemoth. Storey was practicing for a bass fishing tournament. Deputies arrived on the scene and wrestled the massive gator with help from hunter Trey Durant and his friend Robby Amerson. The alligator was clearly not afraid of humans and was deemed a nuisance so it was legally killed by Durant.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The reopening of the USS Arizona Memorial has been scheduled for Labor Day weekend following a 15-month closure. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported Wednesday that walk-on access to the memorial will begin Sunday. A malfunction with the concrete dock’s anchoring system forced the closure of the memorial to foot traffic beginning in May 2018. Exceptionally high tides in 2017 are believed to have dislodged concrete blocks sunk into the sediment of Pearl Harbor and connected by chains to the dock. Park employees last week installed a visitor ramp for walk-on visits to the 105-foot floating dock and reinstalled the memorial’s bridge spanning 30 feet and weighing 4 tons. Officials said the repair project has cost more than $2.1 million.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gallagher, a comedian known for smashing fruit and vegetables with giant wooden hammers, said he was escorted out of Idaho’s Statehouse when he entered the building carrying two of the hammers. Gallagher told the Idaho Statesman in a story Wednesday that he was looking for the state’s film office on Monday for a possible project. The state doesn’t have a film office. A person who answered the phone at the state agency that provides security said Wednesday that no one was available to comment. The 73-year-old comedian who rose to fame in the 1980s said he’s in Boise to scout locations for a film about an ancient poet. He also said he would like to build a retirement project in the area where old celebrities could live among regular folks.\n\nIllinois\n\nArlington Heights: The owner of Arlington International Racecourse has announced the company will not seek a license to add casino gambling at the track. Churchill Downs CEO Bill Carstanjen on Wednesday said state law requiring the track to dedicate a portion of casino earnings to racing purses makes placing casino games at the suburban Chicago track untenable. Carstanjen noted Arlington would enter the gambling market with a tax rate that would be approximately 17.5% to 20% higher than the existing Chicago-area casinos because of contributions to the thoroughbred purse account. Churchill Downs also owns a majority interest in Rivers Casino in nearby Des Plaines. Carstanjen also said horse racing at Arlington is guaranteed until 2021, after which the company might move to a track at another location in Illinois. The Illinois Thoroughbred Horsemen’s Association said the decision on casinos by Churchill Downs means the company is snubbing the men and women of thoroughbred horse racing.\n\nIndiana\n\nMadison:The Ku Klux Klan is planning a second annual “kookout” in Madison for Saturday, an event that was met last year with hundreds of protesters. The group plans to hold the event at Jaycee Park from 1-3 p.m. on Saturday on the riverfront, according to an event flier. The flyer for the event reads “Make America Safe! Make America Drug Free! Make America White! Make America Great! Take a Stand!!! Join the Klan!!!” And at the bottom of the page, “Never! Never! Apologize for Being White!” About 300 people protested last year’s event, saying the Klan’s message was divisive and not welcome in their town. Residents from surrounding towns have said they don’t want to be associated with the KKK. After World War I, Indiana was a platform for the “most powerful Ku Klux Klan,” according to the Indiana State Library’s website. Madison, named after the country’s fourth president, is about an hour’s drive northeast from Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nIowa\n\nClive:City officials now know what caused a portion of Walnut Creek to turn bright green. A water sample collected on Tuesday showed traces of cyanobacteria, which can produce the cyanotoxin microcystin, a news release said Thursday. However, the sample collected was within the allowable range for safe water recreation. The concentration of the microcystin was 2.9 ug/L. The Iowa Department of Natural Resources posts beach advisories for concentration levels greater than 20 ug/L and the Environmental Protection Agency's Health Advisory Level is 8 ug/L. Because the bloom is ongoing and there could be areas in the water where microcystin are more concentrated, the city recommends people and pets stay out of the discolored water until the algae bloom subsides.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: The Lawrence Humane Society has trapped the first feral cats under a program designed to manage the wild cat population. The Community Cat Program traps, neuters and vaccinates feral cats and returns them to the areas where they were found. As part of the program, the shelter clips the ear of a cat when it’s neutered so animal control will not pick it up again. Kirk Putman, the Humane Society’s interim director, said that the shelter trapped a total of 15 cats in two separate efforts in the last week. The organization is asking for volunteers and donations to help with the program. Previously, the city had not allowed cats to roam free. The Lawrence Journal-World reported the program went into effect May 1, despite opposition from some citizens.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A U.S. sailor from Kentucky who died at Pearl Harbor will be buried in his hometown this fall. The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency said 25-year-old Navy Machinist’s Mate 1st Class Ulis C. Steely of Corbin was assigned to the USS Oklahoma battleship when it was attacked by Japanese aircraft on Dec. 7, 1941. He was among 429 crewmen killed. Most of the remains were not identified at the time. Unidentified remains have been buried in Hawaii. The agency said in 2015 it exhumed unknown remains from the USS Oklahoma for analysis. Using dental and anthropological analysis, as well as DNA, Steely’s remains were identified last fall. Gov. Matt Bevin’s office said he would order flags lowered to half-staff in Steely’s honor on Oct. 5, the date of his funeral.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The police department has authorized a minor uniform change as the city prepares for an annual festival of gay culture in the French Quarter. A department news release said that some officers will be sporting “Pride Edition Badges” during Southern Decadence, which began Thursday and runs through the Labor Day weekend. The special badge is designed like the department’s traditional badge, a star framed by a crescent. But this star is rainbow-striped. The department said the badge was introduced in June to mark Pride Month when it was made available as an option for officers to purchase and wear. It can be worn again during the weekend Southern Decadence Festival. The department said it will also be an option during future Pride Month and Southern Decadence celebrations.\n\nMaine\n\nWaldoboro: Fishery regulators are postponing a round of meetings with lobstermen in the state aimed at preparing for potential new restrictions designed to protect endangered whales. Department of Marine Resources spokesman Jeff Nichols said the department hasn’t set dates yet for any new meetings. The meetings were set to start in September. A federal government team called for the removal of many vertical trap lines from the Gulf of Maine to reduce risk to North Atlantic right whales, which number about 400. The state held a series of meetings with lobstermen about the new rules earlier this year. The last took place in late June. Nicholas said the commissioner wants to do another review of right whale and lobster industry data before presenting a plan about the next steps to the industry.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: City officials have decided to use $6 million in park and public facility funds to help pay for the recovery of a ransomware attack that crippled the city for weeks. The Baltimore Sun reported the city’s spending panel voted Wednesday to use the funds for recovery and “hardening of the environment.” A May ransomware attack on city computer servers is estimated to have cost Baltimore about $18.2 million in restoration costs and delayed or lost revenue. The attack came about a year after one hit Baltimore’s 911 system. Mayor Bernard C. Young has said Baltimore might purchase insurance against hackers. The spending panel delayed a vote Wednesday on an $835,000 contract for $20 million in cyber liability coverage. Young said the two panel members need to be briefed on the proposal.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The governors of five East Coast states, including Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, are urging federal regulators not to put any additional roadblocks in the way of the country’s nascent offshore wind industry. The governors of Massachusetts, Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire and Virginia said in a letter Tuesday to Interior Secretary David Bernhardt and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross that offshore wind power will help strengthen America’s energy independence while creating thousands of jobs. The group said they’re disappointed by a recent decision to delay final permitting of the planned 84-turbine Vineyard Wind project. The group urged federal overseers to give the project a green light by next March. An Interior Department spokeswoman said the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management is working to develop a permitting timeline for the project.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: State regulators and Native American tribes are temporarily removing juvenile lake sturgeon from two Michigan rivers to protect them from chemical treatments targeting sea lampreys. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service treats rivers in the Great Lakes region to kill invasive lampreys. It doesn’t harm most fish. But when the treatments are applied in the Big Manistee and Muskegon rivers, lake sturgeon are at risk. Over the next two months, the Little River Band of Ottawa Indians and the Gun Lake Tribe will join the state Department of Natural Resources to catch juvenile sturgeon and keep them in rearing facilities until the treatments are completed. Afterward, they’ll be released. During the last sea lamprey treatment on the Big Manistee River three years ago, 117 lake sturgeon were collected and released.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud:Clean-up after a July fire at St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Catholic School will delay the start of the school year. “The turnaround time is just not fast enough,” said Kelly Vangsness, principal at the south side parochial school. The first day of school was scheduled for Aug. 26, but in early August, the administration pushed the first day to Sept. 4, which is the first day of school for most students in the St. Cloud school district. Continued clean-up has delayed the first day – again – to Monday, Sept. 9, Vangsness said Tuesday. The school was damaged by a July 4 fire that started in a light fixture that had been updated with LED bulbs, according to St. Cloud police. No one was inside the building at the time and the fire was isolated to the vestibule area and adjoining hallway, including the ceiling above that area. Painting and carpet installation is expected to be completed by Sept. 4, Vangsness said, but the administration is waiting for the installation of the fire system and for state officials to sign off on an asbestos abatement.\n\nMississippi\n\nOxford: The University of Mississippi said it’s moving ahead with plans to transfer a Confederate soldier monument from its central location on campus to a spot near a secluded Confederate cemetery. In an email sent to students, faculty and staff, interim Chancellor Larry Sparks wrote that the university submitted plans Tuesday to take down, move and reassemble the monument. The Mississippi Department of Archives and History must review and approve the university’s plans. College Board trustees, who govern Mississippi’s eight public universities, must also approve the move. Sparks agreed in March to calls from faculty, students and staff to move the marble soldier and base from near the school’s historic heart. The monument has stood sentry there since 1906, when the United Daughters of the Confederacy commissioned it. The monument is 29 feet tall and weighs 40,000 pounds. Plans call for moving it outside a cemetery in a less prominent area of the campus that holds graves of Confederate soldiers killed in the battle of Shiloh. A new concrete walkway would be built leading to the cemetery, with the monument installed along with it.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Commuters who prefer to cross the Mississippi River on the Martin Luther King Bridge will have to wait quite a while longer for the bridge to reopen. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that flooding this spring and summer has delayed a construction project on the bridge that closed in August of last year. It was originally expected to reopen this fall. Now, according to the Illinois Department of Transportation, the bridgework won’t be complete until next summer. IDOT spokesman Guy Tridgell said the flooding impacted train routes. He said the diverted trains were rerouted to tracks under the bridge project, preventing IDOT from being able to safely remove a section of the existing bridge. The construction work is on the Illinois side.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A fire burning in grass and shrubs northwest of Billings has led to the evacuation of about 15 residences near the community of Molt. The Billings Gazette reported the fire started Wednesday and had burned up to an estimated 15 square miles by Thursday morning. Yellowstone County Commissioner Dennis Pitman said residents were watching the fire Wednesday night when the wind changed direction, sending the flames toward homes and prompting the evacuations. No structures have been damaged and fire crews were protecting homes. The cause of the fire is still under investigation.\n\nNebraska\n\nSpencer: Drinking water is being restored in Boyd County after a disastrous flood washed out a water main in March. The Omaha World-Herald reported that workers began installing a new pipe beneath the Niobrara River on Tuesday. Boyd County Rural Water District officials said water could be provided to Spencer, Lynch, Anoka and nearby farms in about two weeks. Potable water will not be available until testing and sanitation work is complete. The district has provided no timeline. The water district has refurbished three irrigation wells to provide water temporarily for showering, washing and toilets, and it has been distributing free bottled water. Rex Black, the water district board chairman, said restoring water service will cost about $2 million. The Federal Emergency Management Agency will cover 75% of that.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A Las Vegas-area teachers’ union has struck a teacher pay deal Wednesday with the country’s fifth-largest school district that organizers said will avert a threatened strike Sept. 10. Members of the Clark County Education Association threatened to walk off the job next month over a dispute about paying teachers more for continuing education. Union leaders and the Clark County School District announced at a news conference late Wednesday that the district will fund the salary increase for continuing education, in addition to honoring a commitment for 3% raises and more money for health insurance. The deal came days after the school district filed an emergency court motion to block the strike and have a judge issue an order against it. If the order was imposed, the striking union could have faced fines of up to $50,000 a day. The deal still needs to be ratified by the union’s executives and the school district’s trustees, but both sides say they expect that will happen soon.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nNew Castle Island: Some residents are protesting a plan to recruit archers to kill as many as 20 deer on New Castle Island. News outlets are reporting that nearly 2,000 residents have signed a petition opposing the plan proposed by condo managers of Wentworth by the Sea to stop deer from eating private gardens. Residents estimated there are about 24 deer total on the island. They said they like the animals and don’t want them killed. The Portsmouth Herald reported that some residents said the plan is not a hunt but “a kill” because the archers will take aim from tree stands while the deer feed. The condo association hasn’t responded to requests for comment.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nEwing Township: The state has honored a team that competed in the Little League World Series after winning the state and Mid-Atlantic championships. Gov. Phil Murphy and State Police Superintendent Col. Patrick Callahan hosted the Elmora Troopers and their families Thursday at the State Police Museum in Ewing. Elizabeth’s Elmora Youth League team is named in honor of Trooper Thomas Hanratty, who was struck and killed during a traffic stop in 1992. Hanratty played baseball for the league and players wear a patch with his badge number. The Troopers were knocked out of the double-elimination Little League World Series tournament last week by a team from Louisiana that went on to win the championship.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nRoswell: Investigators have determined a fireworks explosion that killed a firefighter and severely injured another was accidental. Roswell firefighters were packaging fireworks on June 5 for the city’s Independence Day celebration when the explosion happened, the Roswell Daily Record reported Wednesday. The city’s fire department has organized the event in recent years. The blast led to the death of Jeff Stroble, 46, on July 21. Hoby Bonham, 36, was sent home from the hospital in late June. Ten other firefighters were treated for minor injuries. The firefighters were handling the fireworks inside a concrete building at the Roswell International Air Center. They were fusing aerial shell fireworks with electric matches when one went off, the report from the state fire marshal’s office states. Investigators from state agencies and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives assisted in the investigation. The city declined to comment.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The second span of the new Kosciuszko Bridge between Brooklyn and Queens has opened to traffic. The span opened early Thursday. A ceremony on Wednesday night included a light show with music from Billy Joel via satellite from Madison Square Garden. The bridge features five Queens-bound traffic lanes and four Brooklyn-bound lanes, as well as a 20-foot-wide pedestrian and bicycle pathway. A 7-acre site beneath the bridge in Brooklyn will be turned into a public space and park. The first part of the new bridge was completed in April 2017. The $873 million project is the first major bridge built in New York City since the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge in 1964. The original Kosciuszko Bridge opened in 1939.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A man’s body has been exhumed from a gravesite on a court order after a funeral home discovered it mistakenly sold the same plot twice. WRAL reported Kizzie Sewell bought a plot at Montlawn Cemetery in Raleigh for her husband, Winfred Barnes, upon his death in 2014. But last year, Sewell said Montlawn informed her they realized they had sold her husband’s plot to another customer who started paying for it six months before Barnes was buried there. On Wednesday, Barnes’ body was dug up after five years in the plot. A judge ruled the man with the original contract was entitled to the site. Montlawn said in a statement to the outlet that they abided by the court order.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe filed a motion Wednesday to intervene on a proposed expansion of the Dakota Access pipeline that would double the line’s capacity. The tribe, which led original opposition to the crude oil pipeline, petitioned for status as an intervenor in the case before the Public Service Commission arguing its “interests … are not adequately represented.” North Dakota regulators have set a Nov. 13 public hearing on the proposed expansion. The public hearing, which was requested by the tribe and the Sierra Club, will be held in the south-central city of Linton, near where a pump station would go in to increase the line’s capacity.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati:Cincinnati Metro could be out of the streetcar business by New Year’s Day. On Wednesday, City Manager Patrick Duhaney released a 25-page “Cincinnati Streetcar Transition Plan” that details the timeline and who will be responsible for what during the separation. The target date is “on or around” Jan. 1, according to the plan. The separation is expected to cost around $553,000, which would come from the streetcar’s budget. As is, the Cincinnati Bell Connector has a complicated management structure. The city owns it, but Metro oversees it. Metro, in turn, contracts with a private company called Transdev to run the streetcar day-to-day. With the divorce, the city would take over complete management of the streetcar, cutting out Metro as a middleman. Transdev would carry on with day-to-day operations. The city administration is expected to present its financial plan for the separation during a city council meeting on Sept. 4.\n\nOklahoma\n\nWebber Falls: One of two runaway barges that crashed into a dam and sank on top of the other in the Arkansas River has been removed from the dam. The barges carrying a total of about 3,800 pounds of fertilizer sank May 23 after crashing into the lock and dam at Webbers Falls, about 70 miles southeast of Tulsa. They had broken free from their mooring at the Port of Muskogee during historic spring flooding that waterlogged much of the Midwest down into Arkansas. Port manager Fred Taylor said Tuesday it could take several weeks to completely remove both barges, which are to be used for scrap. The McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System runs from Tulsa to the Mississippi River and has been closed to barge traffic since the flooding began.\n\nOregon\n\nCoos Bay: A 6.3-magnitude earthquake struck Thursday off the Oregon coast but did not generate a tsunami or cause any damage or injuries, authorities said. The epicenter of the quake, which hit just after 8 a.m., was located about 150 miles from land at a depth of 7 miles in the Pacific Ocean. The quake was caused by slipping along an offshore fault called the Blanco Fracture Zone and has nothing to do with the more well-known Cascadia fault, which is believed to be overdue for a major earthquake in the Pacific Northwest, said Paul Bodin, manager of the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network at the University of Washington. The event is also unrelated to a cluster of “episodic slips” along the Cascadia tectonic plate boundary that have been releasing energy across the coastal Pacific Northwest over the past week to 10 days, he said. Those slips are not felt by humans but have been picked up by monitoring devices around the Olympic Peninsula in northwest Washington state and also stretching from Eugene to the Siskiyou Mountains along the Oregon-California border, according to the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: State officials are hoping to lower the risk of lead poisoning through mandated blood testing for children and other measures. Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf is backing legislation to require testing that meets federal guidelines and is rolling out other strategies to address the problem. The administration is working on ways for regional response teams to care for children with dangerous amounts of lead in their system. There are also proposals to train more people in remediating lead and to provide more resources online about lead poisoning, testing and remediation. Officials said about 3 in 10 children in the state have been tested for lead exposure, and just under 5% had elevated lead levels.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Residents are facing about an 8% hike in their electricity bills beginning in October after state regulators approved a rate increase. WPRI-TV reported that the cost increase affects National Grid’s residential electricity customers, who on average will pay about $9 more per month for at least the next six months. The Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission, which decides whether to approve or deny rate changes, also approved rate increases for commercial and industrial customers on Wednesday. The higher costs are typical during the winter months when generating electricity becomes more expensive. The commission’s decision was made without objection or controversy.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nHilton Head Island: A group that monitors sea turtles has reported finding a two-headed loggerhead hatchling. News outlets reported Sea Turtle Patrol Hilton Head Island said the hatchling was found alive Tuesday and released into the ocean. The group’s leader, marine biologist Amber Kuehn, said a genetic mutation caused the second head on the turtle, since named Squirt and Crush. The group shared a picture of the turtle on Facebook on Wednesday that showed the creature’s small body partially eclipsed by a gloved hand. The post wished the turtle good luck. Kuehn said Crush and Squirt couldn’t really swim, as the heads controlled separate flippers and weren’t working together.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Gov. Kristi Noem and Oglala Lakota County school officials plan to partner on building the first local public high school on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Noem said Thursday that building a career and technical education high school in Oglala Lakota County “will bolster the area’s workforce” and “empower students with real-life skills and career opportunities.” The school district serves 22 communities and operates from virtual locations that can serve 50 to 250 students at a time. The only other high schools on the reservation are private or federal Bureau of Indian Education schools. District superintendent Anthony Fairbanks said building a physical high school will “create a launchpad for our students’ career development.” The school is scheduled to open in August 2020 and enroll about 400 students.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Former Gov. Bill Haslam isn’t ruling out a future run for office, though he said he isn’t planning on it. During an event alongside former GOP Sen. Bob Corker, Haslam said he would be sad if he never serves in some kind of public role again. Haslam told reporters it was a hard decision, but the right one, not to run to replace retiring Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander in 2020. President Donald Trump tweeted last month that former Ambassador to Japan Bill Hagerty would launch a Senate bid and endorsed him. Haslam said he’s “really excited” about the presumed Republican run by Hagerty, Haslam’s ex-economic development commissioner. Corker said he wants to let the race evolve, saying he’s friends with Hagerty and trauma surgeon Manny Sethi, another Republican who has launched a campaign.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: A nonprofit that advocates for children said the rate of student suspensions has fallen by nearly a third since the state implemented a law barring suspensions except in extreme circumstances. The 2017 Texas law permits suspensions for major violations such as assault or bringing a weapon or drugs to school. The Dallas Morning News reported that Texas public schools suspended more than 101,000 students in prekindergarten to second grade during the 2015-16 school year. Texans Care for Children released a report Wednesday revealing that those figures dropped by 31% to 70,197 in the 2017-18 school year. Youngsters in foster care, black children and those in special education are more likely to be suspended.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: State officials are unveiling a gun safety program aimed at preventing accidental shootings that will be optional for schools. The program had been mandated three years ago by state lawmakers who have consistently rejected gun-control measures. Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes said Thursday at a news conference that the program avoids the politically sensitive issues of gun policy and instead acknowledges that many children are bound to come across guns in a state where an estimated 4 in 10 households have a firearm. Utah is also one of several states that allow teachers with concealed carry permit holders to carry guns in schools. The program features a 5-minute video and would be taught to children in 5th through 12th grades by law enforcement officers who already work with students. School districts will have to approve the course, and parents will have to provide written permission.\n\nVermont\n\nOrange: A farmer said most of the 250 pigs that escaped from his fenced-in area earlier this month are back. Walter Jeffries of Sugar Mountain Farm in Orange said Thursday the fence has been fixed. Jeffries said roughly 50 adults and 200 piglets escaped after fencing was damaged by vandals. He said 99% of the pigs have been wrangled. He and workers placed a trail of hamburger and hot dog buns to lure the stragglers. Agriculture Secretary Anson Tebbetts said his agency provided Jeffries guidance on how to remedy the problem.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A power company is launching an initiative to provide electric school buses to school districts in Virginia. Dominion Energy said in a statement Thursday that electric buses will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and save school districts money. Dominion said the initial phase of the program aims to put 50 electric buses in its Virginia service territory by the end of 2020. The company hopes to expand the program with state approval to bring 1,000 electric school buses online by 2025. Dominion said it hopes to replace all diesel buses. It said replacing one is like taking 5.2 cars off the road. The company said bus manufacturers will be able to submit bids to build the buses. School districts will be able express interest in participating in the program.\n\nWashington\n\nYakima: A radio station has returned on air nearly a year after burglars robbed the station of essential production equipment. The Yakima Herald-Republic reported that KYNR 1490-AM station on the Yakama Indian Reservation hosted its first shows Thursday using a makeshift system. Authorities said burglars took the station’s control board, microphones, printers and the emergency alert system in October. Station hosts said they are still waiting for a replacement control board after the first new one had programming issues. Hosts said a mixing board that relies on analog radio transmission allowed the station to get back on the air for now, but with fewer channels. Authorities said the Federal Communications Commission wanted to know whether the theft was an attempt to impede the station’s ability to inform the public.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: Marshall University will work with the investigative division of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to fight the opioid crisis. The Herald-Dispatch reported Sen. Shelley Moore Capito announced Wednesday the partnership between Marshall University and Homeland Security Investigations. Capito said the school will receive more than $4 million to develop a tool to disrupt and dismantle criminal activity related to opioids. John Sammons, director of Marshall University’s digital forensics and information assurance program, said students, faculty and staff are looking forward to the project because they’ve seen the impact of the epidemic in their community. Sammons said the partnership will focus on transnational criminal activity, including cybercrimes.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: State officials said the gray wolf population might have stabilized after nearing extinction decades ago. The state Department of Natural Resources said it counted from 914 to 978 wolves in the year to April 2019. The agency said that is a 1% increase from the last count. Wisconsin Public Radio reported that state data shows there were just 25 wolves in Wisconsin 1980. A federal judge placed the gray wolf on the endangered species list in 2014. The federal government this year launched an effort to delist it. Adrian Treves, a professor of environmental studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said Wisconsin hasn’t been transparent with its count and that the federal government shouldn’t rely on the state’s numbers. The DNR stands by the count.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: A U.S. bankruptcy court has ruled that a coal company can sell two large Wyoming mines separately from one in West Virginia. Contura Energy originally sought to buy all three mines from Blackjewel in a deal held up while U.S. officials seek payment of federal royalties. Contura would have paid $9.7 million for the Belle Ayr and Eagle Butte mines in Wyoming and Pax Surface Mine in West Virginia. The Casper Star-Tribune reported that the court in West Virginia on Wednesday approved a deal in which Contura would pay $1.1 million to complete the sale of the West Virginia mine. The Wyoming mines have been shut down since Blackjewel declared bankruptcy July 1. Federal records show no production at the West Virginia mine since 2006.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/07/17/rare-butterfly-spotted-gator-attack-georgia-guidestones-news-from-around-50-states/50499899/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Public officials said they have identified the state’s first known cases of monkeypox, a disease that has emerged in more than 50 countries and most U.S. states. The Alabama Department of Public Health said in news releases that two cases have been identified. The first was in Mobile County and the second in Jefferson County. Dr. Rendi Murphree, an epidemiologist with the Mobile County Health Department, said monkeypox can be transmitted through close person-to-person contact.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Authorities are searching for a grandmother whose 2-year-old grandchild was found alone and abandoned for two days in a locked car that was stuck in mud on a rural Alaska road. The search for Mary Dawn Wilson, 69, is being concentrated around the community of Healy, Alaska State Troopers said. The abandoned Ford Focus was found Thursday on Stampede Road, just outside Healy and off the Parks Highway. The child appeared to be in good health and was handed over to the state Office of Children’s Services, the statement said. Officials said evidence in the car indicated that the child and car were abandoned Tuesday when the vehicle became stuck, troopers said. There were indications she tried to free the car, Alaska State Troopers spokesperson Tim DeSpain said. Wilson was the last known person with the child, the statement said,\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:There has been a sharp decrease in traffic fatalities in Arizona this year after a deadlier-than-usual year in 2021, according to preliminary data from the Governor’s Office of Highway Safety. Traffic fatalities between January and June fell from 626 deaths in 2021 to 350 deaths in 2022 – a 44% decrease. Although the data provided didn’t offer a monthly breakdown of alcohol-related traffic fatalities, the current count of 51 alcohol-related deaths is far less than half of 2021’s 230 total death count.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: The St. Scholastica Benedictine Sisters said they have begun to demolish their former monastery building. The monastery, built in 1924, was considered unsafe and unlivable. It had sustained flooding, mold and wall damage, the sisters reported. In February 2019, the sisters moved out of the monastery to live in a more energy-efficient building. “The decision to demolish the former Monastery Building is not one that the Benedictine Sisters made lightly or without years of research and discernment,” according to a news release. Work to demolish the monastery had been planned for June but started July 11.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The international terminal at San Francisco International Airport was evacuated on Friday night after a bomb threat, and authorities found a potentially incendiary device, officials said. One person is in custody. The bomb threat was reported about 8:15 p.m. and authorities discovered a suspicious package, according to the San Francisco Police Department. Investigators at the airport “deemed the item possibly incendiary.” A man was taken into custody but other details were not immediately available. The terminal was evacuated “out of an abundance of caution,” police said. Hundreds of travelers were forced to leave the terminal.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: A flash flood rushed through Buckhorn Canyon on Friday night, killing two people and destroying a house. Multiple reports of flash flooding in the Crystal Mountain and Glen Haven areas started coming in shortly before 5 p.m., Larimer County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson David Moore said. Included in those calls was a report of a camping trailer that had been washed away in the upper-to-middle section of the canyon with an adult woman and a female child inside. Crews immediately started searching for them, and both were found dead at about 7:30 p.m., Moore said. The area in Larimer County received nearly an inch of rain in a short period of time, according to the National Weather Service in Boulder.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The Connecticut Lottery Corp. has settled a lawsuit filed by its former vice president over the handling of her complaint to the FBI of possible wrongdoing in the quasi-public agency. Under the settlement agreement, obtained in an open records request by The Hartford Courant, Chelsea Turner and her attorneys will be paid $450,000 and she is absolved of any wrongdoing. Turner was suspended from her job in July 2019, a week after she testified at an administrative hearing about how she had contacted a friend of hers in the FBI in 2014 about possible wrongdoing by another lottery official. An FBI investigation ended with no charges.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:A rare Hessel’s hairstreak butterfly was spotted in southern Delaware earlier this year, the first time anyone had seen the endangered species on the Delmarva Peninsula since 1995. The two-tailed, iridescent-green butterfly has a wingspan of just an inch and lives atop Atlantic white cedar trees, which are somewhat rare themselves. Hessel’s hairstreaks in Sussex County are “in the middle” of known populations in the New Jersey Pine Barrens and southeastern Virginia.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Members of the DC Council are calling on Mayor Muriel Bowser to act as Arizona and Texas officials continue to bus hundreds of migrants to Union Station, WUSA-TV reported. Gov. Greg Abbott and other Texas officials started busing people seeking asylum to D.C. in April after the state voiced opposition to President Joe Biden lifting Title 42, a public health policy that allowed the government to quickly expel migrants and asylum seekers who come to the U.S. from countries where an infectious disease is present. A letter from 10 councilmembers called on District government to provide contingency funding toward the purchase of travel tickets, food, petty cash, cellphones and emergent medical needs of arrivals until it receives money from federal or philanthropic entities to address the issue. Bowser’s office has not responded to multiple requests from WUSA-TV about efforts to assist asylum seekers.\n\nFlorida\n\nEnglewood: Authorities said a Florida woman was found dead after falling in a pond and being grabbed by two alligators. The Sarasota County Sheriff’s Office told news outlets the elderly woman was seen falling into the pond along a golf course in Englewood late Friday and struggling to stay afloat. While she was in the water, two alligators were seen grabbing her, authorities said. The woman was pronounced dead at the scene. Two alligators have been removed from the area, but it’s not known whether those were the reptiles involved. The cause of death has not been determined. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission says alligators are more active when temperatures rise.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAthens:Law enforcement continued to try and identify the person who bombed the Georgia Guidestones in Elberton, but tips from the public have slowed. “The amount of leads have definitely slowed, but we’re still getting a few through telephone calls,” said Jesse Maddox, an agent for the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. “We haven’t been able to put anything new out because there’s nothing new.” The Guidestones, known as America’s Stonehenge and erected in 1980 in Elbert County, were heavily damaged during the predawn hours of July 6. Residents in the area off Georgia Highway 77 heard the loud blast. There have been some discussions in Elbert County of rebuilding the monument, which became a popular tourist destination, but no decisions have been made. Anyone with information is asked to contact the GBI office in Athens at (706) 552-2309. Anonymous tips can be submitted at (800) 597-8477.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A Pittsburgh man who was charged with manslaughter in the strangulation death of a college buddy he was vacationing with in Hawaii was found not guilty by a jury. Jurors reached their verdict last week after a trial on the Big Island, where Benjamin Fleming was vacationing with two friends he knew since attending Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. They were staying at a vacation rental in Kailua-Kona last year when a night out drinking ended in a deadly fight. Fleming was charged with manslaughter after an autopsy showed that Abhishek Gupta of Pittsburgh was strangled. Authorities said an argument between the men turned physical.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A nuclear waste treatment plant in eastern Idaho designed to treat 900,000 gallons of sodium-bearing, radioactive waste that has had numerous setbacks appears to be making progress, officials said. The U.S. Department of Energy said lastg week the Integrated Waste Treatment Unit at the department’s 890-square-mile site that includes the Idaho National Laboratory recently treated more than 100,000 gallons of simulant over seven weeks. The department plans additional testing and then a shutdown to make sure the plant is ready for radioactive waste. The department said increasing amounts of radioactive waste will be mixed with simulant when the plant is fully operational. The department didn’t give a timeline.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield:About 150 Lutheran High School students will be displaced because of mine subsidence at the facility on the far west side of the city. Subsidence is the sinking of land surface, commonly resulting from underground mining. The problems, including cracking of walls and dropping of floors, were discovered by staff members a little over two weeks ago, said Zack Klug, the interim principal. Students’ families were informed by the school’s board of directors via email Saturday. Klug said he received a report from a Springfield engineering firm recommending the move. Engineers from the Illinois Department of Natural Resources and Illinois Mine Subsidence Insurance Fund have also done inspections on the school, which was built in 1978, and have recommended the building not be occupied. Klug said engineers told him a newer part of the high school, dating from 2017, is safe. Staff will stay there now until a better plan is developed, Klug said.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Weeks of heat and scant rainfall have left most of Indiana facing either drought or unusually dry conditions while farmers hope significant precipitation falls soon. The U.S. Drought Monitor showed more than a third of Indiana with abnormally dry conditions and another 44% of the state gripped by a moderate drought centered over central, western and southwestern Indiana. Moderate drought or abnormally dry conditions cover nearly 80% of the state as of Tuesday, according to Thursday’s national drought update.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Police identified the 11-year-old girl who drowned Wednesday in the Raccoon River. At about 5:57 p.m. Wednesday, Des Moines police and fire department rescue personnel responded to the river in a wooded area northeast of the 6000 block of Creston Avenue after a child fell into the water. Diamond Mathis, 11, reportedly got off a raft on which she was floating with two other children, went under the water and did not resurface, Des Moines Police spokesperson Sgt. Paul Parizek said in a news release. Officers from the Metro STAR Unit located Mathis’ body about 12:20 p.m. Friday in the Raccoon River near where she was last seen.\n\nKansas\n\nLansing: The state prison in Lansing was placed on lockdown Friday night after a fight among inmates sent one prisoner to a hospital and left at least three corrections employees injured. The incident happened about 7 p.m. in a section of the facility that houses violent offenders, said Sarah LaFrenz, a spokeswoman for state Department of Corrections officials. She added the event led to the “loss of control” over one part of the prison. Corrections spokesman Randall Bowman confirmed in a text message the hospitalized inmate was stabbed. He said the rest of the facility had been placed on lockdown as a precautionary measure. A tactical unit was deployed during the altercation and additional staffing brought in from other facilities. All men had returned to their cells “with minimal resistance” by about 10:30 p.m., corrections officials said.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Leak detection and repair crews have identified and fixed waterlines in the western Kentucky town of Marion – work that’s estimated to be saving more than 100,000 gallons of water a day, Gov. Andy Beshear’s office said. An engineering report will lay out the scope of work needed to complete a water connection from Marion to Sturgis Water Co., the governor said. The Kentucky National Guard continues to distribute bottled water. More than 398,000 bottles of water provided by the state and from donations have been handed out, he said. Beshear declared a state of emergency in Marion after the town of nearly 3,000 people began running out of water when a levee was breached on Lake George – the town’s main water supply.\n\nLouisiana\n\nShreveport:The ramp on Interstate 20 eastbound to I-220 westbound (Exit 26 near Louisiana Downs) will be closed Monday as part of the ongoing I-20/I-220 Barksdale Air Force Base Interchange Project, which began in May 2019. The closure is expected to take approximately two months. During that time, construction on a new segment of roadway will be built extending southward leading to a new access point to the base. The Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development will have detour signs in place for an alternate route.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The U.S. House approved a bill that would allow Native American tribes bound by a state land claims settlement in Maine to get the benefit from federal laws going forward. The proposal, attached to a defense bill approved Thursday, won’t change how the tribes are treated under state law but would update federal law to allow future laws passed by Congress to apply to the tribes. U.S. Rep. Jared Golden, who introduced the bill, said tribes in Maine deserve the same benefits as other federally recognized tribes under federal law. The proposal faces an uncertain future in the Senate. Chief Kirk Francis of the Penobscot Nation said in a statement Friday that tribal members “look forward to working with our senators on getting final passage through Congress this year.” Wabanaki tribes in Maine are governed by the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act of 1980, which stipulates they’re bound by state law. That sets them apart from the other 570 federally recognized tribes. Both chambers of the Maine Legislature advanced a bill to amend the land claims settlement to restore rights that tribes forfeited, but it stalled under a threat of veto from Democratic Gov. Janet Mills.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Demand is surging for concealed carry permits in Maryland in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that Americans have a right to carry firearms in public for self-defense. The Washington Post reported Friday that Maryland State Police said they have received 11 times the usual number of permit applications to carry a gun. The surge came after Gov. Larry Hogan’s order to bring the state in line with the high court’s ruling on June 23. Hogan directed state police on July 5 to suspend the state’s “good and substantial reason” standard for permits to carry handguns. The threshold for that standard included showing a person’s life is in danger from threats or working in a job that could put them in contact with people who are dangerous.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The city and the union representing about 10,000 teachers and other employees of the city’s public school system have reached a tentative contract agreement that provides for pay raises and an overhaul of the way the district approaches special education, both sides said in a statement. The contract came at a time of transition for the troubled system, which recently hired a new superintendent and staved off a state takeover by pledging to implement immediate improvement efforts in several key areas. The agreement announced Thursday includes additional investments to support the changes needed for special education, including funding for additional support for students with individualized education programs and English learners. The three-year agreement also includes annual wage increases of 2.5%, plus an additional 2% over the length of the contract. The deal now requires ratification by union membership and approval by the Boston School Committee.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit:About 200 people attended the Detroit Police 2nd Precinct’s vigil Friday afternoon in honor of Officer Loren Courts, 40, who was killed in the line of duty July 6. Courts was fatally shot when he and his partner, Amanda Hudgens, 29, responded to a call about shots fired in the Fiskhorn neighborhood on Detroit’s west side. The shooter, later identified as Ehmani Davis, 19, died when other officers on the scene returned fire. Neighborhood resident Shawna Lancaster, who witnessed the incident, attended the vigil in a homemade T-shirt featuring Courts leaning against his vehicle. “I am one of the people he saved,” she said tearfully. “Showing up – this is the least I can do.” Detroit Police Chief James White led the vigil, which was attended by members of Courts’ extended family. “We’re rocked and we are hurt,” he said, speaking on behalf of the police department, “we are rocked, but we are not defeated.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The number of people who died of drug overdoses in Minnesota climbed by more than 20% last year. State Department of Health records showed at least 1,286 people in Minnesota died of overdoses in 2021. And, most of the deaths were caused by synthetic opioids such as fentanyl, which saw a 32% increase in fatal overdoses compared to 2020. About 450 other deaths were caused by methamphetamine overdoses and 151 were caused by cocaine. Minnesota’s numbers mirror increased drug overdose deaths across the country as fentanyl has been mixed with other drugs such as cocaine.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A $1.6 million lawsuit is the latest development in the ongoing garbage contract dispute in Jackson. WAPT-TV reported Friday that Richard’s Disposal filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi and is seeking more than $1.6 million in restitution. The New Orleans-based company has been collecting trash in Jackson since April 1 but has yet to be paid because the Jackson City Council said the company does not have an approved contract. Earlier this week a judge ruled Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba did not have the power veto a contract the city council had not approved. Judge Larry Roberts issued his ruling Friday in a dispute among Jackson officials over who will be paid to collect garbage, news outlets reported.\n\nMissouri\n\nGrain Valley: An intoxicated pilot was arrested after landing a small aircraft early Friday on Interstate 70 southeast of Kansas City after radioing that he had run out of fuel, authorities said. The landing at about 2:30 a.m. east of Grain Valley, roughly 20 miles southeast of Kansas City, closed westbound lanes of the highway for more than 21/ 2 hours, KCTV reported. The plane had a “minor collision” with a guardrail but otherwise didn’t hit anything, the Missouri State Highway Patrol tweeted. The pilot was the only person on board. He suffered minor injuries and was taken to an area hospital for treatment after his arrest, the patrol said. Online records showed the single-engine plane was 19 minutes into its flight from Warrensburg, Missouri, which is located about 20 miles southeast of the landing site. The patrol said the pilot radioed that he had run out of fuel and had to make an emergency landing on the highway.\n\nMontana\n\nDenton: A ribbon-cutting ceremony was held at the site of the Wolf Creek Bridge, which was rebuilt after a wildfire in December. The Montana Department of Transportation, Frontier West, and Morrison Maierle worked in a short time frame to reopen the bridge. The west entrance road to Denton was burned down by a fire in December. The outdated bridge has since been rebuilt to withstand various weather conditions and meet current codes. Kyle Dubbs of the Montana Department of Transportation said the old structure was a wooden bridge. The recent construction has allowed for safety slopes to be added, the road to be widened, with better drainage and a steel structure.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway now controls nearly 20% of Occidental Petroleum’s stock after picking up another $250 million worth of shares of the oil producer last week. Berkshire has been investing heavily in Occidental this year, including buying up more than $1.2 billion of the Houston-based company’s stock this month. After the latest purchases that Berkshire disclosed Wednesday, Buffett’s Omaha-based conglomerate now owns nearly 180 million Occidental shares worth more than $10 billion. That gives Berkshire control of 19.2% of the company.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The corporate owner of several Las Vegas-area casinos said Friday it plans to demolish three shuttered hotel towers and sell the properties that have been closed since the start of the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020. Red Rock Resorts said its Texas Station in North Las Vegas, neighboring Fiesta Rancho in Las Vegas and the Fiesta Henderson property will be razed “to reposition the land for sale,” although an ice rink at Fiesta Rancho will remain open.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nSeabrook: U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., is requesting a full review of what caused an emergency alarm to be falsely activated at the Seabrook Nuclear Power Station early last week after what she called “a breakdown in communications” transpired between the plant, state and local officials. The emergency alarm went off Tuesday morning, warning many in the area that there was a problem at the plant and advising them to evacuate the vicinity. The state Homeland Security and Emergency Management agency and NextEra Energy put out statements Tuesday saying the alarm was false more than 30 minutes after beachgoers in nearby Hampton and Rye said they heard announcements at about 11 a.m. about the beaches being closed because of a problem at the plant. Brian Booth, the plant’s site vice president, sent a letter to Gov. Chris Sununu on Friday, saying the siren system was inadvertently activated during routine testing. He wrote the company is investigating and will take steps to ensure it doesn’t happen again, WMUR-TV reported. The plant is about 40 miles north of Boston and 10 miles south of Portsmouth. It has operated since 1990.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nBlairstown: A girl who was dubbed Princess Doe after her remains were found 40 years ago in a New Jersey cemetery has been identified as Dawn Olanick, 17, of West Babylon, New York, authorities announced Friday. Charges have been filed against the man they believe killed Olanick, the Warren County, New Jersey, prosecutor’s office announced. The suspect, Arthur Kinlaw, 68, is currently serving 20 years to life in Sullivan County, New York, on two first-degree murder convictions. Kinlaw tried to lure Olanick into prostitution and killed her after she refused, authorities said, according to Lehigh Valley Live. Her remains were found July 25, 1982, in Cedar Ridge Cemetery in Blairstown, in northwestern New Jersey near the Pennsylvania border. Authorities have said she was beaten beyond recognition.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: County boards led by Republicans are urging New Mexico legislators to require photo identification at polling locations, approve new procedures for purging voter registration rolls and prohibit the use of ballot drop boxes that aren’t supervised directly by people. The Otero County commission in southern New Mexico on Thursday endorsed a resolution on a 3-0 vote that advocates for changes to the state election code. Sandoval County commissioners approved a nearly identical resolution in June after an outpouring of public anger over election procedures in the state’s June 7 primary. Residents of both counties have questioned the accuracy of election results and given voice to conspiracy theories about voting systems that have rippled across the country since former President Donald Trump lost re-election in 2020.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul has a campaign war chest seven times the size of Republican challenger Lee Zeldin ahead of the November election. State campaign finance reports due Friday showed Hochul has $11.7 million in the bank, compared with $1.6 million reported by Zeldin, a U.S. representative from Long Island. The fundraising gap between the candidates is steep in a state where Democrats already have the voter registration edge and legislative super majorities.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nChapel Hill: The flagship school of North Carolina’s university system said it has reached a settlement with the journalist who shunned the school in an extended dispute over tenure and joined a historically Black university. David Boliek, chairman of the Board of Trustees at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said the settlement with Nikole Hannah-Jones was for less than $75,000 and was approved by school Chancellor Kevin Guskiewicz, news outlets reported. Attorneys representing Hannah-Jones, including the NAACP Legal Defense & Educational Fund, Inc., last year threatened to take legal action, including filing a federal discrimination lawsuit, against UNC-Chapel Hill and its board of trustees over the failure to give her tenure, news outlets reported at the time. Boliek said the settlement reached by the university was to resolve that “potential legal action,” and that a formal lawsuit was never filed by Hannah-Jones’ attorneys.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: President Joe Biden has issued a major disaster declaration for many of North Dakota’s 53 counties which sustained damage caused during a series of snow storms in April. The declaration was approved for 40 of the state’s 53 counties, and allows for FEMA assistance to help recover from the storms’ damages. The spring storms knocked out power to more than 10,000 residents, caused more than $57 million in damage and later led to spring flooding.\n\nOhio\n\nMason:Kings Island’s Diamondback roller coaster celebrated a milestone recently, giving its 20 millionth ride, as 23-year-old Grace Timmons from Seymour, Indiana, became the coaster’s lucky rider according to a release from park officials. Timmons said she thought she was being pranked when she was informed of her lucky ride. “I was looking for the cameras,” she told park officials, after being assured it was not a prank. The Diamondback opened in 2009 and features a 230-foot first drop and 5,282 feet of track at speeds of up to 80 mph. Timmons received Diamondback-themed gifts to commemorate the event. Kings Island’s 50th Anniversary continues at the park until Labor Day weekend.\n\nOklahoma\n\nDavenport: The Oklahoma Turnpike Authority is planning to add new connections for Davenport and 13 other towns along Route 66, communities that hope the access will bring them new businesses and residents. The turnpike authority has been embroiled in conflict since it announced plans for Access Oklahoma, a 15-year, $5 billion plan to expand the state’s toll road network. The authority is being sued over plans to build toll roads between Oklahoma City and Norman that opponents said will uproot more than 600 homes and businesses. But in towns like Davenport, which once considered themselves economic victims of past turnpike expansions, the new plans are receiving much warmer responses. The new Davenport interchange is one of 14 planned along the Turner, Indian Nation, H.E. Bailey, Kilpatrick and Cimarron turnpikes as part of Access Oklahoma.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:The central section of the State Capitol building has closed for extensive renovations as part of the yearslong Capitol Accessibility, Maintenance and Safety project. Colloquially known as the ’38 building (because it was constructed in 1938), this part of the Capitol includes the visitor’s area, gift shop, both House and Senate chambers, offices for the Secretary of State and State Treasurer and the iconic rotunda. It also houses many of the nonpolitical legislative agencies, as well as working areas for journalists and lobbyists. The ‘38 building is scheduled to reopen in January 2025, in time for the start of the legislative session that year. The Capitol wings will remain open throughout the project to lawmakers, staff and the public. The wings were constructed in 1977 and contain the offices for each representative and senator, as well as legislative leadership office suites.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nJennerstown: Six of the nine men trapped in a flooded mine in southwestern Pennsylvania two decades ago gathered at a raceway over the weekend to kick off 20th anniversary celebrations of the dramatic rescue that ended their 77-hour ordeal. The six took in the races at Jennerstown Speedway in Somerset County, only miles from the Quecreek Mine, sitting with former Pennsylvania Gov. Mark Schweiker, news outlets reported. Blaine Mayhugh, John Phillippi, John Unger, Robert Pugh, Ronald Hileman, and Thomas “Tucker” Foy came to the track at intermission to applause from the crowd. Miners broke through stone into the uncharted mine shaft on the night of July 24, 2002, releasing millions of gallons of water and trapping them more than 200 feet below the surface. Crews drilled a small shaft and lowered a small metal capsule, bringing them up one by one until the last was lifted to safety early on the morning of July 28.\n\nRhode Island\n\nWarwick: A woman sitting in the outdoor eating area of a restaurant died after she was struck by a vehicle, police said. The driver was traveling through the parking lot of Tommy’s Clam Shack on Friday afternoon and inadvertently hit the accelerator, striking a couple who were sitting at a table, police said. The woman, identified as Susan Hjerpe, 66, suffered life-threatening injuries and was taken to a hospital, where she later died, police said. Her husband, Carl, also was hospitalized and is in stable condition. Police said Saturday an accident reconstruction team is still investigating the incident.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Some scientists said water seeping deep into the ground might be causing a swarm of earthquakes in the midlands region of South Carolina. More than 60 earthquakes have been recorded since December in an area near the towns of Lugoff and Eglin, about 20 miles northeast of Columbia. Now, some geologists suggested an initial December quake might have allowed water from the Wateree River to seep into new cracks opened by the quake, setting off additional temblors. The idea is that water moving above ground can increase pressure on water below ground. That downward pressure, in turn, can cause the earth to move. “We think it probably ought to be looked into,’’ said Scott Howard, the state’s chief geologist with the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources. Five earthquakes with a magnitude of more than 3 have been recorded in the area. The largest quake was 3.6 in magnitude last month, an event that was felt across the region.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nLead: In a former gold mine a mile underground, inside a titanium tank filled with a rare liquified gas, scientists have begun the search for what has been unfindable: dark matter. Scientists are pretty sure the invisible stuff makes up most of the universe’s mass and said we wouldn’t be here without it – but they don’t know what it is. The race to solve this enormous mystery has brought one team to the depths under Lead. The idea is that a mile of dirt and rock, a giant tank, a second tank and the purest titanium in the world will block nearly all the cosmic rays and particles that zip around – and through – all of us every day. But dark matter particles, scientists believe, can avoid all of those obstacles. They hope one will fly into the vat of liquid xenon in the inner tank and smash into a xenon nucleus like two balls in a game of pool, revealing its existence in a flash of light seen by a device called “the time projection chamber.” By the time the experiment finishes, the chance of finding dark matter with this device is “probably less than 50% but more than 10%,” said Hugh Lippincott, a physicist and spokesman for the experiment in a Thursday news conference.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The city of Madisonville has been given Main Street accreditation, the state said. Madisonville joins 42 other Tennessee communities that are accredited through the state program and Main Street America, part of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, the state Economic and Community Development Department said. Madisonville is the county seat of Monroe County in southeast Tennessee. The program offers training, support and grant opportunities to help with downtown revitalization projects.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Some hospitals in Texas have reportedly refused to treat patients with major pregnancy complications for fear of violating the state’s abortion ban, the Texas Medical Association said in a letter last week. The association did not name the hospitals but said it has received complaints that hospitals, administrators and their attorneys might be prohibiting doctors from providing medically appropriate care in some situations, The Dallas Morning News reported. Texas law bans most abortions after about six weeks of a pregnancy. A total ban – that includes an exemptions if a woman’s life or health is danger – will take effect in the coming weeks following last month’s U.S. Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: A recount will be required in the Republican primary race for Utah House District 72 after Toquerville businessman Joe Elison beat Hurricane businessman Willie Billings by just seven votes. In the final results canvassed Tuesday by the Washington County Commission, Elison had 4,131 votes to 4,124 for Billings, giving him the inside track to represent the eastern part of Washington County in the state Legislature. State law allows for a recount if the race is within .25% once all the counting is done, but the losing candidate needs to request it. Billings submitted a letter to the county clerk’s office officially making that request.\n\nVermont\n\nMiddlebury: A sheriff arrested on June 28 by the state police on multiple charges related to sexual and domestic assault pleaded not guilty and was then expected to be released on unsecured $100,000 bail. Peter Newton, 50, of Middlebury entered the pleas during an afternoon court appearance in Burlington, outside Addison County where the sheriff was arrested while he was conducting contractor work at a construction job site in his hometown. During the arraignment, Newton was served with what in Vermont is called an extreme risk protection order – known more generically in other states as a red-flag law – that prevents him from possessing firearms.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Quarantining after exposure to COVID-19 is no longer recommended for unvaccinated, asymptomatic children in child care, K-12 schools and camp settings, Gov. Glenn Youngkin said. The guidance announced Thursday night by the Republican governor’s office also said masking is no longer routinely recommended in those settings, except in limited circumstances. The latest guidance said people who test positive still should isolate at home, regardless of vaccination status, and those who have symptoms should begin isolation and undergo testing. Youngkin said the guidance, which is a departure from federal recommendations, is aimed at easing the strain on work and family life many parents of young children have experienced as care and school settings have closed for quarantine periods in response to a small numbers of cases.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Two voting change options will be on the November ballot after the Seattle City Council approved an alternative to a signature-driven effort – and either would change the city’s primary election process. In a special meeting Thursday, the council OK’d asking voters to consider ranked-choice voting alongside approval voting, The Seattle Times reported. Voters currently choose one candidate in a primary election and the top two proceed to the general election. The move away from more traditional voting has gained momentum across the country as advocates seek more equitable elections.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Eligible West Virginia households will receive a one-time summer feeding benefit for children, the state Department of Education said. The program will provide $391 per eligible child to be deposited onto the child’s West Virginia-Pandemic Electronic Benefit Transfer card, the department said. The funds can be expected during August. The state estimated the funding will go to approximately 255,000 children, representing nearly $100 million in additional federal funding, the department said in a news release. The program is funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and administered by the state Education Department and the state Health and Human Resources Department.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A judge ruled against the state prison system Thursday, saying its COVID-19 visitor policy that barred Catholic clergy from meeting with inmates for more than a year violated state law and the state constitution’s guarantee of religious freedom. The Archdiocese of Milwaukee filed a lawsuit in 2021 demanding state corrections officials relax their COVID-19 protocols and allow ministers to visit inmates. The policy was in place from March 13, 2020, until June 21, 2021. The archdiocese alleged that the Department of Corrections’ policy prevented clergy from the archdiocese from meeting in-person with inmates to provide spiritual guidance, communion and penance, violating a state law that grants clergy of all faiths weekly visits with prisoners and inmates’ constitutional right to freedom of religion. Attorneys and DOC employees such as psychologists and social workers were allowed to see inmates under the policy if the visitors followed health and safety protocols such as temperature checks, coronavirus tests and wearing masks.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Harriet Hageman, former President Donald Trump’s pick to unseat Republican U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney in the race for Wyoming’s lone House seat, holds 52%-30% lead in a new poll, the Casper Star-Tribune reported. No other challenger received more than 5% support. Only 11% of voters were undecided.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/11/29/giant-christmas-tree-jersey-shore-boardwalk-salmon-farm-news-from-around-states/8788371002/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTuscaloosa: The city’s outdoor ice skating venue is open at a new location and with a new name. The event, formerly known as Holidays on the River, has moved to Government Plaza for this holiday season, The Tuscaloosa News reported. It’s now known as Holidays on the Plaza. Ice skating is scheduled to continue through Jan. 17. Along with outdoor ice skating, Holidays on the Plaza features the Tinsel Trail benefiting Tuscaloosa’s One Place, private parties, and other holiday festivities, organizers said. The decision to move the holiday ice skating from the Tuscaloosa Amphitheater was because of ongoing construction on Jack Warner Parkway, city officials said. “With increased visibility and proximity to local businesses and restaurants, we hope to make this event more convenient to the community,” said Stacy Vaughn, director of public services. Holidays on the River began nine years ago on the Mildred Westervelt Warner Transportation Museum property, the Tuscaloosa News reported. It grew in popularity, and moved in 2015 to the Tuscaloosa Amphitheater. Admission to Holidays on the Plaza is free. However, guests must purchase skate passes to access the ice rink.\n\nAlaska\n\nBethel: A federal grant will allow an extensive trail system to connect all four communities on Nelson Island, just off Alaska’s western coast. The $12\n\nmillion grant will pay to take the trail the last link, from Toksook Bay, which received the federal money, to the community of Mertarvik, the new site for the village of Newtok. The village is moving because of erosion. However, Newtok has not yet agreed to accept the trail. Newtok Tribal Administrator Phillip Carl told KYUK the village council has not met in months because of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the council is scheduled to meet in December, and will vote on the trail project. Even if they decide not to accept the project, Toksook Bay still intends to build most of the trail to Mertarvik. However, they would stop just short of the village, at the border between the two village corporations. Work on the trail to Mertarvik still needs to be designed and go through environmental reviews. If approved, construction is expected to start in 2023 and take about two years to complete. The island’s trail system will span 50 miles, connecting the four communities: Toksook Bay, Tununak, Nightmute and Mertarvik. The trail connecting Toksook Bay to Nightmute is expected to be completed next summer.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Two hikers were rescued Saturday in separate operations at Echo Canyon and South Mountain. According to the Phoenix Fire Department, the rescues involved a 59-year-old man who experienced chest pains while hiking Echo Canyon and a 14-year-old boy who tripped and suffered a lower-extremity injury while hiking Holbert Trailhead at South Mountain. Firefighters arrived at Holbert Trailhead just before 11 a.m. Saturday and hiked approximately 1\n\nmile to the location where a 14-year-old boy tripped and fell while hiking. After locating him, emergency personnel conducted basic life-support measures and splinted the patient’s leg. He was extricated by helicopter from the scene. The Phoenix Fire Department said the patient was then taken to a local pediatric emergency room for further evaluation. The other hiker was assisted by Technical Rescue Teams in Echo Canyon. After a quick assessment, rescue teams decided to use the “Big Wheel” to help the hiker off of the mountain after he stated he didn’t feel comfortable walking down on his own, according to the Phoenix Fire Department. Once at the trailhead, a second assessment of the hiker was performed and rescue crews determined the patient needed transport to a local hospital. Phoenix Fire Department said no emergency personnel was injured in either incident.\n\nArkansas\n\nHelena-West Helena: The U.S. Department of Transportation has awarded a $20\n\nmillion grant to finish the final section of a bike and pedestrian trail in southeastern Arkansas. The Arkansas Department of Parks, Heritage and Tourism was awarded the money to construct the final 13.4-mile section of the Delta Heritage Trail. Once complete, the 87-mile trail stretching from Lexa to Arkansas City will be one of the longest dedicated pedestrian and bicycle trails in Arkansas. The federal grant is being matched by $20\n\nmillion from the Walton Family Foundation. State parks officials said the project is expected to be finished by 2025.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: A federal appeals court temporarily blocked an order that all California prison workers must be vaccinated against the coronavirus or have a religious or medical exemption. A panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted a request for a stay of September’s lower court order pending an appeal. It also sped up the hearing process by setting a Dec. 13 deadline for opening briefs. The vaccination mandate was supposed to have taken effect by Jan. 12 but the appellate court stay blocks enforcement until sometime in March, when the appeal hearing will be scheduled. The judge who issued the vaccination mandate followed the recommendation of a court-appointed receiver who was chosen to manage the state prison health care system after a federal judge in 2005 found that California failed to provide adequate medical care to prisoners. In addition to requiring COVID-19 shots for prison workers, U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar required vaccinations or exemptions for inmates who want in-person visits or who work outside prisons, including inmate firefighters.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: The remains of the final victim of the Black Hollow Flood have been discovered four months after she and her three family members were swept away in the flood. About 4 p.m. Nov. 20, a local resident reported finding what she thought to be human remains while hiking east of Rustic Road – a little more than 4 miles east of Black Hollow Road – according to a news release from the Larimer County Sheriff’s Office. Deputies with the sheriff’s office and investigators with Larimer County Coroner’s Office recovered those remains, and the coroner’s office identified them as belonging to 57-year-old Diana Brown of San Antonio. Brown was swept away by the flood waters July 20 along with her family members Richard Brown of Bellevue, Nebraska; Patricia Brown of Madison, Wisconsin; and David Brown of San Antonio. Their bodies were recovered in a section of the river between Arrowhead Lodge and the Indian Meadows area of the Poudre Canyon several days after the flood. Richard Brown owned a mobile home on Black Hollow Road, according to Larimer County property records, but his home residence was in Bellevue. All four victims were in the same house in the small Black Hollow area 45\n\nmiles west of Fort Collins when the Black Hollow Creek initiated a flash flood down the mountainside filled with large boulders and trees burned in the Cameron Peak Fire.\n\nConnecticut\n\nTorrington: The Torrington Public Schools district is turning to a limousine service company to help transport students to school because of a bus driver shortage that has been exacerbated by the pandemic. The district plans to use some of its $5.9\n\nmillion in federal coronavirus relief funds to pay Carriage & Limousine Services of Oxford to help cover its 53 bus routes. The private company has said it can provide 30 passenger buses and 10 passenger vans to cover morning bus runs on an emergency basis and afternoon runs more regularly, the Waterbury Republican-American reported. The company charges $125 an hour for passenger buses and $87.50 an hour for passenger vans. All-Star Transportation, the city’s main bus provider, has had difficulty finding enough drivers, which has caused morning delays and prevented most after-school programs, the superintendent of schools, Susan Lubomski, recently told the Board of Education.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Delaware’s K-12 public schools are continuing to report fewer than 300 COVID-19 cases that are deemed as being in-person and contagious. The Delaware State News reported last week the numbers remained below 300 for the fifth consecutive week. The data was released Wednesday by the Delaware Division of Public Health. The agency said there were 298 cases for students, just 0.21% of the estimated 141,040 public school students. The week’s numbers were slightly up from 0.17% – or 243 cases – from the previous week. Delaware has recorded a total of 3,397 in-person contagious cases among students this school year. That figure amounts to 2.4% of all public school students. Another 665 cases have been reported among staff. The data is for all of Delaware’s public schools. That includes 19 districts and 23 charter schools that are part of the public school system.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The Knights of Columbus handed out new winter coats for those in need at Our Lady of Perpetual Help Parish in southeast D.C. on Friday, WUSA-TV reported. Many low-income families have scarce resources to cover even the most basic essentials, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The Knights of Columbus launched the Coats for Kids program to ensure that every child in North America would have access to a warm winter coat. Since the program started in D.C. in 2009, councils have purchased and distributed more than 500,000 new winter coats to children throughout North America. Cardinal Wilton Gregory, who is the first Black U.S. prelate to earn the coveted red cap, said this is the season for giving if you can. “It’s a great gesture of concern for kids and young people who need a little help at this time of year,” Gregory said. Metro Police officers were also picking up coats. Each district gets three boxes. Officer Karen Voglezon said giving them out is a way to connect with the community they serve. “We never know what anybody’s situation is, so to get a warm coat for the winter is very good,” Officer Voglezon said.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: Federal authorities have taken into custody a 26-year-old man who apparently stowed away in the landing gear compartment of an American Airlines fight that arrived at Miami International Airport from Guatemala on Saturday morning. The man was in the wheel well area when the flight arrived from Guatemala City at 10:06 a.m., officials said. News outlets reported that Flight 1182 was met by law enforcement because of a security issue. U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers took the man into custody, the agency said in a news release. Medics took the man to a hospital for a medical assessment. “Persons are taking extreme risks when they try to conceal themselves in confined spaces such as an aircraft,” the agency said. The news release didn’t say whether the man will face any charges, or what will happen to him when he’s released from the hospital.\n\nGeorgia\n\nLawrenceville: All active school district employees in Gwinnett County eligible for benefits are in line to get $1,000 in bonuses next month, as well as a paid Juneteenth holiday next year. Superintendent Calvin Watts recommended the bonuses to the county’s Board of Education, which approved them unanimously, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. The bonus will be paid in a lump sum in the December monthly paycheck for about 21,500 employees, including teachers, administrators and support personnel, according to a news release from Gwinnett County Public Schools. The one-time bonuses’ $21.5\n\nmillion cost will not tie up future budgets or decrease the year-end fund balance, the news release said. Atlanta Public Schools is also considering $1,000 stipends next month for all its 6,000 workers, including part-time employees.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A food distributor in Hawaii has filed a federal lawsuit against a dairy company because milk from the mainland is allegedly being sold under a name that advertises local ties. The lawsuit filed by Hawaii Foodservice Alliance claims Meadow Gold Dairies is selling milk from California alongside advertising that reads, “Hawaii’s Dairy” and “Made with Aloha,” the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported. The lawsuit said the company has no cows in Hawaii and their “Lani Moo” mascot is misleading. Meadow Gold has long sold milk produced in Hawaii. The company was sold in April 2020 to Bahman Sadeghi, a Big Island dairy farmer, who allegedly began using milk from outside the state. “We have never claimed that all our milk is local, but we do consider ourselves Hawaii’s Dairy because we are committed to Hawaii and its community and will continue to be while we work toward building a more sustainable operation,” Meadow Gold said in a statement. In a similar but unrelated case, a federal judge recently tossed out a lawsuit against California-based King’s Hawaiian, which produces sweet rolls. Hawaii Public Radio reported King’s Hawaiian was sued because their label features the words “Established 1950” and “Hilo, Hawaii” in reference to the company’s founding. U.S. District Judge Phyllis Hamilton said the packaging clearly states the rolls are made in California and a geographic reference such as Hilo would not deceive a consumer into believing the product was made there.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise The city is looking to expand its geothermal heating system by 40% as part of a goal to become carbon-neutral by 2050. The city pumps 250 gallons of geothermal water to 96 buildings through 21 miles of pipes. The water has a temperature of 177 degrees Fahrenheit. City officials said that the geothermal heat supplies about 2% of the city’s energy resources. “Geothermal really provides that clean energy alternative,” said Climate Action Manager Steve Hubble, the Idaho Statesman reported. The heated water comes from a river of geothermally heated water flowing under the nearby foothills. Experts said the water is heated by the Idaho Batholith, a massive igneous intrusion of granite producing heat through decay of isotopes like uranium, thorium, and potassium. Boise Geothermal Program Manager Jon Gunnerson said a large fault line runs through the Boise foothills and helps bring the water near the surface. The hot water is pumped from city-owned wells in the foothills to buildings, and then returned to the aquifer. City officials said they want to expand the use of the geothermal water by 5 million gallons (18.9 million liters) a year until reaching 355\n\nmillion gallons. Gunnerson said anyone interested in switching to geothermal should contact his office. The city says the rate is competitive with natural gas prices.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The Capitol dome in Springfield will be without holiday lights for the third straight year. The same structural issue that kept workers from hanging about 1,300 lights from the state Capitol dome in 2019 and again last year has not been resolved, Secretary of State spokesman Henry Haupt told The Springfield State-Journal Register. Haupt said an engineering firm conducted an inspection of the dome in 2019 and recommended an observation deck above the dome be fortified before the lights are put up. “It’s the engineering firm just feels the Christmas lights shouldn’t be tethered to it until it’s fortified,” he said, adding that there is nothing wrong with the observation deck necessarily. He said the next step is for the secretary of state’s office – which is the custodian of the building – to work with the Capitol Development Boar to come up with the funding for the project. That means the lights, which were first hung on the dome in 1924 and became an annual tradition in the 1960s, will remain dark for at least one more holiday season.\n\nIndiana\n\nWinamac: Staff at a primate sanctuary in northern Indiana will be feeding the center’s menagerie with freshly picked fruit in the coming years because of a newly planted orchard. A team of volunteers helped plant 60 fruit trees last month on the property of the Peaceable Primate Sanctuary, which is home to baboons and macaque monkeys retired from research facilities and pharmaceutical companies. The new orchard at the primate center is outfitted with an irrigation system and within a few years it will supply the sanctuary with fresh apples, persimmons and other fruits, WSBT-TV reported. The orchard was planted after donations and a partnership with an organization called The Fruit Tree Planting Foundation. The next project at the sanctuary, located in Winamac, about 40 miles southwest of South Bend, is to build space for 10 additional primates that will be retiring there, said Scott Kubisch, the center’s director and founder.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines Iowa motorists will soon have the option of keeping their driver’s license on their phones. State officials have begun a pilot project to make digital driver’s licenses, or “mobile IDs,” available for download via smartphone apps sometime in 2022, the Cedar Rapids Gazette reported Friday. Iowa is one of several states that have considered, tested or begun issuing digital versions of driver’s licenses. Iowa plans to test devices equipped with digital versions through December, with about 100 state Department of Transportation employees expected to enlist by spring as a test group to make sure the app works. Melissa Gillett, director of the department’s motor vehicle division, said the mobile ID will be optional, but motorists will still be expected to carry hard-copy licenses. Iowa DOT officials are working with technology vendors to address security and privacy concerns inherit with any electronic-based app. They also are working with law enforcement agencies, and want to make sure the digital ID can be accepted by retailers and other places that require people to show identification or proof of age or address.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: Kansas utility regulators have issued an order requiring Evergy to explain and justify a plan to spend $10.4 billion on its electrical system and report quality of service measures on a quarterly basis amid concerns that the plan is designed largely to benefit a hedge fund investor. The Wichita Eagle reported members of the Kansas Corporation Commission sent a strong signal Tuesday that they won’t tolerate efforts to increase shareholder profits at the expense of unreasonably high rates for Evergy’s 1\n\nmillion Kansas customers. In a written statement, Evergy said it was reviewing the commission’s order before identifying “if there are appropriate next steps.” At issue is a plan undertaken by Evergy after Elliott Management Corp. bought into Evergy last year with a stated goal of raising the company’s profitability and stock prices.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Kentucky officials spent nearly $1 million to replace office furniture for hundreds of legislative staffers who work out of the state Capitol and Capitol Annex in Frankfort. The Lexington Herald-Leader reported that Mike Wynn, spokesperson for the General Assembly’s Legislative Research Commission, said the purchase was necessary. “In short, we’ve reached a tipping point,” Wynn said. “Our furniture is more than a decade old, and many items have suffered significant wear over the years. It’s now cheaper to replace those items than repair them.” Fifty executive desks were bought for nearly $1,350 each. Meanwhile, more than 290 bookcases were bought for $815 each and 276 guest chairs were $339 each. No new furniture was purchased for lawmakers and their staffers.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A New Orleans museum plans to launch an elaborate nighttime sound-and-light show next year to showcase individual stories of bravery and sacrifice during World War II. The National WII Museum plans to premier its Expressions of America show on Veterans Day in 2022. It will use music, art installations and projections of what the museum calls “living murals” on the various facades of the expansive museum in downtown New Orleans. The plan is to draw from the museum’s archives to tell personal stories of soldiers, nurses and chaplains who served, their loved ones and others who played a role on the home front, including factory workers, artists and entertainers. The show also will feature actor and veterans advocate Gary Sinise. Expressions of America is being produced at an estimated cost of about $5\n\nmillion, according to museum spokesman Keith Darcey. It will be sponsored by the Bob & Dolores Hope Foundation, a charitable organization founded in the name of the late comedian who famously entertained troops overseas, and his wife.\n\nMaine\n\nBucksport: A proposed salmon farm located at the site of the former Verso paper mill in Bucksport has not started construction despite receiving the necessary permits two years ago. A spokesperson for the company, Whole Oceans – which proposed the land-based aquaculture facility located on 100 acres along the Penobscot River – could not provide an update on when construction would start, the Bangor Daily News reported. The project received permits from the Bucksport Planning Board and approval from the Maine Department of Environmental Protection in 2019. In 2020, the company bought a second plot of land at the old mill site that it said meant it needed to review its plans. Bucksport Code Enforcement Officer Luke Chiavelli told the newspaper he had not received any applications related to construction on the second plot. The current approvals are valid for five years. The company is in compliance with permits and has paid its taxes, Susan Lessard, the Bucksport town manager, told the newspaper. She said the company told her they were in the process of hiring a CEO and there have been multiple previous changes in the company’s leadership in the past three years, the newspaper reported.\n\nMaryland\n\nEaston: Officials on Maryland’s Eastern Shore have voted to award a contract to remove a Confederate monument from a courthouse lawn and relocate it. The Talbot County Council voted unanimously to award a contract for the removal of the “Talbot Boys” statue and its relocation to a Virginia battlefield, news outlets reported. The council also passed an amendment that would allow submissions of alternative local sites for the monument until Dec. 6. The statue dedicated in 1916 commemorates more than 80 soldiers who fought for the Confederacy. It’s thought to be the last Confederate monument still standing on public property in Maryland besides cemeteries and battlefields. The contract was awarded to Washington, D.C.-based contractor Stratified for $67,000, an amount contingent on the project being funded by the Mid-Shore Community Foundation. No county funds are required for the bid.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A man has pleaded guilty to his role in a conspiracy to transport drugs and cash using secret compartments inside tractor trailers. Jamil Roman, 44, of Chicopee was indicted in 2016. He pleaded guilty on Tuesday in federal court in Springfield to conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute cocaine. He is scheduled to be sentenced in March. In 2014, Roman, who owned an auto body shop, and a co-defendant, Javier Gonzalez, conspired to distribute cocaine in western Massachusetts, prosecutors said. Roman admitted to meeting with Gonzalez and conspiring to collect a debt owed for the cocaine, which was part of a larger load obtained from a Mexican supply source. Law enforcement officers seized about $1.17\n\nmillion in cash from a hidden compartment inside a tractor trailer being driven by Gonzalez to Texas as payment for the drugs, prosecutors said. Gonzalez was sentenced in October to 21/2 years in prison and fined $20,000.\n\nMichigan\n\nEast Lansing: In the wake of the death of a Michigan State University student two weekends ago, the school and the Pi Alpha Phi national organization have suspended the school’s chapter of the fraternity. The student, identified as Phat Nguyen, died early Nov. 20 at a residence off campus. An autopsy was conducted but the Office of the Medical Examiner at Sparrow Hospital said the cause of death would not be determined until toxicology results are completed in six to eight weeks. Authorities have said alcohol consumption might have been a factor and shortly after the incident, the East Lansing Police Department said its officers had responded to the scene where four people were “passed out,” including one who was not breathing. According to the Lansing State Journal, Nguyen’s death came a day after the fraternity posted on its Facebook page that he was one of four students who had just joined the chapter.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: President Joe Biden is scheduled to visit the Twin Cities suburb of Rosemount on Tuesday to tout his $1 trillion infrastructure plan. The president has been making multiple stops across the country to highlight the infrastructure package. The White House has projected the package will deliver $4.5\n\nbillion to Minnesota for highways, $800\n\nmillion for public transportation and about $300\n\nmillion for bridge work over a five-year span, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported. The state also is in line for $680\n\nmillion for water projects, at least $100\n\nmillion for broadband expansion and about $297\n\nmillion for airport infrastructure. Biden won Minnesota by about 7 percentage points in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nMississippi\n\nOcean Springs: Mississippi is unveiling a new app that’s designed to store someone’s driver license on their phone. The app is being billed as a safe and effective way to make sure your ID is always on you, WLOX-TV reported. However, state officials said people will still need a physical driver license to show if requested when they are stopped by law enforcement. Another exception listed on the program’s website is boarding an airplane. Still, there’s a “growing list” of businesses and state agencies that accept the Mississippi Mobile ID, state officials said. “Vendors can accept the Mobile ID with confidence, as information on the digital ID can be verified against what is on file with the Department of Public Safety and will always be accurate and up-to-date,” the program’s website stated. Residents’ information is secure and can only be accessed with their fingerprint or face ID, officials with the Department of Public Safety said. Mississippi Mobile ID is voluntary, and residents may continue relying on their physical ID. More information about the program is available at www.driverservicebureau.dps.ms.gov/mobile-id/\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: The city’s embattled police chief’s last day on the job will be in April, a draft agreement obtained by The Kansas City Star showed. The letter was written after Chief Rick Smith met last week with Mayor Quinton Lucas and Board of Police Commissioners president, Mark Tolbert. The meeting came just four days after a Jackson County found Det. Eric DeValkenaere guilty of involuntary manslaughter in the 2019 shooting death of Cameron Lamb. Capt. Leslie Foreman, a spokeswoman for the department said in a statement Smith would retire sometime in 2022. She said Smith made a commitment to stay in the position no more than five years when he was hired in August 2017. But the new letter, which is addressed to Smith from Tolbert, provided more details. It said Smith will announce his retirement to the public on March 1, that his last day will be April 22 and that he will be compensated at his current salary through Aug. 31. Smith earns about $191,000 per year as chief. There have been repeated calls for Smith to resign, including during last year’s racial justice protests. Smith’s departure is expected to come up when the police board meets Monday in a closed session.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: The value of livestock killed by predators such as grizzly bears and wolves is expected to exceed the budget for compensating ranchers for such losses this year, the Montana Livestock Loss Board said. George Edwards, the board’s executive director, said 331 head of livestock have been killed this year by wolves, grizzlies and mountain lions. With more than $262,000 in payouts having been made through Nov. 23, Edwards told The Billings Gazette he doesn’t think the state’s $300,000 annual budget will be enough to cover all the losses. Claims for animals killed by grizzly bears have been increasing in recent years. Six years ago, reported grizzly bear kills of cattle was 50 head, with another 16 probable kills. So far this year, there have been 80 confirmed kills and another 35 that are probable. Wolves also kill sheep, and mountain lions kill sheep and goats. The Montana Legislature started the Livestock Loss Program in 2007 to compensate ranchers for animals lost to grizzly bears and wolves. Mountain lions were added to the predators list and the legislature increased the compensation program’s annual budget from $200,000 to $300,000 in 2019.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Students at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln could be required to log into an online class or watch a recorded lecture from home when bad weather strikes. The Lincoln Journal Star reported a new policy gives UNL the option to require students to follow “instructional continuity plans.” The new policy goes into effect Jan. 3, the start of winter interim classes at UNL. The change comes after heavy snow earlier this year forced UNL to call off classes during an already compressed spring semester schedule. Faculty leaders and others asked for the option, and a plan was developed by the Faculty Senate, Association of Students of the University of Nebraska, and campus administrators. Instructors can choose how they want classes to continue in the event of inclement weather, while adhering to the same schedule and ensuring to make the option available for all students.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Residents of a rural, Republican-leaning town that the Nevada Legislature split into two Assembly districts filed a lawsuit last week challenging the state’s district maps. John Koenig and Gregory Hafen II, a Republican who represents Pahrump in the Statehouse, argued that the maps passed by the Democratic-controlled Legislature and signed into law by Gov. Steve Sisolak are drawn in a way that denies voters their right to elect representatives of their choice. The maps split rural Nye County into three state Assembly districts and Pahrump – its largest city – into two. The lawsuit filed in Carson City court said that combining Nye County voters into a district with more urban communities in the Las Vegas area dilutes their voting power and makes it unlikely that they’ll be able to choose a representative committed to their interests. A representative from a distant county, they said in the lawsuit, “will have little understanding of Pahrump’s and Nye County’s unique and local problems and issues and as such will be unable to adequately represent the needs and interests of Pahrump’s and Nye County’s rural voters.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nKittery: The final submarine in the Navy’s Los Angeles class arrived at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard last week for scheduled system upgrades and maintenance work. With more than 140 crew members aboard, the USS Cheyenne docked at the shipyard. Its home base is in Groton, Connecticut, from where it traveled. Portsmouth Naval Shipyard announced the Cheyenne is the third naval ship to be named after the Wyoming city, as well as the first of its class to partake in the Navy’s service-life extension program. Portsmouth Naval Shipyard spokesperson Gary Hildreth said the maintenance of the submarine is expected to last 30 months at a cost of approximately $315\n\nmillion. At 360 feet long and with a dead weight of 927 tons, the USS Cheyenne is capable of supporting military missions that include “anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface ship warfare, strike warfare, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance,” according to the shipyard’s statement. The Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company was awarded the contract to build the submarine in the fall of 1989, leading to its construction beginning July 6, 1992. The USS Cheyenne was commissioned Sept. 13, 1996.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nWildwood: One of the Jersey Shore’s most popular boardwalks is undergoing repairs designed to better prepare it for next year’s summer crowds. Wildwood has begun repairing several blocks of its wooden walkway, as famous for the motorized tram cars that carry people up and down it as for the gigantic expanses of sand that stretch to the ocean. The first $4\n\nmillion of what could be a $30\n\nmillion to $40\n\nmillion project is being done solely with state funds included in this year’s budget. The walkway is particularly popular with tourists from Philadelphia and its suburbs. Engineers examined the concrete substructure of the walkway and determined that not all of it was in bad shape. An examination of the boardwalk’s underbelly by local and state officials in 2019 found some spots where concrete crumbled to the touch. But the overall assessment of the substructure cleared the way for less expensive plans to repair the sections most in need of work, Mayor Pete Byron said. Work started last week on a three-block section. Eventually, 20 of the boardwalk’s 26 blocks will be refurbished, a process that could take five years, with work done in the offseason to avoid interfering with tourist season.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Several members of New Mexico’s congressional delegation are urging the U.S. Forest Service to again allow a decades-old foot race that goes through a wilderness area and up into mountains overlooking Albuquerque. A letter by Sens. Martin Heinrich and Ben Ray Lujan and Rep. Melanie Stansbury asked the agency to reverse its 2020 decision that the La Luz Trail Race wouldn’t be permitted under the Cibola National Forest’s draft land and resource management plan. The lawmakers wrote that the 9-mile event held annually for more than 55 years “is a point of pride for New Mexicans and an important source of recreation and tourism.” The race, which attracted hundreds of runners, started in the foothills of the Sandia Mountains on the outskirts of Albuquerque and finished at Sandia Crest after an elevation gain of more than 4,000 feet. In a 2020 announcement, Sandia District Ranger Crystal Powell said officials had determined that the race should not have been permitted in the wilderness area because it was a commercial event.\n\nNew York\n\nPoughkeepsie: A second gun buyback event through the state Attorney General’s Office in less than six months is scheduled in the city for Dec. 4. Letitia James’ office is holding the event, in association with the city police department, from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. at Beulah Baptist Church at 92 Catharine St. The amount residents can receive depends on the gun they bring, with the range beginning at $25 for a nonworking or antique gun, followed by $75 for a rifle or shotgun, $150 for a handgun and $250 for an assault rifle. Participants will receive a prepaid gift card at the church. Participants can trade in as many guns as they wish. Weapons must be unloaded and transported inside a plastic bag, paper bag or box. Licensed gun dealers and active or retired law enforcement officers are not allowed to participate in the program. Identification is not required to take part, and no questions will be asked. The Poughkeepsie City School District was forced to close its high school for several days after a shooting on Forbus Street roughly a half-hour after dismissal Nov. 15. City police said 40 to 50 people were in the area of the shooting. No injuries were reported. A 13-year-old found by police that day is in a juvenile facility, charged with criminal possession of a weapon.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nConcord: A fire has destroyed 60 guitars and up to 100 paintings at the North Carolina home of Jim Avett. He is the father of Scott and Seth Avett of the Avett Brothers band. The Charlotte Observer reported the fire occurred Friday in the city of Concord. “The fire started from a golf cart,” Jim Avett posted on Facebook. “Half the house is totally beyond repair.” Officials said that arriving firefighters saw “heavy fire from the garage” and entered the house to keep the flames from spreading. No one was injured, although Jim Avett said a cat was missing. The Avett Brothers, a three-time Grammy Award nominee, are based in North Carolina and have a national following. Jim Avett said on Facebook the blaze is “not a knockout punch.” “We have the strength, attitude, faith and abilities to move forward,” he wrote. “And we will!”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: An agency key to implementing new in-state investment components of North Dakota’s $8.3 billion oil tax savings has a new leader. The State Investment Board recently named Retirement and Investment Office interim Executive Director Jan Murtha to take over the role on a permanent basis, the Bismarck Tribune reported. The office oversees about $20\n\nbillion of assets. Murtha, who is an attorney, has led the agency in the interim role since June, when Dave Hunter resigned for a job in Alabama. Murtha was hired in 2020 and previously was the office’s deputy executive director and chief retirement officer. The agency is key to effecting new in-state investment mandates of the Legacy Fund approved by the Legislature, which include making investments in companies in the state. During the Legislature’s special session earlier this month, state lawmakers approved an additional six full-time employees and $1.8\n\nmillion for salaries and expenses. Murtha has said those resources will help the office meet the new investment requirements.\n\nOhio\n\nLima: The city is about to swear in Democrat Sharetta Smith as its first female and first Black mayor. Smith will take her oath of office Monday at the city’s Veterans Memorial Civic and Convention Center. She defeated Republican Elizabeth Hardesty on Nov. 2 after the two topped a four-way primary in May.Smith succeeds retiring eight-term Mayor David Berger, who has led the city since 1989. She most recently served as his chief of staff. An attorney, Smith previously served as an assistant public defender and criminal court magistrate.\n\nOklahoma\n\nEnid: The dedication for the world’s tallest fresh-cut Christmas tree, a 140-foot Douglas fir, took place Friday night during the opening ceremony for “The One,” a 42-day Christmas event at 150 W Park Ave. In recent days, a special crew from California used boom lift aerial equipment to decorate the tree with more than 20,000 LED lights. Crew members also braved the Oklahoma winds to add about 10,000 ornaments for a show-stopping effect. And an Enid florist shop owner and local volunteers decorated numerous smaller trees that formed a brightly colored ring around the tree. Kyle Williams, chief executive officer of Hammer Williams Co,. said he and his wife Carol came up with the idea for “The One” extravaganza with their four grown children. They envisioned a series of concerts, plays and other activities to take place around a huge tree in downtown Enid. About two years ago, the Williams family did some research to determine where the tallest fresh-cut Christmas trees were featured in previous years. Williams said he found that the giant trees were often the highlight of elaborate holiday scenes created at outlet malls and casinos across the country. And then there was the large fresh-cut Christmas tree famously featured each year at New York City’s Rockefeller Plaza.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Oregonians will soon have more options for camping – especially those looking for a quick trip – as the state parks department works to complete details on a capital improvement plan. Oregon Public Broadcasting reported staff in the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department recently outlined some of the plans at a Parks and Recreation Commission meeting. Park Services Manager Matt Rippee said expanded campgrounds are in the works for several state parks in the Willamette Valley, including Silver Falls and Champoeg. “It also gives folks an opportunity, if a big storm comes through in the middle of the night, or a baby is crying, they can hop in the car and head home, and it’s not a four hour drive,” he said. The expansion is part of an approved $50 million, by state lawmakers, to fund a series of projects over the next five years. In addition, as part of the package the iconic Smith Rock State Park is set to receive $4 million to $6 million for upgrades throughout the park – including added parking, extended hiking trails and a visitor center.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention dropped its percentage of vaccinated adults in Pennsylvania by nearly 5 percentage points in what apparently was a data correction to weed out duplicates. The agency adjusted the percentage to 68.9%, after a day earlier putting the percentage at 73.7% of Pennsylvanians 18 and older. The downward revision amounted to a reduction of about 1.2\n\nmillion doses. Pennsylvania’s Department of Health said it sends its data to the CDC, and began in July to refine its data to remove duplicate information and correct data on first, second and booster doses. The data correction came as infections, hospitalizations and intensive-care unit cases are rising in Pennsylvania and many other states. The department said there are 3,349 people hospitalized with COVID-19 in Pennsylvania, up about 21% in November. That includes 763 in the ICU, up about 17% in November. More than 33,000 people in Pennsylvania have died from COVID-19, according to Department of Health data.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Gov. Dan McKee said the annual holiday celebration and tree lighting at the State House will take place at 5 p.m. on Thursday on the south lawn. The tree will be lit at 6:15 p.m. Two Christmas trees will be on display at the State House. A 12-foot Douglas fir from Henry’s Christmas Tree Farm in Scituate will be outside the State House and an 18-foot artificial tree will be inside the State House. The Douglas fir was purchased with donations from several local businesses and the artificial tree was purchased with funds from the 2017 National Governors Association conference, McKee said. Keeping a real tree alive inside the State House has proved challenging. In 2005, the tree turned brown and shed all its needles. In 2017 the tree died 10 days before Christmas. The governor’s office purchased an artificial tree in 2019. After the tree is lit, McKee and first lady Susan McKee will read “The Night Before Christmas.” The celebration features performances by Billy Gilman, the Cumberland Clef Singers, the Paul Cuffee Lower School Chorus and the Rhode Island Army National Guard’s “Governor’s Own” 88th Army Band. Unwrapped toys will be collected to benefit local children in need. Santa Claus and Mrs. Claus are also scheduled to appear to take socially-distanced photos with children.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: More loggerhead turtle nests were counted on South Carolina beaches this year than in 2020, according to state Department of Natural Resources data. The Post and Courier of Charleston reported officials counted more than 5,600 sea turtle nests this year, with data still being compiled. The final 2020 count was 5,560. That remains below the state’s two biggest years, with 6,446 in 2016 and 8,774 in 2019. The state’s first nest was reported on May 5 on Seabrook Island. The town of Kiawah Island said its last nest was counted Oct. 10. In July, volunteers found a rare two-headed sea turtle hatchling while conducting an inventory at Edisto Beach. As far as the park specialists know, this was a first for the beach. The turtle was released into the Atlantic Ocean. Loggerheads are the Palmetto State’s primary nesting sea turtles. But the department this year reported a Kemp’s ridley nest and five green sea turtle nests. Last year, 16% of nests were washed away, including some by Hurricane Isaias, said state DNR state sea turtle coordinator Michelle Pate. This year, 3.4% of eggs were lost. Pate said a larger share of lost eggs were eaten by predators this year, including coyotes, foxes and raccoons.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nDeadwood: The addition of sports betting helped drive a 20% revenue increase for Deadwood casinos in October, according to new state data. The Rapid City Journal reported that a report from the South Dakota Commission on Gaming showed the casinos generated 20.54% more revenue last month than in October 2020. Gamblers shelled out more than $116\n\nmillion for slots, $8.3\n\nmillion for table game bets and $815,036 in sports bets. Sports betting became legal in South Dakota in July. Betting began in early September after the gaming commission approved a list of sporting events that gamblers can wager on, including the Olympics, professional and college sports. Five Deadwood casinos offered sports betting in October, paying out just over $98,000. Most bets were placed on professional and college football. Overall, gamblers spent almost $1.3\n\nbillion in Deadwood casinos through the first 10 months of the year. That’s up nearly 40% from 2021, when the COVID-19 pandemic forced casinos to close temporarily. Slot machines paid out more than $10.8\n\nmillion in winnings and table games yielded almost $1.5\n\nmillion in winnings, mostly from blackjack and house-banked poker, according to the report.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A woman attacked two flight attendants on a Spirit Airlines flight to Nashville on Saturday night, was restrained by a fellow passenger, and then yelled at police officers to “shoot me” when they arrested her. Airport police arrested a 42-year old female for public intoxication after the flight crew contacted officers on the ground at Nashville International Airport about 7 p.m., an arrest affidavit said. The flight took off from Fort Lauderdale at about 6 p.m., according to Spirit Airlines spokesperson Nicole Aguiar and FlightAware, a flight tracking website. When the plane arrived, members of the crew told officers that she attacked two flight attendants, punching one and pulling the other’s hair. Aguiar did not comment on details in the affidavit but said law enforcement officers removed “a passenger for unruly behavior.” When the passenger deplaned, another passenger was restraining her feet with zip ties, the affidavit said. She smelled of alcohol, spoke in a slurred manner, and her eyes were bloodshot. She told officers she drank “a lot,” the affidavit said. After police arrested her, she yelled at the officers on several occasions, using expletives and saying “I didn’t do anything wrong” and “shoot me,” according to the affidavit. The passenger also resisted getting into the police cruiser, including by stiffening her legs to prevent officers from closing the door. Davidson County Sheriff’s Office jail logs showed she was admitted into jail on at 8:40 p.m. Saturday, but she was released 6 a.m., Sunday.\n\nTexas\n\nKilleen: An invasive underwater weed is spreading in a central Texas lake popular with anglers, tangling boat propellers and threatening fish. The weed is hydrilla, an aquatic plant initially imported and sold as an aquarium plant in the 1950s that has become one of the world’s most invasive plants. Fishing guide Bob Maindelle said its presence is at a record level in Stillhouse Hollow Lake, about 13 miles southeast of Killeen. “So much hydrilla has now grown in Stillhouse that entire coves are now completely inaccessible to boating anglers because the matted vegetation entangles the propellers of both outboard engines and electric trolling motors, thus prohibiting access,” Maindelle wrote recently in the Killeen Daily Herald. The plants are spread by uncleaned boats and form thick mats on water surfaces, changing their pH levels, stripping them of oxygen, restricting native plant growth, blocking nutrients for aquatic animals, and hindering irrigation, recreation and water flow, according to the Texas Invasive Species Institute. It also can damage water quality and foster the growth of toxic blue-green algae. Such algae were linked to the recent sudden deaths of multiple dogs at nearby Belton Lake.\n\nUtah\n\nPanguitch: A minor earthquake struck parts of southern Utah on Friday morning. The quake had a preliminary magnitude of 3.0 and was centered about 7 miles west of Panguitch, the U.S. Geological Survey said. It happened at about 6:40 a.m. Quakes of that magnitude are among the smallest generally felt by people.\n\nVermont\n\nStrafford: A final total of the cost of cleaning up the long-abandoned Elizabeth copper mine in Strafford came in more than four times the original estimate, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said. The Valley News reported that when the Superfund project to clean up the mine began in 2002, its estimated cost, in today’s dollars, was $25\n\nmillion. When the the cleanup was completed earlier this year the final price tag, released last week, came in at $103\n\nmillion. Ed Hathaway, the EPA’s Elizabeth Mine project manager, said “cost increases are very common” in the Superfund program. “We’re not building a house. We essentially are unwrapping the site as we clean it up. … As we excavate and as we do work, we uncover more of the challenges,” Hathaway said. In 2001 the EPA designated the abandoned 250-acre copper mine a Superfund site. Acid- and metal-contaminated water from the site contaminated nearby streams. Copper ore was first discovered in the area in the 1790s. Mining operations waxed and waned over the decades with economic conditions. The mine closed in 1958, leaving behind 7,800 feet of tunnels; abandoned buildings; equipment; huge piles of rock, known as tailings; and other mining debris. After the mine closed, contaminated water leached from waste rock and tailings into nearby streams, endangering animals and homes nearby.\n\nVirginia\n\nRoanoke: Police are seeing an increase in thefts of catalytic converters from automobiles across the nation and in parts of Virginia. Roanoke County police officer Greg Benton told The Roanoke Times that he didn’t think catalytic converter thefts have “ever been this prolific.” Catalytic converters filter pollutants from car exhaust. They’re made with valuable precious metals and sit on the underside of a vehicle. They can be removed in a matter of minutes with a machine-powered saw. In July, insurance provider State Farm said it had seen a three-fold jump in the number of catalytic converter claims filed over the past year. The National Insurance Crime Bureau also said that the average monthly thefts across the nation had soared to 1,203 in 2020. There were 282 a month in 2019. In Roanoke City, 182 converters were reported stolen by the end of October. In all of 2020, there were about 16 thefts. In Roanoke County, Benton said thieves had made off with about 30 converters at once. Car owners can take precautions by parking in well-lit, visible areas. Illegally removing a catalytic converter can be done quickly – but not quietly. The sawing tends to make a racket.\n\nWashington\n\nBellingham: Residents throughout the state were preparing for possible flooding as “atmospheric rivers” again threatened parts of the Northwest, which saw heavy damage from extreme weather earlier this month. People in the small communities of Sumas and Everson in northwest Washington were asked to voluntarily evacuate Saturday night, The Bellingham Herald reported. Both towns near the Canadian border saw extreme flooding from the previous storm. Flood watches were issued for much of western and north-central Washington and the National Weather Service warned that flooding was possible through Sunday. Heavy rain and rising rivers were also expected in the Cascade mountains in the center of the state and the Olympic mountains near the coast. Meteorologists predicted the rain would taper off Sunday and that Monday should be relatively dry.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: FirstEnergy Corp. has applied to build five solar energy projects throughout its West Virginia service territory. The Akron, Ohio-based utility company estimated the projects, if approved by West Virginia regulators, would generate 50 megawatts of power, the Charleston Gazette-Mail reported. The plans comply with a 2020 bill passed by the state legislature that permits electric utilities to own and operate up to 200 megawatts of renewable generation facilities. They would not displace the company’s current coal-fired generation capacity, the newspaper reported. The application was submitted through FirstEnergy’s two subsidiaries, Mon Power and Potomac Edison. Construction could begin as early as 2022, with all projects expected to be completed by 2025. The sites include a 26-acre reclaimed ash disposal site in Berkeley County, a 51-acre site adjacent to a Mon Power substation in Hancock County, a 95-acre site in Monongalia County and a 44-acre reclaimed strip mine property in Tucker County. A fifth location is under review.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A community group is urging city officials to back off on plans to shut down a homeless encampment in a city park. City officials have posted notices that camping won’t be allowed in Reindahl Park on Madison’s east side after Dec. 6 and all tents, structures and belongings must be removed from the park by Dec. 9. The encampment has seen more than 70 people at times and has been declared unsanitary, unhealthy and unsafe after a number of attacks and overdoses, a stabbing and a shooting. The city wants to move people living in the park into shelters and a hotel. The Wisconsin State Journal reported that volunteer group Community Action Against Reindahl Eviction issued a statement Wednesday asking the city to halt the eviction. One of the group’s members, Pearl Foster, said the shelters and the hotel don’t have enough space for all the Reindahl campers and it shouldn’t be a problem to keep the park open because it’s not used for winter sports. Linette Rhodes, the city’s community development grants supervisor, said the city doesn’t want anyone sleeping outside during the winter and she’s confidant that all campers will have a place to go as the city shuts down the park.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: When the Republican-dominated legislature met last month to fight federal COVID-19 vaccination rules, it drew a crowd. That first day, people opposed to the federal rules crammed into the House and Senate galleries, filled two overflow rooms and gathered on the steps of the Capitol. State residents who traveled to Cheyenne fear taking a relatively new vaccine and don’t want to lose their jobs for refusing the shots, said Kristy Tyrney, the head of Wyoming Health Freedom, a grassroots group that rejects vaccine requirements. The scene in Wyoming played out across more than a dozen red-state legislatures in recent weeks as Republican lawmakers and governors pledged to fight President Joe Biden’s new immunization rules. Since September, at least 14 GOP-controlled legislatures have debated bills that would undermine vaccine mandates and passed at least 13 new laws, by Stateline’s count.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/12/27/news-around-states/40892461/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: The deadline is approaching for a company to earn a $15 million bonus for finishing work early on a major bridge project in Alabama’s largest city. Texas-based Johnson Brothers Corp. will get the money if it completes work by Jan. 21 on the new Interstate 59/20 overpasses through Birmingham, state officials told news outlets. But the company will have to pay $250,000 a day if the opening is delayed past March 21. State transportation officials said the work is nearly done, and they will work out a schedule for opening the roads after the holidays. The more than $700 million project is replacing elevated highways built more than 45 years ago to accommodate 80,000 vehicles daily through the heart of downtown. Transportation officials said I-59/20 carried more than twice that number of vehicles before it was closed in January and demolished. The shutdown, which forced drivers to travel around the city on surface streets or Interstate 459, affected a more than mile-long section of I-59/20 from Red Mountain Expressway to Interstate 65. The state said it is keeping an eye on safety as contractors complete work that includes smoothing out the driving surface, installing lighting and adding stripes. Plans call for the area beneath the elevated highway to be used for community spaces including a park and an area for food trucks.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A project that maintains seismic monitoring stations in Alaska needs more funding to continue fully operating, officials said. Scientists, lawmakers and federal agencies are promoting the permanent installation of the Transportable Array Network, The Anchorage Daily News reported Tuesday. The National Science Foundation project was installed temporarily beginning in 2014. The stations can monitor earthquake activity and track weather, wildfires and volcanoes. The system can also detect North Korean nuclear testing, officials said. Many of the network’s stations in northern and western Alaska are set to be removed over the next two years if funding is not secured to maintain them permanently, officials said. The Alaska Earthquake Center at the University of Alaska Fairbanks took more than 43 stations in southeast Alaska in September, officials said. The center operates through an external grant on behalf of the U.S. Geological Survey, but it will need more funds to support the monitoring network for the long term. Permits for the stations will need to be renewed if they stay in the ground, officials said. The Alaska Earthquake Center requested $2.5 million in state funding to help maintain the network, money that would go to the University of Alaska.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:A flash flood watch is in effect for parts of southwestern Arizona through Friday morning as another storm rolls off the Pacific, over California and into the 48th State. The heaviest rainfall was expected Thursday afternoon and evening, according to the National Weather Service. The forecast office in Phoenix said light to moderate rain will spread across southern and central Arizona Thursday night, with some lingering showers and maybe a few thunderstorms on Friday. All of this could be great news for skiers and snowboarders. Another round of snow is forecast to hit northern Arizona late Thursday through Saturday morning, according to the National Weather Service office in Flagstaff, where an additional 4 to 8 inches is expected. The storm that rolled through the state over Christmas dumped 11.8 inches of snow on Flagstaff’s airport as of 5 p.m. Wednesday. Arizona Snowbowl reported 47 of its 48 trails served by ski lifts were open as of Christmas Day.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: An optometrist group is asking the state Supreme Court to reconsider its Dec. 12 ruling that directed the state to count all the signatures submitted in favor of holding a referendum on a law that would allow optometrists to perform a broader range of surgeries. Secretary of State John Thurston had not counted all the signatures because canvassers didn’t file paperwork required under a law enacted earlier this year, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported. However, the court ruled the requirements weren’t in effect when the Safe Surgery Arkansas committee submitted its signatures. The law in question, Act 579, would allow optometrists to perform additional procedures that currently only ophthalmologists can. Much of the debate has focused on whether optometrists have the necessary training. The referendum would allow voters in next year’s general election to decide if Act 579 should take effect. Supporters of the referendum believe eye surgery should only be conducted by medical doctors.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLaguna Beach: A sea lion pup was in critical condition but “still feisty” Wednesday after it fell more than 30 feet from a footbridge onto a highway, officials said. The 33-pound pup, now named “Lords-a-Leaping,” was dehydrated and emaciated when it was rescued Monday night in Laguna Beach by staff from the Pacific Marine Mammal Center, The Orange County Register reported. It did not appear to suffer any fractures or internal injuries. Most animals at the center are considered to be in critical condition for at least a week after they arrive, animal care coordinator Wendy Leeds told the Associated Press. “He is up, he is eating and he is still feisty,” Leeds said. The animal crawled up to the footbridge and jumped onto the shoulder of the highway before staff from Pacific Marine Mammal Center arrived. It was unclear what prompted the pup to head to the footbridge.\n\nColorado\n\nBreckenridge: The town of Breckenridge canceled its New Year’s Eve fireworks display over environmental considerations, officials said. The decision was a continuation of the town’s decision earlier this year to celebrate holidays in ways that have a less environmental impact, Summit Daily reported. The town canceled its 2019 Fourth of July fireworks display, which officials said was a result of concerns about fire safety and potential negative effects on the forest and wildlife. The town council opted to remain consistent with its summer holiday cancellation, Breckenridge spokeswoman Haley Littleton said. Breckenridge Ski Resort has not changed plans to hold its annual New Year’s Eve torchlight parade, in which ski and snowboard instructors carry torches and ride from the top of one of the mountain’s peaks down to the resort village.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Farmers are being asked to suggest ways to improve the state’s Connecticut Grown campaign, an effort to raise awareness about produce and other agricultural products grown and sold in the state. Bryan Hurlburt, the commissioner of Connecticut’s Department of Agriculture said his agency plans to embark on an integrated marketing campaign that will promote Connecticut Grown products during 2020 and beyond. The program was developed to assist producers and retailers of Connecticut farm products by raising awareness and increasing direct-to-consumer and wholesale buying. During his visits to over the past few months to numerous farms and businesses, Hurlburt said he heard a clear message that promotion of the Connecticut Grown brand needs to be improved.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The remains of a 33-year-old American soldier killed in combat in Afghanistan have been returned to the United States on Wednesday, arriving at Dover Air Force. Sgt. 1st Class Michael J. Goble of Washington Township, New Jersey, was killed Monday in a roadside bombing in northern Kunduz province. The Taliban claimed they were behind the attack. Goble was assigned to 1st Battalion, 7th Special Forces Group (Airborne) at the Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. The Pentagon has said Goble’s unit was engaged in combat operations when he suffered fatal injuries. Multiple U.S. officials, including national security adviser Robert O’Brien and Army Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, attended Wednesday what the military calls a dignified transfer in which the cases containing the remains are transferred to a vehicle from the aircraft that ferried them to the United States.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Metro admits it “did not follow safety procedures” – or follow a 2015 guideline from federal investigators – when it sent a Red Line train to investigate sparks on the tracks during Dec. 10’s morning’s rush, WUSA-TV reported. Metro safety watchdogs said riders were put in danger. A transit agency investigation of the incident found that a rail operations controller radioed the operator of Train 130 to check out a track problem near Tenleytown, “but failed to instruct Train 130 to offload its passengers before beginning the inspection.” NTSB investigators said trains carrying passengers should not be used to scope out track issues.\n\nFlorida\n\nCocoa Beach: Who needs a sleigh when you have a surfboard? Some 600 surfers dressed as Santa chose surfboards instead of sleighs on Tuesday during an annual Christmas Eve surfing fundraiser in Cocoa Beach. Almost 10,000 spectators turned out for the 10th Annual Surfing Santas event along Florida’s Space Coast. The surfing fundraiser raised $40,000 for the Florida Surf Museum and a nonprofit that helps people with cancer.\n\nGeorgia\n\nColumbus: A manufacturer of plastic stretch film is planning to open a new manufacturing facility in Georgia. Zummit Plastics, based in Phoenix, is expanding with plans to create 50 jobs and invest $25 million into the project in Columbus, according to the Georgia Department of Economic Development. The location and opening date were not announced, The Columbus Ledger-Enquirer reported.. “This announcement is a fantastic way to wrap up 2019,” said Russ Carreker, chairman of the Development Authority of Columbus. “We are grateful that Zummit Plastics decided to choose Columbus as the place to achieve business success with their environmentally-friendly stretch film products.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: The Hawaii Police Department has gone $3 million over budget primarily because of the necessity of an increased police presence near the site of demonstrations at the Mauna Kea Access Road, an official said. Assistant Chief Samuel Thomas told the Hawaii County Police Commission of the budget overrun Friday, The Hawaii Tribune-Herald reported Wednesday. Since July, demonstrators have blocked access to the summit of Mauna Kea to prevent the construction of a giant telescope. Demonstrators have said the Thirty Meter Telescope could damage land considered sacred by some Native Hawaiians. The department’s increased presence on Daniel K. Inouye Highway has required an increase in officer overtime payments, Thomas said. The county has accrued more than $5 million in law enforcement expenses related to Mauna Kea demonstrations and increased traffic enforcement on the highway, Thomas said. Thomas told commissioners the police budget for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2020, is just more than $70 million, adding that a budget meeting with the county Department of Finance is scheduled for January. The state has spent about $15 million to provide safe access to the mountain, Democratic Gov. David Ige said earlier this month.\n\nIdaho\n\nKetchum: The Idaho Public Utilities Commission rejected a proposed settlement for home and small business solar panels, officials said. The agreement would have changed how Idaho Power Co. customers are credited for the solar power they produce and put into the grid, The Idaho Mountain Express reported Tuesday. The proposed agreement reached in October by Idaho Power, utilities commission staff and seven other entities involved net metering, officials said. Net metering records the amount of power produced by a home power producer relative to the amount the home consumes, officials said. The commission’s Dec. 20 order rejected the settlement agreement, finding the record created from the settlement proceedings was insufficient to support the proposal. The public was not adequately notified the agreement might result in significant changes to Idaho Power’s net metering program, the commission said.\n\nIllinois\n\nAlton: Authorities in southwest Illinois made a Christmas-morning rescue after a woman who climbed up bluffs above a city park got stuck on a ledge for hours. Madison County 911 received a call that a woman could be heard calling for help around 1 a.m. Wednesday, according to The (Alton) Telegraph. Alton Fire Chief Jesse Jemison said a woman climbed the bluffs in a part of Piasa Park with thick wooded brush. He estimated she had been there since 4 p.m. Tuesday and was stranded about 30 feet off the ground in an area with loose rock. Crews used a ladder to rescue her after cutting a path to the woman with a chainsaw, Jemison said. The woman did not appear to have serious injuries, according to the newspaper. Authorities said the woman gave no reason for the attempted climb and was able to walk through thick brush before being transported to an area hospital.\n\nIndiana\n\nBedford: State conservation officers are investigating the deadly shooting of a bald eagle in southern Indiana and offering a reward to anyone with information. The investigation began last week after a landowner notified a Lawrence County animal control officer and officials with the Brown County Indiana Raptor Center of an injured bird. It had suffered an apparent gunshot wound and was treated for injuries but died, officials said. Authorities are seeking help from the public for any information and offered a $1,000 reward. The birds are no longer endangered but remain protected by two federal laws. Under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, a first offense of killing a bald eagle can bring up to a year in prison and a $100,000 fine. The other law is the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Earlier this week, Louisiana wildlife agents said at least one bald eagle might have been killed in the state’s northwest region.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A proposed class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of liquor retailers alleges that the Iowa Alcoholic Beverages Division illegally marked up the price of their products for years. The lawsuit comes days after the division’s former comptroller filed his own lawsuit alleging he was fired for blowing the whistle on the illegal price markups. Attorney Stuart Higgins represents the plaintiffs in both cases. Division spokesman Tyler Ackerson said Monday the agency is consulting with legal counsel and has no comment. He said last week that the allegations filed by former comptroller Todd Halbur were not true. The new lawsuit was filed on behalf of Class E liquor license holders who purchased products from the agency, Iowa’s exclusive wholesaler and distributor of liquor. Those licensees include nearly 1,700 grocery, liquor and convenience stores. State law allows the division to mark up products by 50% above what it paid before selling them to licensees. The lawsuit alleges that the markups that the agency assessed for years was “in excess of the statutory cap” and seeks reimbursement for the overcharges and other damages. It doesn’t elaborate on the amount involved.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Zoo animals in Topeka will soon be making use of castoff live Christmas trees. The city said in a news release that the trees can be dropped off at a special location at Gage Park, where the zoo is located. Zoo Director Brendan Wiley said animals that can benefit from the trees include lions, tigers, owls, mountain lions, giraffes, black bears and painted dogs. Once the animals make use of the trees, they will be ground up and turned into mulch. The trees must be free of ornaments, hooks, tinsel and tree stands. They also can’t be in plastic bags.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Effective next week, motorists with some special license plates will be required to pay an additional charitable donation to the organization represented on the plate. Currently, $10 donations are optional, but starting Monday, the $10 donation will be required. The change affects 29 special license plates, the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet said in a news release. Most special plates already have a donation requirement that will not change. The legislation changing the requirement for special plates was passed during this year’s General Assembly. It also requires approved nonprofit organizations to maintain at least 500 registrations annually for the cabinet to continue producing the plate design. New fees for the 29 special plates will be $44 when first purchased and $44 at annual registration renewal. Currently, the cost is $44 at initial purchase and $31 at annual renewal.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Two elderly sisters have completed their goal of attending mass at every Catholic church in the Archdiocese of New Orleans. It took them nearly 20 years. Beverly Kelly, 84, and her sister, Pat Mahaffey, 88, crossed the final church off their list on Sunday when they attended 11 a.m. mass at the St. Joseph Abbey Church near Covington, The Times-Picayune/New Orleans Advocate reported. It was the 160th church where the sisters attended Mass. That’s more than the 120 churches and chapels in the archdiocese. But some churches have closed since they started their journey. They also went to some churches outside the New Orleans area. They aimed for one church a month, figuring that would take them roughly 10 years, according to the newspaper. But they revisited many churches along the way and were delayed when Hurricane Katrina struck. Two other sisters were part of the effort, but they died. That made Sunday’s Mass emotional. “We were a very close family,” Mahaffey, 88, said. “Sybil (one of the sisters) was sort of the instigator in this church quest. I said a prayer: ‘God, I’m sorry you couldn’t spare her to complete this.’ But I feel she is watching us.”\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A cold snap followed by warming temperatures has left many lakes and ponds in the state with dangerously thin levels of ice, the Maine Warden Service has warned. The service is urging residents to exercise caution before venturing out on any ice-covered Maine waterways. Ice conditions vary widely across the state, and that means residents must check the thickness of ice before going onto it for activities such as ice fishing. The service recommends ice fishermen and others check the ice in different places using an auger or another means of making a “test hole” that gauges thickness. It’s a good idea to make several such holes, the state said. People venturing onto the ice should also bring a partner, avoid areas with currents, look for honeycombed ice and take other safety precautions, the state said.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: The Solid Waste Division of Worcester County will hold its annual collection of Christmas trees through Jan. 31. Area residents can drop off Christmas trees at the Central Landfill in Newark and the Berlin, Pocomoke and Snow Hill Homeowners Convenience Centers at no cost. Businesses and organizations that sold trees will not be permitted to drop off trees at the convenience centers but can take them to the Central Landfill, where applicable tipping fees will be assessed. The trees will be ground into mulch for use at the Central Landfill. For more information, contact Recycling Manager Mike McClung at (410) 632-3177.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Public health officials are seeking organizations to set up centers where people can be monitored after using illicit drugs. These planned “medical observation and monitoring services” would be staffed by nurses and other clinicians, who would monitor the clients’ vital signs, administer oxygen, intravenous fluids, and the overdose-reversing drug naloxone if necessary, the Boston Globe reported Wednesday. The clients will be able to remain anonymous and receive counseling, treatment for infections and wounds, and help with obtaining primary health care and addiction treatment. People will not be allowed to use drugs inside these centers, a marked difference from the concept of “safe consumption sites.” The state’s Department of Public Health is seeking bids to create three to five monitoring sites. Each would serve five to 10 people who have taken too much of a sedative, such as heroin or fentanyl, or a stimulant, such as cocaine or methamphetamine. The site locations have not yet been determined.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: WOOD-TV reported that doctors in Detroit removed a kidney from Logan Bosselaar on Christmas Eve and transplanted it to Vanessa Bosselaar. The surgery had been in the works for weeks. Doctors were surprised that Logan was a perfect transplant match for his 24-year-old wife, who has a serious kidney disease. They live in Kentwood, near Grand Rapids. It’s been a challenging month: The Bosselaars were in a rollover crash after a medical appointment a few weeks ago but had only minor injuries. “The fact that we were OK from our car accident and then to go in and have a successful surgery – that’s amazing,” Logan said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud: Before heading out to deliver presents for Christmas, Santa made a special stop last week at the CentraCare – St. Cloud Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit to visit babies who were dressed for the occasion. The March of Dimes provided the outfits – most of them donated – including tiny hats made by one of CentraCare’s NICU nurses. The bows were also handmade, showing how each baby is a gift to their family. Hospital officials said Tuesday that Santa was expected to return overnight to fill Christmas stockings.\n\nMississippi\n\nVicksburg: Warren County supervisors voted to delay a decision on hauling away flood debris, which could cost the county more than $100,000. A total of 24 homes at Eagle Lake have been demolished by volunteers following flooding. The delay means the next board of supervisors will decide on the move after they are sworn in on Jan. 1 to begin new four-year terms. Water trapped inside a levee system stood for months this year. A floodgate that allows the water to drain from what’s called the Yazoo backwater region was kept closed because it was preventing even worse flooding from the Mississippi River. Under the plan, the county would place dumpsters in the Eagle Lake area to collect debris. That would cut down on the number of time-consuming round trips to the county’s landfill. But county emergency manager John Elfers estimates nearly 250,000 cubic yards of debris needs to be hauled away, equivalent to 305 dumpsters. That would cost the county more than $137,000. Officials say Warren County must pay for the work itself and isn’t eligible for federal disaster reimbursement. Outgoing supervisors asked county employees to make a new estimate of the amount of debris, as well as determine whether it’s all on public rights-of-way. Mississippi counties are barred by state law from working on private property.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Education officials said they have a plan that would not only increase teachers’ pay but also offer raises and attract them to positions that are challenging to fill. The state has one of the worst teacher compensations in the country, ranking at 40th with the average salary of $48,000, according to data from the National Education Association. But a new proposal could lift Missouri up to 26th with an average salary of about $54,000. Paul Katnik, an assistant education commissioner at the state’s Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, presented a nearly $400 million proposal to the State Board of Education during its December monthly meeting. The three-part plan calls for increasing the base pay for teachers from $25,000 to $32,000, offering teachers a $4,000 raise and creating a fund to lure teachers to take on hard-to-fill positions. The fund would allocate $75 million to recruit teachers to work in high-poverty or rural schools or teaching subjects such as high school science or English as a second language classes for immigrants. Education officials, teachers and education associations penned the plan.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: State parks across Montana will offer guided hikes on New Year’s Day as part of the “First Day Hikes” annual tradition across the U.S. Some 55,000 people walked more than 133,000 miles in state parks nationwide on New Year’s Day last year, according to the National Association of State Park Directors. This year, among the Montana parks participating, Missouri Headwaters State Park will offer a 3-mile family friendly loop at 11 a.m. Wednesday, the Bozeman Daily Chronicle reported. The land had been used for thousands of years by the Bannock, Salish, Shoshone, Crow and Blackfeet tribes, according to Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks. The Lewis and Clark expedition camped at the site in 1805 on its way to the Pacific Ocean. Later, the land was used by fur traders as a meeting place. It was also where the state’s first flour mill was built. The mill supplied flour to gold miners throughout southwest Montana. Missouri Headwaters State Park was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960. Participants can meet at the main picnic grounds near the Gallatin River. The hike will begin at 11 a.m. David Andrus, manager of the 532-acre park, said the event will include hot chocolate and toasted bagels beginning at 10 a.m.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Union Pacific is continuing its fight against reinstating a train engineer who defecated on a locomotive connection knuckle. The company filed an appeal last week to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, the Lincoln Journal Star reported. Last month a district judge in Omaha upheld an arbitration board’s decision that the fired engineer should be reinstated because termination was “excessive discipline.” Union Pacific had sued the employee union to overturn the board’s order to put Matthew Lebsack back on the job. The lawsuit says Lebsack walked past the locomotive cab bathroom on Nov. 20, 2016, when the train was stopped. It said he left the locomotive and defecated on the metal knuckle that connected the locomotive to a rail car. U.S. District Court Judge Brian Buescher said in his ruling that he didn’t understand why the board didn’t think Lebsack’s conduct was worthy of upholding his termination. But Buescher also said the law didn’t let him consider the merits of the arbitration board’s decision, but only whether that decision fell within the board’s discretion under the provisions of railroad-union contract. He said Union Pacific presented no evidence showing the board’s decision was not within its discretion.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Veterans Village has announced plans to add 150 affordable units to the Nevada housing community and change its name to SHARE Village Las Vegas. The master-planned community will also be opened to nonveterans, The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported Monday. The nonprofit organization had been planning to expand the affordable housing community, and a fatal fire accelerated the timeline, Veterans Village founder and President Arnold Stalk said. Six people died and 13 were injured Saturday in a fire at Alpine Motel Apartments. A Las Vegas Fire Department official said the blaze was the deadliest in the city’s history. In addition to those killed or injured, 30 to 35 residents were displaced from their homes and were assisted by the American Red Cross. Five of the 13 injured were initially listed in critical condition, including a pregnant woman. The cause of the fire is under investigation, but it appeared to have originated at a stove. There was no evidence of criminal activity, the fire department said. After the Alpine Motel fire, Stalk wanted to “let the public know that we are expanding our mission and services,” he said. SHARE Village Las Vegas also offers year-round crisis intervention centers, medical and mental health services, employment training, nutrition programs, and other services as part of its public-private partnerships.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Two state senators hope to increase accountability and transparency in the budgeting process for the state’s community college system. Sen. Dan Feltes, D-Concord, and Sen. John Reagan, R-Deerfield, sit on the Senate Finance Committee. They expressed concern after the New Hampshire Technical Institute announced that it is laying off 10 people Dec. 27, including senior professors in the departments of English, education, accounting and social science. Although the layoff announcement came after the filing deadline for new legislation, the senators said they will seek some kind of legislative fix to address the issue. College President Gretchen Mullin-Sawicki has said the decision was “very painful, but unfortunately necessary to create a more sustainable institution” at a time when enrollment has dropped 8% in the last year.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nWall Township:A home that caught fire Christmas Day reignited early Thursday morning as multiple fire crews were back on the scene in the southeastern corner of town, Capt. Greg Carpino said in a news release. A video of the fire posted by News 12 showed smoke and flames coming from the second floor of the three-story house at 2379 Peter Court. Smoke could be smelled all around the area toward Point Pleasant Beach because of weather conditions preventing it from escaping into the atmosphere Thursday. The fire had been extinguished again as of 9 a.m. and the cause remains under investigation, Carpino said. Township police said the fire first started around 2:05 p.m. Wednesday. Everyone in the home was accounted for and were uninjured, but a family pet died, according to a GoFundMe page set up for the family. As of Thursday morning, more than $2,000 of the $20,000 goal had been raised. On Wednesday, dozens of emergency vehicles blocked off the cul-de-sac on Peter Court as scores of firefighters worked in and around the smoking house into the late afternoon.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLos Alamos: State officials are planning another public meeting focused on the state’s oversight and scientific monitoring of environmental impacts at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The Environment Department has scheduled the next meeting for Jan. 9 at the University of New Mexico campus in Los Alamos. The focus will be a 2016 agreement the state signed with the U.S. Energy Department regarding the cleanup of contamination and other responsibilities of the lab. The order spells out milestones the lab needs to meet with its cleanup campaigns and establishes corrective actions for the release of hazardous wastes or groundwater contamination. Watchdogs have been critical of the pace of cleanup projects at the northern New Mexico lab. Earlier this year, environmental groups filed a federal lawsuit over water pollution downstream from the lab. The groups asked the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to issue a permit that would specifically regulate urban stormwater runoff from developed areas at the lab, the town of Los Alamos and the nearby community of White Rock.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Gov. Andrew Cuomo proposed Thursday a study to look into what it would take to bring high-speed rail to New York. Cuomo is proposing bringing together outside experts to look at the state’s past reports on high-speed rail and come up with a new plan. The Democrat’s idea was released Thursday as part of the governor’s 2020 State of the State agenda. Cuomo said previous plans over the last two decades have long said high-speed rail projects would take decades and prove too expensive for New York. The governor said most of New York’s population lives along the Amtrak’s Empire Corridor through New York City, Albany and Buffalo, and those lines often average 51 mph. He has said that makes travel on them the “slowest method available for New Yorkers.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The fight over the critically endangered red wolf has returned to court as Gov. Roy Cooper sought immediate help for the dozen or so remaining in the wild and federal biologists planned to transfer wolves into the recovery area for the first time in years. In late November, Cooper sent the secretary of the interior a sharply worded letter warning that, with no more than 14 known wolves in the wild, “the American red wolf is on the brink of extinction.” He noted that in 2019, no litters of red wolf pups were born in the wild for the first time in the history of the reintroduction program. Red wolves once occupied much of the Eastern U.S. but were driven to near-extinction by trapping, hunting and habitat loss before they were reintroduced to North Carolina in 1987. Their range is limited to five North Carolina counties. Another 200 live in captive breeding programs.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nGrand Forks: The Grand Forks Police Department said it has received numerous reports of mail being stolen from residential mailboxes. Two suspected vehicle descriptions have been provided to police. One is a dark colored-sport utility vehicle and the other is a white four-door sedan, according to police Sgt. Mike Jennings. Police have no further details. Jennings said the thefts have happened in the late night and early morning hours in an area south of 24th Avenue and east of 20th Street South. Police are recommending that residents do not leave outgoing mail for pickup in their mailboxes overnight and that they ask the Post Office to hold their mail then they are out of town.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A New York-based sports network has turned to the federal courts in its trademark dispute with Ohio State University over use of the letter “O.” Overtime Sports Inc., an online network focusing on high school basketball and football, has a capital O with sloping corners as its logo. Its application to trademark the logo is pending with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Ohio State asked the company in July to stop using the logo, saying it was too close to its own trademarked octagonal “block O” letter. Overtime Sports disagrees with Ohio State’s position and on Monday filed a federal lawsuit in New York City asking that the university be prohibited from trying to stop the use of the logo. The lawsuit noted that Ohio State’s “O” contains neither rounded edges nor a rectangle in the center, as the company’s logo does. It also argued there’s no danger of someone confusing the letters, and that Overtime Sports has not unfairly competed with Ohio State or violated any of its rights. Ohio State declined to comment on the lawsuit.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A group seeking a public vote on whether to legalize recreational use of marijuana in Oklahoma has temporarily abandoned its effort. The two proponents of the initiative petition – Amy Young and Vanessa Avery – notified the Secretary of State’s office Monday that they were withdrawing the petition they filed earlier this month. Young said in a statement she grew concerned about the impact that recreational marijuana might have on existing medical marijuana businesses and on children who are able to receive medicinal marijuana. A spokeswoman for the group, Michelle Tilley, said they plan to rewrite the petition to include greater protections for the medical marijuana industry and submit it again. If passed, it would amend the Oklahoma Constitution to allow adult use of marijuana and impose a 15% tax on the sale of marijuana, in addition to state and local taxes. Oklahoma’s medical marijuana program launched last year and has been wildly successful, with more than 220,000 patients and 1,500 dispensary licenses issued so far.\n\nOregon\n\nBend: Authorities are searching for a skier from California who went missing while skiing at an Oregon resort on Christmas Day. The search for Ashlee Gingerich began around 5 p.m. Wednesday when Deschutes County deputies were alerted she had not reunited with her skiing partners at Mt. Bachelor. The Ski Patrol swept all the runs right away and did not find her. Deschutes County Search and Rescue professionals and volunteers then got involved. The search resumed early Thursday. KOIN reported that Gingerich, 30, was last seen around 3:40 p.m. Wednesday.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nNorth Huntingdon: Police said a western Pennsylvania woman and her boyfriend were both charged with assault for a fight she said began when he found her wrapping presents for another boyfriend. The Tribune-Review said Daniel W. Hill and Diedra L. Dibucci, both 50 years old, were arrested after the incident in the North Huntingdon apartment they shared. Police answered a call about a man with a knife and had to force their way inside. That’s where they said they found Hill on the floor, with injuries and scratches to his face and neck. Dibucci told officers Hill threw a chair at her and grabbed a kitchen knife. Hill was charged with aggravated assault and resisting arrest. He was jailed after failing to post bail. An attorney was not listed for him in court records. Court records indicated Dibucci faces an assault charge. She did not appear to have a listed phone number.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Mayor Jorge Elorza, who has three years left in his second mayoral term, is considering a run for governor in 2022. He said he still has to consider various factors, including whether he can raise enough money to compete in what will likely be a competitive Democratic primary field, The Boston Globe reported. Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo won’t be able to run in 2022 because of term limits. Elorza has more than $600,000 in his campaign account. Treasurer Seth Magaziner, Lieutenant Gov. Daniel McKee, Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea are widely expected to run in the Democratic primary for governor in 2022.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nAndrews: Members of Spirit Filled Ambassadors for Christ church said someone broke into a building they use for gatherings and set several fires. Someone also broke nearly all the windows on a church bus sometime early Sunday morning, Pastor Deshawn Rouse said. Several tablecloths in the Georgetown County church’s Executive Hall were set on fire. Pictures posted to the church’s Facebook page show burned tables, soot on the walls and other damage. The church’s sanctuary was not damaged, so services went on even with heavy hearts, Rouse told WMBF-TV. The State Law Enforcement Division is helping Andrews Police investigate the fire and vandalism. The state agency has been called in to investigate most church fires in South Carolina since a series of blazes at houses of worship in the 1990s. Rouse said the FBI has also been called in to help the investigation at the predominately African American church, also something that routinely happens in arson cases with mostly black congregations.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nCuster: An acting supervisor has been selected for the Black Hills National Forest until a replacement is named for the outgoing leader. Andrew Johnson, the supervisor of the Bighorn National Forest in Wyoming, will manage the South Dakota wildness area for up to four months, the Forest Service said. The current supervisor, Mark Van Every, is retiring next week. Johnson will start on Jan. 6. The Black Hills National Forest covers 1.2 million acres in western South Dakota and northeastern Wyoming. Offices are located in Sundance and Newcastle, Wyoming, and Custer, Rapid City and Spearfish in South Dakota.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville:A new poll shows Tennessee voters strongly support the spending of federal dollars to provide child care options. As well, voters want to see increased early childhood education opportunities in the state, according to the poll released on Wednesday by Tennesseans for Quality Early Education. The poll comes days after a Vanderbilt University survey also showed similar results – that voters support spending the state’s federal grant reserves to subsidize child care for low-income workers. The TQEE survey found 71% of voters said the state should use all of the federal funding it receives because there are not enough quality, affordable child care options for families. The poll conducted by Public Opinion Strategies surveyed 600 likely Tennessee voters from Nov. 18-21 and sampled voters across the state’s political, demographic and geographic lines, according to a news release. Overall, 93% of state voters view early childhood education – including the role of child care – as a bedrock to the short- and long-term success of children.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: A Texas woman who drove to Mexico to deliver Christmas gifts to a sprawling refugee camp housing people waiting for U.S. court dates said Wednesday she was detained by authorities there for two days. Anamichelle Castellano said she and another volunteer for her nonprofit group were stopped Monday at a bridge crossing from Brownsville, Texas, to Matamoros, Mexico. She said authorities discovered a small box of ammunition inside the car she was driving, which she said was left inside by her husband. Mexico has strict laws against entering the country with guns or ammunition. Those laws occasionally ensnare Americans crossing the border. Castellano said she spent Monday night sleeping on a couch with her 9-year-old daughter in a government office. She gave a statement Tuesday to someone she believed to be a prosecutor, then was allowed to leave a few hours later. The prosecutor’s office in Mexico’s Tamaulipas state did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Utah firefighters are among the U.S. federal and state personnel who have traveled to Australia to help stop brush fires that have prompted a national emergency, officials said. Five federal agencies and 10 states including Utah have sent 21 firefighters to Australia, The Deseret News reported Tuesday. The state of emergency was declared because of a massive fire near Sydney, with other national park and mountain fires expected to fuse as brush fires continue to spread across 1,563 square miles of Australia, authorities said. The fires have been fueled by 25 mph winds amid temperatures reaching 113 degrees, officials said.\n\nVermont\n\nRutland: Two women have started a pet food pantry to assist animal owners in need. Linda Groce and Theresa Jones opened the pantry Dec. 17 and plan to keep it open until January, the Rutland Herald reported. Groce said she was inspired by a similar effort in another city. The pantry will accept pet food donations Monday through Thursday. If the pantry continues to do well, and if space permits, the pair would like to bring it back next year, Groce said. Leftover donations will be donated to the Rutland Cupboard, local rescue organizations and the Feline Connection.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A lawmaker has filed a bill that would scrap the state’s Lee-Jackson holiday celebrating two Confederate generals and add one on Election Day. Del. Joseph Lindsey’s measure is one of hundreds lawmakers will consider when they convene next month for the start of the 2020 legislative session. Lee-Jackson Day, established more than 100 years ago, is observed annually on the Friday preceding the third Monday in January. It honors Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson, both native Virginians. For a time, the holiday was merged with the one celebrating the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. But the 2000 General Assembly brought an end to Lee-Jackson-King Day when it voted to create a separate holiday for King. Critics of the Lee-Jackson holiday view it as a celebration of the state’s slave-holding history that’s offensive to African Americans. Many cities and counties have opted not to observe it. Lindsey, a Democrat whose district includes Norfolk and Virginia Beach, is the new chair of the House privileges and elections committee. He is the first black lawmaker to serve in that role, according to the legislative black caucus.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The state Supreme Court has unanimously ruled that drivers must use their signal every time they turn or change lanes on a roadway. Thursday’s ruling reverses a Court of Appeals ruling that said a signal is required only when public safety is affected. The high court ruled that the plain language of the law requires drivers “to ensure turns and lane changes are done safely and with an appropriate turn signal.” The ruling was issued in the case of David Brown, who was arrested for driving under the influence in Kennewick in March 2015. State patrol officers pulled him over after he briefly turned on his left turn signal while approaching a light in a designated left turn lane but turned it off and did not reactivate it while at the light or making the turn. He was arrested after his breath test showed .26 breath alcohol content, more than triple the legal limit. Brown had argued that the evidence of the breath test should be suppressed because the underlying traffic stop was without cause, and a lower court agreed and dismissed the case. The only issue before the Supreme Court was whether Brown violated traffic laws. The case now goes back to the lower courts to proceed in accordance with the high court’s guidance on the initial stop.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: The city isn’t going to force retired police officers and firefighters to return miscalculated and overpaid pension payments. The City Council decided Monday to keep the overpaid pensions where they are and correct any underfunded pensions, The Herald-Dispatch reported. Those whose pensions were underpaid will also receive back pay. Mayor Steve Williams said the city’s pension funds are now the strongest they have ever been, and the fund is making payments on time after having been late for months. In 2013, the police officer fund’s net worth was about $22.3 million. It has nearly doubled since then. The firefighter fund was about $13 million in 2013 and now sits at about $30 million. A 2017 review of the city’s pension calculations found that some workers were being paid too much and some were being paid too little.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A large number of people donated kidneys this year at the University of Wisconsin Hospital in Madison – and in each case, it was a donation to a stranger. It’s unclear why there was a surge in kidney donations this year – 28 in all – but a staffer at the hospital has a simple theory: “Society in general just wants to do good right now,” Leza Warnke, a UW Hospital transplant coordinator, told the Wisconsin State Journal. “We’re hurting for some ‘feel good.’ ” The 28 people who donated their kidneys are a rare type of donor known as “nondirected donors” because they’re willing to give to anyone, regardless of whether they know the person. Of the 28 donors, 22 were women and six were men. The ages of donors ranged from 23 to 78. Garet Hil, founder and CEO of the National Kidney Registry, said there were about 300 such donors nationwide this year, which still makes the act unusual. “We don’t know what’s driving it,” Hil said. “It’s still about one-in-a-million. These are very special people.”\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: A woman from Alaska has donated body armor to a Wyoming K9 officer, the Laramie County Sheriff’s Office said. The bullet and stab protective vest for K9 officer Arie comes from a donation by Denise Nading of Anchorage through a nonprofit organization called Vested Interest in K9s, Inc. Nading made the donation in memory of Mel Nading, an Alaska State Trooper and pilot who died in a helicopter crash in March 2013 while returning from rescuing a stranded snowmobiler in Talkeetna, Alaska, according to news reports. The vest is embroidered with: “In memory of Mel Nading, Pilot of Helo 1,” the sheriff’s office said in a Facebook post on Tuesday. Arie, who joined the sheriff’s office this fall, is trained in narcotics detection, suspect tracking and apprehension, building search and officer protection.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/27"}]}

It said it would continue flying into New York's John F. Kennedy airport, Los Angeles International and Washington Dulles.\n\n\"We are working closely with aircraft manufacturers and the relevant authorities to alleviate operational concerns, and we hope to resume our US services as soon as possible,\" Emirates said in its statement.\n\nAir India said it would suspend service between Delhi and San Francisco, Chicago and JFK. It will also suspend a Mumbai to Newark flight. It will continue to fly into Washington Dulles.\n\nBoth ANA and Japan Airlines said they canceled some flights to the United States scheduled to use Boeing 777 aircraft, but will operate some flights using Boeing 787s instead.\n\nGermany's Lufthansa canceled a flight between Frankfurt and Miami. It said it would swap Boeing 747-8 aircraft for 747-400s on flights from Frankfurt to Los Angeles, Chicago and San Francisco.\n\nA spokesperson for British Airways told CNN Business that it \"had to make a handful of cancellations\" because a decision by telecom operators to delay activating the new 5G service at some locations didn't cover all the airports the airline serves.\n\nOther carriers including Virgin Atlantic and Air France-KLM said they had not canceled any flights but were monitoring the situation.\n\nDelta Air Lines DAL said it is planning for the possibility of weather-related cancellations as early as Wednesday due to the new 5G service in the vicinity of dozens of US airports.\n\nTransportation regulators had already been concerned that the version of 5G that was scheduled to be switched on could interfere with some airplane instruments, and many aviation industry groups shared those fears — despite reassurances from federal telecom regulators and wireless carriers.\n\nSpecifically, the Federal Aviation Administration has been worried that 5G cellular antennas near some airports — not air travelers' mobile devices — could throw off readings from some aircraft equipment designed to tell pilots how far they are from the ground. Those systems, known as radar altimeters, are used throughout a flight and are considered critical equipment. (Radar altimeters differ from standard altimeters, which rely on air pressure readings and do not use radio signals to gauge altitude.)\n\nIn December, the FAA issued an urgent order forbidding pilots from using the potentially affected altimeters around airports where low-visibility conditions would otherwise require them. That new rule could keep planes from getting to some airports in certain circumstances, because pilots would be unable to land using instruments alone.\n\nAT&T, which owns CNN's parent company, and Verizon both announced Tuesday that they would delay activating 5G on some towers around certain airports.

Airlines estimate 1,000 flight disruptions per day because of possible interference with radar altimeters that pilots use to land in low visibility conditions. The telecom industry has not commented on the letter, but has said fears are unfounded since there have not been problems in other countries where 5G is already deployed.\n\n— Brian Fung, Jackie Wattles and Chris Liakos contributed to this article.", "authors": ["Gregory Wallace", "Pete Muntean", "Michael Ballaban"], "publish_date": "2022/01/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/07/investing/spirit-frontier-airlines-merger/index.html", "title": "Spirit and Frontier Airlines plan to merge - CNN", "text": "The companies have yet to say what brand they'll fly under or who would lead management of the new airline. The combined company would offer more than 1,000 daily flights to over 145 destinations.\n\nThe merged carrier would leapfrogandin the number of miles flown by paying passengers, according to 2021 statistics, putting them behind the four major airlines that control about 80% of the nation's air traffic --and\n\n\"This transaction is centered around creating an aggressive ultra-low fare competitor to serve our guests even better, expand career opportunities for our team members and increase competitive pressure, resulting in more consumer-friendly fares for the flying public,\" said Spirit CEO Ted Christie.\n\nThere are only 519 routes currently served by both airlines, out of 2,832 combined routes, according to aviation analytics firm Cirium. That's equal to just 18% of their routes, suggesting a combination will have only limited impact on reducing competition for passengers.\n\nLike most of the US airline industry, Spirit and Frontier have been struggling with losses the last two years as air travel plunged during the pandemic. On Monday, Spirit reported a 2021 loss of $440.6 million, excluding special items, such as federal assistance that went to all US airlines. That was an improvement from the $719.6 million it lost on that basis in 2020. Frontier reported it lost $299 million on that basis in 2021, roughly the same as in 2020.\n\nBut the two airlines' combined fourth quarter revenue was down only 2% from their combined revenue in the final three months of 2019. That's much closer to pre-pandemic levels than at the four major airlines. Much of that is due to the fact they depend primarily on leisure travelers, not business passengers, who have been slower to return to flying.\n\nLow fares, low approval\n\nThe combination would bring together two airlines that have very low base fares, but charge passengers extra for most things, including carry-on bags. Although their passengers might like the low fares, many don't like the experience of flying with them.\n\nSpirit had by far the highest number of passenger complaints, with 13.25 complaints per 100,000 passengers, according to stats from January through September 2021 kept by the US Department of Transportation. JetBlue had the second most complaints on that basis with 6.85, while Frontier had the third most in the industry with 5.76. Frontier had by far the worst rate of complaints in the same period of 2020, when it recorded 60.24 complaints per 100,000 customers.\n\nFrontier and Spirit also had the industry's worst customer satisfaction ratings , according to the American Customer Satisfaction Index.\n\nFrontier suffered some badly-timed service problems Monday morning, soon after it announced the planned merger. A technology issue temporarily resulted in all of its flights being grounded, the FAA disclosed. The statement from the airline said the problem was quickly fixed.\n\n\"Earlier today, we experienced a technology issue which led to some flight delays and cancellations,\" it said in a midday statement. \"The issue was identified and has been resolved. We are working to restore our flight schedule for the balance of the day.\"\n\nRegulatory hurdles\n\nWhether or not the merger will be approved by federal antitrust regulators remains uncertain. The Biden administration has taken a much more aggressive approach on antitrust issues. It recently blocked an alliance between American and JetBlue that fell short of a full merger. Increasing competition in the airline industry is one of the issues that the Biden administration has cited as a priority.\n\nExecutives involved in the proposed Spirit-Frontier deal say they believe the merger will bring more competition to the industry.\n\n\"This is the type of transaction the administration should in fact support,\" Bill Franke, chair of Frontier's board and the managing partner of Indigo Partners, Frontier's majority shareholder, said in an interview Monday on CNBC. \"It's beneficial to the consumers. It's beneficial to the employees. It's beneficial to the communities that the airlines serve. And at the end of the day, even in combination, these two airlines will control less than 10% of the market.\"\n\nBut experts aren't sure the regulatory approval will be as easy as the airlines hope.\n\n\"In a normal environment we would not expect any regulatory hurdles given the relatively small market share of each airline. But given the Biden Administration's 'big is bad' approach we would expect some objection,\" said Savanthi Syth, airline analyst with Raymond James.\n\nThe US airline industry has been greatly reshaped by mergers in the last 25 years. The four largest airlines today were formed from a series of mergers of 10 airlines. This would be the United States' first airline merger since Alaska Air purchased Virgin America in 2016.\n\nThe $6.6 billion value of the deal includes assumed debt, such as aircraft leases.

This year the holiday, which commemorates of the end of slavery in the United States, falls on Sunday but it will be observed in many places on Monday, June 20.\n\nGiven that this long summer weekend also coincides with Father’s Day, that means there will be a lot of travel going on.\n\nThe Friday before Juneteenth clocked in as the most popular air travel day of 2022, according to statistics from the Transportation Security Administration. Airports haven’t been that crowded since Thanksgiving 2021.\n\nTSA officers said they screened about 2,438,784 people at airport security checkpoints nationwide on Friday, the highest checkpoint volume since November 28, the Sunday after Thanksgiving. That also was about 100,000 more travelers than the Friday before Memorial Day weekend.\n\n“Welcome to the Juneteenth Holiday Weekend of travel!” wrote TSA spokesperson Lisa Farbstein on Twitter.\n\nWhile Juneteenth became an official holiday last year, this is the first year that the US stock market and banks will close in its honor.\n\nThe surge in numbers couldn’t have come at a worse time for US airlines. A combination of rough weather, staff shortages and infrastructure challenges have left major carriers struggling to keep up with the surge in travel. Nearly 9,000 flights were delayed within the US Friday and another 1,500 flights were canceled according to the data group FlightAware.\n\nIn all, more than 3,200 flights were canceled between Friday and Sunday, per FlightAware, including more than 850 flights on Saturday and more than 900 Sunday.\n\nDelta Air Lines alone canceled at least 248 flights on Sunday. United Airlines canceled 90 flights, and American Airlines canceled 96 flights.\n\n“A variety of factors continue to impact our operations, including challenges with air traffic control, weather and unscheduled absences in some work groups,” Delta said in a statement to CNN. “Canceling a flight is always our last resort, and we sincerely apologize to our customers for the inconvenience to their travel plans.”\n\nCNN has reached out to United and American for a comment on the flight cancellations.\n\nThe increase in delays and cancellations comes just one day after Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg met with airline CEOs to discuss ways to improve performance and operations ahead of another expected surge in travel over the 4th of July holiday.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 02:50 - Source: CNN 'Broken system': Expert reacts to airlines pushing to end international traveler testing\n\nAbout 2,700 flights were canceled over Memorial Day weekend. Major airlines already are preemptively canceling more flights just as the busy summer season heats up. Southwest Airlines has cut nearly 20,000 flights between June and Labor Day and is struggling to hire the 10,000 new workers it says it needs to meet demand.\n\n“I go through the Whataburger drive-thru and I pay and get my bag, and stapled to the bag is a job application,” Southwest CEO Robert Jordan joked to the Dallas Morning News last year about the difficulty in finding job applicants. “That’s what it’s come to.”\n\nDelta said it will cancel 100 daily flights in the US and Latin America from July 1 to August 7. In an open letter to customers, Delta pilots wrote that the labor shortage has put them on pace to fly more overtime hours this year than in all of 2018 and 2019 combined.\n\n“The pilot shortage for the industry is real, and most airlines are simply not going to be able to realize their capacity plans because there simply aren’t enough pilots, at least not for the next five-plus years,” United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby said during the airline’s quarterly earnings call in April.\n\nUnions representing pilots at Delta, American and Southwest say that airlines got themselves into the current situation by refusing to replace pilots who retired and took leaves of absence during the height of the pandemic when air travel plummeted.\n\nAbout 8,000 new commercial pilots have received certificates in the last year, according to pilot unions, and they say there shouldn’t be a shortage. The current service cut narrative, they claim, is being used by companies to justify a cut to training and safety requirements that will boost profit margins.\n\nSome US senators are taking note. “While some flight cancellations are unavoidable, the sheer number of delays and cancellations this past weekend raises questions about airline decision-making,” wrote Senators Richard Blumenthal and Edward Markey in a letter to Buttigieg earlier this month.", "authors": ["Nicole Goodkind"], "publish_date": "2022/06/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2022/04/12/mask-mandate-plane-train/7293562001/", "title": "Mask mandate on planes, trains: Administration to update rules soon", "text": "David Koenig\n\nAssociated Press\n\nThe federal mandate to wear a mask on planes and public transportation is due to expire April 18.\n\nIt's been extended several times before, but pressure is growing from the airline industry and others to do away with it now.\n\nDefenders of the mask mandate say it's still needed to protect seniors and people with compromised immune systems.\n\nDALLAS – The federal requirement to wear face masks on airplanes and public transportation is scheduled to expire next week, and airline executives and Republican lawmakers are urging the Biden administration to let the mandate die.\n\nThe fate of the rule – and consideration of an alternate \"framework\" of moves to limit the spread of COVID-19 – was under discussion Monday within the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and prevention. Officials described it as a close call.\n\n\"This is a decision that the CDC Director Dr. (Rochelle) Walensky is going to make,\" White House coronavirus-policy adviser Dr. Ashish Jha said Monday. \"I know the CDC is working on developing a scientific framework for how to answer that. We are going to see that framework come out I think in the next few days.\"\n\nJha said that extending the mask mandate again is \"on the table.\"\n\nMASK RULES:Yes, masks are still required on planes and at airports despite new CDC mask guidelines\n\nBEEN A WHILE SINCE YOU TRAVELED?:Here's a refresher on those basic economy plane tickets\n\nThe administration gave the rule a one-month reprieve in March so that public-health officials would have time to develop alternative methods of limiting the transmission of COVID-19 during travel.\n\nThe mask mandate is the most visible vestige of government restrictions to control the pandemic and possibly the most controversial. A surge of abusive and sometimes violent incidents on airplanes has been attributed mostly to disputes over mask-wearing.\n\nCritics have seized on the fact that states have rolled back rules requiring masks in restaurants, stores and other indoor settings, and yet coronavirus cases have fallen sharply since the omicron variant peaked in mid-January.\n\n\"The American people have seen through the false logic that COVID-19 only exists on airplanes and public transportation,\" Republicans on the House and Senate transportation committees said Friday in a letter to the administration.\n\nHowever, a recent uptick in cases could provide a reason for the CDC to keep the mask rule a bit longer.\n\nAfter a steep, two-month decline, the seven-day rolling U.S. average of new reported coronavirus cases has turned slightly higher in recent days, although from relatively low levels.\n\nSeveral prominent officials have contracted the virus, including the 82-year-old House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who tested positive for the virus last week after appearing – without a mask – at a White House event with President Joe Biden. Also last week, Attorney General Merrick Garland and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo disclosed that they had tested positive after a gathering that was quickly dubbed a super-spreader event.\n\nStory continues below.\n\nEric Feigl-Ding, an epidemiologist at the New England Complex Systems Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts, believes that if the mandate is dropped, more air travelers and airline crew members will get sick. He said the CDC made a mistake by linking mask guidance to hospitalization rates because less severe but highly transmissible variants can still kill large numbers of people.\n\n\"In public health, we try to prevent crashes. Medicine is basically mechanics who try to fix cars after they have already crashed,\" he said. \"Do you say, 'Oh, you don't need to buckle your seat belt today, hospital beds are not full?' Who does that?\"\n\nAirlines began requiring masks in 2020, months before the government mandate was issued days after Biden's inauguration. Airlines faced financial ruin because of the pandemic, and the masks and other measures such as blocking middle seats were meant to reassure frightened passengers that flying was safe from the virus.\n\n'My flight attendants are begging us to stop this'\n\nIn December, the CEO of Southwest Airlines was forced to walk back a comment that masks didn't do much to improve health safety in the cabin because planes have strong air filters.\n\nTravelers have returned – the number of Americans getting on planes surged past 2 million a day in March – and airlines think they can sell plenty of seats without the mask rule.\n\n\"My flight attendants are begging us to stop this,\" Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle said. \"Every day it's causing all of these incidents on board, and it's frustrating and it's dangerous. You're asking a 24-year-old flight attendant to explain it to someone who is mad\" about the rule.\n\nStory continues below.\n\nUnions that represent flight attendants once supported the mask rule but are now neutral. Officials say their members are divided, which could explain why the two largest U.S. flight-attendant unions declined to comment on the issue this week.\n\nExecutives of 10 airlines including American, Delta, United and Southwest wrote to Biden last month, urging the White House to drop the mask rule and a requirement that international travelers test negative for COVID-19 before flying to the U.S. \"Much has changed since these measures were imposed and they no longer make sense in the current public health context,\" the executives said.\n\nAirlines for America, a trade group representing those big airlines, and three other industry organizations made a similar appeal to Jha on Friday. They pointed to recent CDC guidance which found that most Americans no longer need to wear masks indoors because hospitalization rates in their communities are relatively low.\n\nSavanthi Syth, an airline analyst for Raymond James & Associates, said there are some people who will feel uncomfortable flying with fellow passengers who aren't wearing masks, but there could be others who have avoided flying because they're not comfortable wearing one for a long flight.\n\n\"I expect the vast majority of passengers and flight attendants will welcome the change (if the rule is dropped), given that it is consistent with most other areas of everyday life,\" Syth said. She said any impact on travel demand will be small, and that airlines would get a much bigger boost from the elimination of the testing requirement on inbound international travelers.\n\nChris Lopinto, co-founder of travel site ExpertFlyer.com, said that because of the recent uptick in COVID-19 cases, it might be wise to keep the mask mandate until cases subside again.\n\n\"I don't think there would be a material effect on demand, either way, considering airlines can barely keep up with the demand they already have,\" he said.\n\nMost congressional Democrats continue to support the mask mandate. A leading liberal, Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass, urged the CDC and the Transportation Security Administration to keep the rule in place, saying that the virus and variants remain a threat to seniors and people with weakened immune systems or disabilities.\n\nThe political calculus could be shifting, however. Last month, eight Democrats broke with the White House and joined Senate Republicans in a symbolic vote against the mask mandate. Four of those Democrats face difficult reelection races in November, and the party is unlikely to keep control of the Senate if any of them lose.\n\nContributing: Zeke Miller, Associated Press White House reporter", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2021/11/04/fact-check-no-evidence-vaccinated-pilots-dying-during-flights/6236189001/", "title": "Fact check: No evidence vaccinated pilots are dying during flights", "text": "The claim: COVID-19 vaccinated American Airlines pilots died during flights\n\nAs air travel across the U.S. faces a spike in unruly passengers, aircrew understaffing and flight cancellations, one article circulating on social media takes it a large step further by claiming vaccinated airline pilots are dying while on duty.\n\n\"Vaccinated Pilots Dropping Dead Mid-Flight,\" reads the headline of an article shared to Facebook on Oct. 28.\n\nThe article, published on a website called bestnewshere.com, claims that two American Airlines' pilots died in October during separate flights leaving Dallas Fort Worth International Airport.

Williams is also set to play her first doubles match with sister Venus on Wednesday.\n\nSince returning to the circuit back in June after a year out through injury, Williams has managed to win just a single match and has been unable to get close to the form that helped her win her last grand slam title in 2017.\n\nEven if she cannot achieve a dream final flourish by lifting the title at Flushing Meadows, Williams' 23 grand slam singles titles will go down as the most by any player in the Open Era and just one shy of Margaret Court's all-time record.\n\nSerena Williams beat Martina Hingis in the 1999 US Open final to win her first grand slam title.\n\nWilliams' greatness is not only limited to the singles court, having won every doubles grand slam title at least twice and winning two of four mixed doubles grand slam titles. She has also achieved more than $94 million in on-court career earnings.\n\nFew tennis players have transcended the sport like Williams and her presence will undoubtedly be missed on the Tour.\n\nOne of the many young talents that will likely be plugging that gap is defending US Open champion Emma Raducanu. The teenager stunned the world of sport last year by becoming the first qualifier in history to win a grand slam title in what was only her second appearance in the main draw of a slam.\n\nRaducanu and Williams crossed paths for the first time two weeks ago at the Cincinnati Masters , with Raducanu coming out on top in straight sets.\n\nHowever, that was one of just 12 wins that Raducanu has mustered in a season that has been blighted by injuries and patchy form. She's shown flashes, though, of the player that triumphed at Flushing Meadows last year, most notably in the recent demolition of two-time grand slam champion Victoria Azarenka in Cincinnati.\n\nTwo thousand of the 2,756 ranking points that currently have Raducanu 11th in the world -- and as high as 10th back in June -- came from her US Open win, and failure to get close to defending her crown will see the 19-year-old plummet down the WTA world rankings.\n\nEmma Raducanu secured one of the most remarkable grand slam wins in history at the 2021 US Open.\n\nRaducanu's run in Cincinnati was ended at the hands of world No. 8 Jessica Pegula, but it was a closely-fought contest to finish a week that will likely give Raducanu increased confidence going into the US Open.\n\nAmong the stars hoping to snag Raducanu's New York crown will be Poland's world No. 1 Iga Swiatek, who has won a remarkable six singles titles in 2022.\n\nThe two-time French Open winner goes into the tournament as the bookmakers' favorite, but has only ever reached the fourth round at Flushing Meadows and has struggled for form on the hard court in the lead up to the US Open.\n\nHowever, Swiatek did reach the Australian Open semifinals at the start of the year and won three successive WTA 1000 hard court events earlier in the season, so she no doubt has the ability to go all the way in New York.\n\nRafael Nadal aims for No. 23\n\nIn the men's draw, all eyes will be on Rafael Nadal as he looks to add to his men's record 22 grand slam titles.\n\n\"The main thing for me is to stay healthy,\" Nadal told reporters after the defeat. \"It has been a difficult injury to manage, to be honest.\n\n\"The last month and a half hasn't been easy because, having a tear on the abdominal, you don't know when (you will be) 100 percent over the thing, so that affects me a little bit in terms of not (being) sure if you are able to try your best in every serve.\"\n\nBut New York has been a happy hunting ground for Nadal over the years with the Spaniard winning the title on four occasions, most recently in 2019 when he came through a five-set epic against Daniil Medvedev.\n\nRussia's Medvedev, competing under a neutral flag since his country's invasion of Ukraine, is the bookmakers' favorite to lift the trophy and retain the crown he won in 2021 to mark his maiden grand slam victory.\n\nJUST WATCHED Daniil Medvedev on stopping Novak Djokovic's calendar grand slam (2021) Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Daniil Medvedev on stopping Novak Djokovic's calendar grand slam (2021) 02:48\n\nThe 26-year-old's lone title in 2022 came on the hard court in Mexico earlier this month, but Medvedev did reach the Australian Open final at the start of the year, agonizingly losing out after holding a two-set lead over Nadal.\n\nAlexander Zverev, who would have been among the favorites to win, confirmed earlier this week that he was pulling out of the US Open after failing to recover from injury in time.\n\nThe world No. 2 underwent surgery back in June on torn ligaments in his ankle, which he sustained after landing awkwardly in the French Open semifinals against Nadal.\n\nZverev's absence from the draw moves all those players ranked below him up a place in the seedings, meaning Nadal and Medvedev can now only face each other in the final.\n\nNovak Djokovic confirmed on Thursday that he would not be competing at Flushing Meadows in 2022. The United States' vaccination rules for non-US citizens meant the Serbian would not have been granted a visa to enter the country, so Nole will wait at least one more year before returning to the Big Apple.\n\nThe world No. 6 triumphed at Wimbledon earlier this year to win his 21st grand slam title and move to within one of long-time rival Nadal, but has been unable to play in any of the Tour's US Open warmup events in the States or Canada.\n\nThe US Open will be the second grand slam this year that Djokovic will miss out on due to his unvaccinated status, after he twice had his visa revoked ahead of the Australian Open in January.\n\n\"Sadly, I will not be able to travel to NY this time for US Open,\" Djokovic wrote on social media . \"Thank you #NoleFam for your messages of love and support.\n\n\"Good luck to my fellow players! I'll keep in good shape and positive spirit and wait for an opportunity to compete again.

This week, she has been competing in the women's doubles event at Eastbourne alongside Ons Jabeur, although the pair had to withdraw from the tournament semifinals after Jabeur picked up a knee injury.\n\nWith so little match experience, it's difficult to predict how the 23-time grand slam champion will fare at Wimbledon, where French Open champion Iga Swiatek , currently on a 35-match unbeaten streak, is arguably the favorite to win the women's singles title.\n\nIn the men's draw, Rafael Nadal has a chance to equal Williams' tally of 23 grand slam titles, but he is set to face fierce competition from top seed Novak Djokovic, who is looking to win his fourth consecutive title at Wimbledon.\n\nNadal hits a serve during an exhibition match against Stan Wawrinka at the Hurlingham Club in London.\n\nSerena returns\n\nWilliams told CNN earlier this year that she is \"not giving up\" on her pursuit of a 24th grand slam title, but her Wimbledon participation has nevertheless come as a surprise.\n\nThe 40-year-old, granted a wild card entry for the tournament, will face France's Harmony Tan in the first round.\n\nDespite grass not being her favored surface, world No. 1 Swiatek's supreme form so far this year makes her well-placed to win a third grand slam title and her first at Wimbledon -- though she did win the girls' championship in 2018. She faces Croatian qualifier Jana Fett in the first round.\n\nAshleigh Barty's retirement from tennis earlier this year means there will be no defending champion in the women's draw, but previous Wimbledon champions Simona Halep , Garbiñe Muguruza, and Angelique Kerber are among the top 16 seeds.\n\nTeenagers Emma Raducanu , the US Open champion playing at her home grand slam, and Coco Gauff , the French Open runner-up, could also enjoy deep runs in the draw.\n\nNadal, Djokovic headline men's draw\n\nOn the men's side, the top two players in the world rankings will be absent -- Daniil Medvedev due to the ban on Russian players and Alexander Zverev due to a long-term injury sustained at the French Open.\n\nThat means few would look past Nadal and Djokovic for this year's title, with the Spaniard looking to win his third consecutive grand slam title.\n\nDjokovic faced Felix Auger-Aliassime at London's Hurlingham Club earlier this week.\n\nNadal's participation at Wimbledon looked uncertain after he revealed the extent of his ongoing foot injury at the French Open , relying on daily injections in order to get through the tournament.\n\nBut ahead of Wimbledon, he said he hasn't limped for a week, adding that \"day to day, the pain has been different and that's progress.\" He will make his first appearance at the tournament in three years against Argentina's Francisco Cerundolo.\n\nDjokovic, meanwhile, could move one grand slam title behind Nadal if he triumphs at SW19. In doing so, he would become the fourth man in the Open Era to win four consecutive Wimbledon titles after Roger Federer, Pete Sampras and Bjorn Borg.\n\nIf the draw progresses according to seeding, Djokovic and Nadal will meet each other in the Wimbledon final for the second time.\n\nOther contenders for the men's title include Matteo Berrettini -- last year's finalist who triumphed at Queen's Club this week -- French Open finalist Casper Ruud and fourth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas.\n\nAn added incentive for players at Wimbledon this year is the increase in prize money to £40,350,000 (around $49,400,000) -- a 15.2% increase on last year. The winners of the men's and women's singles finals, which take place on July 9 and 10, will each earn £2 million (around $2,450,000).\n\nFollowing the Covid-19 pandemic, it will also be the first time in three years that the tournament can be held at full capacity.\n\nAnother piece of history has already been made at Wimbledon after players were permitted to practice on the show courts ahead of the tournament for the first time.\n\nWith several players slipping on the surface last year , the decision enables players to get used to the conditions and help bed in the courts, according to organizers.\n\nHow to watch\n\nFor viewers in the United States, Wimbledon will be aired on ESPN and the Tennis Channel, while the BBC and Eurosport will broadcast action for UK viewers.", "authors": ["George Ramsay"], "publish_date": "2022/06/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/11/tennis/serena-williams-canadian-open-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Serena Williams begins farewell tour as she loses at the Canadian ...", "text": "(CNN) Carrying a bouquet of flowers and wiping a tear from her eye, Serena Williams waved to the raucous crowd on Wednesday a day after her announcing her forthcoming retirement from tennis.\n\nThe 23-time grand slam champion was defeated 6-2 6-4 by Belinda Bencic in the second round of the Canadian Open in Toronto -- her first match since penning an article in Vogue explaining that \"the countdown has begun\" and that she will \"evolve away from tennis.\"\n\n\"As I said in the article, I'm terrible at goodbyes.

And I have absolutely nothing to lose,” she said.\n\nWilliams will next face Australia’s Ajla Tomljanovic in the third round. Tomljanovic, who was playing at the same time as Williams on Wednesday, defeated Russian Evgeniya Rodina 1-6, 6-2, 7-5.\n\nAnd Williams is not playing just singles; she will open doubles play with her sister Venus Williams on Thursday night.\n\n“I need more matches,” she told ESPN. “I love rising to the challenge. Yeah, I haven’t played many matches, but I’ve been practicing really well. In my last few matches, it just wasn’t coming together. I’m like, ‘This isn’t me.’”\n\nThings have changed since she started playing at the Open, she said.\n\nShe began singles play Monday with a 6-3 6-3 victory over Danka Kovinić of Montenegro. It was Williams’ third match since announcing in Vogue magazine she will “evolve away from tennis” after the US Open.\n\n“I have never liked the word retirement. It doesn’t feel like a modern word to me. I’ve been thinking of this as a transition, but I want to be sensitive about how I use that word, which means something very specific and important to a community of people,” Williams said in the Vogue article published earlier this month.\n\n“Maybe the best word to describe what I’m up to is evolution. I’m here to tell you that I’m evolving away from tennis, toward other things that are important to me,” she said.\n\nAt her post-match news conference Monday, Williams was asked if this is definitely her last tournament.\n\n“Yeah, I’ve been pretty vague about it, right?” she said with a smile. “I’m going to stay vague because you never know.”\n\nThe opening-round win over Kovinić was the best Williams had looked since making her comeback from injury. She has managed to win just one match since returning to the circuit in June and was unable to get close to the form that helped her win her last grand slam title in 2017.\n\nBut Kontaveit, who had said she was excited to play against Williams, encountered a player who showed no signs of wanting to hasten her retirement.\n\n“I think she played really well,” said the Estonian during the post-match news conference. “I mean, I thought I didn’t play a bad match at all.”\n\nAfter the players split the first two sets, Williams stepped up her play for the decider, Kontaveit said.\n\n“She really switched it on from there,” she said. “There’s a few points here and there where I feel like I could have done better on my serve maybe. I mean, she was returning better. She was playing the rallies better. I felt like she did everything a little bit better in the third set.”\n\nThe passionate pro-Williams crowd was also a challenge, Kontveit added.\n\n“I mean, I think they were not rooting like against me. They just wanted Serena to win so bad,” she said. “So, I mean, I don’t think it’s a personal attack against me or anything. I mean, it’s fair. I mean, she deserves this, yeah.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 03:06 - Source: CNN See how Serena Williams became one of the all-time greats\n\nWilliams burst on the scene by winning her first US Open in 1999\n\nOne of the greatest tennis players ever, Williams has won 23 grand slam singles titles and has won the US Open six times, most recently in 2014.

It followed wide expectation that she would call time on her career at the age of 40 after struggling with a leg injury.\n\nWilliams made a surprise appearance in a doubles match alongside Tunisian Ons Jabeur at the Eastbourne International on Tuesday, the pair progressing after taking victory over Marie Bouzkova and Sara Sorribes Tormo. Having received a wild-card invitation to Wimbledon, Williams is scheduled to compete in a first-round match at the beginning of next week.\n\nHowever her long-term future in tennis “remains uncertain” according to Sky Sports, though Williams said she “felt good” on her return at Eastbourne.\n\nAway from the court\n\nRumours of retirement gathered pace after Williams’s coach Patrick Mouratoglou began working with Romanian player Simona Halep earlier this year, while Williams turned her attention to projects away from the court.\n\nAs well as bringing up her four-year-old daughter Olympia, Williams has been involved in several enterprises unrelated to tennis, including founding a venture capital fund called Serena Ventures. The firm was created to invest in businesses run by women from diverse backgrounds and launched with an initial $111m fund earlier this year.\n\nWilliams also joined other high-profile names in backing the new LA-based women’s football team, Angel City FC, which began playing in March 2022.\n\nAlongside that, Williams was promoting the Oscar-winning movie about her family, King Richard, before its release late last year, as well as developing her fashion brand, called S by Serena, as well as a jewellery range.\n\n‘Significant obstacles’ in tennis future\n\nWilliams said she “can’t answer” whether she’ll play tennis into next year, reported The Guardian, adding that her ventures off the court are “a lot.\"\n\nDespite her long absence from the court and the tennis spotlight, attention will be on whether Williams can find the form again to claim a record-equalling 24th Grand Slam title. The “new depth on the tour” combined with her time away will “create significant obstacles” in achieving that, said the Los Angeles Times.\n\nThe 2021 Wimbledon runner-up Karolina Pliskova said it will be difficult for Williams on her return to the grass court, explaining that “the body takes time to get back in the shape of playing matches” and that competitive play is “very different” to practice matches. There are some players though that will be “super scared to play her” because of her career, Pliskova added.\n\nWilliams has remained coy about her future tennis plans, and with one Grand Slam remaining this year after Wimbledon, the US Open, Eurosport speculated it “may be a better setting if she does decide to bow out”.\n\n“I’m literally taking it one day at a time,” Williams said after safely making it through the Eastbourne first round injury-free. “I love tennis and I love playing, or else I wouldn’t be out here.”", "authors": ["Richard Windsor"], "publish_date": "2022/06/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/01/tennis/serena-williams-tiger-woods-us-open-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Serena Williams hails Tiger Woods' influence as she continues her ...", "text": "(CNN) It was a performance that had Tiger Woods on his feet and pumping his fist -- a sight usually witnessed on the 18th hole of a golf course, rather than the stands of Arthur Ashe Stadium.\n\nWilliams was buoyed and cheered on every point by the packed home crowd. That included Woods, who watched the drama unfold with his partner, Erica Herman, from Williams' player's box.\n\n\"It was a privilege to watch greatness. Congrats @serenawilliams,\" the 15-time major champion tweeted after the match.\n\nLater, Williams paid tribute to Woods and his influence over the later stages of her tennis career.\n\n\"He's one of the reasons I'm here, one of the main reasons I'm still playing,\" she told reporters. \"We talked a lot. He was really trying to get me motivated. There are a few people, but we were like: 'OK, we can do this together, you know?'\"\n\nWoods wasn't the only sporting great to offer words of encouragement. \"Not done yet @serenawilliams,\" tweeted Steph Curry , while fellow NBA star Chris Paul said he's \"never seen anything like what Serena Williams is doing ... I'm a fan and enjoying every minute.\"\n\nEye of the Tiger ... Woods has offered advice to Williams in the later stages of her career.\n\nHaving announced last month that she will \"evolve away from tennis\" after this year's US Open, Williams' farewell to tennis has clearly captured the imagination of the wider sporting world and beyond.\n\n\"Thank you @SerenaWilliams for inspiring people around the world with your talent, grace, and determination both on and off the court,\" tweeted Vice President Kamala Harris. \"We celebrate all that you have been, all that you are, and all that is to come.\"\n\nWilliams, bidding to win her 24th grand slam singles title, will face Australia's Ajla Tomljanovic on Friday in what will be her first third-round match at a grand slam since last year's French Open.\n\nAnd despite her time away from the game over the past 12 months, the 40-year-old showed on Wednesday that she still has what it takes to beat top players in the world. According to ESPN, Williams has now won 23 of her last 25 matches against players ranked inside the top two -- a run that stretches back to 2007.\n\n\"I'm playing pretty good,\" she said. \"I've been practicing really well, but it hasn't been coming together in matches.\n\n\"But, you know, now it's kind of coming together, I guess. I mean, I had to bring it together today. It worked out.\"\n\nAsked after the match if she could win the tournament, Williams said she \"cannot think that far.\" It would be her first grand slam title since the 2017 Australian Open and tie her with Margaret Court's all-time singles record.\n\nThe boisterous crowds at Arthur Ashe Stadium have shown they're prepared to will Williams in that direction over the course of her first two matches -- an added challenge for anyone facing her.\n\nIn Williams' opening match against Danka Kovinić on Monday, 29,402 fans were in attendance -- a record for an evening session on the US Open's main show court.\n\nWilliams has had raucous support from the crowds at this year's US Open.\n\n\"You can expect something, I saw it from the previous match,\" Kontaveit told reporters about the partisan atmosphere. \"But when you're on the court, I mean, it was hard ... It was something I never experienced before.\"\n\nIt remains unclear whether this will be the final tournament of Williams' career.\n\nShe is also competing in the doubles competition alongside her sister Venus, and on Thursday, they play their opening match against Czech pair Linda Nosková and Lucie Hradecká.\n\nWith another packed crowd expected, Williams is partly savoring the opportunity to play in New York one more time and partly thinking about the task at hand.\n\n\"I think these moments are clearly fleeting,\" she said. \"For me, it's really about having a little embrace (of the occasion) but also understanding that I'm here to focus and do the best that I can this time.\"", "authors": ["George Ramsay"], "publish_date": "2022/09/01"}]}

States where the largest shares of adults are open to taking the vaccine are concentrated in the Northeast.\n\nMany Americans who have yet to be vaccinated cite one of three reasons: either they are concerned about possible side effects, or they want to wait to see if it is safe, or it is difficult for them to obtain a vaccination. Others cite different reasons.\n\nNationwide, 16,300,000 people, 6.5% of the adult population, do not trust the COVID-19 vaccines, and another 6,980,000, or 2.8%, do not think COVID-19 is a big threat. Additionally, 13,800,000 American adults, or 5.5% of the 18 and older population, have not been vaccinated because they do not trust the government.\n\nMeanwhile, the virus continues to spread. Since the beginning of the pandemic, there have been 36,547,639 confirmed cases of the virus and a total of 616,711 Americans have died as a result.\n\nTracking COVID-19 vaccine distribution:How many people have been vaccinated in the US?\n\nSo far, 169,592,873 Americans — or 51.1% of the total population — have received the full course of vaccinations necessary to protect against COVID-19, according to the CDC.\n\nAll survey data used in this story was published by the Census on Aug. 11, 2021.

That means the coronavirus has infected about one in six Iowans at some point in the past two years.\n\nIowa's number of cases is again on the rise, with the state reporting an increase in new confirmed cases for the third week in a row. This week's average of 1,295 new reported cases per day was up 19% over the previous week.\n\nWhile cases are climbing, the state has an additional tool to curb the virus after federal regulators approved a COVID-19 vaccine for children as young as 5.\n\nMore:US COVID-19 map: Tracking cases and deaths\n\nCOVID-19 hospitalizations, which had declined each of the previous four weeks, also increased, according to Wednesday's data. There were 524 Iowans hospitalized with COVID-19, including 113 in intensive care and 52 on ventilators. More than 70% of the patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were not fully vaccinated against the disease, including 85% of those in the ICU.\n\nThe share of the state's population that is fully vaccinated against COVID-19 increased just two-tenths of a percentage point in Wednesday's update, a slight decline from previous weeks. About 53% of the state's population is fully vaccinated, according to the Iowa Department of Public Health. Additional data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that nearly one-fifth of those fully-vaccinated Iowans have also now received a booster dose — the extra shot now available to some at-risk populations.\n\nThe state also reported 97 additional COVID-19 deaths this week, some dating back to mid-September. COVID-19 has now caused or contributed to the deaths of 7,166 Iowans.\n\nHow many Iowa children have received the vaccine?\n\nAs has been the case for the last several months, children made up just under a quarter of the new COVID-19 cases reported this week, or about 2,000. Eight were hospitalized with the disease as of Wednesday's update.\n\nLast week, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine became available for children ages 5 to 11. Wednesday's data update did not yet show the number of doses that have been administered to children in that age group so far.\n\nMore:'We feel like we can move forward.' COVID-19 vaccines for children 5 to 11 years old now available\n\nHowever, about 7,000 Iowa children were able to start their vaccination process by the end of the weekend, according to Ken Sharp, an Iowa Department of Public Health administrator helping coordinate the vaccination campaign. On Wednesday, he called that \"good news,\" and promised the number of doses administered would rise.\n\nBiden administration officials have promised it would have its pediatric vaccination distribution program fully running this week after the Pfizer vaccine was approved for young children last week. In Iowa, the doses started being administered in many locations on Thursday, albeit with limited slots available. Many pharmacies that provide the adult vaccine were still getting their programs up and running through the weekend.\n\nMore:'We feel like we can move forward.' COVID-19 vaccines for children 5 to 11 years old now available\n\n\"There are some, I think, frustrations we're hearing that the parents weren't able to get the vaccine where they would normally go to get the vaccine, and I think it's just a matter of timing,\" Sharp told the State Board of Health at its regular meeting Wednesday. \"We're still taking that as positive news of parents are excited about getting their kids vaccinated and looking for that vaccine.\"\n\nThere are about 284,000 children ages 5 to 11 in Iowa, and the state received about 99,000 doses from the federal government, not including those shipped directly to pharmacies. Sharp said all 99 counties should have pediatric doses available by this week. The state has also ordered another 24,000 doses.\n\nCDC assumptions on vaccine take rates show about 30% of parents would want their child vaccinated immediately, Sharp said, which covers about 95,000 newly eligible children. Another 20% to 30% would likely wait a little bit or until it's more convenient, such as during other scheduled vaccinations. The remaining are hesitant, Sharp said.\n\n\"CDC has assured us that there will not be any supply chain issues for the pediatric vaccine, and right now, we feel like things are going as smoothly as they could be given the rollout of that new product,\" he told the board.\n\nMeanwhile, board member Dr. Donald Macfarlane, with University of Iowa Health Care, asked for a stronger pushback on anti-vaccine rhetoric.\n\nMacfarlane said he was concerned about how vaccine opponents are misusing the CDC's vaccine adverse event reporting system, known as VAERS. The data, he said, is made up of unverified, self-reported events that aren't necessarily associated with any vaccine.\n\nSharp said the state receives regular updates from the CDC about VAERS reports, and there have been zero Iowans who have died because they received the COVID-19 vaccine. Sharp told Macfarlane that the state health department would discuss how to better communicate that message.\n\n\"I think there is a very difficult message for the general public to understand what those data elements are and to understand that literally anyone can report into VAERS on a perceived correlation between a negative impact or adverse effect from a vaccine,\" Sharp said.\n\nRead more on COVID-19 in Iowa:\n\nThe latest COVID-19 numbers in Iowa\n\nThe latest data, as of 11 a.m. Wednesday, Nov. 10, compared to the previous Wednesday.\n\nConfirmed cases: 500,119, an increase of 9,067\n\nDeaths: 7,166, an increase of 97\n\nTotal tested: 2,141,764\n\nTotal recovered: 465,549\n\nStatewide 14-day positivity rate: 8.9%\n\nHow many Iowans are hospitalized with COVID-19?\n\nHospitalizations: 524, up from 483 one week ago\n\nPatients in ICU: 113, up from 111\n\nPatients on ventilators: 52, down from 53\n\nHow many people in Polk and Dallas counties are vaccinated?\n\nIn Polk County, 288,796 (59%) residents are fully vaccinated, an increase of 1,330 (0.3 percentage points) since last week.\n\nIn Dallas County, 54,760 (59%) residents are fully vaccinated, an increase of 272 (0.3 percentage points).\n\nThe five counties in Iowa with the highest percentage of their population fully vaccinated as of Nov. 10 are Johnson (63%), Buena Vista (61%), Linn (59%), Polk (59%) and Dallas (59%) counties.\n\nFor a county-by-county look at the vaccination rollout, see our COVID-19 vaccine tracker, which is updated weekly.\n\nTim Webber is a data visualization specialist for the Register.

By measuring Covid-19 seroprevalence, the study provides an estimate of the percentage of the population that was previously infected.\n\nThe blood samples are submitted to commercial labs for unrelated reasons, such as routine medical checkups, and identifying information is removed. Every two weeks, researchers collected data from these samples, which encompass all 50 states, Washington, DC, and Puerto Rico.\n\nThe agency estimates that about 43% of the country has had the virus as of late January, including almost 60% of children up to age 18, nearly half of people 18 to 49, 37% of those 50 to 64 and 23% of those 65 and older.\n\nWisconsin has the highest seroprevalence, with an estimated 56.1% of its population infected by the coronavirus at some point. Vermont has the lowest, at 17.8%. Estimates for Nevada, Utah, Arizona and North Dakota could not be provided due to low numbers of samples from these states.\n\n\"I think this reflects more exposure than immunity,\" said Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. \"I think what people should take from that is about half the country's been infected with Covid-19, which is pretty extraordinary itself.\"\n\nThe statistics recorded from this seroprevalence survey are a big jump from the 74.3 million total number of Covid-19 cases reported, which is measured using antigen testing or PCR testing of viral RNA. This difference may lie with a large portion of asymptomatic or mild cases of Covid-19 that are not identified through testing, leading to an underestimate of total Covid-19 infections. Many people have also recently been relying on at-home Covid-19 antigen tests, which generally are not reflected in the CDC databases.\n\nKeri Althoff, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told CNN that although the CDC data can accurately say who does or doesn't have antibodies, \"what it doesn't tell us is: Are those antibodies high enough to actually protect against infection if the virus would come that person's way again?\"\n\nThe presence of antibodies does not imply protection from reinfection, and the survey does not measure how much antibody is present.\n\nStudies have shown that the level of protective antibodies created from an infection can last longer than those from vaccination, but the CDC does not recommend using antibody testing to assess for immunity to Covid-19.\n\n\"The Covid infections themselves have created a lot of immunity. How durable, how strong, what the duration of that immunity is, remains to be determined,\" said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.\n\nAt the end of November, according to the CDC estimates, there had been 102.9 million infections. This would mean more than 30 million infections came in December and January, as the Omicron wave swept the country.\n\nAccording to Hotez, the Omicron variant mainly affects the upper respiratory system, \"and there's literature there that says the upper respiratory coronaviruses do not induce much in the way in terms of durable protection,\" he told CNN.\n\nThough it's not possible to draw conclusions about overall immunity against reinfection from these studies, they do provide scientists and policy makers with a broad overview of how the population was affected by the pandemic.\n\n\"What these data are designed to give us a sense of is: What's the magnitude of the issue? It's a little like looking at some mountains across a big plain. You can see where the mountains rise, where they peak and where they fall. You don't have to count every tree to get the big picture,\" Schaffner said.\n\nFor example, as hospitalization and death rates trend down, this data can explain why.\n\n\"These data ... give us some expectation, assuming that this protection lasts for a while, that we can continue to plan about moving from the pandemic phase to the endemic phase,\" Schaffner said. \"These data undoubtedly played a substantial role in the CDCs decision to revise its masking recommendations .\"\n\nHowever, there are limitations to the data. Althoff said that because it sources blood work done for non-Covid purposes, it's important to consider who is being left out of the study.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"Who's having blood work done? People who have access to health care. And what do we know about this virus? ... It disproportionately impacted communities of lower socioeconomic statuses, communities that also tend to have a lower access to health care,\" she said, noting that the seroprevalence measure is probably an underestimate.\n\nNevertheless, the data offers a snapshot of one source of immunity for the US population.\n\n\"As we're peeling back these mandates ... it's important to know we've got a pretty good cushion of population immunity going on right now. And we're going to have to watch it closely, because that will wane,\" Althoff said.", "authors": ["Tasnim Ahmed", "Katherine Dillinger"], "publish_date": "2022/03/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/11/health/unvaccinated-covid-deaths-growing/index.html", "title": "Growing share of Covid-19 deaths are among vaccinated people ...", "text": "(CNN) Since Covid-19 vaccines became widely available, there has been a wide gap in deaths between the vaccinated and unvaccinated. But recent Covid deaths are much more evenly split as highly transmissible variants take hold, vaccine protection wanes and booster uptake stagnates.\n\nBreakthrough infections have become more common in recent months, putting vulnerable populations at increased risk of severe disease or death as more and more transmissible variants continue to spread. This seems to be especially true for seniors in the United States, who were among the first to get their initial vaccine series.\n\nIn the second half of September -- the height of the Delta wave -- less than a quarter of all Covid-19 deaths were among vaccinated people, federal data shows. But in January and February, amid the Omicron surge, more than 40% of Covid-19 deaths were among vaccinated people.\n\nCovid-19 vaccines have saved millions of lives in the United States since the first shot was administered in December 2020, and the unvaccinated are still far more likely to be hospitalized or die than people who are vaccinated with at least two doses of the Moderna or Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccines or a single dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.\n\nBut evidence continues to build around the critical importance of booster shots.\n\nOf those vaccinated people who died from a breakthrough case of Covid-19 in January and February, less than a third had gotten a booster shot, according to a CNN analysis of data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The remaining two-thirds had only received their primary series.\n\nOverall, the risk of dying from Covid-19 is still about five times higher for unvaccinated people than it is for those vaccinated with at least their primary series, CDC data shows.\n\nBut there's a significant disparity by level of vaccination, too: When adjusted for age, people vaccinated with only their initial series faced about three times greater risk of dying than those who also have their booster shot.\n\nThe CDC encourages people to be \"up-to-date\" on Covid-19 vaccinations -- which includes getting boosters at the appropriate time -- but still defines a person to be \"fully vaccinated\" if they've received at least their initial vaccination series.\n\nBut this week, a senior Biden administration official was more direct: All adults need a third shot.\n\nVaccination is the best way for individuals to protect themselves against Covid-19, and protection is most effective with at least three shots, the official said.\n\nOthers have emphasized the importance of boosters to save lives, too.\n\n\"Almost no one in this country should be dying from Covid\" with up-to-date vaccinations and appropriate antiviral treatments, Dr. Robert Califf, commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration, said Saturday on CNN Newsroom.\n\n\"What we really should be worried about is getting the boosters that we need to stay up to date so with the new variants that we have, we don't have unnecessary deaths and hospitalizations.\"\n\nBoosters benefit high-risk seniors most\n\nIn the first year of the pandemic, before vaccines were available, the vast majority of Covid-19 deaths -- more than 80% -- were among seniors age 65 and older.\n\n\n\nIn 2021, especially during the Delta surge, the average age of people dying of Covid-19 shifted younger. Less than 60% of those who died in September were 65 or older, according to provisional data from the CDC.\n\nBut 2022 has looked a lot more like 2020 and the first winter surge; so far this year, about three-quarters of all Covid-19 deaths have been among seniors.\n\nStudies have suggested that Covid-19 vaccine effectiveness wanes over time. Data from the CDC published in January found that getting boosted was 90% effective at preventing hospitalizations during a period when Omicron was the dominant variant. In comparison, getting two shots was 57% effective when it had been at least six months past the second shot.\n\nThe vast majority of seniors completed their initial series more than a year ago now. And while booster uptake among seniors is better than other age groups, less than two-thirds of seniors have gotten a booster shot.\n\nThe CDC now recommends a second booster shot for this age group, too, and uptake is even lower.\n\nCNN's analysis of CDC data from recent months suggests that disparities in risk among vaccinated people who are boosted compared with those who only have their initial series are most prominent among this vulnerable age group.\n\nCovid-19 deaths are preventable\n\nDaily Covid-19 deaths in the US have fallen to a fraction of what they were in January and February amid the Omicron surge, but hundreds are still dying each day.\n\nCases are rising in nearly all states right now, and the White House has warned that another wave in the coming fall and winter could cause 100 million new cases -- both raising the potential for more severe disease and tragic loss.\n\nBut experts say we have the tools to ensure infections don't turn tragic.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nGetting more Americans boosted against Covid-19 could make a big difference as the country heads into the fall and winter, Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said Monday.\n\n\"It's really important that we try to get the half -- or a little bit more than a half -- of Americans who have only received two doses to get that third dose,\" he said. \"That may make a difference moving forward here, and it may particularly make a difference now that we're coming into yet another wave of Covid-19.\"", "authors": ["Deidre Mcphillips"], "publish_date": "2022/05/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/11/health/us-coronavirus-tuesday/index.html", "title": "Omicron variant will 'find just about everybody,' Fauci says, but ...", "text": "(CNN) As the Omicron variant spreads like wildfire across the United States , it's likely just about everybody will be exposed to the strain, but vaccinated people will still fare better, the nation's leading infectious disease expert said Tuesday.\n\n\"Omicron, with its extraordinary, unprecedented degree of efficiency of transmissibility, will ultimately find just about everybody,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci told J. Stephen Morrison, senior vice president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"Those who have been vaccinated ... and boosted would get exposed. Some, maybe a lot of them, will get infected but will very likely, with some exceptions, do reasonably well in the sense of not having hospitalization and death.\"\n\nIn contrast, those who are not vaccinated are \"going to get the brunt of the severe aspect of this,\" he added.\n\nAcross the United States, at least one in five eligible Americans -- roughly 65 million people-- are not vaccinated against Covid-19. More than 62% of the country has been fully vaccinated, but only 23% are fully vaccinated and boosted, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nFauci's comments came in response to a question about whether the pandemic has entered a new phase. That will come when there's enough protection in the community and drugs to easily treat severe Covid-19, he said, adding, \"We may be on the threshold of that right now.\"\n\nAlso Tuesday, US Food and Drug Administration acting commissioner Dr. Janet Woodcock said that while most people could catch the virus, the focus now should be on making sure hospitals and essential services function.\n\nWoodcock was responding to a question from Sen. Mike Braun about whether it's time for the United States to change its Covid-19 strategy. Her statement was not a new assessment of Covid-19, but rather an attempt to make clear the need to prioritize essential services as the Omicron variant surges.\n\n\"I think it's hard to process what's actually happening right now, which is: Most people are going to get Covid,\" Woodcock said Tuesday at a Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee hearing. \"And what we need to do is make sure the hospitals can still function, transportation, you know, other essential services are not disrupted while this happens.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, the number of US patients hospitalized with Covid-19 hit a record high, adding strain to health care networks and pushing states toward emergency staffing and other measures as they struggle to cope.\n\nMore than 145,900 people were in US hospitals with Covid-19 as of Tuesday -- a number that surpasses the previous peak from mid-January 2021 (142,246), and is almost twice what it was two weeks ago, according to data from the Department of Health and Human Services\n\nThe hospitalization record comes amid a surge in cases fueled by the highly transmissible Omicron variant\n\nThe United States averaged more than 754,200 new Covid-19 cases daily over the past week, according to Johns Hopkins University data. That's about three times last winter's peak average (251,987 on January 11, 2021), and 4.5 times the peak from the Delta-driven surge (166,347 on September 1), according to JHU.\n\nThe country has averaged 1,646 Covid-19 deaths a day over the past week -- 33% higher than a week ago, according to JHU. The peak average was 3,402 daily on January 13, 2021, JHU data shows.\n\nThe Omicron variant caused 98.3% of new coronavirus cases in the United States last week, according to estimates posted Tuesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nA technician administers a Covid-19 test Monday at a drive-thru location at Churchill Downs, Kentucky.\n\nLeaders activate new measures to combat surging numbers\n\nHospitals are increasingly juggling staffing issues -- not just because of the increased demand, but also because their employees, who are at a high risk of infection, have to isolate and recover after testing positive.\n\nIn Virginia, Gov. Ralph Northam declared a limited state of emergency Monday after the number of intensive care unit hospitalizations more than doubled since December 1. The order allows hospitals to expand bed capacity and gives more flexibility in staffing, he said, adding that it also expands the use of telehealth as well as expanding which medical professionals can give vaccines.\n\nIn Texas, at least 2,700 medical staffers are being hired, trained and deployed to assist with the surge, joining more than 1,300 personnel already sent across the state, the Texas Department of State Health Services said in a statement to CNN.\n\nKentucky has mobilized the National Guard to provide support, with 445 members sent to 30 health care facilities, the state announced.\n\n\"Omicron continues to burn through the commonwealth, growing at levels we have never seen before. Omicron is significantly more contagious than even the Delta variant,\" said Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, noting the earlier variant that spurred a surge of cases in the summer and fall.\n\n\"If it spreads at the rate we are seeing, it is certainly going to fill up our hospitals,\" he said, and Kentucky is \"down to 134 adult ICU beds available.\"\n\nAnd New Jersey reinstated a public health emergency, Gov. Phil Murphy announced, saying the state needed to \"commit every resource available to beating back the wave\" caused by Omicron. In the past two weeks alone, the state saw more than 10,000 people requiring hospitalization due to Covid-19, the governor said in a video announcement.\n\nMitigation measures such as mandatory masking are also being revived in some areas.\n\nDelaware Gov. John Carney signed a universal indoor mask mandate Monday because of hospitalization increases, with some hospitals \"over 100% inpatient bed capacity amid crippling staffing shortages,\" he said. Churches and places of worship are exempt, while businesses should provide masks to customers and have signage about indoor mask requirements.\n\n\"It's time for everyone to pitch in and do what works. Wear your mask indoors. Avoid gatherings or expect to get and spread Covid. Get your vaccine and, if eligible, get boosted. That's how we'll get through this surge without endangering more lives,\" Carney said.\n\nShare of hospitalizations from breakthrough infections is growing, but risks for unvaccinated are higher\n\nThe HHS data on Covid-19 hospitalizations includes both those patients who are hospitalized because of Covid-19 complications and those who may have been admitted for something else but test positive for Covid-19. This has been true throughout the pandemic, though the share of patients who fall into each category may have changed over time.\n\nFully vaccinated people are accounting for a growing share of people hospitalized with Covid-19 -- but hospitalizations among people who received a booster shot are still rare, and the gap in risk by vaccination status has been wide.\n\nBetween April and July 2021, before the emergence of the Omicron variant, more than 90% of Covid-19 hospitalizations were among people who were either unvaccinated or partially vaccinated, according to a study published by the CDC.\n\nBut a sampling of data collected by CNN suggests that figure has dropped to somewhere between 60% and 75% in recent days and months:\n\n• In Pennsylvania, about 75% of Covid-19 hospitalizations between September and early December 2021 were among people who were not fully vaccinated, according to data from the state health department.\n\n• In New York, about 61% of Covid-19 hospitalizations during the week ending January 2, 2022 were among people who were not fully vaccinated, according to data from the state health department.\n\n• Beaumont Health, the largest health care system in Michigan, reported on Thursday that 62% of Covid-19 patients in its eight hospitals were unvaccinated.\n\nIn some hospitals, up to 40% of patients with Covid-19 \"are coming in not because they're sick with Covid, but because they're coming in with something else and have had Covid or the Omicron variant detected,\" CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told Fox News on Sunday.\n\nBut Covid-19 cases in hospitals strain resources, regardless of whether a patient was hospitalized because of Covid-19, CNN chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said.\n\n\"If they get (incidentally) diagnosed with Covid in the hospital, they still need to go into infection protocol -- personal protective equipment, all of that still needs to be utilized. So it's a huge drain on the system overall,\" Gupta said Tuesday.\n\nWhile fully vaccinated people are accounting for a larger share of Covid-19 hospitalizations, multiple accounts suggest that those who are fully vaccinated and boosted account for a small share.\n\nIn the University of Maryland Medical System, less than 5% of hospitalized patients were fully vaccinated and boosted, President and CEO Dr. Mohan Suntha said Thursday. Beaumont Health reported Thursday that only 8% of Covid-19 patients were fully vaccinated and boosted.\n\nThe CDC did not respond to CNN's multiple requests for data on the share of Covid-19 hospitalizations by vaccination status.\n\nThe agency publishes data on its website regarding the relative risk by vaccination status. Cumulatively, the risk of hospitalization has been eight times higher for unvaccinated people than for fully vaccinated people. But in the last week of November, CDC data showed that hospitalization rates were about 17 times higher for unvaccinated people than for fully vaccinated people.\n\nSchools and industries face Omicron issues\n\nThe debate over safety in schools from Covid-19 continues to play out as only about one in six children ages 5 to 11 is fully vaccinated, according to data from the CDC.\n\nAs Los Angeles prepared to return to school on Tuesday, approximately 62,000 students and staff had tested positive for Covid-19 and will have to stay home, data from the Los Angeles Unified School District showed Monday, equating to a 14.99% positivity rate. The positivity rate of Los Angeles County at large, by comparison, has spiked to 22%.\n\nIn Chicago, educators returned to school Tuesday and students are expected to resume in-person learning Wednesday following a nearly weeklong dispute. The Chicago Teachers Union had voted to teach remotely last week, and the school district responded by canceling classes for four days.\n\nThe agreement, announced late Monday , included metrics for when a classroom would need to go remote due to Covid-19 levels.\n\nIn areas where schools have returned to in-person learning after the holiday break, the time needed for those with Covid-19 to recover has impacted some essential services.\n\nOther sectors also are struggling due to high infection rates.\n\nSome municipalities have seen nearly a quarter of their trash collection workforce call in sick in recent weeks due to Covid-19, leading to delays, according to the Solid Waste Association of North America.\n\n\"This coincided, unfortunately, with increased trash and recycling volumes associated with the holidays. However, we hope that as volumes decline and sanitation workers return to work, these delays will prove temporary,\" executive director and CEO David Biderman said in a statement Monday.\n\nIn travel, US airlines canceled thousands of additional flights over the weekend due to Covid-19 callouts and winter storms, and cruise line Royal Caribbean International announced it has canceled voyages on four ships because of \"ongoing Covid-related circumstances around the world.\" Last week, Norwegian Cruise Line canceled the voyages of eight ships.\n\nPublic transit systems in major metropolitan areas such as New York City and Washington, DC, have had to scale back service with employees ill from Covid-19.

Even among adolescents ages 12 to 17, the vaccination rate is higher than 50% nationally.\n\nBut even though they've been eligible for vaccination for nearly five months, less than 28% of children ages 5 to 11 are fully vaccinated.\n\nOf more than 3,100 counties in the US, only a few dozen have fully vaccinated more than half of this age group.\n\nMisconceptions about risk\n\n\"Certainly, this is a group that we have seen a much slower uptake,\" said Dr. Brannon Traxler, director of public health for South Carolina's Department of Health and Environmental Control.\n\nNo county in South Carolina has fully vaccinated more than a third of 5- to 11-year-olds, according to CNN's analysis, and more than a third of counties have vaccinated fewer than 1 in 10 in this age group.\n\nTraxler wasn't surprised by the low rates. The overall vaccination rate in South Carolina lags behind the national average across all ages, but vaccinating children has been particularly difficult, she said, because of a number of parents' perception of Covid-19 as a disease that affects the elderly.\n\n\"A number of them don't see Covid-19 as being significant or severe in children,\" Traxler said.\n\nIt's a sentiment that pediatricians and public health officials have heard repeatedly.\n\n\"We know that the vast majority of hospitalizations and deaths overall over the pandemic have been in people over 65 and those with underlying medical conditions,\" said Maldonado, who is also chief of the Stanford University School of Medicine's division of pediatric infectious diseases and is leading vaccine trials in children. \"This basically is a risk perception issue, that families don't feel that their children are at risk for getting severe disease.\"\n\nThe recent Omicron wave pushed children's case numbers and hospitalizations to the highest levels of the pandemic.\n\nstudy published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine found vaccination to be a key factor in preventing hospitalization in that time period. The researchers, including some from the CDC, found that vaccination reduced the risk of hospitalization for 5- to 11-year-olds by 68% during the Omicron wave.\n\nLike adults, children who are immunocompromised or have risk factors such as obesity or asthma may be at higher risk of becoming seriously ill with Covid-19, but with many children, it's not clear why they end up in the hospital and others don't.\n\n\"We can't risk-stratify children,\" Maldonado said. \"We can't predict which children are going to be at risk for hospitalizations.\"\n\nA delicate balance\n\nBeyond the South, there are also hundreds of counties in the Midwest that have particularly poor vaccination rates among children, including Genesee County, Michigan, which is home to Flint.\n\n\"There's people who don't think it's severe, so they haven't bothered yet, and I think there's also people who are afraid of the vaccine,\" said Dr. Pamela Hackert, the county's medical health officer.\n\nHackert said it's been challenging to balance the messaging around potential side effects from vaccines with dispelling misinformation about them.\n\nThe most common vaccine side effects in children and adults include aches and fever. But there has been a slight increase in the risk of myocarditis, which is inflammation of the heart muscle, and pericarditis, inflammation around the heart, which has happened occasionally in males 16 to 39 who were vaccinated.\n\n\"We know that myocarditis in [the 16- to 39-year-old] group is mild and that it's not the kind of myocarditis that we tend to see from other pathogens, other viruses or bacteria, or from even from Covid disease itself. But that has been an issue that parents have really focused on,\" Maldonado said.\n\nBut there's also been a lot of work dispelling vaccine myths, such as effects on fertility.\n\n\"We just have to learn how to move beyond the misinformation and try to dispel it,\" Maldonado said.\n\nA political struggle\n\nIn contrast to the South and Midwest, there are only about a dozen counties in the Northeast -- less than 10% of all counties in the region -- that have vaccinated less than 10% of children ages 5 to 11.\n\nPlaces like Manhattan's New York County and some counties in the West -- including Seattle's King County and a few in California's Bay Area -- have had more success, with more than half of their 5-to-11 population fully vaccinated.\n\nMany of those counties cite strong local partnerships and programs aimed at bringing vaccines to people where they are. But public health experts in areas with lower rates of vaccination -- such as Dr. Rendi Murphree in Mobile County, Alabama -- said they've made similar relationships and efforts.\n\nRather, Murphree said, the struggle is entrenched in parents' politics.\n\n\"For some reason, with this illness,\" she said, \"they've made their decisions.\"\n\nIn Mobile County, just 9% of kids 5 to 11 have been vaccinated with both doses, and 60% of adults have had their two shots.\n\n\"I think last year, we did 300 community events out in the community. They're just not going to do it. We can take it to their back door. We can sit still and let them come to us. They're not going to do it,\" Murphree said.\n\nShe is optimistic that when kids return to school this fall, vaccine uptake among children 5 to 11 might inch up as pediatricians talk about getting ready for the school year and flu season. But she doesn't anticipate it budging much.\n\n\"I'm not hopeful that we're going to get above 50% of our 5-to-11-year-olds vaccinated,\" she said.\n\nWith fewer than 1 in 10 children vaccinated in Mobile County, she is worried about how vulnerable that leaves them.\n\n\"They're not vaccinated. They are not encouraged to wear masks, and there are no routine testing programs in schools,\" she said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIn South Carolina, Traxler is also worried. She says children may have a short-term benefit of protection if they were infected during the Omicron wave, but she worries about the future.\n\n\"It's the same areas that have the lower vaccination rates that we're experiencing the lower masking rates. And so, certainly, that concerns me,\" she said.\n\n\"There could be a variant that escapes immunity, either from natural infection or from vaccines.

The second indication is consistent with what scientists have observed in South Africa, where the variant was first identified.\n\nDr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the CDC, told the Associated Press on Wednesday that of the 40-plus people known to be infected by omicron so far in the U.S., more than three-quarters were vaccinated, and one third had received a booster shot.\n\nHowever, she added that almost all the cases resulted in mild illness -- with cough, congestion and fatigue as the main symptoms. Only one case required hospitalization, and no deaths have been reported.\n\nAlso Wednesday, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that of the 12 people infected by omicron in an East Bay outbreak, 11 were vaccinated and boosted staffers of an Oakland hospital who attended an out-of-state wedding. The newspaper said all have mild symptoms.\n\nPfizer says booster shot provides protection against omicron\n\nA third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine appears to protect against omicron, the troubling new variant of the coronavirus that has been confirmed in at least 21 U.S. states and more than 50 countries.\n\nThe companies said Wednesday that two doses of their vaccine may provide protection from severe disease but may not be sufficient to protect against infection with omicron, according to preliminary lab data. A third dose offers more robust protection, providing a level of neutralizing antibodies against omicron similar to the level observed after two doses against the original coronavirus and other variants.\n\nAntibody levels predict how well a vaccine may prevent infection with the coronavirus, but they are just one layer of the immune system’s defenses. The companies are also developing an omicron-specific vaccine.\n\n\"The first line of defense with two doses of vaccination might be compromised (by omicron), and three doses of vaccination are required to restore protection, Özlem Türeci, BioNTech's chief medical officer, said in a Wednesday news conference.\n\nScientists and health officials are still conducting studies to learn more about omicron. Early information indicates it could be more contagious but perhaps less dangerous than previous variants such as delta.\n\n– Contributing: Karen Weintraub\n\nMost Americans are concerned about omicron but won't nix holiday travel, poll shows\n\nLess than two weeks after news of the omicron variant of the coronavirus spread worldwide, the vast majority of Americans have heard of it. While most are at least somewhat concerned about the variant, few say they will change their holiday plans because of it.\n\nAn Axios-Ipsos poll conducted Dec. 3 through Dec. 6 found that 94% of Americans have heard of omicron. Forty-seven percent of Americans said they've heard of it but know almost nothing about it.\n\nNearly three-quarters of Americans, 71%, said they were at least somewhat concerned by the variant. But only 23% said they would cancel holiday travel, and 28% said they would stop gathering with people outside their households, the survey found.\n\nJudge blocks Biden's vaccine mandate for federal workers\n\nA federal judge has ruled in favor of seven states and several contractors in the legal battle over enforcement of a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for federal contractors.\n\nIn a 28-page order released Tuesday, U.S. District Court Judge R. Stan Baker granted the states a preliminary injunction that halts enforcement of President Joe Biden's executive order that required all federal contractors to have their employees vaccinated.\n\nQuoting a federal judge in Kentucky who also granted an injunction halting the enforcement of vaccine mandates last week, Baker wrote: \"This case is not about whether vaccines are effective. They are.\" And Baker acknowledged the tragic toll of COVID in the United States and around the world.\n\n\"However, even in times of crisis, this court must preserve the rule of law and ensure that all branches of government act within the bounds of their constitutionally granted authority,\" Baker wrote.\n\n– Sandy Hodson, The Augusta Chronicle\n\n91-year-old UK woman reflects on being first to get COVID vaccine one year later\n\nMargaret Keenan told the BBC on Wednesday that she has had a \"wonderful year\" since becoming the first person to get a COVID-19 vaccine in the West's first mass immunization program.

Boosted Americans are 97 times less likely.\n\nThose were the figures presented Wednesday by Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, based on reports from 25 jurisdictions in the week ending Dec. 4. For every 100,000 people, 9.7 of those who were unvaccinated were killed by the coronavirus, compared to 0.7 of those fully vaccinated and 0.1 of the boosted.\n\nShe said more recent information during the omicron wave further underscores the value of getting boosted, prompting Dr. Anthony Fauci to say, “The data are really stunningly obvious why a booster is really very important.’’\n\nThey spoke at a briefing by the White House COVID-19 response team, during which Walensky confirmed the omicron surge is abating, with new infections nationwide down 36% to a daily average of 446,000 compared to the previous week, and hospitalizations dropping 14% to 17,100.

Fauci highlighted two recent studies that showed vaccination had no impact on fertility, which actually diminished temporarily among males infected with the virus.\n\n“New data adds to previous studies that indicate the COVID-19 vaccination does not negatively impact fertility,’’ Fauci said. “And of course, as we’ve all said over and over again, vaccination is recommended for people who are trying to get pregnant now or might become pregnant in the future, as well as their partners.’’\n\nFor many who are already parents, news that their children under age 5 may become eligible for the vaccine by the end of this month could relieve concerns about their exposure to the virus.\n\nResponse team coordinator Jeff Zients said about 18 million children in that age group would qualify once the Food and Drug Administration and the CDC give their OK, adding that the administration is already working on distribution plans for the low-dose vaccine.\n\n“We’ll be ready to start getting shots in arms soon after FDA and CDC make their decisions,’’ Zients said.\n\nAlso in the news:\n\n►The Food and Drug Administration said its vaccine advisory committee will have a virtual meeting Feb. 15 to discuss Pfizer-BioNTech's request for an emergency use authorization of its COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 6 months through 4 years.

The Navy announced it would begin discharging unvaccinated members in December; the Air Force began letting go of unvaccinated people that same month.\n\nMardi Gras mask, vaccine rules draw legal challenge in New Orleans\n\nMore than 100 people have joined a lawsuit against New Orleans’ mayor and health director over COVID-19 restrictions recently extended to Mardi Gras parades and other events leading up to Fat Tuesday on March 1.\n\nThe 2020 festival was recognized afterward as a super spreader that turned New Orleans into an early pandemic hot spot. Last year, parades were canceled and bars were shuttered. This month, masks are required in bars, restaurants and other public spaces. And children as young as 5 must show proof of vaccination or a recent negative test for the virus to get into indoor public areas.\n\nThe lawsuit against Mayor LaToya Cantrell and health director Jennifer Avegno targets mask and vaccination mandates. City Hall spokesman Beau Tidwell said the city normally doesn't publicly respond to litigation.\n\n“However, in this case I think it’s worth noting that the guidelines that we put in place saved lives, full stop,\" Tidwell said. \"The vaccine mandate and the mask requirements are going to remain in place throughout Mardi Gras.”\n\nMany physicians still prescribing ivermectin despite dubious evidence\n\nContrary to scientific evidence and warnings from health agencies, hundreds of doctors nationwide continue to prescribe ivermectin – encouraged by a little-known national group of physicians – to prevent and treat COVID-19. Many of the doctors follow treatment guidelines set by an organization called the Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance, which promotes the controversial drug along with other unproven therapies. The group's protocol is a laundry list of ivermectin and other prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, vitamin supplements and herbs, none of which have been scientifically proven to work against COVID-19. Read more here.\n\n“There’s a group of physicians who will abandon the science in order to satisfy the unscientific demands of patients,” said Dr. Gregory Poland, professor of medicine and infectious diseases and director of the Mayo Clinic's Vaccine Research Group. “It’s disinformation. You’re failing to use proven therapies in favor of disproven therapies, and that’s wrong.”\n\n– Adrianna Rodriguez\n\nSurge of child COVID cases fueled rise in inflammatory disease\n\nAlthough overall child COVID-19 case counts are on their way down in the United States, the January numbers were 3.5 times higher with the omicron variant than what was seen with the previous delta surge, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. The increase in cases has resulted in more pediatric hospitalizations and the rise of a dangerous disorder called MIS-C, or Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children. MIS-C, a condition leading to inflammation in the body affecting organs such as the heart and lungs, occurs about four weeks after infection and can cause high fever, rash, and in some children, other serious health outcomes.\n\nDr. John Vanchiere, president of the Louisiana Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said about 6,000 cases of MIS-C have been documented nationwide.\n\n\"Their whole immune system is really turned on inappropriately,\" Vanchiere said. \"That inflammation can have long-term effects on the heart and particularly the coronary arteries. We're worried about that.\"\n\nPandemic isolates seniors. Loneliness is taking its toll\n\nEven before the pandemic, advocates and health experts had warned of loneliness and social isolation among the nation’s older adult population. Now, nearly two years in, they say government mandates and precautionary measures meant to control the virus by limiting social interaction have taken an emotional, mental and physical toll. Geriatric workers say rates of depression and anxiety have risen among their clients in that time. In more severe cases, those conditions have led to cognitive and physical deterioration, or worse.\n\n“People experienced cognitive decline from having no stimulation, and that has persisted,” said Stacey Malcolmson, Senior Source president and CEO. “For those with underlying mental health conditions like dementia or Alzheimer’s, we’ve been finding that that cognitive decline is irreversible.”\n\n– Marc Ramirez\n\nMichigan woman pleads guilty to misusing federal COVID funds\n\nA Michigan woman who previously owned a home health agency that was never operational during the pandemic received $37,657 in federal funds designated for the medical treatment and care of COVID-19 patients, the Department of Justice said. The woman pleaded guilty Tuesday in the Eastern District of Michigan to stealing government funds and using them for her own personal expenses. She previously owned 1 on 1 Home Health in LaPorte, Indiana, which she had closed in early 2020.\n\nThe woman was indicted in February of last year in the first criminal charges for the intentional misuse of funds distributed from the CARES Act Provider Relief Fund.\n\n– Grace Hauck, USA TODAY\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/02/02"}]}

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nKennedy Space Center, Florida (CNN) The launch of NASA's historic Artemis I moon mission has been postponed after the team was unable to work through an issue with one of the rocket's four engines.\n\n\"It's too early to say what the options are,\" said Mike Sarafin, Artemis mission manager at a NASA press conference. \"We really need time to look at all the information, all the data. We're going to play all nine innings here. We're not ready to give up yet.\"\n\nThe next opportunity to send the Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft on their journey is September 2, but whether or not another attempt is made that day depends on how testing goes.\n\nSarafin confirmed that \"Friday is definitely in play\" if the team can resolve the issue while the rocket sits on the pad within the next 48 to 72 hours.\n\nThe next launch window is September 2, opening at 12:48 p.m. ET and closing at 2:48 p.m. ET. The next window after that is September 5, opening at 5:12 p.m. ET and closing at 6:42 p.m. ET.\n\n\"Launch controllers were continuing to evaluate why a bleed test to get the RS-25 engines on the bottom of the core stage to the proper temperature range for liftoff was not successful, and ran out of time in the two-hour launch window,\" according to an update from NASA. \"Engineers are continuing to gather additional data.\"\n\nThe launch team knew that the bleed test was a risk because they weren't able to include it in previous wet dress rehearsal tests simulating the launch, and Monday was the first time demonstrating that, Sarafin said.\n\nCurrently, the issue doesn't suggest an engine problem, but rather an issue within the bleed system that is used to cool the engine, he said.\n\n\"We need the engine to be at the cryogenically cool temperature such that when it starts, it's not shocked with all the cold fuel that flows through it. So we needed a little extra time to assess that,\" Sarafin said.\n\nThe team also saw an issue with the vent valve at the inner tank and the combination of issues convinced the team they needed more time, Sarafin said.\n\nIf a substantial fix is needed the team may require more time to address it and roll the rocket stack back into the Kennedy Space Center's Vehicle Assembly Building, a process that takes 3 1/2 days.\n\nThe launch team still needs to troubleshoot the engine issue and will keep the rocket in its current configuration to gather data and assess what needs to be done. Both the Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft remain stable, according to NASA officials.\n\nPrior to the scrub, the countdown was extended into an unplanned hold as the launch team worked on a troubleshooting plan for one of the rocket's four engines.\n\nThat's because the launch team discovered an issue with an engine bleed in engine #3. Attempts to reconfigure it were unsuccessful.\n\nDuring engine bleeds, hydrogen is cycled through the engine to condition it for launch. Three of the four engines are performing as expected, but engine #3 experienced an issue.\n\n\"There were also a series of weather issues throughout the launch window. We would have been a no-go for weather at the beginning of the window due to precipitation. Later on in the window, we would have been no-go for lightning within the launchpad area,\" Sarafin said.\n\nPreviously, 80% favorable weather conditions had been forecast for the beginning of the window, which opened at 8:33 a.m. ET, but the weather changed as that time inched closer.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, who traveled to Kennedy Space Center in Florida with second gentleman Doug Emhoff to watch the launch, underscored the United States' commitment to NASA's Artemis program in comments made after the postponement.\n\n\"While we hoped to see the launch of Artemis I today, the attempt provided valuable data as we test the most powerful rocket in history,\" Harris said via Twitter . \"Our commitment to the Artemis Program remains firm, and we will return to the moon.\"\n\nThe 322-foot-tall (98-meter-tall) stack is sitting on Launchpad 39B at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\n\nNASA Administrator Bill Nelson addressed the scrub shortly after it was announced, stressing that Artemis I is a test flight.\n\n\"We don't launch until it's right,\" Nelson said. \"They've got a problem with the gases going on the engine bleed on one engine. It's just illustrative that this is a very complicated machine, a very complicated system, and all those things have to work. You don't light the candle until it's ready to go.\"\n\nIt's something Nelson has personal experience with. As an astronaut, he was on the 24th flight of the Space Shuttle. It was scrubbed four times on the pad and the fifth try resulted in a flawless mission.\n\n\"Had we launched on any one of those scrubs, it wouldn't have been a good day,\" he said.\n\nSeveral issues cropped up after the rocket began fueling after midnight.\n\nOffshore storms with the potential for lightning prevented the team from beginning the fueling process, due to start at midnight, for about an hour.\n\nThe hold was lifted at 1:13 a.m. ET, and the tanking process began to load the rocket's core stage with supercold liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen.\n\nThe team stopped filling the tank with liquid hydrogen twice due to an initial leak as well as a pressure spike, but tanking resumed for the core stage and began for the upper stage, or the interim cryogenic propulsion stage.\n\nThe team also discovered a line of frost on the inner stage flange. At first, engineers thought the frost may indicate the presence of a crack in the tank, but it turned out to be a crack in the external foam. The team shared that the issue had been resolved since the foam crack did not indicate a leak.\n\nEngineers also experienced an 11-minute delay in communications between the Orion spacecraft and ground systems. The issue could have impacted the beginning of terminal count, or the countdown that begins when 10 minutes remain on the clock before liftoff. The team was able to work through the issue, which was the result of a simple misconfiguration.\n\nIn addition to the visit by Harris, appearances by celebrities like Jack Black, Chris Evans and Keke Palmer and performances of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" by Josh Groban and Herbie Hancock and \"America the Beautiful\" by The Philadelphia Orchestra and cellist Yo-Yo Ma were planned as part of the program.\n\nMission overview\n\nWhen Artemis I launches, Orion's journey will last 42 days as it travels to the moon, loops around it and returns to Earth -- traveling a total of 1.3 million miles (2.1 million kilometers). When it returns to Earth, the capsule will splash down in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of San Diego.\n\nWhile the passenger list doesn't include any humans, it does have passengers: three mannequins and a plush Snoopy toy will ride in Orion.\n\nThe crew aboard Artemis I may sound a little unusual, but they each serve a purpose. Snoopy will serve as the zero gravity indicator -- meaning that he will begin to float inside the capsule once it reaches the space environment.\n\nCameras inside and outside of Orion will share images and video throughout the mission, including live views from the Callisto experiment , which will capture a stream of Commander Moonikin Campos sitting in the commander's seat. If you have an Amazon Alexa-enabled device, you can ask it about the mission's location each day.\n\nExpect to see views of Earthrise, similar to what was shared during Apollo 8 for the first time, but with much better cameras and technology.\n\nScience experiments and technology demonstrations are riding in a ring on the rocket. The 10 small satellites, called CubeSats, will detach and go their separate ways to collect information on the moon and the deep space environment.\n\nThe inaugural mission of the Artemis program will kick off a phase of space exploration that lands diverse astronaut crews at previously unexplored regions of the moon and eventually delivers crewed missions to Mars.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/08/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/29/us/five-things-august-29-trnd/index.html/", "title": "5 things to know for August 29: NASA, Flooding, Shootings, Covid ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nGet '5 Things' in your inbox If your day doesn’t start until you’re up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix.

During engine bleeds, hydrogen is cycled through the engine to condition it for launch. Three of the four engines were performing as expected, but engine #3 was experiencing an issue. The uncrewed Artemis I mission had been scheduled to lift off today between 8:33 a.m. and 10:33 a.m. ET from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, but several issues cropped up after the rocket began fueling after midnight. The next launch window is September 2. The last crewed landing on the moon, Apollo 17, took place in 1972.\n\n2. Hurricanes\n\nFor the first time in 25 years, the month of August did not have a named storm. But now that September has arrived, things appear to have changed quickly in the tropical Atlantic. On Thursday, the National Hurricane Center announced that Tropical Storm Danielle, currently in the North Atlantic, is expected to strengthen into a hurricane by Saturday. Danielle is not a threat to any land at this time, forecasts show, and it is expected to remain fairly stationary through the weekend. Still, current indications show the early stages of the Atlantic hurricane season have been above average and could begin to pick up.\n\n3. January 6\n\nFormer President Trump said he will “very, very seriously” consider full pardons for the rioters who breached the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, if he runs for reelection and wins. “If I decide to run and if I win, I will be looking very, very strongly about pardons. Full pardons,” Trump said on Wendy Bell Radio Thursday. Trump had made a similar promise during his final days in office when some of the January 6 rioters were already in jail. None, however, were pardoned before he left office. Trump’s comments come amid intense speculation about a potential 2024 presidential run, and his continued invocation of the Capitol attack could preview a central part of his future political messaging.\n\n4. Abortion\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is mobilizing his MAGA allies to defend him ahead of the upcoming public hearings by the House select committee investigating the January 6 insurrection. Trump’s team has asked some prominent Republicans to cover for him and push back on the committee while the public hearings play out, according to GOP sources familiar with the request. Committee members have teased that the prime-time hearings could be focused on Trump’s direct role in undermining the election results. The committee has been working toward a thesis that Trump’s obsession with losing the election and his peddling of false claims about the results is what laid the groundwork for the violent and deadly riot at the Capitol. The first public hearing will take place Thursday at 8 p.m. ET.\n\n5.

And it has significantly increased the cost of one major budget buster – raising kids.\n\nIt now costs $310,605 for a married middle-income couple with two children to raise their youngest child from birth through high school, according to a recent estimate from the Brookings Institution.\n\nThe estimate builds on a 2017 report from the US Department of Agriculture. Back then, the agency estimated that it cost a middle-income, married couple $233,610 to raise a child to the age of 17. The price factored in expenses for food, shelter and other necessities for a child born in 2015, but notably not the cost of a college education.\n\nBrookings found that today’s record-high inflation has dramatically increased those costs. Brookings first shared the numbers with the Wall Street Journal.\n\n“It causes people to recognize that when you start having a family or when you increase the size of your family, you’re going to have to make some tradeoffs with other items in your budget,” said Isabel Sawhill, a senior fellow in economic studies at Brookings Institution who authored the study with Brookings’ senior research assistant Morgan Welch.\n\nHousing is the biggest expense for families and accounts for almost a third of the total child-rearing costs. The median home price in July – $403,800 – was up 10.8% from a year ago, marking more than a decade of year-over-year monthly gains. And prices rose across the country, with 80% of US metro areas seeing double-digit home price increases last quarter.\n\nFood is the second most expensive budget item when raising a child, the USDA found, making up 18% of the total cost in its original calculation. Sawhill noted their most recent estimation did not adjust the allocation of costs for different items.\n\nOver the past year, grocery prices rose 13.1%, the largest annual increase since 1979, the Bureau of Labor Statistics found. Almost every grocery staple is more expensive due to inflation – prices for eggs soared 38%, chicken jumped to 17.6% and milk is up 15.6%.\n\nSawhill said the estimate already had to make a big assumption about what inflation is going to look like in the future. The number is still based on expenses for a child born in 2015, so Brookings had to estimate the inflation rate past the child’s current age of seven.\n\nWhen it put out its estimates, the USDA had been using an inflation rate of 2% from 2015 onward, but Sawhill assumed 4% in the new estimation by looking at historical trends that arose after the US emerged from the high inflation rate environment of the late 1970s.\n\n“In ’79, the Federal Reserve stepped hard on the brakes to bring down what was at that time, double-digit inflation,” Sawhill said. “And it took at least a decade for those numbers to get back to normal.”", "authors": ["Ramishah Maruf"], "publish_date": "2022/08/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2018/02/26/raising-child-costs-233-610-you-financially-prepared-parent/357243002/", "title": "Raising a child: How much does it cost to raise a kid from birth to 18", "text": "Aimee Picchi\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nFour years after getting married — and after a lot of financial planning — Jennie Kennedy and her husband welcomed their baby son into their Spokane, Wash., home.\n\nKennedy, 34, recalled their discussions before their son was born: “ ‘Are we ready? Are we in a good spot?’ We probably over-thought it because we put off getting pregnant.”\n\nNot quite. Kennedy and her husband took all the right steps before having a child, including putting money aside and analyzing their finances, experts say. Adding a child represents a major financial stress: The cost of raising a child today is $233,610 – excluding the cost of college – for a middle-income family, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nThe stakes may be higher for new parents than in previous generations, thanks to a combination of changing demographics and economic pressures.\n\nWomen are delaying motherhood, a trend especially pronounced for college-educated women. That means new parents typically have a better financial foothold than in earlier decades, yet it can deliver other challenges, such as a higher rate of fertility problems and tough decisions about balancing work and family.\n\nHow to budget for baby\n\nWhere to start? First, financial experts recommend socking away six months of living expenses, which will help if a parent wants to take unpaid time off from work or if the family encounters surprises.\n\nNext, get a grip on your budget. Estimate how your expenses might change after the baby arrives. While there will be new expenses – such as higher costs for food, clothing and child care – some couples may spend less on restaurants and entertainment, said Adrienne Penta, senior vice president at Brown Brothers Harriman’s Center for Women & Wealth.\n\n“Think about what your life will be like after a baby, which isn’t the same as two professional people in the city,” Penta said.\n\nFinancial programs such as You Need a Budget or Mint can help would-be parents set up a budget and model expenses after a baby. One of the biggest costs is child care, which can vary considerably depending on your location. Talking with friends and family who have relied on child care can give a sense of your area’s costs, said Kelly Barrow, a wealth management adviser with financial services firm TIAA.\n\nSetting up a health savings account (HSA), available to people with high-deductible health care plans, can also prove helpful, as New York mom Priya Raghavan discovered. She and her husband relied on an HSA to help cover unexpected medical expenses, such as an unplanned hospital visit for their newborn daughter.\n\n“I was surprised because we have good insurance,” Raghavan said.\n\nFertility treatments and adoption\n\nWith more adults putting off parenthood, some are finding themselves blindsided by another health expense: fertility treatments. One round of in vitro fertilization (IVF) can set a couple back by $15,000, and often multiple rounds are required to conceive. Adoption within the U.S. can range from $15,000 to $40,000, while international adoptions can cost as much as $50,000, according to the Child Welfare Information Gateway, a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nPut some legwork into research, such as what benefits your employer offers and how the fertility industry works, said Kelley Long, a certified financial planner with Financial Finesse, who herself is pursuing IVF treatments.\n\n“If I had to go back and start over, I would do things differently,” she added. “Part of educating yourself is knowing what costs are negotiable,” such as fertility drugs.\n\nHope for the best, plan for the worst\n\nLastly, create a will and take out life insurance before the baby arrives, financial experts say.\n\n“Everyone needs a plan, if you have $100 million or $150 in your bank account,” said Brown Brother Harriman’s Penta. “Take a 50,000-foot view before you have these people in your life who have personalities and needs.”\n\nSaving for a child’s college education is another step, although 529 plans are typically opened for a child after their birth because it requires a Social Security number for the beneficiary. Consider asking family members to contribute, rather than buying a new toy or clothing, experts say. College costs rose more than 3% last year, outpacing inflation, and the average private college now costs almost $47,000 annually.\n\nRaghavan said her advice for people who may be thinking of starting a family: “Start saving.”\n\nShe added, “Prioritize what you want for your child and for yourself. It shouldn’t be that hard, but every little thing adds up.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/02/26"}, {"url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2019/03/18/car-insurance-rates-gender-should-cost-same-men-women/3142110002/", "title": "Average car insurance rates by age and gender", "text": "Lisa Green\n\nNerdWallet\n\nYour driving record may be flawless. Your car may be one of the safest on the road. But, in most states, you might pay more for car insurance than an all-but-identical driver, simply because of your gender.\n\nNo one is immune. While men traditionally have paid more, particularly when they’re younger, recent studies show women often pay more when they’re older.\n\nThis year, California joined six other states in banning the use of gender to set car insurance prices. Elsewhere, drivers can pay hundreds of dollars a year in higher premiums because of the effect of gender on their rates.\n\nRansom hoax?:The kidnapper calling from his daughter's iPhone demanded money or she would die. It was all a scam.\n\nMoney-making jobs:These are the 25 highest paying jobs in the US\n\nWhether such pricing is fair depends on your perspective, but drivers can come out ahead by finding insurers that give their gender a break.\n\n“The best thing you can do is to shop for insurance,” says James Lynch, chief actuary for the Insurance Information Institute. “Different companies have very different rates, and you can get a good deal by shopping around.”\n\nWho pays more?\n\nInsurers analyze many factors, including driving records and demographics, to decide which drivers are more likely to have accidents and therefore should pay more. They’re required to justify their rates to state regulators. In Hawaii, Massachusetts, Montana, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, parts of Michigan and now California, insurers can’t use gender as a factor. Elsewhere, the approach to gender varies widely.\n\n“Until the last few years, men always paid more,” says Robert Hunter, director of insurance for the Consumer Federation of America. But in 2017 the group found most large car insurance companies often charge 40- and 60-year-old women more than their male counterparts.\n\nWhere you can find best deals:Drivers in these states could see the biggest discount on car insurance if they switched\n\nLooking at getting accident forgiveness?:Why you should think twice before adding it on your car insurance\n\nThe research, which priced basic liability insurance from six insurers in 10 cities, also found widespread inconsistencies. For example, Allstate quoted higher rates for 40-year-old women in Baltimore and higher rates for their male counterparts in Tampa, Florida, according to the data. For 20-year-olds in Cleveland, Farmers Insurance showed higher quotes for men while Geico had higher quotes for women.\n\nA 2019 NerdWallet analysis found similar patterns for full-coverage policies, which provide broader protection. It examined average annual rates among the largest insurers in 20 ZIP codes of each state for a 2015 Toyota Camry for single 40-year-old drivers with clean records and good credit.\n\nSeven of the country’s 10 largest car insurance companies showed higher average rates for women in some states and higher rates for men in other states.\n\nBut gender-based price differences were dwarfed by overall price differences among companies. So a woman might save hundreds of dollars a year with the cheapest insurer in her area – even if that insurer would charge her male counterpart less.\n\nAn example from NerdWallet’s analysis underscores the importance of shopping for insurance. Here are two companies’ average annual rates for drivers in Minnesota:\n\nAmerican Family: $921 for women; $917 for men.\n\nAllstate: $1,859 for women; $1,881 for men.\n\nWhat drivers can do\n\n“If you want a company that doesn’t use gender (in setting rates), have that conversation with your agent or company,” says Nicole Ganley, spokesperson at the American Property Casualty Insurance Association. “And shop around, because there’s a lot of choices out there.”\n\nComparison shopping is the key to finding the best rates.\n\n“There’s no substitute for that,” says Alex Hageli, also with the APCIA as the director of personal lines policy, which includes auto and home.\n\nSome advice for shoppers:\n\nCompare quotes.

Congratulations! Better put plenty of money in your savings account.\n\nThe Department of Agriculture says the estimated cost of raising a child from birth through age 17 is $233,610, or as much as almost $14,000 annually. That’s the average for a middle-income couple with two children. It’s a bit more expensive in urban parts of the country, and less so in rural areas.\n\nThe estimate released today is based on 2015 numbers, so a baby born this year is likely to cost even more. It’s a 3% increase from the prior year, a hike higher than inflation.\n\nRelated:\n\nWhat 1 thing would kids growing up in Detroit change?\n\nParent raising children and grandchildren on tight budget\n\nToxic stress of poverty, violence, pain alter kids' brains\n\nSince 1960, USDA has compiled the annual report to inform — and probably terrify — budget-preparing parents. State governments and courts also use the information to write child support and foster care guidelines. The main costs include housing, food, transportation, health care, education, clothing and other miscellaneous expenses.\n\nThings to know about how much it costs to raise a child:\n\nHOUSING IS EXPENSIVE\n\nUp to a third of the total cost is housing, accounting for 26% to 33% of the total expense of raising a child. USDA comes up with those numbers by calculating the average cost of an additional bedroom — an approach the department says is probably conservative, because it doesn’t account for those families who pay more to live in communities that have better schools or other amenities for children.\n\nURBAN VS. RURAL DIFFERENCES\n\nThe cost of raising a child varies in different regions of the country. Overall, middle-income, married-couple families in the urban Northeast spent the most ($253,770), followed by those in the urban West ($235,140) and urban South ($221,730). Those in the urban Midwest spent less ($217,020), along with those in rural areas ($193,020).\n\nUSDA estimates the annual housing cost per child in urban areas is $3,900, while it’s $2,400 in rural areas.\n\nThere were also differences depending on income. Lower-income families are expected to spend around $174,690 per child from birth through 17; higher-income families will spend a whopping $372,210.\n\nThe average middle-income family earns between $59,200 and $107,400 before taxes.\n\nCHILD CARE COSTS HAVE RISEN\n\nAfter housing, child care, education and food are the highest costs for families. For a middle-income couple with two children, food costs make up about 18% of the cost of raising a child. Child care and education costs make up 16%.\n\nEducation costs have sharply risen since 1960, when USDA estimated that those expenses were around 2% of child-rearing expenses. The report says this growth is likely due to the increased number of women in the workforce, prompting the need for more child care.\n\nThe numbers don’t even include the annual cost of college, which the government estimates is $45,370 for a private college and $20,090 for a public college.\n\nOLDER KIDS ARE MORE EXPENSIVE\n\nNew parents may flinch at the costs of diapers and baby gear, but it’s going to get worse. While a child costs around $12,680 when he or she is between 0 and 2, a teenager between 15 and 17 costs around $13,900 annually.\n\nUSDA says food, transportation, clothing and health care expenses all grow as a child ages. Transportation costs are highest for the oldest children, perhaps because they start driving, and child care and education costs are highest for six and under.\n\nMORE KIDS, LOWER COSTS\n\nThere is some good news for big families. Families with three or more children spend an average of 24% less per child. USDA says that’s because children often share bedrooms in bigger families, clothing and toys are handed down and food can be purchased in larger and more economical packages. Also, private schools and child care providers may offer sibling discounts.\n\nIn contrast, one-child households spend an average of 27% more on the single child.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/01/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2021/07/08/child-tax-credit-irs-what-to-know-about-advance-payments/7899621002/", "title": "Child tax credit 2021: What to know about new advance payments", "text": "Starting July 15, parents will be eligible to receive a new monthly payment for each child thanks to a new federal law.\n\nCalled an advanced child tax credit, the monthly payments are connected to your income taxes. If eligible, parents may receive half of their annual tax credit money in the form of monthly payments. Parents will receive the other half of the credit when they file their income tax returns.\n\nPart of the American Rescue Plan, which President Joe Biden signed in March, the new advance payments add to the child tax credit, which has existed in some form since 1997. The amount has increased over the years and will increase again with the new program on July 15. For now, the advance payments and increased amounts run through Dec. 15, 2021.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the payments parents will start receiving in just a few weeks:\n\n'Going to make a difference': Families plan how they’ll spend extra cash.\n\nWhy can't grads find jobs?:The economy needs millions of workers. What's going on?\n\nWhat is the advance child tax credit?\n\nThe new advance child tax credit pays parents part of the tax credit they will receive at the end of the year in monthly installments. Parents will then report that they have received these payments — and will claim the other half of the credit — when filing their tax return in April.\n\nA tax credit is the amount you are allowed to subtract from the income taxes you owe to the government. For example, if you are eligible for a $1,000 tax credit and you owe $3,000 in income taxes, the amount you owe in taxes is reduced to $2,000.\n\nParents with children under age 6 are eligible for up to $3,600 per child, or $300 per month. Parents with children from ages 6-17 are eligible for up to $3,000 per child, or $250 per month with the advance payments. For now, though, these increased amounts and advance payments are set to expire at the end of 2021.\n\nMichael Jamison, president of OnTarget CPA, said the government sees these tax credits as a way to support parents, offset costs associated with having children and provide \"some level of support for children throughout the year.\"\n\nWhere's my Social Security check?:When will I get my monthly Social Security check? It depends on these quirky rules.\n\nHow is the advance child tax credit different from the child tax credit that exists right now?\n\nPreviously, parents were able to claim the tax credit in full only when filing taxes. The advance payments, which offer half the credit in monthly installments and half available to be claimed in April or whenever tax returns are filed, are new.\n\nThis tax credit amount has increased, from $2,000 for all children to $3,600 for children under the age of 6 and $3,000 for children between the ages of 6 and 17.\n\nCurrently, the new tax credit program is set to end at the end of 2021 unless a new law is passed.\n\nWho is eligible for the advance child tax credit?\n\nParents with at least one child under the age of 18 who meet the income requirements are eligible for the full credit.\n\nTo qualify for the full tax credit, filers must make less than $75,000 if filing alone, less than $150,000 if filing jointly as a married couple and less than $112,500 for \"head of household\" filers, such as unmarried single parents.\n\n\"If you make more than that, it doesn't mean you won't get any of that credit; it just gets reduced down to a lower amount,\" Jamison said.\n\nIf you make more than the maximum income to qualify for the full amount, your tax credit will be reduced by $50 for each $1,000 your income exceeds the maximum until the credit amount reaches $2,000.\n\nIf your income is $400,000 filing jointly or $200,000 filing alone, the second phaseout begins. The second phaseout reduces the tax credit amount by $50 for every $1,000 your income exceeds $200,000 or $400,000, depending on the circumstances.\n\nYou also must reside in the United States for at least six months of the year, and the child must live with the parent claiming the child as a dependent for at least half the year.\n\nYour child must not turn 18 before Jan. 1, 2022, for you to be eligible for the credit. If you welcome a child at any time in 2021, you will be eligible for the full credit, Jamison said.\n\nHow much will the payments be?\n\nUnder the full tax credit, monthly payments will be $300 per child under age 6 and $250 per child ages 6 to 17.\n\nThese payments will amount to half of the credit: $1,800 for younger children, and $1,500 for older children. Parents will claim the other half of the tax credit when filing taxes.\n\nThe advance payments and increased amount are currently set to end at the end of 2021. Without new legislation, the tax credit will revert back to $2,000 per child, with no advance payment option.\n\nHow do I receive the advance child tax credit payment?\n\nYou can receive the advance child tax credit payment either by direct deposit or by check.\n\nIf you have previously set up direct deposit with the IRS, then you will receive payments in that bank account. To check your eligibility and bank account information, you can visit the child tax credit update portal. If you enrolled to receive direct deposit, you should see your routing number and the last four digits of your account listed in the portal.\n\nAll payments, including the July 15 payment, will be delivered by direct deposit if you are signed up. To change account information for the August payment, you can update your account information on the portal.\n\nThe payment cannot be split between accounts, and there is only one account number allowed per recipient.\n\nIf you are not signed up for direct deposit, then you will receive a check. To switch from receiving checks to direct deposit, you can add your bank routing number and bank account information in the portal.\n\nThe IRS encourages families to set up direct deposit in lieu of receiving checks because parents will get the money faster and it will eliminate the risk of lost or stolen checks, according to their website.\n\nHow do I claim the advance child tax credit on my taxes?\n\nTo balance this out on your taxes, you will need to claim and keep track of the advance payments you receive in 2021. Then you will report the amount and reconcile it with the amount you are eligible to receive on your tax return.\n\n\"The amount that you get needs to be input into your tax return,\" Jamison said. \"So the amount of an advanced payment that you receive ... you'd want to make sure that you're indicating that when you file that return.\"\n\nWhen will I receive the payments?\n\nFor those who are eligible and have not opted out, the first payments will start July 15.\n\nThe payment schedule is set for the rest of the year. Families will receive payments on these dates: July 15, Aug. 13, Sept. 15, Oct. 15, Nov. 15 and Dec. 15.\n\nIs it better to opt out of the monthly payments?\n\nIt depends. If your eligibility will change during the year--for instance you receive a raise --then it could be better to wait and claim the full amount when you file your tax return, Jamison said.\n\nIf another family member (such as an ex-spouse) qualifies to claim your child as a dependent, or you reside outside the U.S., you also may want to opt out.\n\nIt's too late to opt out of the monthly payments for July, but families can opt out of the August payments by Aug. 2.\n\nIf you want to opt out of the monthly payments and claim your full amount when you file your tax return, you can unenroll on the child tax credit update portal.\n\nIf you don't opt out of this advanced credit and your eligibility changes, you may end up having a balance due when you file your return. However, if you opt out of the monthly payments, you will be able to still receive the full tax credit based on your 2021 income when filing your income tax return, Jamison said.\n\n\"It's not like you're gonna lose out on it,'' Jamison said. \"You're just (going to) get all that money with your tax refund instead of getting that in advance.\"\n\nHow long will the advance child tax credit payments last?\n\nAs of now, the advance payments of the child tax credit are scheduled to go only through the end of 2021.\n\n\"Obviously Congress could choose to extend (or) change whatever they do for 2022,\" Jamison said. \"But this currently is only through the end of the year. And then next year, it reverts back to the regular.\"\n\nDo I have to apply or sign up to receive the advance child tax credit?\n\nNo. You are automatically eligible for the child tax credit if you meet the requirements and if you filed your taxes in 2020.\n\nIf you didn't file your taxes in 2020, you can still file your back taxes to receive the advance child tax credit payments.\n\nIf you did not qualify to file taxes in 2020 but are eligible for the tax credit, you can use the IRS' Non-Filer sign-up tool. To use the tool, you will need to provide your personal information, including your name, mailing address, date of birth, and Social Security or taxpayer ID numbers for you and your dependents. You will also need to provide your bank account and routing numbers and Identity Protection PIN from the IRS, if applicable.\n\nDo you have to pay back the advance child tax credit?\n\nGenerally, no, unless you claim more than what you actually qualify for based on your income.\n\nJamison recommends opting out of the advance payments if your income will increase and change your eligibility. If you receive the advance payments and your eligibility changes, you may owe money to the IRS when it comes time to file your tax return.\n\n\"What (the government is) doing is they're giving you this money, based on the amount of earnings you had in 2020,\" Jamison said. \"But they don't know yet how much you're gonna earn in 2021. So if you do earn more, then there's a chance you're gonna have to repay this advanced amount.\"\n\nAre dependents 18 and older eligible for the advance child tax credit?\n\nNo, however, parents with adolescent children may be eligible for other tax credits, Jamison said.\n\nUnder the March stimulus package, families with children who are 18 or full-time college students aged 19-24 whose parents or legal guardians claimed them as dependents will receive a one-time tax credit of $500 in April 2022, when parents file their 2021 income tax returns.\n\nContact IndyStar Pulliam Fellow Claire Rafford at crafford@gannett.com or on Twitter @clairerafford.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/14/politics/seniors-social-security-inflation-cola/index.html", "title": "Social Security's cost of living adjustment could be in the double ...", "text": "(CNN) Social Security recipients could see a 10.5% increase in their payments next year, driven by the steep rise in inflation, according to a new estimate.\n\nThat would add about $175 to the average monthly retiree benefit, which is currently $1,668, according to The Senior Citizens League, an advocacy group that released the projection Wednesday. But it still may not be enough to cover seniors' costs if price hikes aren't tamed in coming months.\n\nThe estimate is based on the June reading for an inflation measure the Social Security Administration uses to calculate the annual cost of living adjustment, or COLA. It rose by 9.8% over the past 12 months, compared with the 9.1% annual jump for the broader and better known Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers.\n\nJust how much more retirees, Americans with disabilities and other recipients will actually receive won't be determined until the fall.

A cost-of-living adjustment in this example would be an additional $1,800 a year.\n\nWe must wait until October for the official cost-of-living adjustment.\n\n\"This will be one of the highest COLAs ever paid in the history of the program,\" predicted Mary Johnson, a Social Security policy analyst for The Senior Citizens League, a nonprofit group.\n\nBased on consumer price index data for the year through July, the COLA adjustment could be around 9.6% if inflation continues at a similar pace.\n\nIf inflation heats up, that adjustment could jump to around 10.1%, according to estimates from the Senior Citizens League.\n\nIf inflation cools, the adjustment could end up in the 8% to 9% range, according to estimates.\n\nOnly two months of consumer price data – August and September – are left to go for the adjustment to be calculated. September data will be announced Oct. 13 by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nMore:Higher prices from scorching hot inflation — and other hiccups — push consumers to borrow\n\nMore:Why high inflation will make I Bonds even more popular\n\nA few years had such sizable gains\n\nThe inflation adjustment for Social Security benefits was high at 5.9% in 2022. The cost-of-living adjustment began with benefits payable to more than 64 million Social Security beneficiaries in January.\n\nBut you'd have to go back to 1979, 1980 and 1981 for any inflation adjustment that would be 9% or higher. The highest COLA ever was 14.3% in 1980.\n\nJohnson said the deepest impact of inflation has been felt by older adults who aren't bringing home a paycheck, even a small one; as well as seniors who don't have a pension or savings.\n\n\"Every COLA is meaningful,\" Johnson told the Free Press, \"because Social Security is one of the only forms of retirement income that is adjusted for inflation.\"\n\nIf you need about 10% more money now, for example, to buy the same groceries and other goods you bought a year ago, you're going to drain whatever savings you have much faster.\n\nWhile you can trim spending by turning to generic brands, eating less meat or going out for lunch less often, everything we buy isn't discretionary and cannot be scratched off a shopping list.\n\nInflation was high last year – and it soared even more in 2022. July did show improvement, as the month-to-month change was flat, reflecting in part a 7.7% decline in gasoline prices.\n\nRetirees couldn't keep up with inflation this year though, as many pensions aren't adjusted for inflation – and many retirees do not have pensions at all.\n\nWhile an inflation adjustment for Social Security benefits helped this year based on 2021's data, for example, it did not reflect the continued inflationary pressures in 2022.\n\nInflation has been running much hotter than the 5.9% adjustment given in 2022 to retirees and people receiving Supplemental Security Income payments, which are made to those with a disability or blindness who have income and resources below specific limits.\n\nOver the 12 months that ended in July, the Consumer Price Index rose 8.5%. Year over year in June, the inflation index climbed 9.1%.\n\n\"The actual COLA we received has fallen short of actual inflation,\" Johnson said. Her group estimates the shortfall is roughly $58 a month on a $1,656 monthly Social Security benefit.\n\nSome of that might even out in 2023.\n\n\"With the next COLA that we get, we may be in a little bit better position,\" Johnson said. \"I don't know how much longer inflation will continue at its current pace.\"\n\nRichard Johnson, director of the Program on Retirement Policy at the Urban Institute, said no one can say for certain how much Social Security benefits will increase in 2023.\n\nIf one assumes that energy prices continue to decline in August and September, which Johnson said seems likely, and other prices continue growing at recent rates, Johnson estimated that next year’s Social Security COLA would be 8.7%.\n\nIf energy prices hold steady for the next two months, he said, the COLA could be as high as 9.3%.\n\n\"The increase will help seniors a lot, especially those who depend most on Social Security,\" he said.\n\n\"But the adjustment only gets them back to where they were at the beginning of the year before prices really took off. Every time prices increase in 2023, they’ll continue to fall behind.\"\n\nRichard Johnson noted that the cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security doesn’t perfectly reflect how Social Security beneficiaries spend money to cover their expenses because the index is tied to spending by urban wage earners and clerical workers, who are mostly too young to collect Social Security.\n\nOverall, \"seniors have actually fared a bit better in terms of inflation than younger people,\" Johnson said.\n\nHe noted that the Bureau of Labor Statistics computes an alternative index to reflect spending by people ages 62 and older, known as the CPI for the Elderly, which gives less weight to transportation and more weight to medical care and housing than the standard inflation measure.\n\nJohnson said the CPI for the Elderly has increased slightly less than the standard CPI over the past 10 months because it gives less weight to transportation and energy. Energy prices, of course, have increased tremendously over the past year.\n\nSome seniors benefited as prescription drug prices increased only 2.8% over the past 12 months, Richard Johnson said, much less than the overall inflation rate.\n\nEvery extra dollar counts in retirement.\n\nThe problem for many households, including those headed by some retirees, is that personal savings are limited, and prices are unlikely to fall even if inflation cools.\n\nAbout 48% of households headed by someone aged 55 and over had no retirement savings in 2016, based on research released in 2019 by the U.S. Government Accountability Office.\n\nSome of those families could have a pension that could help provide a monthly income, but that same study showed 29% of such households had no pension and no retirement savings.\n\nInflation creates uncertainty\n\nNot surprisingly, half of retirees who feel less confident about their ability to live comfortably in retirement blamed inflation for triggering more anxiety, according to the 2022 Retirement Confidence Survey conducted by the Employee Benefit Research Institute and Greenwald Research.\n\nInflation hasn't been a worry for decades, but now those who are retired or planning for retirement need to consider what higher prices will mean to their 401(k)s or limited savings.\n\nOne key point: If you're at least 62 in 2023, you'd benefit automatically from next year's COLA increase – even if you have not yet filed to receive Social Security benefits.\n\nInflation adjustments are baked into future payments each year until you claim benefits, as long as you're 62 or older in 2023.\n\nThe Social Security Administration notes: “You’re eligible for cost-of-living benefit increases starting with the year you become age 62. This is true even if you don’t get benefits until your full retirement age or even age 70.”\n\nUltimately, getting inflation and some costs under control again would help a great deal.\n\nFor retirees, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 offers some hope that they'll soon see relief on drug costs but most changes aren't immediate.\n\nThe new federal law limits out-of-pocket costs for Part D prescription drugs covered under Medicare to $2,000, beginning in 2025.\n\nOne change in 2023: Beginning next year, the law limits copayments to $35 per month per prescription for covered insulin products in Medicare Part D plans, and for insulin furnished through an external insulin infusion pump under Medicare Part B, with no deductible.\n\nMany who receive Medicare are worried about higher premium costs in 2023. Often, retirees are frustrated that their Medicare Part B premiums have been increased aggressively and cut into the inflation adjustment on Social Security benefits.\n\nBut fingers crossed, retirees might not face that challenge next year.\n\nMedicare Part B covers doctor visits and outpatient care, as well as some drugs. The changes for any Part B premium would likely be announced in mid-November.\n\nLast November, the Centers Medicare & Medicaid Services announced that the Medicare Part B monthly premium rate would be $170.10 in 2022 – a 14.5% increase from the 2021 premium.\n\nThis year, it's possible that the increase would be smaller, or maybe even flat.\n\nIn May, Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra announced that Medicare Part B premiums paid by Medicare beneficiaries for 2022 should be adjusted downward to account for an overestimate in costs attributable to the inclusion of the new Alzheimer's drug Aduhelm within the Medicare program for reimbursement.\n\nSuch an adjustment wasn't made this year, but many expect this to put a limit on potential hikes in 2023.\n\nNo, the pain from inflation isn't going to vanish.

Times are tough for millions of families like the Sowas, and the cost of raising kids just keeps going up.\n\nAccording to the latest statistics released by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, parents will spend an average of $235,000 to raise a child born in 2011 to the age of 17. (And that's not taking into account any savings for college).\n\nHousing, food, clothing, health care, child care, schooling ... the list of compulsory expenses goes on and on.

What are we getting ourselves into?'\"\n\nThe numbers in the USDA's report are eye-opening.\n\nThe $235,000 figure is an average. For the lowest income groups, raising a child will cost about $212,000. For the highest earners, the number shoots up to $490,000.\n\nThe greatest share of these expenses is housing, which is 30 percent of the total. It's followed closely by child care and education at 18 percent and food at 16 percent.\n\n\"Because of the economic insecurity of life today, there are some tough trade-offs that families are having to make,\" says Ellen Galinsky, president of the Families and Work Institute in New York City. \"These aren't luxury trade-offs, like not getting the fanciest strollers. These are food and 'who's going to stay with my child' issues for so many families.\"\n\nIndeed, who is going to stay with the kids is one of the biggest financial hurdles parents face. In 1961, when the USDA's Expenditures on Children by Families report was first issued, child care and education costs amounted to only 2 percent of the overall cost. Today, that number stands at 18 percent.\n\nRebecca Sutton of Belvidere, N.J., has two sons—Landon, 4, and Brody, 4 months—with her partner, Jared Coffin. When the couple found out they were having a second child, they started doing the math and the result shocked them.\n\n\"Our day care expense for just our older son was over $1,000 a month,\" Sutton says. \"If we had put our younger son in day care as well, it would have been about $2,200 a month. That was more than our mortgage payment.\"\n\nThe couple knew they couldn't afford it and made a tough choice. Sutton returned to her job as an online marketing manager while Coffin, an electrician by trade, quit his full-time job in order to stay home with the kids. He picks up side work here and there, but being a dad is his primary focus.\n\n\"He's really getting into his groove now,\" says Sutton. \"He's enjoying spending time with both kids.\"\n\nFor much of the past decade, Josh Bevington was living the high life. A successful real estate agent in one of the hottest markets in the nation, he whipped around town from open houses to closing transactions. He had a thick portfolio of clients and was helping buy and sell dream homes in southwest Florida.\n\nBut in 2008, the American economy began to struggle; the bottom dropped out of the housing market and few places were harder hit than the Gulf Coast of Florida.\n\n\"We would joke around the office that we were working twice as hard for half as much,\" Bevington recalls. \"The membership at the local board of realtors decreased by half as a lot of agents got out of the business.\"\n\nAs the market constricted, so did Bevington's family finances. With three young children at home, Josh's wife, Caroline, tried to return to full-time work as a pediatric physical therapist. But money woes had hit local hospitals and the hours weren't there.\n\nSo Josh and Caroline sat down with their household budget and began making tough decisions. Gym memberships? Canceled. A treadmill? Sold online for extra cash. Running outside was free. Old cars were kept longer than planned. Friends and family helped out with baby-sitting.\n\nFinancial experts say the Bevingtons took the right steps when money issues appeared.\n\n\"That's one of the bright spots of these hard economic times,\" Cavanagh says. \"We have seen more families developing a budget or a spending plan. That's a first step—to become more aware of how they are spending money.\"\n\nFrom there, it's a simple next step to identify the areas\n\nwhere money is being wasted or the areas where one can cut back without too much sacrifice.\n\nFinally, if circumstances require it, families can move on to making more serious cuts, reducing food and clothing budgets, moving to a less expensive home, even selling a car and taking public transportation. Painful, but often necessary.\n\n\"After we found out we were having a second son, we knew we couldn't stay where we were living,\" Sutton recalls. \"The cost of living was way too high. Our house was too small and we wouldn't have been able to upgrade, the housing market was too expensive.\"\n\nSo Sutton and her family packed up their home in Maple Shade, N.J., and moved two hours away—closer to family and to a home owned by Sutton's parents.\n\nEvery family needs to find their own balance—the amount of belt-tightening they can live with while still giving the kids everything they need.\n\n\"I operate on a zero weekly budget,\" Laura Sowa says. \"The only money I spend during the week is for gas or groceries.\"\n\nAnd she means it.\n\nSowa never dashes into a restaurant to grab a quick lunch or dinner. Rather, she keeps a picnic blanket in her car along with packed lunches so she and the girls can stop at a park or the library to eat. She pours over local magazines looking for free things to do with the kids at area attractions, museums and bookstores.\n\nWhen it comes to shopping, Sowa is a coupon queen. Each week, she goes through the supermarket flyers to see what's on sale. Then she plans the family's meals based on what bargains she can get. She estimates she cuts at least 30 percent off her grocery bill each week, sometimes more.\n\n\"When I get it up to 40 or 45 percent, I'm pretty proud. I make a call to my husband and tell him how much we saved,\" Sowa says with a laugh.\n\n\"We have seen an incredible rise in the number of people using coupons,\" says Cavanagh. \"A dollar here and 50 cents there really does add up over the course of a year.\"\n\nThere are other keys to Sowa's frugalness.\n\nSpecial activities such as camps or lessons for the girls often go on Christmas and birthday lists and are given as gifts by grandparents. Sowa never buys any clothing new. All of the girls' clothes are either hand-me-downs from older cousins or items purchased at consignment shops. Sowa keeps tubs in the attic of their home, labeled by size and season. Shirts, pants, dresses, jackets—they all sit there waiting to be called into action. When they are being worn, Sowa takes fastidious care of them until the girls outgrow them.\n\n\"I do a lot of soaking,\" she says. \"I soak them in detergent to get any stains out and then they go back to consignment. I press them and hang them and price them and off they go.\"\n\nThe money made selling items on consignment goes toward new things the family needs. It's a never-ending loop.\n\nWhile times have been tight for many families with children like the Bevingtons and Sowas, valuable lessons have been learned. Lessons about budgeting. Lessons about making do with less. Lessons about what one really needs in life to be happy.\n\nFor Josh Bevington, the downturn in his real estate business brought some hardship, but also something of immeasurable value.\n\n\"It was a blessing in disguise. I had been working way too much, working 80 hours a week,\" Bevington says. \"I was able to step back and realize that my priorities were out of whack. I started going to church. I started spending time with the kids. I'm coaching. I'm taking an active part in their lives.\"\n\nDespite what the statistics say, it turns out that the high cost of raising kids isn't always as expensive as many believe.\n\n\"What we think our children need and what children actually need can be quite different sometimes,\" says Galinsky. \"Don't think it's always something you have to purchase for your child or something you have to schedule for them. The time spent with you—taking a walk, looking at leaves falling—will be something they will remember forever.\"\n\nCutting the cost\n\nSometimes circumstances dictate that we cut back to the bare minimum. Here are nine things to consider when you have to stretch your budget.\n\nDon't buy a top-of-the-line stroller. Cut your child's hair. Find free entertainment at parks, libraries, restaurants. Keep birthday parties simple — at home, games, cake, presents, done. Handle pre-school at home. Shift hours instead of opting for expensive childcare. Look (but don't buy) in stores, then purchase online. Shop bargain racks, consignment stores and garage sales. Pack lunches, buy in bulk, and consider making food from scratch.\n\nThis article was excerpted from USA TODAY's Guide to Kids' Health magazine, available through USA TODAY's online store.

But of all the financial choices you can make, the one with the most impact, by a long shot, is not having a child or having one fewer than planned.\n\nIt also turns out to be the best move for the environment.\n\nGiven the social and emotional value placed on family, that can be hard to hear, but if you’re undecided about the idea of parenthood, understanding the environmental and financial costs can help inform your decision. Here’s what you should know.\n\nThe environmental cost\n\nWhile it doesn’t receive a lot of media coverage as a savvy environmental move, not having a child is the most effective single decision you can make to reduce your carbon footprint. The second-best alternative, living car-free, isn’t even close. That’s according to Canadian research published in the journal Environmental Research Letters.\n\nThe carbon savings from not having a child vastly outweighs every other single solution for mitigating carbon. And this chart shows the annual, not lifetime, savings. So not having a child accrues this benefit every single year.\n\nTo put this in more perspective, you’d have to fly back and forth to Europe 36 times per year to have the same carbon impact as having one child. Other options such as recycling, going car-free or eating vegetarian also have little impact in comparison.\n\nThe financial cost\n\nThe economic cost is just as striking. The Department of Agriculture estimates that it costs nearly $234,000 to raise a child born in 2015 through age 17 — and that figure doesn’t include the cost of college. More importantly, this number doesn’t factor in what that money would compound into over time if invested elsewhere.\n\n» MORE:Calculate the cost of raising a child\n\nThe average cost of child-raising amounts to between $12,350 and $14,000 per year. Let’s be even more conservative, however, and use the average for lower-income families, about $10,000 annually, or nearly two annual maximum individual retirement account contributions. So what would one child cost in retirement savings over a 35-year career, assuming these 17 years’ worth of savings were plowed into the stock market?\n\nThese results are shocking: The cost to your retirement of having a child could top $2.5 million. That’s how much you could have in 35 years if you had invested that $10,000 annually. This assumes 10% annual stock returns, with compounding — right at the market’s long-term average.\n\nStill want to have kids? When it comes to maximizing your retirement savings, you have three options: delay, delay, delay — because you can roll up a nest egg in the interim. There are, of course, other factors to consider if you’re deciding when to start a family, but the more time you give your investing snowball to grow, the smaller the overall hit to your retirement 35 years out.\n\nLooking to save some money on that child? Here’s how to minimize expenses and maximize savings.\n\nMore From NerdWallet\n\nThe article Your Best Financial Move Is Also Best for the Environment originally appeared on NerdWallet.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/01/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2018/05/29/college-cost-scary-amount-future-got-529-plan/638830002/", "title": "Attending Harvard will cost $475,000 in 2036.

Then new parents will probably want to take a seat for this news.\n\nIn 2036, just 18 years from now, four years at a private university will be around $303,000, up from $167,000 today.\n\nTo get a degree at a public university you'll need about $184,000, compared with $101,000 now.\n\nThese forecasts were provided by Wealthfront, an automated investment platform that offers college saving options. It uses Department of Education data on the current cost of schools along with expected annual inflation to come up with its projections.\n\nHere are the estimated changes in cost over the next 18 years for six well-known schools.\n\nThe cost of college, now and in 18 years\n\n(The totals include tuition, room and board, supplies and other expenses for four years at the institution).\n\nCollege 2018 2036 UCLA $221,000 $394,000 UC-Berkeley $224,000 $399,000 Univ. of Texas-Austin $211,000 $377,000 Stanford $266,000 $475,000 MIT $261,000 $466,000 Harvard $266,000 $475,500\n\nSource Wealthfront, CNBC\n\n\"Some of the universities are nearly half a million dollars — people get a little bit of sticker shock,\" said Kate Wauck, head of communications at Wealthfront.\n\n\"But once you have the power of knowing what cards are on the table you can start to make a plan,\" she said.\n\nMore:Twitter poll: College costs are chief source of worry for parents\n\nMore:Millennials spend huge amounts on rent, using up 45% of income made by age 30\n\nMore:You could recoup cost of college in under 3 years if you're willing to do one thing\n\nWhat is a 529?\n\nExperts agree that 529 plans, tax-advantaged investment funds that can be used for education costs, are the best way for you to save for your child's college years.\n\nThe plans are state-run, but you don't have to open one in the state in which you live.\n\nWhen should you start saving with one?\n\n\"The sooner they start saving, the more the earnings can compound,\" said Mark Kantrowitz, a student loan expert.\n\nIf you start saving at your child's birth, about a third of the college savings goal will come from earnings, Kantrowitz said.\n\n\"If you wait until the child enters high school, less than 10 percent will come from earnings and you will have to save six times as much per month to reach the same goal,\" he said.\n\nDespite the benefits of 529 plans, just 29 percent of parents use one to save for college, compared with 45 percent who keep their savings in a general bank account, according to Sallie Mae's 2018 report, How America Saves for College.\n\nHow to pick one\n\nYour first step in deciding on a 529 plan should be to learn if your state offers a full or partial state income tax deduction for your contribution, said Kim Lankford, contributing editor at Kiplinger's Personal Finance, who writes about the plans.\n\nMore than half of states, plus the District of Columbia, offer such a deduction, she said — and that perk often (but not always) makes it smart to stick with your home state's plan.\n\n(Seven states allow you to claim a tax benefit even if you don't contribute to your own state's plan, according to SavingforCollege.com: Arizona, Arkansas, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana and Pennsylvania.)\n\nBeyond taxes, you can compare plans by their investment options and fees. \"Look at what funds they're invested in and if there are some you're familiar with and like already,\" Lankford said.\n\nMany funds offer age-based plans, meaning the investments become less aggressive as your child's first day at college nears. As time goes on, keep tabs on your account to make sure it's being managed in a way you're comfortable with.\n\nYou can get a breakdown of 529 plans at SavingForCollege.com.\n\n© CNBC is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

The last time the world No. 1 lost at the Open was in the 2011 final against Sam Stosur.\n\nShe ended the match with her usual twirl, wave and wag of her index finger, signaling “No.1” to the crowd, but the match, aside from the end result, was everything but ordinary for New York’s three-time defending champion.\n\nSerena Williams survives a major Grand Slam scare, yet again\n\n“I’m not trying to live on the edge,” said Williams, hoarse from crying out and shouting during the match. “I’m playing players that come out really strong. I don’t think I came out too slow, I just think Bethanie played really well, I had to do things and adapt to her game. I was finally able to get some rhythm going toward the end of the second.\n\n“I said, ‘you know what, Serena, keep going, here’s another one, keep going. Keep trying, keep trying, keep trying, and keep trying.' \"\n\nFor the better part of two sets, it looked as though a player ranked outside of the top 100 was going to be the one who snatched away Williams' shot at history.\n\nNo. 101 Mattek-Sands, an outgoing veteran player noted on tour for her fight on court, tattoos and colorful hair– bright orange the night she nearly beat Williams – nearly pulled off the upset of the year.\n\nRafael Nadal falls to Fabio Fognini at U.S. Open\n\nMattek-Sands, who underwent her second hip surgery last year, was beating Williams from the start with a fierce return and confidence at net. She broke the world No. 1 to get a 3-0 jump and broke her again to go up 4-2 after Williams got back on serve.\n\n“I was really happy with how many times I broke her today,” Mattek-Sands said. “I know she serves big. I was ready for it. I like to think that returning is one of my favorite shots. I was really happy with how I did that.”\n\nThe first set saw few long rallies and plenty of serve and volleys from Mattek-Sands, tapping into the part of her game that helped her win three doubles championships this year.\n\nWhen she was up 5-2 it looked as though Williams was finding her game and posing a comeback as she had in a smattering of tense matches this year — she boasts a 17-1 record in three-set matches in 2015. She committed 34 unforced errors and let 15 break points slip by but slammed 53 winners and ended the match winning nearly 80% of points off her first serve.\n\nPlayers share memories of beloved Grandstand before its demise\n\n“I think getting out of (being a set down) so many times definitely helps me,” Williams said. “It's definitely not something I want to do, though. But hey, a win’s a win, I guess.”\n\nNext Williams meets American power-hitter No. 19 Madison Keys in the Round of 16. Should both Serena and Venus win their fourth-round matches — Venus also won Friday in a straight-sets rout of Belinda Bencic — the sisters will meet in the quarterfinals.\n\nBoth Mattek-Sands and Keys are dangerous gun-slingers with no reason to hold back against Williams, something that helped the former get Williams out on a wire.\n\n“Madison will probably go into that match with nothing to lose. She's a big power player,” Mattek-Sands said. “I think it will be a really good match.”\n\nNo. 13 Ekaterina Makarova won her third-round match in straight sets, making her the highest-seeded player left in Williams’ half of the draw. In the other half, No. 2 seed Simona Halep and No. 5 seed Petra Kvitova play Saturday.\n\nGALLERY: BEST OF THE U.S. OPEN", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/09/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/2022/08/29/with-serena-on-at-night-us-open-begins-us-open-updates/50654691/", "title": "Children of Austin, Mandlikova win matches | US Open updates", "text": "AP\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — The Latest on the U.S. Open tennis tournament (all times local):\n\n12:10 a.m.\n\nThe children of past champions Tracy Austin and Hana Mandlikova are making their own U.S. Open memories.\n\nBrandon Holt, Austin’s son, knocked off No. 10-seeded Taylor Fritz in four sets after advancing through the qualifying tournament into his first Grand Slam main draw.\n\nHolt says he couldn’t remember what advice Austin, the 1979 and 1981 U.S. Open women’s champion, gave him before the match, but that it was probably to have fun and enjoy it.\n\nAustin also owned a victory over Kathy May, Fritz’s mother, from a tournament in Philadelphia in 1978.\n\nMandlikova’s daughter, Elizabeth Mandlik, received a wild card into the tournament and edged Tamara Zidansek 5-7, 7-6 (3), 6-4.\n\nMandlikova won the 1985 U.S. Open for one of her four Grand Slam singles titles.\n\n___\n\n11:30 p.m.\n\nDanka Kovinic heard the roars of the crowd early in her match against Serena Williams and one thing quickly came to mind.\n\nKovinic said to herself: “OK, if they’re going to be this loud the whole match, it's going to be tough.”\n\nWilliams beat her 6-3, 6-3, but Kovinic felt she played better than the score.

He was able to compete during the previous two U.S. Opens held during the pandemic, but the current vaccine requirement began last Nov. 8.\n\nMembers of Families are Essential and Children’s Health Defense & Teachers for Choice were among the demonstrators, standing behind signs that read “End The Travel Mandate Now!”\n\n___\n\n11:15 a.m.\n\nWith Serena Williams on the schedule at night, the U.S. Open has begun with far more buzz than usual for Day 1.\n\nPlay has started at the final Grand Slam of the year, with defending champion Daniil Medvedev among the players who will be in early action Monday.\n\nMedvedev, who won his first Grand Slam title last year in Flushing Meadows, plays the lead match in Arthur Ashe Stadium against American Stefan Kozlov at noon.\n\nPast U.S. Open champion Andy Murray is facing No. 24 seed Francisco Cerundolo of Argentina in one of the matches that has begun.\n\nWilliams will begin the night session in Ashe for the start of what could be the final tournament of her career.

The two meeting for the very first time.\n\nU.S. Open to test shot clock, but tennis is split on issue\n\nHow it happened: Keys won the first set 7-5 in what was one of the most power-laden matchups in women’s tennis against Osaka, a highly-touted 19-year-old who plays for Japan but grew up in New York and Florida.\n\nOsaka would break for 5-4 in the second and then be gifted two Keys return errors to close out the second set, 6-4. In the third Keys’ unforced errors piled up with Osaka racing to a 5-1 lead and having chances to serve out the match at 5-2 and 5-4.\n\nBut a Keys volley on the first point of the 5-2 game was perhaps the shot of the match, and the 21-year-old American would break, hold and break again, shrugging off a 30-all point at 5-4 (when Osaka was two points from the win). Osaka forced a tiebreak by holding in the 12th game, but Keys was the player with the momentum in the tiebreak, closing out the match off Osaka’s 35th unforced error of the day.\n\nKey stats: The baseline-bashing affair saw 52 winners, 37 of them coming from Keys, who also committed 41 unforced errors. Keys won 80% of points on her first serve and went 13 for 14 on net points played, including that down-the-line forehand stab volley winner to open game eight of the final set.\n\nAt stake: A shot in the quarterfinals, where Keys has never been before in New York. Wozniacki last made the quarters at any major two years ago here, when she made her surprise run to the final before losing to Serena Williams. Johanna Konta, the No. 13 seed, is the highest remaining seed in that quarter otherwise, the bottom half of the draw being anchored by world No. 2 Angelique Kerber.\n\nWhat she said: “I just knew that if I stayed in the match that I could maybe have a chance to come back and get back in it,” Keys told reporters. “The crowd today was amazing, and getting to play at your home slam on Ashe is a feeling like you can't even describe.”\n\nThe Keys-Wozniacki match is a likely Ashe candidate for the holiday weekend Sunday — day or evening session. “I think the crowd will be more divided seeing as she's a finalist,\" Key said, \"but I think I will have plenty of support.”\n\nFor the second time in three matches, Keys was two points from defeat having nearly gone out to fellow American Alison Riske in the first round. That match finished at 1:48 a.m. ET Tuesday morning, the latest-ever finish for a women's match at the U.S. Open.\n\n\"I think the biggest thing is just, you know, I'm never giving up and I'm fighting to the very end,\" Keys said of the comeback. \"That's something to pat myself on the back for. But also definitely going to sit down later and work on some things for the next round because I don't want to be two points from losing again.\"\n\nPHOTOS: Best of the U.S. Open early rounds", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/09/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/2021/09/03/the-latest-osaka-mens-contenders-on-us-open-schedule/48814539/", "title": "The Latest: Tiafoe beats No. 5-seed Rublev in late Open", "text": "AP\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — The Latest on the U.S. Open tennis tournament (all times local):\n\n___\n\n2:20 a.m am\n\nAmerican tennis player Frances Tiafoe had a small, late-night crowd at Arthur Ashe Stadium going wild on every point in an upset win that pushed the record for the latest finish in tournament history.\n\nTiafoe outlasted fifth-seeded Andrey Rublev 4-6, 6-3, 7-6 (6), 4-6, 6-1 and reached the fourth round for the second straight year. Tiafoe, Rublev and a few hundred fans were left on the grounds by the time the match ended at 2:14 a.m\n\nThere were three U.S. Open finishes at 2:26 a.m., in 1993, 2012 and 2014.\n\nTiafoe had experienced five-set heartbreak before at Flushing Meadows. He lost to John Isner in 2016, Roger Federer in 2017 and Alexander Zverev in 2019 in five. Not this time. The 23-year-old fan favorite stripped off his shirt and celebrated with fans, before he sat on the bench and shook his head at his accomplishment.\n\nTiafoe won the five-setter in 3 hours, 45 minutes.

Fernandez pulled off the 5-7, 7-6 (2), 6-4 victory.\n\nOsaka said after the loss she was thinking about taking another break from tennis “for a while.”\n\nFernandez says Osaka, is a “great example for anybody that’s on tour and all the little girls in the world.”\n\nBy the end of the match, the crowd was booing Osaka for turning her back to the court and taking too much time between points. The fans went wild for Fernandez and only got louder with each point won deeper into the match. Fernandez smiled and flashed two thumbs up in celebration.\n\nShe says he was glad she “put on a show for everyone that came to watch.”\n\nHours after the win, Fernandez bounded into came into the media center, laughing and relaxed with her hands in her pockets.\n\nBut she could use some rest.\n\nFernandez joked, “I’m way past my bedtime at the moment.”\n\n___\n\n10:05 p.m.\n\nDefending champion Naomi Osaka repeatedly smashed her racket to the court, smacked a ball into the crowd, hid under a towel and imploded over the final two sets in a third-round loss at the U.S Open.\n\nEighteen-year-old Canadian Leylah Fernandez had the fans on her side as she pressured the third-seeded Osaka and pulled off the 5-7, 7-6 (2), 6-4 victory at Arthur Ashe Stadium.\n\nOsaka threw her racket at least three times and was finally hit with a code violation in the third set when she hit the ball into the stands. She even draped a towel over her head as she took a break following her second-set loss.\n\nOsaka played her first Grand Slam since she pulled out of the French Open in late May for a mental health break.\n\nFernandez used her left-handed serve to defeated two-time US Open quarterfinalist Kaia Kanepi in straight sets before knocking off Osaka. She waved her arms and pumped her fist toward fans that cheered louder for her on every late point.\n\nOsaka glumly walked to the locker room while Fernandez smiled and flashed two thumbs up in celebration.\n\n___\n\n9:30 p.m.\n\nDefending champion Naomi Osaka has lost a set at the U.S. Open for the first time this year.\n\nOsaka slammed her racket to the court multiple times in frustration during her second-set loss to 18-year-old Canadian Leylah Fernandez. Osaka took the first set 7-5. Fernandez won the next 7-6 (2).\n\nOsaka draped a towel over her head as she took a break after the second set loss.\n\nThey'll head to a third set to decide who advances to the fourth round.\n\nOsaka is in her first Grand Slam since she pulled out of the French Open in late May for a mental health break.\n\n___\n\n8:15 p.m.\n\nThere are two male qualifiers in the U.S. Open's fourth round for the first time in 21 years — and they could be joined by a third.\n\nPeter Gojowczyk, a German ranked 141st, and Botic van de Zandschulp, a Dutchman ranked 117th, both picked up their third main-draw victory this week at Flushing Meadows on Friday to go along with a trio of wins in qualifying rounds last week.\n\nGojowczyk beat Henri Laaksonen, yet another qualifier, 3-6, 6-3, 6-1, 6-4. Gojowczyk's next opponent is 18-year-old Carlos Alcaraz, who eliminated No. 3 seed Stefanos Tsitsipas on Friday.\n\nFor van de Zandschulp, his 3-6, 6-0, 6-2, 6-2 win against Facundo Bagnis set up a matchup against No. 11 seed Diego Schwartzman for a berth in the quarterfinals.\n\nOscar Otte can make it three qualifiers into Week 2 by beating Andreas Seppi on Saturday.\n\nThe last time there were two qualifiers into the fourth round in New York was 2000, when Wayne Arthurs and Lee Hyung-taik did it.\n\n___\n\n7:50 p.m.\n\nStefanos Tsitsipas can take all the time he wants in the bathroom now that he's out of the U.S. Open.\n\nTsitsipas was booed by fans and criticized throughout the U.S. Open for his lengthy breaks in the bathroom. Tsitsipas pointed out that he’s doing nothing that violates any regulation.\n\nHe took a 4 1/2-minute break after he dropped the third set to Carlos Alcaraz. Alcaraz won 6-3, 4-6, 7-6 (2), 0-6, 7-6 (5) in just over four hours.\n\nTsitsipas said after the loss, \"I took my toilet break as a normal athlete. He said he only changed clothes during his break and lashed out at accusations he was doing more than that, like reading texts or receiving coaching advice in the bathroom.\n\nTsitsipas said he feels refreshed after he heads off the court to change his clothing.\n\nHe said, “ all of these things have been against me for no reason.”\n\n___\n\n7:10 p.m.\n\nWith the Arthur Ashe Stadium crowd chanting his name, 18-year-old Carlos Alcaraz upset third-seeded Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-3, 4-6, 7-6 (2), 0-6, 7-6 (5) at the U.S. Open.\n\nAlcaraz, the teenager from Spain, used powerful groundstrokes in an entertaining match to knock off Tsitsipas. Tsitsipas can take all the long bathroom breaks he wants from home. The controversial Greek tennis player faced an unfriendly crowd again in large part because of his lengthy breaks in the bathroom.\n\nAlcaraz easily pulled off the biggest win of his career and is in the fourth round at Flushing Meadows for the first time in his career. He was down 5-2 in the third set but kept pushing in a match that stretched past four hours.\n\nAlcaraz thanked the crowd, absent last year because of the pandemic, for “pushing me up in the fifth set.” He became the breakout start of the U.S. Open and had fans chanting “Carlos! Carlos!” with each big winner.\n\n__\n\n6:15 p.m.\n\nAngelique Kerber won a matchup of previous U.S Open champions when she beat Sloane Stephens 5-7, 6-2, 6-3 at the U.S. Open.\n\nThe reward for the 16th-seeded Kerber? A potential date with No. 3 seed and defending champion Naomi Osaka.\n\nKerber, the 2016 champion, was ruthless in the third set to knock out 2017 champion Stephens.\n\nKerber beat Stephens for only the second time in seven career matchups.

I'm just trying to play my way into this tournament.\"\n\nEarlier in the afternoon, sister Venus Williams was ousted from the tournament in a dramatic three-set loss to Karolina Pliskova, 4-6, 6-4, 7-6(3), meaning the Williams sisters will not meet in the semifinals later this week.\n\nVenus Williams loses to Karolina Pliskova in fourth round\n\nSerena, however, would like to get to 311 Slam wins this U.S. Open: That would mean she would win the tournament, earning her a record 23rd major (and break her tie with Steffi Graf at 22) as well as maintain her No. 1 ranking, which is in jeopardy over the next few days.\n\n“This is where it all started, so it’s always magical for me,” Williams said on court. “But 308 sounds pretty good.”\n\nWilliams is still yet to drop serve in this tournament and has lost just 20 games in four matches played. She’s only faced one break point in those four matches, and Monday served 11 aces en route to victory.\n\n“I’ve never served this consistently,” she said on court. “I’m not going to ask questions. I’m going to just keep serving.”\n\nWilliams has a 7-1 head-to-head lead on Halep, who won the summer event in Montreal last month. They were set to meet in last year’s U.S. Open final before both getting upset in respective semifinals.\n\nWilliams hit an astounding 28 winners in Monday’s 68-minute match. She appeared calm and focused out of the gates, the Arthur Ashe Stadium crowd still buzzing from Venus’ three-set defeat at the hands of Pliskova.\n\nShvedova, a Grand Slam champion in doubles, looked steady in the opening games of the second set after losing the first, but whiffed a ball at 2-3 30-15 and then never recovered. She wouldn’t win another game.\n\nAt home in New York, Caroline Wozniacki has found her form\n\nSerena won 28 of 30 first serve points, or 93 percent. She closed out the match on a service winner.\n\nWilliams and Halep will meet on Wednesday, while Pliskova, in her first major quarterfinal, awaits either No. 4 seed Agnieszka Radwanska or Ana Konjuh, a 19-year-old up and comer.\n\n\"I just think with everyone I play, they play a step up and above their ranking,\" she said. \"I think that's the beauty, one of the reasons I'm able to hang. Everyone I'm playing is playing like they're No. 1. To me it doesn't really matter who I play because I have to expect they're going to play the match of their life. That's how I go into these matches now.\"\n\nWilliams is also looking to break her tie with Chris Evert for six U.S. Open titles won. Should Serena be unable to make the final, however, No. 2 seed Angelique Kerber, the Australian Open champion, will take over the No. 1 ranking. Radwanska also has a shot at No. 1, as well, though the Pole must win the title outright.\n\nWilliams is almost the complete opposite in demeanor on court in Flushing Meadows versus 2015, when she came in trying to complete the calendar Grand Slam, having won the Australian and French Opens as well as Wimbledon. Graf was the last player to have done so, back in 1988.\n\nShe would be stunned in the semifinals by Roberta Vinci, however, and not play for the rest of the year. After losses in the Australian and French Open finals this year, Williams won her long-awaited 22nd Grand Slam trophy in Wimbledon before losing in the third round of the Olympics last month.\n\nShe pulled out of a big event in Cincinnati three weeks ago with a bad shoulder, but has said the injury has felt better and better throughout this U.S. Open campaign.\n\nWilliams, 34, moves to 88-10 at the U.S. Open.\n\nBest of the early rounds from the U.S. Open", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/2014/04/04/top-seeds-jankovic-errani-upset-at-family-circle/7314157/", "title": "Top seeds Jankovic, Errani upset at Family Circle", "text": "AP\n\nCHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) — It proved tough to be a top seed at the Family Circle Cup this week.\n\nNo. 2 seed Jelena Jankovic and No. 3 seed Sara Errani were both upset Friday in the quarterfinals, leaving sixth-seeded Eugenie Bouchard as the lone top-10 seed left in the semifinals.\n\nJankovic fell to Bouchard 6-3, 4-6, 6-3 to start the round of eight before 17-year-old qualifier Belinda Bencic pulled off an even bigger shocker by eliminating Errani, a runner-up at the French Open in 2012.\n\nBencic, who had to win twice last weekend simply to make the field, took over in the final two sets for a 4-6, 6-2, 6-1 victory over the 26-year-old Italian. Bencic hadn't made it past the second round in two previous WTA events this year and wasn't expecting to advance to her first tour semifinals\n\n\"I was hoping for it and I was believing in me that it would come,\" she said. \"Yeah, I'm just really happy it came this week.\"\n\nBencic is the first qualifier to advance this far at the Family Circle, an event where at least one of the top four seeds has reached the semifinals the previous 10 years. On Saturday, she'll face unseeded Slovakian Jana Cepelova, who pulled off a final surprise when she easily beat 12th-seeded countrywoman Daniela Hantuchova 6-2, 6-1.\n\nCepelova had defeated world No. 1 and two-time defending Family Circle champion Serena Williams on Tuesday night to start off a week of upsets.\n\nEither Bencic or Cepelova will be the first unseeded player in the finals since 2011 when Elena Vesnina lost the championship to Caroline Wozniacki.\n\nErrani looked confident and in control in the first set before getting overwhelmed by Bencic, who won 12 of the final 15 games. Errani talked to herself and even threw down her racket as Bencic's crisp shots clipped lines and moved out of reach.\n\nEarlier, Bouchard rallied in the third set by winning five of the last six games to oust Jankovic, a past champion who came in ranked eighth in the world.\n\nThe 20-year-old Canadian reached the semifinals at a WTA tour event for the second time this season and fifth in her career.\n\nOn Saturday, she plays 14th-seeded Andrea Petkovic as she seeks her first title — something Bouchard thinks she's more than ready for.\n\n\"Every time I go into a tournament now and every match, I always believe I can win,\" she said.\n\nEven when she falls behind, as happened in her past two matches. Bouchard trailed in the third set against Venus Williams on Thursday and Jankovic this time before rallying to victories.\n\n\"I feel confidence in myself,\" she said.\n\nPetkovic topped ninth-seeded Lucie Safarova 6-3, 1-6, 6-1. The 26-year-old German, ranked 40th in the world, had struggled in recent events.\n\nSo Petkovic was pleased to shake off Safarova in the final set and advance to weekend play.\n\n\"I'm used to winning at least two, three matches and then losing to the top players, but it was a really tough few weeks for me in the past,\" she said. \"So now I'm just really, really happy and kind of relieved.\"\n\nCepelova said the win over Serena Williams gave her a boost of energy she's carried throughout the work. \"Playing against Serena I really learned so much and every match gave me more confidence,\" she said.\n\nBouchard made it to the Australian Open semifinals this year, losing to eventual champion Li Na. In her only WTA final, she lost to Sam Stosur in Osaka in October.\n\nBouchard trailed 2-1 in the final set. She then dug in to win the next three games and take control. Her steady, strong groundstrokes wore down Jankovic.\n\n\"It was the third set and your concentration goes down a little bit if you're getting tired,\" Jankovic said. \"It was so close. It could have went either way, if I was a little bit tougher out there and played certain points a little smarter.\"\n\nThe two also met in the quarterfinals last year, and Jankovic won 6-2, 6-1. Bouchard was ranked No. 114 then, but she's 20th now.\n\n\"Well, I didn't want it to be Groundhog Day today, for sure,\" Bouchard said. \"Same tournament, same round, same opponent.\"\n\nNot the same result.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/04/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/2019/08/22/first-round-fireworks-serena-sharapova-to-meet-at-us-open/39996657/", "title": "First-round fireworks: Serena, Sharapova to meet at US Open", "text": "AP\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova will finally meet in the U.S. Open, and they'll do it in their very first match.\n\nA long-awaited Roger Federer-Rafael Nadal showdown could come only in the final.\n\nWilliams and Sharapova, past U.S. Open champions and two of the biggest stars in women's tennis, were scheduled for an opening-round matchup when the draws were conducted Thursday for the final major of the year.\n\nWilliams and Sharapova have met in the finals of the other three majors and the 2012 Olympics but have never played each other in the U.S. Open. Williams owns a 19-2 record in their WTA Tour matchups and has won 18 in a row, but that lopsided number shouldn't do much to dampen the hype around what will be the marquee match of the opening round at Flushing Meadows, which starts Monday.\n\nWilliams will begin another bid for a record-tying 24th Grand Slam singles title. Sharapova isn't the same player she was when she won the 2006 U.S. Open championship — or beat Williams two years earlier in the final at Wimbledon — but remains one of the most popular players among fans in New York.\n\nShe was given a wild card into the tournament two years ago shortly after returning from a doping suspension and promptly scheduled for a match on Arthur Ashe Stadium, where she upset No. 2 seed Simona Halep. U.S. Open officials kept putting Sharapova on the main court in her next couple of matches, drawing complaints from some players who felt an unseeded player wasn't worthy of such a prime position.\n\nThat shouldn't be a problem this time, as a Williams-Sharapova matchup is too big for anywhere other than Ashe.\n\nThey haven't played since the 2016 Australian Open. They were scheduled to meet last year in the fourth round at the French Open in what was Williams' first major tournament after returning to tennis following the birth of her daughter, but she pulled out of the match with a pectoral muscle injury.\n\nThe men's draw sent No. 3 seed Federer into the top half, meaning he could play top-ranked Novak Djokovic in the semifinals. They met in a classic final at Wimbledon, where Djokovic won in a fifth-set tiebreaker.\n\nFederer and No. 2 seed Rafael Nadal have never played each other in New York and could do so this year only if both make the final.\n\nDjokovic might have to beat both to repeat as U.S. Open champion — and could face a tough obstacle just to get there with a potential quarterfinal against No. 5 seed Daniil Medvedev. Medvedev upset Djokovic in the semifinals of the Western & Southern Open en route to the title in what was his third straight week reaching a final.\n\nUnlike some players, Djokovic said he does look at his draw beyond the next match to see his potential path.

Kvitova sprayed a backhand long on the next point to lose it.\n\nThose problems continued in the second set, and in an epic 27-stroke rally on match point, Krunic looped several towering shots before Kvitova sailed yet another forehand out to end it.\n\n\"She played really unbelievable tennis and she put a lot of balls back ... almost all of them,\" said Kvitova, a two-time Wimbledon champion who has never advanced past the fourth round at the U.S. Open. \"I was trying to fight and fighting every point, but it was so difficult. It wasn't really my day.\"\n\nKrunic faces the winner of the match between 16th-seeded Victoria Azarenka and Elena Vesnina.\n\nThere was no upset for 11th-seeded Flavia Pennetta, who downed American wild-card Nicole Gibbs, 6-4, 6-0.\n\nThe men's side, meanwhile, remained largely true to form. None of the top 10 and only two of the top 20 seeded men had lost entering Saturday. Tenth-seeded Kei Nishikori continued that trend, advancing in straight sets against No. 23 Leonardo Mayer.\n\nFifth-seeded Milos Raonic, a 7-6 (5), 7-6 (5), 7-6 (3) winner over Victor Estrella Burgos, who at 34 was the oldest man left in the draw.\n\nIn other key matches Saturday, top-seeded Novak Djokovic faced American Sam Querrey, and fellow American John Isner, seeded 13th, sought to defeat No. 22 Philipp Kohlschreiber, the man who has beaten him in the third round the last two years.\n\nFor the third time in three matches at this year's U.S. Open, Williams faced an American, 52nd-ranked Varvara Lepchenko.\n\nWilliams has won 16 matches in a row at Flushing Meadows.

She also has reached the semifinals at the other two major tournaments. That includes at the French Open in 2017.\n\nJeanjean is a 26-year-old from Montpellier.

And No. 5 Petra Kvitova lost later, meaning only three of the top 13 women's seeds remain in the field. And it's still just Week 1 in Flushing Meadows.\n\nIt's similar to the way things went at the last major tournament: For the first time in Wimbledon history, none of the top five women's seeds reached the round of 16. And only one of the top 10 made it to the second week there.\n\nOn Saturday in New York, No. 29 seed Dominika Cibulkova rallied Saturday to beat the fourth-seeded Kerber 3-6, 6-3, 6-3. No. 26 Aryna Sabalenka beat Kvitova 7-5, 6-1 at night.\n\n\"I was not able actually to play my best tennis in the important moment,\" Kerber said.\n\nJoin the club.\n\nTop-ranked Simona Halep, the French Open champion, was eliminated in the first round. Australian Open champion Caroline Wozniacki, the No. 2 seed, fell in the second.\n\nOnly No. 3 seed and defending champion Sloane Stephens remains among the top six women.\n\nOn Saturday alone, No. 6 Caroline Garcia, No. 10 Jelena Ostapenko and No. 13 Kiki Bertens were eliminated, too.\n\nThe early stunners seem to clear the field for No. 17 seed — oh, and six-time champion — Serena Williams to move in on another title.\n\n\"I think she's playing really good tennis,\" Keys said.\n\nMaybe the losses are a case — or curse — of the Louis Armstrong blues.\n\nHalep, Wozniacki, Kerber and Kvitova were all beaten at the new Louis Armstrong Stadium. Two-time major champion Garbine Muguruza lost there, too, in the second round.\n\nThe 14th-seeded Keys has stuck around in a field smacked with upsets.\n\nKeys whiffed on an overhead, fought a case of first-set jitters and never found a groove with her backhand. She rallied after dropping the first set and the U.S. Open finalist from a year ago beat Aleksandra Krunic 4-6, 6-1, 6-2 at Arthur Ashe Stadium on Saturday.\n\nKeys plays Cibulkova in the quarters.\n\n\"I think she's super feisty,\" Keys said.\n\nKeys lost to Stephens in the final last year and lost to her again this year in the French Open semis. But Keys has been plagued with various injuries (right wrist and ribs, notably) most of the season and slipped out of the top 10 in the rankings.\n\nKrunic beat Keys four years ago at Ashe and the Serb seemed poised to do it again when she took the first set. Keys rebounded to win 12 of the last 15 games and thanked the pro-American fans for pulling her through into the round of 16.\n\n\"The biggest confidence boost for me has been being able to get myself back into those matches and knowing that in a situation like today, if I make some adjustments and stay calm, then I can usually figure things out,\" Keys said.\n\nKeys' parents are both attorneys and she picked up some jargon — from a different kind of court — when she explained how she fanned on an overhead.\n\n\"In my defense,\" she said, laughing, \"the sun was right there. The ball went right there and I couldn't see it. You know, it happens. At least it doesn't happen to everyone else on national television.\"\n\nShe pleaded the fifth when asked how having the top seeds out of the tourney affects her and potentially makes for an easier road back to the final. Like everyone else who watched, she couldn't ignore, though, the dominance by Williams over sister Venus Williams on Friday night. Serena equaled her most-lopsided victory against her sister with a 6-1, 6-2 rout.\n\n\"I think she played really well. You obviously have to play well to beat Venus,\" Keys said.\n\nThe 23-year-old Keys joined Stephens, Venus Williams and CoCo Vandeweghe for an all-American semifinals at last year's Open. Keys' run to the French Open semifinals showed an overall development of her game. Her big-hitting style makes her more of a natural fit on hard courts and there's no reason she couldn't have another long stay in New York.\n\n\"Coming into here, I was, like, 'Oh, last time I was in here, I lost.' That's fun,\" Key said, smiling. \"It's fine. I'm not torn up about it.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP tennis coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/09/01"}]}

Eminem and Snoop Dogg, ‘From the D 2 the LBC’\n\nTwo rap icons, taking the VMAs stage together for their first collaboration in two decades. It should’ve been an instant highlight of this year’s show – but instead, Eminem and Snoop’s “From the D 2 the LBC” got lost in the metaverse. The hip-hop stars used Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs for the song's music video and took the sidelines for the bulk of Sunday’s “performance” as their cartoon avatars rapped inside an oversized pinball machine and spider web, among other computer-generated locales. It was only toward the end of the song that it finally came alive, as Eminem and Snoop “woke up” on a couch onstage and finished the track in person. Props for trying something different, but maybe keep your NFT away from our MTV next time.\n\nTaylor Swift announces new album 'Midnights':'A journey through terrors and sweet dreams'\n\n12. Kane Brown, 'Grand'\n\nOn Sunday, Brown became the first male country singer ever to perform at the VMAs. Bathed in green and blue neon lights on an outdoor stage, the 28-year-old crossover artist made every moment count as he sang a sprightly rendition of “Grand,” his pop-leaning anthem about appreciating the big and small things in life.\n\n11. Marshmello and Khalid, ‘Numb’\n\nKhalid’s silky vocals were characteristically flawless, as he and electronic artist Marshmello took the stage to perform the upbeat team-up “Numb,” their second collaboration after 2017’s “Silence.” If only we could’ve actually seen what was going on: Because of a psychedelic camera filter, much of the performance was extremely blurred and out of focus, with multiple viewers complaining on Twitter that it made them dizzy.\n\nThe most outrageous MTV VMA moments ever:From Britney Spears' snake to Lady Gaga's meat dress\n\n10. Blackpink, ‘Pink Venom’\n\nThe K-pop quartet made their VMAs debut in sensational style, appearing from a cloud of pink smoke to perform their latest single “Pink Venom.” Dressed in all black and flanked by backup dancers, the girl group deftly executed tight choreography that was as punchy and sultry as the song’s lyrics.\n\n9. J Balvin and Ryan Castro, ‘Nivel de Perreo’\n\nThe Colombian superstars took over the telecast early in the night for a raunchy rendition of their collaboration “Nivel de Perreo,” backed by a line of faceless, latex-clad dancers straight out of “American Horror Story.” But the real scene-stealer was a hologram of a giant, silvery woman in a bikini, bringing some “Jack and the Beanstalk” realness to the VMAs as she twerked and towered over the crowd for the song’s entire three minutes.\n\n8. Bad Bunny, ‘Tití Me Preguntó’\n\nBad Bunny, who played a pair of headlining shows at New York’s Yankee Stadium this weekend, delivered a dynamic remote performance of “Tití Me Preguntó,” from his chart-dominating fifth album “Un Verano Sin Ti.” The sunglass-clad reggaeton superstar had no trouble captivating the enormous stadium audience, making the VMAs feel like his own personal concert as he set Twitter ablaze by kissing male and female dancers.\n\n7. Lizzo, ‘About Damn Time' and '2 Be Loved (Am I Ready)’\n\nAfter singing a few bars of her infectious No. 1 hit “About Damn Time,” Lizzo channeled Tom Hanks circa 1988’s “Big”: playing a light-up floor piano with her feet as she launched into her high-energy new single “2 Be Loved (Am I Ready).” Performing upstage and away from the audience, she sometimes got lost among the eye-popping projections. Still, it was hard not to get swept up in the genre-smashing artist’s enthusiasm, particularly as she danced in a bubblegum pink ensemble against a backdrop of dozens of miniature Lizzos.\n\n6. Panic! At the Disco, 'Don’t Let the Light Go Out'\n\nBrendon Urie’s unmistakable voice was on display in “Don’t Let the Light Go Out,” as the frontman crooned directly to the camera before jamming with his band on the hood of a car. Pyrotechnics lit up the backdrop as the performance went from black and white to color, delivering a genuinely thrilling climax to this year’s ceremony.\n\n5. Måneskin, ‘Supermodel’\n\nIf you didn't know Måneskin before the VMAs, you probably do now. The glam rock up-and-comers took the stage for a fiery performance of “Supermodel,” with lead singer Damiano David flashing his bare bum to the audience while rocking leather chaps. But midway through the exhilarating track, the camera abruptly cut away to rows of empty seats. It was later revealed that bassist Victoria De Angelis had suffered a wardrobe malfunction when her top fell down and exposed her breasts. The camera eventually returned to Måneskin for a sweaty (and safely covered) finish, making \"Supermodel\" a performance we won't soon forget.\n\n4. Anitta, ‘Envolver’\n\nAnitta, who won the best Latin award for the viral hit “Envolver,” is quickly proving why she’s one of the fastest-rising stars in the U.S. right now. Descending a white set of stairs in a red bodysuit, the Brazilian singer oozed personality as she led her dancers in some genuinely steamy, and then joyous, choreography.\n\n3. Red Hot Chili Peppers, ‘Black Summer’ and ‘Can’t Stop’\n\nSometimes, all you need are instruments and a stage. Red Hot Chili Peppers forewent any bells and whistles for their VMAs performance, putting their fierce musicianship front and center as they blazed their way through the new song “Black Summer” and set-list staple “Can’t Stop.” The veteran rockers, who took home the Global Icon Award, were the epitome of cool in red fishnet shirts and high yellow socks, with pink-haired bassist Flea earning screams as he cheekily gyrated during the electrifying intro of “Can’t Stop.”\n\n2. Nicki Minaj, Video Vanguard Award medley ('Super Freaky Girl,' 'Anaconda' and more)\n\nAnd that’s why she’s called the queen of rap. As this year’s recipient of the Video Vanguard Award, which honors an artist’s impact on music videos and pop culture, Minaj blew through nearly a dozen of her most recognizable songs in a bedazzled pink getup, complete with a giant bow. After a too-rushed beginning that didn’t give her career-making “Monster” verse its proper due, the rapper settled into a groove with crowd favorites “Moment 4 Life” and “Super Bass” as she twerked and strutted across the Barbie Dreamhouse-inspired stage. She ended the medley with a fun and frisky take on her Rick James-sampling “Super Freaky Girl,” a deserved song of summer if we’ve ever heard one.\n\n1. Jack Harlow and Fergie, ‘First Class’ and 'Glamorous'\n\nFresh off his breakout success last summer with Lil Nas X’s “Industry Baby,” Harlow delivered an instant classic VMAs performance. Dressed as a flight attendant, the suave rapper walked down the aisle of an airplane as he performed his chart-topper “First Class,” playfully interacting with “passengers” including Avril Lavigne along the way. He then made his way to the Prudential Center stage, revealing surprise guest Fergie, whose 2007 hit “Glamorous” is heavily sampled in the track. The screaming crowd – which included multiple cutaways to Taylor Swift – was gleefully riding the nostalgia high, with Fergie and Harlow their effortlessly charismatic captains.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/26/entertainment/mtv-vma-nominations-2022/index.html", "title": "2022 MTV VMAs: See who's nominated | CNN", "text": "(CNN) MTV has revealed its nominations for the 2022 Video Music Awards.\n\nFans can take part and vote for their favorite stars across 22 gender-neutral categories, including video of the year, artist of the year, best collaboration and two all-new categories: best longform video and best metaverse performance.\n\nThe 2022 VMAs will air live from New Jersey's Prudential Center on Sunday, August 28 at 8 p.m. ET/PT.\n\nSee below for a full list of the nominees.\n\nRead More", "authors": ["Chloe Melas"], "publish_date": "2022/07/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2020/08/30/mtv-vmas-2020-lady-gagas-wild-outfits-were-another-world/5676975002/", "title": "Lady Gaga wins 2020 MTV VMAs with a space helmet, horns, every ...", "text": "Lady Gaga has always ruled the MTV Video Music Awards, going back to 2010 when she wore a dress made out of raw meat.\n\nBut her outfit performance in pandemic 2020 was something special.\n\nGaga was the night's most out-there winner even when she wasn't taking home five awards, including artist of the year and best song and best collaboration for \"Rain on Me\" with Ariana Grande.\n\nHer nine outlandish outfits, and the ongoing face mask fashion display, is what Lady Gaga will be remembered for – not to mention her moments playing on a brain piano.\n\nHere's how Gaga rocked the VMAs.\n\nBest and worst moments: The 2020 VMAs - from Lady Gaga's pandemic-chic outfits to eerie fake crowds\n\nLos Angeles, we had no problem with the bubble mask\n\nGaga rocked the space face mask even before the virtual show, hosted by Keke Palmer, began.

After the Archives organized the return of 15 boxes of presidential materials from Mar-a-Lago in January, it referred the matter to the Justice Department for a criminal investigation.\n\nFBI agents reviewed the 15 boxes provided to the National Archives in May, and the affidavit details the amount of classified material that was found.\n\nIn the affidavit, the Justice Department said there were “184 unique documents bearing classification markings, including 67 documents marked as CONFIDENTIAL, 92 documents marked as SECRET, and 25 documents marked as TOP SECRET.”\n\nThreats to witnesses\n\nThe Justice Department also released a redacted legal brief explaining why it proposed the redactions to the affidavit, including possible threats to witnesses.\n\nThe DOJ argued that, without the proposed redactions, “the affidavit could be used to identify many, if not all, of these witnesses.” What follows is two paragraphs of redacted material.\n\n“If witnesses’ identities are exposed, they could be subjected to harms including retaliation, intimidation, or harassment, and even threats to their physical safety,” the filing said. “As the Court has already noted, ‘these concerns are not hypothetical in this case.’”\n\nReiterating language prosecutors previously used to describe why the affidavit should be kept secret, the DOJ’s legal brief said its details would provide a “road map” to the investigation and that revealing “this information could thus adversely impact the government’s pursuit of relevant evidence.”\n\nIt appears that one example of this risk is laid out in a redacted paragraph.\n\n“In addition, revealing this information could severely disadvantage the government as it seeks further information from witnesses,” the filing said. “In short, the government has well-founded concerns that steps may be taken to frustrate or otherwise interfere with this investigation if facts in the affidavit were prematurely disclosed.”\n\nThe sworn affidavit released Friday was written by an FBI special agent, whose identity was redacted to protect them from potential violence and threats. The document does reveal the agent was trained in “counterintelligence and espionage investigations” at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia, and has expertise investigating people who “unlawfully collect, retain, and disseminate sensitive government information.”\n\nClassified markings\n\nThe affidavit also says that there were markings on the documents with multiple classified compartmentalized controls. “Based on my training and experience, I know that documents classified at these levels typically contain” national defense information, wrote the special agent who authored the affidavit.\n\n“Several of the documents also contained what appears to be (the former President)’s handwritten notes,” the affidavit says.\n\nThe FBI search of Mar-a-Lago on August 8 occurred two months after a trip made by top department officials, where they were shown where Trump was storing some of the materials. In the time between, investigators became suspicious members of Trump’s team weren’t being fully truthful about the situation and that documents were being withheld in the efforts to return the records to the federal government.\n\nFBI used separate team to search Trump’s office to protect against privilege issues\n\nThe FBI used law enforcement personnel who were not part of the investigation to search Trump’s office in order to protect against potential attorney-client privilege issues, according to the affidavit.\n\nThe affidavit unsealed Friday says that the FBI used a “Privilege Review Team” to search the “45 office,” separate from the investigators who searched other areas of Trump’s residence authorized by the warrant.\n\n“The Privilege Review Team will search the ’45 Office’ and conduct a review of the seized materials from the ‘45 Office’ to identify and segregate documents or data containing potentially attorney-client privileged information,” the affidavit says.\n\nThe affidavit says that if the review team determined there were “documents are potentially attorney-client privileged or merit further consideration in that regard,” the team could take steps to seek a court determination, keep the documents from the investigative team, or “disclose the document to the potential privilege holder.”\n\nFight over releasing the affidavit\n\nThe affidavit was released after a fight in court over what level of transparency the public was owed into a search with the historic significance of one involving the home of a former president. Soon after news of the search broke, news outlets, including CNN, and other entities filed in court, seeking the release of the warrant materials.\n\nThe Justice Department was initially willing to release some of the warrant documents publicly, with Attorney General Merrick Garland telling reporters earlier this month that the Trump team’s public confirmation of many aspects of the search made the move appropriate in the face of the DOJ’s usual habit of keeping such materials secret.\n\nProsecutors balked at releasing the warrant affidavit itself, which they said would provide a “road map” to the investigation and chill the cooperation of witnesses in this and other probes. They also argued that once the necessary redactions were made, the document would be devoid of meaning.\n\nBut US Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart – who approved the warrant in early August and presided over the document release dispute – did not buy that argument. Under his instruction, the DOJ instead proposed redactions, which he found acceptable, prompting his order for the release.\n\nTrump calls for document’s release but sits out court back-and-forth\n\nTrump has previously called for its release as he baselessly claimed that he was the target of a “witch hunt.” But on Truth Social on Friday, he called it “a total public relations subterfuge by the FBI & DOJ.”\n\nHe has also shared audio on the social media website, saying, “I did nothing wrong.”\n\nThe audio appears to have been recorded prior to the affidavit being unsealed Friday afternoon as part of an interview that Trump gave to political commentator Lou Dobbs on his podcast, “The Great America Show.”\n\n“I did nothing wrong. … We were essentially attacked. We were broken into. They opened up safes. They brought safecrackers in. They brought many, many FBI agents in – all right before the midterms and all when I have the best poll numbers I’ve ever had,” he said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, speaking at the White House Friday, mocked Trump for saying he’d declassified all of the material he took with him to Mar-a-Lago. And Biden said when he takes classified information home with him, he follows set procedures for handling it.\n\nAsked about Trump’s claims he’d used his presidential powers to declassify documents, Biden scoffed.\n\n“I just want you to know I’ve declassified everything in the world. I’m president, I can do – c’mon,” Biden said.\n\nTurning serious, Biden said: “I’m not going to comment because I don’t know the details. I don’t even want to know. I’ll let the Justice Department take that.”\n\nTrump’s attorneys did not make any formal move to weigh in on the dispute before Reinhart. Only two weeks after the search did his legal team raise objections to it in court – but in a separate legal action filed that landed before a different judge in the Southern District of Florida.\n\nIn that lawsuit, Trump is asking for a third party known as a “special master” to oversee the FBI’s review of the materials it seized at Mar-a-Lago. His filing this week referenced a desire to see the affidavit in full, but he didn’t request an order from the judge to do so. Other apparent legal shortcomings in the complaint prompted the judge, Trump-appointee Aileen Cannon, to order he make new submissions by Friday midnight laying out exactly what he wanted and why she had the authority to grant it.\n\nThe quick pace of the proceedings around learning more about the FBI’s search has showcased the disarray in Trump’s legal response to the investigation. The narrative that Trump and his allies have put forward about his handling of the documents in their PR response to the search has not matched what Trump’s legal team claimed in the private negotiations with the Archives that started a year and a half ago, according to documents that have been made public from those conversations.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Marshall Cohen Tierney Sneed Jeremy Herb", "Marshall Cohen", "Tierney Sneed", "Jeremy Herb"], "publish_date": "2022/08/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/08/31/doj-obstruction-evidence-against-trump-fbi/7954027001/", "title": "DOJ lays out strongest obstruction evidence against Trump yet", "text": "Good afternoon, OnPolitics readers!\n\nOne of former President Donald Trump's most prominent defenders amid the Justice Department’s investigation into classified documents stored at his Florida estate is a fixture in Trump political circles.\n\nChristina Bobb, 39, spent years in the public eye as an on-air host for conservative news network One America News Network where she made no secret of her support of Trump. But she only burst onto mainstream news channels in recent weeks after the FBI executed its search warrant on Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club.\n\nThe FBI's search of Mar-a-Lago elevated Bobb’s role as one of Trump’s attorneys and as a person tightly tied to the investigation.\n\nA filing late Tuesday implicated Trump's team, including his lawyers, alleging that government records were concealed in an effort to obstruct the FBI's investigation. If true, the revelation could open Bobb to potential legal exposure, though it’s as likely that she would serve as a witness – and be forced to testify against Trump – should any charges be brought against the former president, said Norm Eisen, former Obama administration ethics czar and counsel in the first Trump impeachment.\n\nTo learn more about who Bobb is and her role in FBI's search of Mar-a-Lago, click here.\n\nIt's Amy and Ella with today's top stories out of Washington.\n\nDOJ mapped out strong obstruction evidence against Trump, aides in filing, experts say\n\nA Justice Department court filing elaborating on the search of Donald Trump’s Florida estate explains in the strongest terms yet – short of actually filing charges – a potential case for obstruction of justice against the former president and his aides, according to legal experts.\n\nThe extraordinary filing, a response to the former president's request for a third-party special master to oversee the review of seized records, accused Trump’s team of concealing and moving documents in an effort to impede the investigation, possibly implicating them in a scheme to shield hundreds of classified documents from investigators for a year and half after he left office.\n\n\"Donald Trump has drawn a bullseye on himself,\" said David Weinstein, a former Florida federal prosecutor, referring to a striking photograph included in the government's filing which showed clearly marked classified documents strewn across the floor of Trump's office next to a box of what appears to be Time magazine covers.\n\nWhat was the FBI looking for? The Aug. 8 search warrant sought evidence for potential violations of three statutes: the Espionage Act, mishandling national defense documents and obstruction of justice. The obstruction charge is more serious, carrying a maximum 20-year prison sentence, than the Espionage Act's maximum 10-year sentence.\n\nA key element for proving obstruction would be the false statement made June 3 from a Trump aide that all classified documents had been returned to the government, Ryan Goodman, a former special counsel to the general counsel at the Defense Department and now a law professor at New York University, said.\n\nProsecutors would need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that lawyers knew the statement was false or that Trump knowingly gave them false information, but witnesses and surveillance tapes could prove that case, Goodman said.\n\n“If it can be proven that Trump directed or otherwise ensured that documents with classified markings be kept from the DOJ following the subpoena it would likely be an open and shut case under all of the charges cited in the arrest warrant,” Goodman told USA TODAY.\n\nReal quick: Stories you'll want to read\n\nFemale troops saw biggest surge in unwanted sexual contact since DOD began collecting data\n\nWomen in the military endured the highest level of unwanted sexual contact since the Defense Department began tracking the data sixteen years ago, a new Pentagon survey obtained by USA TODAY shows. The startling finding shows sexual crimes are rising steadily despite hundreds of millions spent to curb the problem and vows by senior leaders to tackle it.\n\nThe Pentagon estimates that sexual assaults among women service members surged an estimated 35% from 2018 to 2021. The survey shows that 8.4% of women and 1.5% of men in the active-duty military said they had been the victim of a sex crime, ranging from groping to rape, according to results of the survey. In 2018, an estimated 6.2% of women in the armed services were victims of unwanted sexual contact.\n\nThe previous high for women was 6.8% in 2006, the same year that produced the highest on record for men at 1.8%.\n\nThe Pentagon's so-called prevalence survey had been delayed a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is considered the best measure of sexual abuse because it relies on an anonymous survey of troops to estimate the extent of the problem, rather than on formal complaints of sexual assault, a crime that is underreported.\n\nPresident Joe Biden will host Barack and Michelle Obama to unveil their official White House portraits years after former President Donald Trump snubbed the former first family by not hosting them to unveil the portraits during his time in office. --Ella & Amy", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/01/politics/trump-legal-gambits-political-risk-analysis/index.html/", "title": "Analysis: Donald Trump's legal gambits offer fresh revelations and ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nDonald Trump’s scattershot defense in the weeks since FBI agents descended on his Mar-a-Lago resort has only exposed the depth of the mess he faces over his refusal to return classified documents that led to an unprecedented search of an ex-president’s home.\n\nHappening Today 1 p.m. ET: Federal judge holds hearing to consider Trump’s bid for a special master to review evidence the FBI seized at Mar-a-Lago. Follow live updates 5:45 p.m. ET: House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy to give a speech in Biden’s hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania, just before the President’s primetime address 8 p.m. ET: Biden to speak about “the continued battle for the soul of the nation”\n\nAs he keeps inadvertently giving the Justice Department new openings, there are also signs that the fast-expanding drain on Trump’s time and focus is having a political impact as he considers delaying his timeline for the launch of a likely 2024 White House bid, as CNN’s Gabby Orr and Kristen Holmes reported Wednesday.\n\nBut Trump is not done with the time-honored strategy of delaying, distorting and trying to tie the legal system up in knots, which has throughout his life in business and politics often succeeded in postponing or preventing accountability.\n\nIn a legal filing on Wednesday laced with trademark chutzpah ahead of a critical new court hearing in Florida, Trump ditched a core argument he’s made for days – that he had already declassified documents found on his property.\n\nIn a head-spinning pivot, Trump’s legal team effectively argued that no one should be shocked he had classified documents at his home – he was once president, after all.\n\n“Simply put, the notion that Presidential records would contain sensitive information should have never been cause for alarm,” the filing said.\n\nThe bald-faced statement was a classic Trumpian tactic. It recalled the ex-President’s insistence that an official account of a conversation in which he self-evidently coerced the president of Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden with the promise of military aid was, on the contrary, evidence of “a perfect call.”\n\nTrump’s approach immediately gives his supporters in the GOP and on conservative media new material to muddy the waters, distort the case against him and accuse the DOJ and the FBI of political motives.\n\nBut he did not address the core questions swirling around him in the documents case. These include: why did a former president need material, some bearing the highest designations of classification in the intelligence community? And why did he keep material that could potentially damage national security and endanger US agents overseas in insecure locations in his heavily visited resort?\n\nAnd he also ignored a fundamental principle underlying the Justice Department investigation: According to US law, the papers of former presidents do not belong to the individual who once sat in the Oval Office. They belong to the nation and should be in the custody of the National Archives – an agency that made exhaustive efforts to retrieve Trump’s haul before turning to the Justice Department.\n\nOften Trump’s political and legal strategies cross-pollinate. This was highly successful in the case of the Ukraine call, which led to his first impeachment, although he avoided conviction in the Senate, which could have removed him from office. The complication here, however, is that Trump is facing not political scrutiny but the judgment of the law. And recent days suggest that he’s deeply exposed – not least because of a scathing Justice Department filing on Tuesday that obliterated many of his previous defenses and raised the possibility that Trump and his lawyers could face obstruction charges.\n\nStill Trump’s Wednesday filing, in support of his call for the appointment of an independent official known as a special master to work out whether the FBI took legally privileged documents from his home, could still work for him in the short term. If a judge agrees with his expansive definition of the role, Trump could throw a stick in the spokes of the investigation. He might be able to launch court challenges rooted in legal and executive privilege claims that could be frivolous but would take time to work through the system. And he could challenge the Presidential Records Act through various and exhaustive levels of the legal system. A hearing on Trump’s request is set for 1 p.m. ET Thursday.\n\nIf he can push the investigation deep into 2023 and possibly beyond, it could conflict with the presidential campaign and help Trump portray the episode as a politicized effort by the Biden administration to thwart his return to the White House. And he could once more frustrate political opponents desperate to see him quickly pay a price for his refusal to observe presidential norms and constant challenges to the rule of law.\n\nThis is one reason why the DOJ urged the judge to equip any special master she appoints with exceedingly limited guidelines for operation.\n\nIn itself, a special master is not an unreasonable request in such a case, according to legal experts, though the curiosity here is that Trump waited until the government had documents it took from Mar-a-Lago for two weeks to make it.\n\n“If the government’s case is as they think it is, let’s just play it straight, let a special master come in,” David Schoen, Trump’s lawyer from his second impeachment trial, said on CNN’s “New Day” on Thursday.\n\n“But why not let that process run out? Because a part of this whole scenario has to be – satisfy the public that there’s been a full and fair airing of everything, that all concerns have been addressed.”\n\nHow Trump keeps sabotaging his own defense\n\nAt the same time, however, Wednesday’s filing also threatened to backfire since it appeared to admit to the transgression of which Trump is accused – keeping classified information at his home. This could be another self-inflicted legal blow. Much like the revelations by the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection, the longer the process goes on, the more damning it seems to become for Trump.\n\nWhile the ex-President has succeeded in politicizing the investigation, and uniting much of the GOP behind him, his gambits so far have often only revealed more and more damning evidence about his own conduct.\n\nThe Justice Department, meanwhile, seems to be constantly outwitting Trump’s politicized and emotional defenses, which typically fail to address substantive legal issues.\n\nThe most concrete example of this is the remarkable legal filing by the DOJ on Tuesday night that argued that highly classified material was “likely concealed and removed” from a storage room at Mar-a-Lago. In a staggering photo, the filing showed document title pages bearing highly classified markings on the floor after they were found on the former President’s property. The DOJ filing also suggests that Trump’s lawyers misled the FBI when they attested that all secret documents had been removed earlier this year, a potential trigger for obstruction charges.\n\nWhat is striking about this is that Americans would never have had this level of insight into the case were it not for Trump himself.\n\n“The response that the Justice Department gave was perfectly appropriate,” conservative attorney George Conway told CNN’s Pamela Brown Wednesday. “The Trump people just basically asked to be punched in the face and they were punched in the face by the response,” Conway said.\n\nDave Aronberg, the state attorney for Palm Beach County, Florida, where Mar-a-Lago is located, agreed that Trump’s request for a special master had only worsened his position.\n\n“This is yet another self-inflicted wound by Trump’s legal team. (The special master motion) opened the gates for the DOJ to respond with a 36-page missile right into the heart of Trump Tower,” Aronberg, a Democrat, said on CNN’s “The Situation Room.”\n\n“You have got this response that decimates Trump claims that his team was fully cooperative the whole time. Actually, it lays out a case of obstruction.”\n\nIt was not the first time that Trump had appeared to sabotage his own position.\n\nEarlier in August, Attorney General Merrick Garland pressed for the release of a search warrant that showed classified documents were taken from his home three weeks ago. This revelation, which undermined Trump’s criticism of the search and revealed that the FBI had reason to believe classified information was on the property, only took place after Trump announced the search himself, then unleashed a storm of disinformation and threats against the bureau.\n\nLike many of Trump’s legal filings, Wednesday night’s document seemed as much designed to address a political audience – and to fan his campaign of fury against the Justice Department – as to ease his legal conundrum.\n\nThere is much that remains unknown about this case. It is reasonable for Trump and his allies to demand answers about how the Justice Department handled a hugely sensitive case against an ex-president and possible 2024 presidential candidate. So far, however, there is every sign the DOJ is going by the book. The search was, for instance, not illegal as Trump claims but was permitted by a search warrant signed by a judge who had to be convinced of probable cause a crime had been committed. It is also impossible to get a full window into the case because the underlying affidavit that precipitated the search warrant has only been released in highly redacted form to protect witnesses and FBI agents from backlash and to maintain the integrity of the investigation.\n\nTrump’s 2024 calculation is getting more complicated\n\nThe fallout of the FBI raid on Trump’s property has thrust the former President back into the headlines in a way that Republicans keen to focus on inflation and Biden’s low approval ratings in the midterm elections do not welcome.\n\nIt has also raised questions about how the legal pressure bearing down on him will impact his likely 2024 presidential campaign.\n\nCNN’s Orr and Holmes reported that after months eyeing Labor Day weekend as the target launch date for his 2024 campaign, he has spent the last few weeks backing away from that timeline.\n\nAn onslaught of political concerns – raised by the possibility some of his hand-picked candidates are underperforming in the midterms – and his growing legal worries have Trump nervous about prematurely diving into the race, according to nine former and current Trump aides and allies who requested anonymity to discuss internal matters.\n\n“Everyone was operating under the assumption that shortly after Labor Day would be the best possible time to launch, but that has changed and he’s being told to deal with the FBI stuff first,” said a Trump adviser.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/09/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/politics/mar-a-lago-search-warrant-fbi-donald-trump/index.html", "title": "Trump's Mar-a-Lago searched by FBI in document investigation ...", "text": "(CNN) The FBI executed a search warrant Monday at Donald Trump 's Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, as part of an investigation into the handling of presidential documents, including classified documents, that may have been brought there, three people familiar with the situation told CNN.\n\nThe former President confirmed that FBI agents were at Mar-a-Lago and said \"they even broke into my safe.\" He was at Trump Tower in New York when the search warrant was executed in Florida, a person familiar told CNN.\n\n\"My beautiful home, Mar-A-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, is currently under siege, raided, and occupied by a large group of FBI agents,\" Trump said in a statement Monday evening.\n\nThe extraordinary move to search the home of a former president raises the stakes for the Justice Department and comes as Trump's legal problems continue on multiple fronts.

The four investigators, including Jay Bratt, the chief of the counterintelligence and export control section at the Justice Department, sat down with two of Trump's attorneys, Bobb and Evan Corcoran, according to a source present for the meeting.\n\nAt the beginning of the meeting, Trump stopped by and greeted the investigators near a dining room. After he left, without answering any questions, the investigators asked the attorneys if they could see where Trump was storing the documents. The attorneys took the investigators to the basement room where the boxes of materials were being stored, and the investigators looked around the room before eventually leaving, according to the source.\n\nA second source said that Trump came in to say hi and made small talk but left while the attorneys spoke with investigators. The source said some of the documents shown to investigators had top secret markings.\n\nFive days later, on June 8, Trump's attorneys received a letter from investigators asking them to further secure the room where the documents were stored. Aides subsequently added a padlock to the room.\n\nIn April and May, aides to Trump at Mar-a-Lago were interviewed by the FBI as part of the probe into the handling of presidential records, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\n\"It is a federal crime to remove classified documents wrongly. And so if you are filling out that affidavit and you have to list the crime, you can list that as the crime,\" said Elie Honig, a former federal and state prosecutor and a CNN senior legal analyst.\n\nHonig told CNN's Erin Burnett on \"OutFront\" that the timing of the search held with the longstanding department rule not to execute politically sensitive moves within 90 days of an election.\n\n\"Today is just about 90 days out exactly from the midterms, I think maybe 91 or 92 days out.

The filing represents the DOJ's strongest case to date that Trump concealed classified material taken from his time at the White House. The Justice Department revealed the startling new details as part of its move to oppose Trump's effort to intervene in the federal investigation that led to the search of his Florida resort and his desire for a \" special master \" to be appointed to the case. A picture from the court filing also showed classified documents arrayed on the floor of Trump's office -- full of classified markings like \"HCS,\" or human confidential sources -- displaying how sensitive the material Trump had taken was.\n\n2.

More than 55 million people are currently under heat alerts from Southern California through the San Joaquin Valley and into portions of the Northwest, including 20 of the most populated cities up and down the West Coast. According to the National Weather Service, dangerously hot temperatures today may extend through Labor Day and could exceed 110 degrees Fahrenheit in parts of the Southwest. The kind of heat that will be felt from San Diego to Los Angeles to even Phoenix will be difficult to endure even for the locals, experts say. There will be a gradual warm-up in the coming days, and it will peak by the end of the week.\n\n4. Artemis I\n\nThe uncrewed Artemis I mission will get another attempt at launching on a journey around the moon on Saturday. After the launch was scrubbed Monday morning, NASA's launch team spent the day evaluating data gathered during the attempt. Mission managers said one of the rocket's four engines could not reach the proper temperature range that is required for the engine to start at liftoff. Several other issues, including storms and a hydrogen leak, also caused delays that prevented liftoff during Monday's launch window. The new two-hour launch window opens at 2:17 p.m. ET on September 3. There is still a backup opportunity for the mission to launch on September 5 as well.\n\nJUST WATCHED NASA scrubs Artemis I rocket launch due to engine issues.

Gun Laws\n\nNew York City's famed Times Square tourist area will be designated a \"gun-free zone\" beginning Thursday as a new state law limiting where firearms can be legally carried in public is set to go into effect. The law outlines areas in the city deemed \"sensitive\" where firearm possession will be illegal, and also includes government-owned buildings, schools, health care facilities, places of worship and public transportation. People who carry a gun in a prohibited location could be charged with a felony under the law. New \"gun-free zone\" signs are expected to be posted in Times Square today at every entry and exit point of the area. This comes as the number of shootings involving automatic weapons in the US has skyrocketed in recent years.\n\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\n\n'This is so embarrassing': Woman gets stuck upside down at the gym\n\nA woman used her smartwatch to call 911 after getting stuck in an interesting position at the gym.

CNN has previously reported how Trump flouted presidential record-keeping laws and would often tear up documents, drafts and memos after reading them.\n\nHe periodically flushed papers down the toilet in the White House residence -- only to be discovered later on when repairmen were summoned to fix the clogged toilets. Trump has denied the allegations, and in a statement given to Axios on Monday, a spokesman claimed that reporting about the practice was fabricated.\n\nThis picture shows notes that former President Donald Trump apparently ripped up and attempted to flush down the toilet.\n\nIn the images revealed on Monday, it's unclear what the documents are in reference to -- and who authored them -- but they appear to be written in Trump's handwriting in black marker. Haberman said one image is from a White House toilet and the other one is from an overseas trip that was provided to her by a Trump White House source.\n\n\"Who knows what this paper was?

It recalled the ex-President's insistence that an official account of a conversation in which he self-evidently coerced the president of Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden with the promise of military aid was, on the contrary, evidence of \"a perfect call.\"\n\nTrump's approach immediately gives his supporters in the GOP and on conservative media new material to muddy the waters, distort the case against him and accuse the DOJ and the FBI of political motives.\n\nBut he did not address the core questions swirling around him in the documents case. These include: why did a former president need material, some bearing the highest designations of classification in the intelligence community? And why did he keep material that could potentially damage national security and endanger US agents overseas in insecure locations in his heavily visited resort?\n\nJUST WATCHED See why Trump's lawyer may need a lawyer in wake of DOJ photo Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH See why Trump's lawyer may need a lawyer in wake of DOJ photo 02:31\n\nAnd he also ignored a fundamental principle underlying the Justice Department investigation: According to US law, the papers of former presidents do not belong to the individual who once sat in the Oval Office. They belong to the nation and should be in the custody of the National Archives -- an agency that made exhaustive efforts to retrieve Trump's haul before turning to the Justice Department.\n\nOften Trump's political and legal strategies cross-pollinate. This was highly successful in the case of the Ukraine call, which led to his first impeachment, although he avoided conviction in the Senate, which could have removed him from office. The complication here, however, is that Trump is facing not political scrutiny but the judgment of the law. And recent days suggest that he's deeply exposed -- not least because of a scathing Justice Department filing on Tuesday that obliterated many of his previous defenses and raised the possibility that Trump and his lawyers could face obstruction charges.\n\nStill Trump's Wednesday filing, in support of his call for the appointment of an independent official known as a special master to work out whether the FBI took legally privileged documents from his home, could still work for him in the short term. If a judge agrees with his expansive definition of the role, Trump could throw a stick in the spokes of the investigation. He might be able to launch court challenges rooted in legal and executive privilege claims that could be frivolous but would take time to work through the system. And he could challenge the Presidential Records Act through various and exhaustive levels of the legal system. A hearing on Trump's request is set for 1 p.m. ET Thursday.\n\nIf he can push the investigation deep into 2023 and possibly beyond, it could conflict with the presidential campaign and help Trump portray the episode as a politicized effort by the Biden administration to thwart his return to the White House. And he could once more frustrate political opponents desperate to see him quickly pay a price for his refusal to observe presidential norms and constant challenges to the rule of law.\n\nThis is one reason why the DOJ urged the judge to equip any special master she appoints with exceedingly limited guidelines for operation.\n\nIn itself, a special master is not an unreasonable request in such a case, according to legal experts, though the curiosity here is that Trump waited until the government had documents it took from Mar-a-Lago for two weeks to make it.\n\n\"If the government's case is as they think it is, let's just play it straight, let a special master come in,\" David Schoen, Trump's lawyer from his second impeachment trial, said on CNN's \"New Day\" on Thursday.\n\n\"But why not let that process run out? Because a part of this whole scenario has to be -- satisfy the public that there's been a full and fair airing of everything, that all concerns have been addressed.\"\n\nHow Trump keeps sabotaging his own defense\n\nAt the same time, however, Wednesday's filing also threatened to backfire since it appeared to admit to the transgression of which Trump is accused -- keeping classified information at his home. This could be another self-inflicted legal blow. Much like the revelations by the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection, the longer the process goes on, the more damning it seems to become for Trump.\n\nWhile the ex-President has succeeded in politicizing the investigation, and uniting much of the GOP behind him, his gambits so far have often only revealed more and more damning evidence about his own conduct.\n\nThe Justice Department, meanwhile, seems to be constantly outwitting Trump's politicized and emotional defenses, which typically fail to address substantive legal issues.\n\nThe most concrete example of this is the remarkable legal filing by the DOJ on Tuesday night that argued that highly classified material was \"likely concealed and removed\" from a storage room at Mar-a-Lago. In a staggering photo, the filing showed document title pages bearing highly classified markings on the floor after they were found on the former President's property. The DOJ filing also suggests that Trump's lawyers misled the FBI when they attested that all secret documents had been removed earlier this year, a potential trigger for obstruction charges.\n\nWhat is striking about this is that Americans would never have had this level of insight into the case were it not for Trump himself.\n\n\"The response that the Justice Department gave was perfectly appropriate,\" conservative attorney George Conway told CNN's Pamela Brown Wednesday. \"The Trump people just basically asked to be punched in the face and they were punched in the face by the response,\" Conway said.\n\nDave Aronberg, the state attorney for Palm Beach County, Florida, where Mar-a-Lago is located, agreed that Trump's request for a special master had only worsened his position.\n\n\"This is yet another self-inflicted wound by Trump's legal team. (The special master motion) opened the gates for the DOJ to respond with a 36-page missile right into the heart of Trump Tower,\" Aronberg, a Democrat, said on CNN's \"The Situation Room.\"\n\n\"You have got this response that decimates Trump claims that his team was fully cooperative the whole time. Actually, it lays out a case of obstruction.\"\n\nIt was not the first time that Trump had appeared to sabotage his own position.\n\nEarlier in August, Attorney General Merrick Garland pressed for the release of a search warrant that showed classified documents were taken from his home three weeks ago. This revelation, which undermined Trump's criticism of the search and revealed that the FBI had reason to believe classified information was on the property, only took place after Trump announced the search himself, then unleashed a storm of disinformation and threats against the bureau.\n\nLike many of Trump's legal filings, Wednesday night's document seemed as much designed to address a political audience -- and to fan his campaign of fury against the Justice Department -- as to ease his legal conundrum.\n\nThere is much that remains unknown about this case. It is reasonable for Trump and his allies to demand answers about how the Justice Department handled a hugely sensitive case against an ex-president and possible 2024 presidential candidate. So far, however, there is every sign the DOJ is going by the book . The search was, for instance, not illegal as Trump claims but was permitted by a search warrant signed by a judge who had to be convinced of probable cause a crime had been committed. It is also impossible to get a full window into the case because the underlying affidavit that precipitated the search warrant has only been released in highly redacted form to protect witnesses and FBI agents from backlash and to maintain the integrity of the investigation.\n\nTrump's 2024 calculation is getting more complicated\n\nThe fallout of the FBI raid on Trump's property has thrust the former President back into the headlines in a way that Republicans keen to focus on inflation and Biden's low approval ratings in the midterm elections do not welcome.\n\nIt has also raised questions about how the legal pressure bearing down on him will impact his likely 2024 presidential campaign.\n\nCNN's Orr and Holmes reported that after months eyeing Labor Day weekend as the target launch date for his 2024 campaign, he has spent the last few weeks backing away from that timeline.\n\nAn onslaught of political concerns -- raised by the possibility some of his hand-picked candidates are underperforming in the midterms -- and his growing legal worries have Trump nervous about prematurely diving into the race, according to nine former and current Trump aides and allies who requested anonymity to discuss internal matters.\n\n\"Everyone was operating under the assumption that shortly after Labor Day would be the best possible time to launch, but that has changed and he's being told to deal with the FBI stuff first,\" said a Trump adviser.", "authors": ["Analysis Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/09/01"}]}

It's a plane. It's the nation's fastest communitywide internet service, and it's making its way to a Tennessee city and convention center.\n\nEPB, an internet, TV, phone and energy company in Chattanooga, has launched a communitywide, 25-gigabits-per-second internet service. The service will be available to all residential and commercial customers in the area and is operated by a 100% fiber optic network, EPB said in a news release on Aug. 24.\n\n\"What we have done is basically laid a community-wide fiber to the home and fiber to the business network, so every premise, home and business has fiber going directly to the facility or the home,\" said J.Ed. Marston, the company's vice president of strategic communications.\n\nThe move comes after EPB first launched its gig-speed internet service in 2010 and then its 10-gig internet service in 2015.\n\nThe latest service to launch covers a 600-square mile service area, he said.\n\nInternet access: Major internet providers to slash cost of broadband service for low-income Americans\n\nPrices start above $1,000 per month for residents\n\nEPB said it'll charge $1,500 per month for residential 25 gig internet service and $12,500 per month for commercial service.\n\n\"While 25-gig is available to every business and residential customer in our 600-mile area, it is best utilized today in commercial applications with very high bandwidth needs (hundreds or thousands of simultaneously streaming devices),\" wrote EPB public relations specialist Sophie Moore in an email.\n\nThe company expects the price to decrease as the rest of the market catches up, she said.\n\nSpace race:SpaceX, T-Mobile race to put an end to cell phone dead zones with help from outer space\n\nWhat does 25-gig internet mean for the user?\n\nThe first site to have 25-gig service as part of a communitywide network is the Chattanooga Convention Center, EPB announced. It will allow thousands of visitors to connect electronics during events like business conferences, e-gaming competitions and livestreaming events.\n\n\"People who are attending conferences at the Chattanooga Convention Center ... they won't have that experience that we've all had when you're in a crowded venue and you can't get a signal at all, or it's super slow and dies before you can get to the webpage you want to look at,\" Marston told USA TODAY.\n\nEPB said its 25-gig internet service comes with symmetrical upload and download speeds. In other words, users will be able to download and upload high-resolution pictures and videos without any snags.\n\nThe current Federal Communications Commission national standard for broadband bandwidth is 25 megabits per second for downloads and 3 megabits per second for uploads, Steve Corbató, executive director of Link Oregon, a nonprofit that connects public and non-profit sectors to broadband, told USA TODAY.\n\nOne gigabit is 1,000 megabits, so updating the standard to one gigabit could lead to a 40 times increase in download speeds and over 300 times an increase in upload speeds, he said.\n\nCorbató thinks the pandemic revealed just how bad internet access is in some communities, and service providers historically haven't taken upstream bandwidth as seriously because they thought of the internet as a way of simply \"delivering content.\"\n\n\"The speed of the connection really matters,\" he said. \"It really empowers people to have high-quality video conferences. In terms of telehealth, it allows higher resolution imaging, which is important for remote diagnosis.\"\n\nA hotbed for internet inclusion\n\nAngela Siefer, executive director of the National Digital Inclusion Alliance, said Chattanooga has made its Digital Inclusion Trailblazers list every year since it started in 2016. The list includes local government initiatives that promote digital literacy and broadband access for underserved residents.\n\nThe list is based on six indicators, including whether the local government has a digital inclusion plan and has tried to increase the affordability of home broadband service. Chattanooga has hit all six indicators, Siefer said.\n\n\"They think about it in a way that not everybody does,\" she said. \"(We care) about equitable access to internet, so we don't get really excited about the difference between 10 gig and 25 gig. What we get excited about is everybody having access to whatever it is that they need.\"\n\nThe importance of internet connectivity and fiber optic networks\n\nCorbató, from Link Oregon, said EPB is taking advantage of being the city's electric utility company. They have access to people's houses through electrical feeds.\n\n\"By putting the fiber out there, that makes the sort of natural increase in speed that happens as electronics gets faster that much easier,\" he said. \"I think cities that have abundant fiber, and in the case of homes that get fiber to the home, they're going to be in a better position.\"\n\nHe said the federal government is making a hefty investment in broadband, so similar projects may be popping up in other cities.\n\nSome cities are already making strides to enhance their connectivity, he said, such as Ammon, Idaho. In the 2000s, the city built its own fiber-optic cable network, allowing locals to get internet access for around $9.99 a month, according to U.S. News & World Report.\n\n\"It's really important that all Americans get the level of internet connectivity to allow them to participate in digital society and the digital economy,\" Corbató said.\n\nSaleen Martin is a reporter on USA TODAY's NOW team.

Anyone already connected to AT&T U-Verse services should start to receive GigaPower service by the end of 2016.\n\n\"It's a great pleasure to see that Reno is now in the line-up to receive our fastest speeds available, especially given the significant economic development underway; this can only enhance those opportunities for growth,\" Stephanie Tyler, president of AT&T Nevada said in a press release.\n\nFiber-optic Internet is more than 10 times faster than the highest speed currently available to homes in the Reno area, ranging from 100 megabits per second to 10 gigabits per second compared to the current top speed of 120 megabits per second offered to some consumers. In addition to break-neck speeds, fiber optics allow more simultaneous use, alleviating slowdowns caused by high traffic.\n\n\"Faster access for our businesses and the city is critical to the economic vitality of our city as we compete for business and jobs in our area,\" Mayor Hillary Schieve said in a press release. \"Today's announcement is a game changer in delivering our goals to keep Reno moving forward.\"\n\nIn the coming months, Reno-based fiber-optic company Lightcore Group is also building extremely high-speed Internet into new residential developments in downtown Sparks. Those include C Street Lofts in the former Old Silver Club Hotel and The Yard, formerly Bourbon Square Casino, said Sparks City Manager Steve Driscoll.\n\nIn both Reno and Sparks, the fiber companies will be funded privately and work with developers to install the network instead of using taxpayer money.\n\nOther cities with gigabit-speed Internet have attracted significant investment and experienced growth as a result of the technology. In other words, like the Tesla Effect, gigabit Internet could help improve the perception of Reno and its economy, backers say.\n\nLightcore Group owner Lance Douglas said fiber-connected houses would raise home values and create jobs and businesses to support people moving to Reno. Schieve and Mike Kazmierski, president and CEO of the Economic Development Authority of Western Nevada, want fiber to bring new technology companies and industries in for the same reason.\n\n\"Our view is any fiber is good fiber,\" Kazmierski said.\n\nHe's not the only one.\n\n\"What the Startup Row banners (on First Street) do for us, fiber would do for the city,\" said Reno Collective owner Colin Loretz. \"It's future-proofing Reno.\"\n\nWhy does Reno need fiber?\n\nIn the coming years, Americans will need faster Internet because up to 50 Internet-connected devices and appliances will compete for bandwidth in a single home. If Johnny and Sally are watching two different Netflix movies on their phones while Mom watches HBO Go on the TV, it may slow down Dad working remotely on his laptop.\n\nOutside of home use, \"the sky is the limit\" for what fiber Internet can achieve, Douglas said. Some Reno businesses already have fiber but not many.\n\nIn the \"smart city\" of the future, thousands of sensors could stream weather, air quality, earthquake and traffic data to early warning systems, smart phones and automated cars. These are all part of a larger technology trend called the Internet of Things, where everyday objects connect to the Internet to provide real-time feedback and streaming data. The city's Internet infrastructure will determine how well that connectivity operates.\n\nReno is working toward that goal. A local company, Filament, wants to deploy a network across the city to facilitate these types of sensors in the future. Owner Eric Jennings said a fiber-optic network would make Reno \"pretty unstoppable.\"\n\nChattanooga, Tenn., is the first fully connected gigabit city and realized many of these benefits five years ago. Chattanooga now calls itself GIG City as a way to attract more technology companies and startup money.\n\n\"Chattanooga has gone from close to zero venture capital in 2009 to more than five organized funds with investable capital over $50 million in 2014 — not bad for a city of 171,000 people,\" the Guardian wrote in a 2014 story about the town's tech boom.\n\nChattanooga attracted $4 billion in additional outside investment since it turned into the GIG City, according to The Gig Tank, a startup accelerator for businesses that need gigabit-speed Internet.\n\nSome cities only have gigabit speeds in a few neighborhoods. EDAWN Vice President Doug Erwin visited one called the Kansas City Startup Village last year. The village centers around a Google Fiber hub. He said it served as a lightning rod to bring in new businesses.\n\nTech startups moved to Kansas City and converted houses into businesses instead of renting office space because it was cheaper. Loretz said tech companies moved to the village for fiber, which in some ways is better than waiting for them to start from scratch. He said Reno could benefit from the same thing.\n\nHow would Reno get fiber-to-home?\n\nUsually, fiber-optic services set up networks in neighborhoods and not entire cities. Customers who live within the network then pay standard monthly rates to an Internet service provider, which then uses the fiber-optic network to deliver the Internet to the home.\n\nThis is how AT&T GigaPower works. Prices have not yet been announced for Reno but in Cupertino, Calif. the service ranges from $110 to $180 for 1 Gbps with various TV and phone bundles.\n\nChattanooga went a different route and brought its fiber through a public utility, which is why the whole city received it. Customers pay for fiber through the power company. They offer 100 Mbps for $57 per month.\n\nLightcore's model would differ from other companies that offer fiber networks.\n\nLightcore lays the fiber-optic cables throughout the city. Internet providers would then lease bandwidth from Lightcore to provide faster Internet to their customers. Douglas' dream is that a customer's current Internet provider will call to say \"you've been upgraded to fiber, congratulations!\" This dream and business model is not new, it happens all the time in the cellular phone world.\n\nVerizon, AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile rarely set up their own towers, they all lease cell-phone bandwidth from other companies. It's more efficient for the city, customers and providers to use one tower instead of three identical towers next to each other. In some cases, tower companies bought and leased the bandwidth back to the provider.\n\nLoretz said he's most excited that Lightcore could create price competition and more options for Internet service. Lightcore's idea would even the playing field so that no single company can hold a monopoly on Internet service. Instead, they will compete over pricing instead of who owns the network.\n\nThis is similar to cell phone data battles. When Sprint announced unlimited smart phone data, others followed. Customers suddenly received more data for the same price.\n\nRight now, a few fiber optic providers only serve some businesses and charge $1,000 to $2,000 per month. Douglas said he's signing on new providers that would further diversify the Reno market. If those providers brought in 200 Mbps service for $60 a month, for example, it would make the current 60 Mbps offered to homes overpriced. The market would adjust.\n\n\"Our goal is to change the industry,\" Douglas said.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nIt's unclear what will happen with Lightcore's pilot project in Sparks while AT&T moves into Reno. Douglas said it would cost him $600 million and up to three years to build a fiber-to-home network throughout the entire region. He's looking at a long-term 20 to 30-year investment cycle, much longer than a standard start up. Neither Sparks nor Reno governments will help pay for that, said Schieve and Sparks City Manager Steve Driscoll.\n\nThe Southeast Connector project, for comparison, cost $290 million and it's one of the most expensive and controversial infrastructure projects in the region.\n\nDouglas knows he could lose the market to an existing provider if they move faster with more investment, but he wants a chance to make fiber available to everyone.\n\n\"It can be done for citizens and everyone makes money,\" he said. \"It doesn't have to be a monopoly or a dictatorship like it is in some places.\"\n\nHere’s the full list of cities slated to get fiber service through AT&T:\n\nThe 38 metro areas that AT&T will be entering, starting with the launch of service in parts of the Los Angeles and West Palm Beach metro areas today, are:\n\nAlabama: Birmingham, Huntsville, Mobile and Montgomery\n\nArkansas: Fort Smith/Northwest Arkansas and Little Rock\n\nCalifornia: Bakersfield, Fresno, Los Angeles, Oakland, Sacramento, San Diego, San Francisco and San Jose\n\nFlorida: Pensacola and West Palm Beach\n\nGeorgia: Augusta\n\nIndiana: Indianapolis\n\nKansas: Wichita\n\nKentucky: Louisville\n\nLouisiana: Baton Rouge, Shreveport-Bossier, Jefferson Parish region and the Northshore\n\nMississippi: Jackson\n\nMissouri: St. Louis\n\nMichigan: Detroit\n\nNevada: Reno\n\nNorth Carolina: Asheville\n\nOhio: Cleveland and Columbus\n\nOklahoma: Oklahoma City and Tulsa\n\nSouth Carolina: Charleston, Columbia and Greenville\n\nTennessee: Memphis\n\nTexas: El Paso and Lubbock\n\nWisconsin: Milwaukee\n\nMike Higdon is the city life reporter at the RGJ and can be found on Instagram @MillennialMike and on Facebook at Mike Higdon, Reno Life.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/12/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/22/tech/how-to-access-5g-att-verizon/index.html", "title": "How to access AT&T and Verizon's new super fast 5G networks", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nMany mobile device users in the United States now have access to blazing-fast internet speeds stemming from the rollout of Verizon (VZ) and AT&T (T)’s new C-band 5G networks earlier this week.\n\nWhile telecom companies have rolled out 5G networks to various locations across the country over the last few years, many delivered an experience that was arguably only a notch above what 4G offers. Now, AT&T (T), which owns CNN’s parent company, and Verizon have turned on C-band 5G networks, which are an important set of higher radio frequencies. These networks will supercharge the internet as we know it, allowing users to, for example, stream a Netflix movie in 4K resolution or download a movie in seconds. (Verizon said its C-band speeds reach nearly 1 gigabyte per second, about 10 times as fast as 4G LTE. If that’s not obvious, it’s really fast.)\n\nBut not everyone will be able to take advantage of these C-band 5G networks out of the gate. You’ll need three key things to access one: a newer smartphone model that supports 5G, a 5G-specific cellular plan and to be in an area with the new coverage.\n\nHere’s what you need to know:\n\nIs my phone compatible?\n\nAT&T and Verizon have a handful of devices that are compatible with their new C-band 5G networks, including the iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 models, the Samsung Galaxy S21 line and, soon, Google’s Pixel 6 phones. (For a full list of C-band compatible devices, visit AT&T and Verizon’s websites.)\n\nIf you’re on an Android device, you can check which network your phone supports by going to Settings, tapping on Network and Internet, and then selecting Mobile Network. On iOS, open Settings, then Cellular and tap Cellular Data Options. If you’re using Dual SIM on iOS, go to Settings, then Cellular and choose the number whose options you want to change.\n\nBut if you haven’t bought a new smartphone in the past two years, you most likely have a 3G or 4G phone.\n\nIt’s only a matter of time before most new phones come with built-in 5G support, as manufacturers and carriers will push customers toward it over other networks. (AT&T plans to shut down its 3G network next month, Verizon is shutting down its 3G network by the end of the year and T-Mobile will shut down Sprint’s 3G network by March 31.)\n\nDo I need a new cellular plan?\n\nIf you own a 5G device, you’ll still need a 5G-specific plan to access the faster C-band network. Existing 5G subscribers can do so without an additional charge. Both AT&T and Verizon offer plans that start at $35 a month for each phone line.\n\nVerizon also announced a 5G home internet plan for its C-band network, starting at $50 a month.\n\nWhere are the C-band networks?\n\nEven if you have a 5G-capable device and a 5G mobile plan you may not be able to access the new higher-speed 5G network.\n\nAT&T’s new C-band 5G network — which it is calling the 5G+ network — is currently only available in eight metro areas, including Chicago, Houston, Austin, Dallas/Fort Worth, Detroit, Miami, Jacksonville and Orlando. The company said it will expand to more cities throughout the year, most likely in cities where it has already launched 5G in other bands.\n\nAnyone with a 5G-compatible phone will be able to download the latest mobile operating system to gain access to the network. On AT&T’s network, anyone in a 5G+ market will see a “5G+” at the top of the device when the network is available.\n\nMeanwhile, Verizon said its new 5G Ultra Wideband network will be available to 100 million more people this month in over 1,700 US cities, including Chicago, Miami, Los Angeles, New York City and even smaller cities such as Dayton, Ohio, and Rochester, New York. To see if service is in your area, Verizon’s website has a coverage map.\n\nA “5G UW” indicator will appear on the top right corner of the device when a 5G phone on one of the plans is detected on the network.", "authors": ["Samantha Murphy Kelly"], "publish_date": "2022/01/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2021/07/28/tennessee-sales-tax-free-weekend-holiday/5397979001/", "title": "Tennessee sales tax holiday: What to know before you shop, how to ...", "text": "Tennessee's annual sales tax holiday is here again.\n\nStarting July 30, Tennesseans can make most purchases on clothes, school supplies and computers tax-free, bringing savings of up to 9.75%. The holiday is always a huge boon for back-to-school shoppers, but anyone can take advantage of savings on everything from clothes to dry-erase boards to desktop computers.\n\nAnd in a first for the state, nearly all non-alcohol food and beverage purchases in stores and restaurants will be tax-free from July 30 to Aug 5. Restaurant purchases were tax-free during a second tax holiday in 2020, but this is the first time food retailers and grocers have been eligible for the tax break.\n\n\"It just encourages people to get out and spend, regardless of what they're buying,\" said L.J. Whalen of Gifford's Bacon. \"If you save a dollar here or there, that's a dollar you can spend somewhere else.\"\n\nThat's good for both consumers and business owners, said National Federation of Independent Business State Director Jim Brown.\n\n\"Tennessee’s economy is stronger than it was a year ago, but it may be months before small, independent businesses get back to where they were before the pandemic,\" Brown said in a statement. \"Small businesses do a lot to help their communities. This is a good opportunity for people to support small businesses.\"\n\nHere are seven things to know before the tax holiday kicks off.\n\nWhat items are eligible?\n\nThe annual sales tax holiday runs from 12:01 a.m. Friday, July 30, to 11:59 p.m. Sunday, Aug. 1. The holiday is generally intended to give shoppers a break on back-to-school items, including:\n\nApparel that costs $100 or less per item. This does not include jewelry, handbags or sports and recreation equipment.\n\nSchool supplies, including binders, backpacks, writing and art supplies and other items that cost $100 or less per item.\n\nComputers for personal use that cost $1,500 or less. This includes laptops, desktops and tablet computers.\n\nMore tax-free eating in 2021\n\nTennessee enacted a second tax holiday in 2020 for restaurant purchases. That has been expanded for 2021, and virtually all non-alcohol grocery and dining purchases are tax-free from 12:01 a.m. on Friday, July 30, to 11:59 p.m. on Thursday, Aug 5.\n\nThe criteria for tax-free food purchases are very broad and include sales of food, food ingredients and prepared food at grocery stores, farmers' markets, restaurants, food trucks and other dining establishments. There is no spending limit for food purchases, according to the Department of Revenue's website.\n\nPurchases of alcoholic beverages, tobacco, candy and dietary supplements do not qualify for the tax break.\n\nGun safety devices now eligible\n\nGun safes and gun safety devices, such as computerized locking devices, are also eligible for the tax break. There is no price limit for these purchases, and the tax-free period runs through June 30, 2022. Purchases of firearms and ammunition are not tax-exempt.\n\nChanges from last year\n\nTennessee lawmakers increased the spending limit for eligible purchases during last year's sales tax holiday, which fell during the throes of the pandemic recession. The expanded caps are not in place this year.\n\nClothing purchases are once again limited to $100 per item to be eligible, and the limit for computer spending is back down to $1,500. Other electronics such as video game consoles, TVs and cellphones are no longer eligible.\n\nOnline shopping qualifies\n\nOnline purchases for Tennessee shoppers qualify for the tax break if the order is placed by the consumer and accepted by the retailer during the three-day window. All orders shipping to a Tennessee address are eligible.\n\nOddball items to buy\n\nThe tax holiday is always a boon for back-to-school shoppers, but Tennesseans can save on many items designed specifically for use outside the classroom.\n\nClerical vestments, golf clothing, galoshes, diapers, swimsuits, lingerie and underwear, pajamas, hats, art pads, lab coats, altar robes and dozens of other items are specifically denoted as tax-exempt during the holiday, provided they cost $100 or less per item.\n\nFor a full list of eligible items and restrictions, visit tn.gov/revenue/taxes.\n\nOther restrictions\n\nState law specifically states that \"no items used in trade or business are exempt,\" so business purchases are not eligible for the tax break.\n\nTextbooks qualify for the tax break whether purchased in-store or online. Many textbooks cost more than the $100 spending limit for school supply purchases, however, limiting the number of qualifying items.\n\nCole Villena covers business at The Tennessean, part of the USA Today Network — Tennessee.

Prepare to negotiate", "text": "Rob Pegoraro\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY\n\nQ. I moved into a new house that I thought had broadband; instead, Comcast says I'll have to pay $2,000 to get service extended. Is that my only option?\n\nA. The agony of being outside an Internet provider's coverage has been in the news the past few days, thanks to Consumerist's tale of a man in a suburb of Seattle who discovered his new abode had zero broadband options.\n\nThis story isn't as painful and does have a somewhat happy ending, but it's still not that pretty.\n\nAutomotive journalist Christian Moe had been a Comcast customer for four years in the farther reaches of the Knoxville area, and when he was considering a place four miles closer to town, Comcast said it had service there too. But after he signed the lease, Moe learned otherwise.\n\nHe was told he'd have to pay to have Comcast service extended from the nearest pole -- at $8 a foot, a total of \"just over $2,500,\" he wrote. And no, he could not hire somebody else to do the job.\n\nWhat about DSL? AT&T's could go no faster than 6 million bits per second, but its reps disagreed over whether the lines to his house allowed even that.\n\nAfter I asked Comcast PR to look into Moe's case, the picture initially got worse. The Philadelphia cable giant sent technicians to his house and reported that he'd actually need \"1,200 feet of new extension and over 300 feet of aerial cable to service your home.\"\n\nThe revised deal he was then offered: commit upfront to two years of a higher-than-usual level of service, and Comcast would cover the cost of extending the line.\n\n(I'd share numbers, but these negotiations took place with USA TODAY's thumb on the scale; your results without that influence may vary.)\n\nMeanwhile, Moe's separate conversations with AT&T had yielded a backup option: A technician extended the line to his house at no charge. But again, 6 Mbps DSL rates as slow broadband.\n\nIf you find yourself in a situation like this, the first thing you should do is read the cable company's local franchise agreement. (It may be posted on your city or county's site, or you may need to call to have a copy sent to you.) This sets out how it must extend service to an unserved residence -- and each one varies, said Comcast spokesman Charlie Douglas.\n\nIn Knox County, Tennessee, Comcast can charge a \"premium\" rate to bridge gaps greater than 350 feet -- although if 10 potential subscribers all within 1,000 feet of part of its system request service, it should connect them at no cost. It remains unclear whether Moe's first estimate complied with that provision.\n\nYou should also talk to whoever in your local government oversees this agreement. Your bargaining position usually improves if it's not you alone against a telecom conglomerate.\n\nBut the most important thing you can do to avoid getting stuck in a bandwidth-deprived state is to verify upfront that a potential future home has high-speed Internet access.\n\nChecking at a cable or phone company's site may not suffice, and a lack of broadband has yet to rise of the status of, say, lead paint as a hazard that real-estate agents must disclose to sellers. Instead, get confirmation from current occupants that they don't have to sip the Internet through a dial-up straw.\n\nTip: A second opinion on your Internet connection's speed\n\nFor years, I've been recommending the Speedtest.net site and its mobile apps to check an Internet provider's performance. And for most purposes, Seattle-based Ookla's tools work fine, quickly estimating ping times (a measure of responsiveness) and download and upload speeds.\n\nBut Speedtest.net also goes heavy on the ads and gets confused by extremely fast services: At a Google Fiber exhibit at SXSW in Austin two weeks ago, the site clocked that billion-bits-per-second connection at a low fraction of its speed, just as I saw it underestimate gigabit fiber in Sonoma County, Calif., three years ago.\n\nAnd even on slower connections, a second opinion can enlighten.\n\nFortunately, my traditional fallback option -- the Network Diagnostic Test from Measurement Lab, a project of the New America Foundation, Google and others -- no longer demands the security risk of running Java in your browser. Like Speedtest.net, \"NDT\" now only requires Adobe's Flash plug-in. (It's also available as an Android app.)\n\nOn my own FiOS connection, no news was good news: M-Lab reported only slightly slower figures than Speedtest.net.\n\nRob Pegoraro is a tech writer based out of Washington, D.C.

It's expensive, unreliable, slow.\n\nThe electric company creates \"fast lanes\" for your competitors — big corporations — that pay to get electricity first and fastest. Their customers can reach them faster than your customers reach you.\n\nThat would make it really tough to launch a new company and succeed, right? It would mean your small business would be at a big disadvantage.\n\nAnd it would significantly inhibit innovation.\n\nNow, substitute \"the Internet\" for \"electricity,\" and that's exactly what's happening in America.\n\nIn many cities across the USA, business and residential customers have only two choices for high-speed data transmission: one cable company and one DSL provider. These providers have few incentives or requirements to develop the next generation of communication networks and keep costs down.\n\nYou feel this every time you open your cable bill. But this is about more than how much you pay to get The Big Bang Theory.\n\n\"America led the world in the first generation of Internet application development, but it won't for the second,\" said Susan Crawford, Harvard law professor and author of Captive Audience: The Telecom Industry and Monopoly Power in the New Gilded Age.\n\nThe United States ranks near the bottom of developed countries, 31 of 34, in the affordability of broadband access — behind countries like Slovakia and Poland.\n\n\"My eyes have been opened by recent trips to Stockholm and Seoul,\" Crawford said. \"You have to experience in person what it's like to take unlimited, friction-less communication capacity for granted.\"\n\nYou don't have to travel to Sweden or South Korea. Just catch a plane to Chattanooga, Tenn.\n\nCity leaders developed their own high-speed fiber optic network, referred to as \"The Gig,\" that the city's electric utility company, EPB Fiber Optics, runs. The move is helping create jobs, launch new companies and spur innovation.\n\n\"I'm a radiologist. We look at medical images to help doctors make diagnoses,\" said Dr. Jim Busch, president of Diagnostic Radiology Consultants in Chattanooga. Medical images, such as MRIs and mammograms, create very large digital files.\n\n\"It's extremely dependent on network and bandwidth,\" Busch said. \"I was in Boston when we made the transition (from analog to digital scans). It was unbelievably expensive to get high-speed bandwidth. …You can get a gigabit here for hundreds of dollars, compared to in Boston, where a T3 line — about 200 times slower — costs about $15,000 a month.\" A gigabit for Chattanooga homes costs $70.\n\n\"It was a no brainer\" to move to Chattanooga, he said. \"I would not have done this in another location.\"\n\nThe average U.S. broadband connection speed was 10 megabits per second in the fourth quarter of 2013, according to Akamai's State of the Internet report. In Chattanooga, you can get 1,000 Mbps at home or work.\n\nGig-related recruitment efforts and an enlivened entrepreneural cultural locally have resulted in the creation of about 1,000 jobs, said J. Ed Marston, vice president of the Chattanooga Chamber of Commerce.\n\n\"I was tenured faculty at the University of Minnesota. I had no reason to move,\" said Dr. Ashish Gupta, associate professor of analytics and information systems at University of Tennessee at Chattanooga. Gupta relocated to this southeast Tennessee of about 170,000 residents in large part because of the high-speed, low-cost bandwidth.\n\nHe's about to launch his company, Mental Health Analytics, which crunches big data in the mental health field.\n\n\"In other places, there's huge limitations due to bandwidth,\" Gupta said. In Chattanooga, \"the cost of using the infrastructure is phenomenally cheap, so it makes accessibility and adoption of new technologies much faster.\"\n\nFor most of the rest of America, Internet-access costs are about to get even worse:\n\n• Comcast, the country's largest cable provider, wants to merge with Time-Warner, the second largest.\n\n• The Federal Communications Commission also is about to effectively gut the principal of \"net neutrality,\" that all data must be transmitted equally. Officials have proposed rules allowing some companies to purchase a \"fast lane\" for the Internet, meaning even less incentive to create high-speed networks for the rest of us.\n\nChattanooga shows the promise of city control of high-speed fiber networks. But telecom companies have pushed through legislation in about 20 states limiting municipalities' ability to create these critically necessary networks.\n\n\"The FCC is treating Internet access like a luxury product, not like a utility, allowing companies that offer it to discriminate and price that product however they like,\" Crawford said. \"This is not a right-left issue. Even rock-rib Republicans want to be able to start a business without worrying about what Comcast thinks of them.\"\n\nHigh-speed Internet in Chattanooga\n\nEPB Fiber Optics, Chattanooga's nonprofit electric utility, serves almost 170,000 residents in a 600-square-mile area that stretches beyond city limits into north Georgia and surrounding Tennessee counties. It completed its high-speed network for all customers in March 2011. The costs for residential customers:\n\n• 1 gigabit, i.e. 1,000 Mbps: $69.99 a month\n\n• 100 Mbps: $57.99 a month\n\nBusiness costs are higher because of higher volumes. Other plans are available that include TV and telephone.\n\nSource: EPB Fiber Optics\n\nRhonda Abrams is president of The Planning Shop and publisher of books for entrepreneurs.

Here's how it could impact ...", "text": "(CNN Business) Twenty years after 3G was first introduced in the United States, paving the way for a new generation of mobile apps, the network is officially being phased out.\n\nAT&T is set to pull the plug on its 3G network Tuesday, with other major US carriers expected to follow suit later this year. The move impacts everything from older phones to home alarm systems and roadside assistance systems.\n\nTo move its mobile customers over to 4G without service interruptions,, which owns CNN's parent company, has been providing free replacement phones to many users with a 3G device. It has also been attempting to alert customers to the network changes through various methods.\n\n\"For nearly two years, we've proactively sent numerous communications via direct mail, bill messaging, emails and text messages to help customers transition to next generation networks before 3G services end on February 22,\" AT&T told CNN Business in a statement.\n\nAT&T is shutting down its 3G networks as part of a greater effort to re-use the spectrum for 4G and 5G — newer standards that are more efficient than 3G.will do the same in the third quarter andwill do soby the end of the year.\n\nHere's what you should know about the 3G shutdown.\n\nWhat products will be impacted?\n\nThe shutdown will impact people still using 3G Kindles, 3G flip phones, the iPhone 5 and older models as well as various Android phones. It will also affect home alarm systems and medical devices such as fall detectors. Some in-car crash notification and roadside assistance systems like OnStar will need to be updated or replaced, too.\n\nIf you're not sure which network your phone is on, open Settings, tap Network and Internet, and then select Mobile Network on Android devices. On iOS, choose Settings, Cellular and then pick Cellular Data Options. AT&T also has a dedicated webpage to determine if your device will be impacted by the shut down.\n\nIt can be harder to tell with other everyday products. If you're not sure whether the device relies on 3G, you can call the manufacturer or car dealer.\n\nWhat can I do about it?\n\nFor those who don't want to get rid of their 3G mobile devices, there are some workarounds. In theory, it will be possible to access a web browser via Wi-Fi or make calls over wireless on a 3G phone if the user has an app enabling voice-over-internet protocol, such as Facebook Messenger. Similarly, people with a 3G e-reader will still be able to download new books on the device via Wi-Fi.\n\nOther 3G products may be more complicated. My Alarm Center, a home security systems business, has warned customers that certain alarm systems will need to be replaced by a technician to avoid potential disruptions. \"Even if your alarm appears to function, it will no longer communicate with our central service station to notify us that emergency services are needed,\" the company states on its website.\n\nGeneral Motors GM , which owns OnStar, started pushing over-the-air updates in October to vehicles released as far back as 2015, including models from Chevrolet, Buick and Cadillac, which may be impacted by the transition. As a general rule, most cars built in the last five years with connectivity are using 4G modems. If the car does run on 3G, the manufacturer may offer an upgrade program or the wireless carrier can provide an adapter with a modem that can be plugged into a vehicle.\n\nWhy is this happening?\n\nThe 3G network launched in 2002 and became the driving force behind the early App Store boom around the end of that decade. The wireless companies later moved on to 4G and more recently 5G networks.\n\nLast month, AT&T and Verizon turned on C-band 5G networks, an important set of higher radio frequencies that will supercharge the internet. The change will allow users to, for example, stream a Netflix movie in 4K resolution or download a movie in seconds. (Verizon said its C-band speeds reach nearly 1 gigabyte per second, about 10 times as fast as 4G LTE.)\n\nOnly a small portion of wireless customers are still using 3G networks. Verizon said in a blog post that 99% of its customers have already upgraded to 4G LTE or 5G, and AT&T said less than 1% of its mobile data traffic runs on 3G networks. T-Mobile did not respond to a request for comment about its 3G user base.", "authors": ["Samantha Murphy Kelly", "Cnn Business"], "publish_date": "2022/02/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sponsor-story/tmobile2022/2022/02/10/4-tricks-phone-scammers-using-2022-and-how-stop-them/6720737001/", "title": "4 tricks phone scammers are using in 2022 – and how to stop them", "text": "Cemile Kavountzis,\n\nfor T-Mobile\n\nWhether you’re about to sit down to dinner, catching up with an old friend or simply taking a well-deserved nap, an unwanted robocall always seems to disrupt your day at the most inconvenient time.\n\nBut unwanted robocalls and scams are more than just annoying interruptions; they can actually be dangerous. Last year, the volume of scam call attempts exploded to record highs. They were the top complaint reported to the FCC and Americans lost some $30 billion to these ploys.\n\nIf you’re concerned, or even just annoyed, you should be. There was a 116% increase in scam attempts last year alone, according to new network data reported by T-Mobile, and the bombardment of calls is set to soon pass pre-pandemic levels.\n\nDespite efforts across the wireless industry, the tactics used by bad actors around the globe have become more aggressive over time and even more deceptive in their efforts to appear legitimate. Scammers are relentless – and they are not going to stop as long as they keep making money.\n\nAt the end of 2021, T-Mobile released its first-ever Scam and Robocall Report, which identified trends across the country, insights into scammer behavior and ways the company responded. T-Mobile’s Scam Shield technology, for example, identified or blocked more than 21 billion scam calls for their customers in 2021 – more than double the number of calls in 2020. That’s roughly the equivalent of 700 spam calls every second.\n\n“We are protecting every single customer with the free scam-fighting tools in Scam Shield, regardless of their plan or device,” said Jon Freier, president of T-Mobile’s Consumer Group, in a statement on the company’s website. “We know that scammers won’t stop as long as they continue to be successful, so we are doing everything we can to make their job as hard as possible.”\n\nThe T-Mobile report also shared some of the most common phone scams and ways to protect your information.\n\n1. ‘Neighborhood’ calls\n\nOne location-based trick scammers use is called neighbor or neighborhood spoofing, in which they disguise their number to appear as if it is coming from a local number, using a similar area code or prefix to your number.\n\nT-Mobile’s Scam and Robocall Report found certain areas of the country are more heavily targeted by scam calls than other parts. The states with the highest volume of scam call attempts in 2021 were Texas, Florida, Arizona and Georgia. Among those, Dallas/Fort Worth was the top metro area for receiving scam calls.\n\nTo help stop neighborhood spoofing, last year companies across the wireless industry implemented number verification powered by STIR/SHAKEN. T-Mobile was the first to implement number verification for customers and T-Mobile, Sprint and Metro by T-Mobile customers with an eligible device will get a checkmark to confirm the phone number displayed on your phone is the actual number calling and hasn’t been spoofed by a scammer.\n\n2. Legitimate businesses scams: fake auto warranties\n\nOne of the biggest concerns heading in to 2022 is scammers posing as legitimate businesses. If you’ve gotten a call from someone regarding your car’s warranty, you’re already familiar with this one. In 2021, the top scam was fake auto warranties, making up 51% of all scam call attempts.\n\nOther common fraudulent calls were from individuals pretending to represent car insurance companies (6%), social security (10%), wireless providers (9%) and package delivery (4%).\n\nWhat is particularly concerning about scams like the auto warranty scam is the caller may already have some personal details about your car or warranty. These calls often start with a robocall instructing you to press a number and stay on the line.\n\nTo help screen these calls, you can use tools such as Caller ID combined with number verification or use your wireless provider’s scam identification tools. As part of Scam Shield protections, T-Mobile gives free Caller ID to every customer. And when a scam threat is detected, customers automatically receive a “Scam Likely” warning on their Caller ID display. They can then decide if they want to answer the call or not.\n\nEven if you decide to answer a likely scam call, to protect yourself from any suspected fraudulent business calls, your best bet is to hang up and call the company back directly by looking up their customer service contact information on the Internet.\n\n3. Time of year: tax season and health care scams\n\nScammers are savvy and will capitalize on seasonal events to ramp up call attempts. With tax season coming up, phone scammers will often prey on people’s anxiety surrounding their taxes.\n\nTo keep yourself protected, know that generally, the IRS will first mail a bill to any taxpayer who owes taxes. They also won’t call about an unexpected tax refund. If you receive a call requesting immediate payment in the form of gift cards, threatening to bring in law enforcement for unpaid bills, or demanding payment without a bill or opportunity to question the amount, stay alert – it’s likely a scam.\n\nSimilarly, scam calls relating to health care spiked during open enrollment for health insurance and Medicare in late fall and winter. The FCC issued a $225 million fine – the largest in its history – in 2021 to a Texas-based telemarketer for robocalls falsely claiming to represent major health insurance companies.\n\nAlong with a seasonal ramping up, another method scammers use to appear above board is keeping regular business hours Monday to Friday with peak volume on Wednesdays. T-Mobile’s report found spam call volume drops by as much as 85% on weekends.\n\nTo keep yourself protected against the newest seasonal threats, you’ll want software that is updated regularly. T-Mobile claims that its scam protections are updated every 6 minutes, every day, all day. And unlike apps from third-parties, T-Mobile’s Scam Shield sits within the network, so it uses AI, machine learning and patented technology to update against new threats in real time.\n\n4. Technical support calls\n\nAnother avenue scammers use to weasel their way in is fake technical support calls. These calls can result in cyber criminals getting access to your data or planting malicious code on your phone or computer.\n\nFake technical support calls will often begin with the scammer saying they’re with a well-known company and that an issue has been detected with your device. From there, they’ll walk you through various steps to “fix” your phone or computer. Don’t be fooled – scammers who pull this trick will be attempting to download dangerous software used to obtain your data.\n\nT-Mobile warns that every wireless customer should use some form of scam protection to help prevent these calls getting through. Fortunately, in addition to “Scam Likely” warnings, T-Mobile’s Scam Shield also includes Scam Block, which once activated, blocks all “Scam Likely” calls before they ever reach your phone, giving you the peace and quiet you deserve. If you are a T-Mobile customer, you can download the Scam Shield app for free in your device’s app store.\n\nAs long as scammers are still able to make money off unsuspecting victims, their tactics will keep evolving. Thankfully, the technology used to protect people from these cyber criminals will continue to advance, as well – that’s why it’s crucial to utilize scam protection software to protect yourself.\n\nTo learn more about T-Mobile or view the 2021 Scam and Robocall Report, visit https://www.t-mobile.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/02/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/10/success/tax-returns-irs-feseries/index.html", "title": "File tax returns for 2021 starting January 24 - CNN", "text": "The IRS said Monday it would start accepting 2021 federal tax returns on Monday, January 24.\n\nThe tax filing deadline this year is Monday, April 18.

Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that legalized the procedure nationwide. For many of those women, employers' benefit packages may be the only way they can soon afford a legal abortion.\n\nAmazon became the latest corporation to cover employees' travel costs to seek abortion care. The company told staff it would pay up to $4,000 in travel expenses annually for medical treatments including abortions, according to a message seen by Reuters. An Amazon spokesperson confirmed the nature of the Reuters report to CNN Business.\n\nThe company's announcement echoes similar moves by Citigroup, Yelp, Uber and Lyft to help employees bypass Republican-led efforts in several states to effectively ban abortion. And it comes just hours after a bombshell report by Politico indicated the Supreme Court is prepared to overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\nCNN has not independently confirmed the Politico report, and a Supreme Court spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nIf Roe is overturned, legislatures in 26 states have pending laws indicating that they intend to ban abortions, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights. That could leave many women in need of abortion services hundreds or thousands of miles away from access to the procedure — unaffordable for many.\n\nCorporate America is increasingly being drawn from the political sidelines on the abortion issue in response to pressure from investors, customers and employees. Companies are also struggling to attract and retain talent and worry about the impact these states' anti-abortion laws could have on their workers.\n\nExecutives are also learning how difficult it can be to craft a political message without angering one side or the other. Disney, notably, is grappling with the political fallout of coming out against Florida's so-called Don't Say Gay law. CEO Bob Chapek initially failed to condemn the legislation before backtracking and apologizing to staff and fans who were outraged by the legislation. After Disney publicly opposed the law and vowed to help repeal it, lawmakers in the state passed legislation to dissolve the company's longstanding status as a self-governing special district.\n\nLast year, as several states pushed legislation that would make it harder for some citizens to vote, hundreds of leading executives from companies including Amazon, Google, BlackRock and Starbucks signed a statement opposing the bills.\n\nHere are some of the most prominent companies offering expanded assistance to staff in states curtailing abortion care.\n\nAmazon\n\nThe nation's second-largest private employer said it would cover up to $4,000 per year in travel expenses for staff members seeking non-life-threatening medical care, including abortions, if care isn't available within 100 miles of where they live.\n\nTesla\n\nThe electric vehicle maker said in its 2021 impact report that it will help provide travel and lodging \"for those who may need to seek healthcare services that are unavailable in their home state\" as part of its expanded Safety Net program and health insurance offering. Tesla's headquarters moved to Texas in 2021, a state that has banned abortions after six weeks.\n\nCitigroup\n\nCitigroup in March became one of the largest US companies to commit to covering employees' travel costs if they need to leave their state to seek an abortion.\n\n\"In response to changes in reproductive healthcare laws in certain states in the US, beginning in 2022 we provide travel benefits to facilitate access to adequate resources,\" Citi said in a letter to shareholders as part of its annual proxy statement.\n\nBumble\n\nThe dating app company, which is based in Austin, Texas, in September created a fund \"supporting the reproductive rights of women and people across the gender spectrum who seek abortions in Texas.\"\n\n\"Bumble is women-founded and women-led, and from day one we've stood up for the most vulnerable. We'll keep fighting against regressive laws like #SB8,\" the company said on Twitter the week the legislation, which amounts to a near total ban on abortions in the state , went into effect last fall.\n\nRelief funds will go to organizations that support women's reproductive rights, including Fund Texas Choice, according to Bumble.\n\nLevi Strauss\n\nThe clothing company called protecting access to reproductive care a critical business issue.\n\n\"Efforts to further restrict or criminalize that access would have far-reaching consequences for the American workforce,\" the company told CNN Business in a statement. \"Given what is at stake, business leaders need to make their voices heard and act to protect the health and well-being of our employees. That means protecting reproductive rights.\"\n\nUnder Levi's benefits plan, employees can be reimbursed for travel expenses for services not available in their home state, including abortion. Part-time staff and others who aren't included in the company's benefits plan are also eligible for reimbursement, it said.\n\nLyft & Uber\n\nThe ride-sharing rivals each announced in September that they would create legal defense funds to protect any drivers who might be sued under the Texas law for driving a person who receives an abortion.\n\nThe law's wording leaves open the possibility that a driver could be sued, possibly even if they didn't know an abortion was happening, according to Elizabeth Sepper, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nLyft also said it would donate $1 million to Planned Parenthood \"to ensure that transportation is never a barrier to healthcare access.\"\n\nMatch Group\n\nThe Dallas-based company that owns Match.com and several dating apps including Tinder, OkCupid and Hinge, also announced in September a fund to ensure its employees and their dependents would be able to seek reproductive care outside of Texas.\n\n\"The company generally does not take political stands unless it is relevant to our business,\" said CEO Shar Dubey in a memo at the time. \"But in this instance, I personally, as a woman in Texas, could not keep silent.\"\n\nSalesforce\n\nSalesforce announced in September that it would assist its employees and their families if they want to leave Texas after the state passed the nation's most restrictive abortion law.\n\nThe cloud computing company told its 56,000 employees that they \"stand with all of our women at Salesforce and everywhere.\"\n\nSalesforce CEO Marc Benioff tweeted at the time: \"Ohana if you want to move we'll help you exit TX. Your choice.\" (\"Ohana\" is the Hawaiian word for \"family.\")\n\nYelp\n\nA representative for the San Francisco-based company said its employee health insurance already covers abortion care, but starting in May, Yelp will cover travel expenses for any US employees and their dependents who need to travel out of state to access abortion care.\n\nThe benefit extends to staff and dependents affected by any current or future restrictions on reproductive rights.\n\nAs a remote-first company with a distributed workforce, \"it's a priority for us to offer our employees consistent healthcare coverage, regardless of where they live,\" a representative said.\n\nStarbucks\n\nStarbucks' healthcare plan is offering reimbursement for travel for abortion or gender-affirming procedures when those are not available within 100 miles of an employee's home. Dependents who use Starbucks' medical plan are also eligible for these benefits.\n\n\"Regardless of what the Supreme Court ends up deciding, we will always ensure our partners have access to quality healthcare,\" wrote Sara Kelly, acting EVP of Partner Resources at the company, in a May 16 letter.\n\nKelly added that the company's benefits team is working on details of the new benefit, including timing.\n\n— CNN Business' Catherine Thorbecke, Ramishah Maruf, Charles Riley and David Goldman contributed reporting.", "authors": ["Allison Morrow", "Cnn Business"], "publish_date": "2022/05/03"}]}

The Democrat defeated Sarah Palin in Alaska's special election\n\nHow Twitter edit button will work\n\nUsers can edit their tweet a number of times within a 30-minute window after it is first posted. Tweets that have been edited will be easily identified by an icon, time stamp and label, Twitter said. Tapping the label will allow users to see previous versions of the tweet.\n\nTwitter said the time limit and version history components were crucial to “help protect the integrity of the conversation and create a publicly accessible record of what was said.”\n\nThe company said it would track any “misuse” of the feature in its rollout.\n\nThe edit feature saw increased buzz amid Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s doomed deal to acquire Twitter. He had been an advocate for an edit function.\n\nTwitter first announced the feature was forthcoming in April.\n\nMusk-Twitter battle:Elon Musk unloads almost $7 billion in Tesla stock as he prepares for Twitter court battle\n\nTrump's Truth Social: Twitter competitor not approved for Google Play store over content moderation concerns\n\nContributing: Terry Collins, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2022/02/04/twitter-downvote-button-replies/6670356001/", "title": "Twitter's new downvote feature is nothing like Reddit, YouTube ...", "text": "Select Twitter users found a new feature upon opening up the app Friday: a downvote button, available only to some as Twitter tests the feature on a global scale.\n\nTwitter isn’t the first social platform to embrace a downvote button – Reddit and YouTube each sport the feature in different forms. But the addition sparked debate Friday as users weighed in on the measure.\n\nThe downvote button is still in testing, and its limited unveiling Friday came as a surprise to many users selected to try out the feature, who tweeted about their confusion. Twitter announced the rollout from the Twitter Support account Thursday, specifying it would be available on web and soon on Android and iOS.\n\nThe downvote option was tested earlier in June 2021 with some iOS users, though this new, wider rollout doesn’t appear to show an upvote button in place of the usual like button. Still, some users found the change to be reminiscent of Reddit.\n\nHow Twitter's downvote button works\n\nUnlike on Reddit, Twitter does not show downvotes or downvote proportions on posts, nor do they factor into the overall likes, or for Reddit, upvotes, on the post. Google-owned YouTube, another major platform with a dislike button, made the number of dislikes on videos private in 2021. The dislike button remains, though the company said in a blog post from November that its decision had reduced targeted dislike attacking behavior. The major difference in YouTube's approach is creators can see exact dislike counts for videos.\n\nIf you have access to the new feature while in testing, you should see a notification from Twitter when you open the website or app. The downvote button will appear as a downward-facing arrow to the right of the heart-shaped like button.\n\nHere’s an example of the kind of tweet Twitter sees as downvote-worthy, based on its examples sent Thursday: An original tweet asks “Does anyone have restaurant recommendations for New York City? I’m going for the first time and I’m overwhelmed.” A downvoted reply to this tweet reads “The city is overrated. Not worth the traffic.”\n\nMany were quick to criticize the fact that the downvote option is currently only for replies, while others found its position frustrating.\n\nThe notification introducing users to reply downvotes explains a few aspects of the feature: downvotes aren’t public, nor will they be shared with the tweet’s author or others on the timeline. Twitter describes the button’s purpose as meant to let the platform know when a reply “isn’t adding to the conversation.” Under the heading “help us make Twitter better,” the company says downvote feedback will help the platform prioritize higher quality content.\n\nThumbs up or down on Twitter downvoting\n\nNot everyone is convinced the feature will be used as intended, with some users pointing to the potential that mass downvoting might silence marginalized groups such as transgender people. Others had sarcastic responses to this new step in the platform's ongoing battle against online hate speech, which has repeatedly flared up as a point of criticism for Twitter in particular.\n\nIn a short thread Thursday, Twitter Safety shared information on why people clicked the downvote arrow, reporting that most users found the reply in question offensive, irrelevant or both. The platform claims downvoting will help to customize one’s timeline and avoid showing similar content in the future, though it’s not clear what methods will be used to do so.\n\nWhat else is new on Twitter\n\nThe downvote wasn’t Twitter’s only rollout this week. On Wednesday, the platform announced all web and Android users globally would be able to add one-time warnings to photos and video, along with some iOS users. Some iOS users will now see a DM icon on tweets to help them reply directly to the author. And in Brazil, Twitter introduced an experimental feature prompting users to reconsider replies using harmful language, Twitter Safety announced.

The test will first roll out to Twitter Blue subscribers in New Zealand, with Australia, Canada and the US to follow, according to the company. Users outside the test group will also be able to see edited tweets on the platform.\n\nTwitter said in April that it had been testing an edit feature for a year, and that it would be available to Twitter Blue subscribers within months. The announcement came the same day the company announced that it would add Elon Musk to its board, and after he polled his followers about whether they’d like an edit button on the platform. When it confirmed the edit feature was in the works, Twitter also said, “no, we didn’t get the idea from a poll.”\n\n(Musk later pulled out of the board seat offer, agreed to buy Twitter outright, moved to terminate the acquisition deal and now is fighting a lawsuit from Twitter that seeks to compel him to follow through with the deal.)\n\nAlthough many people have for years been calling on Twitter to add an edit button — which rivals like Facebook and Instagram offer — others have raised concerns about the potential implications of such a feature.

After that, Twitter's fee will increase to up to 20% on future earnings.\n\n\"We’re working on ways for the people driving those conversations to earn money from audience support and engage their followers in a new way – features that will enable people to directly support creators through tipping and allow people to pay for access to exclusive live audio experiences with Ticketed Spaces and other exclusive content available via monthly subscription through Super Follows,\" Twitter said in its shareholders' letter.\n\nSegal reinforced that notion during a call with investors on Thursday. \"We’re helping creators build and nurture and grow their follower base so they will continue to create great free content, and great paid content,\" Segal said.\n\nWhy Fleets failed\n\nBut last week after only seven months in operation, Twitter said that it is ending its Fleets feature, where users can share text, photos and videos that disappear in 24 hours, similar to rival Snapchat, due to the lack of new user engagement, on Aug. 3.\n\nIn a rare moment of admitting defeat, Kayvon Beykpour, Twitter's consumer product head, tweeted last week that \"If we’re not having to wind down features every once in a while, then it would be a sign that we’re not taking big enough swings.\"\n\nDorsey echoed a similar sentiment about Fleets during Twitter's investors' call Thursday. He said Fleets \"caused a little bit of confusion\" with users on how to use it.\n\nInstead of keeping a failing product around for years, Dorsey said it's better to shut it down and retool to make it something that's more \"unique to Twitter so it will help grow our ecosystem instead of playing catch up.\"\n\nIlya Brown, Twitter's head of product said last week that Twitter will conduct tests to try incorporating features from the Fleets composer including \"the full-screen camera, text formatting options, and GIF stickers,\" into Twitter's product.\n\nIs downvoting coming to Twitter?\n\nThis week, Twitter announced it is in the early stages of testing a dislike/downvote button for some users on Apple's iOS. \"We're testing this to understand the types of replies you find relevant in a convo, so we can work on ways to show more of them.

Users now have three options to choose who can reply to their tweets: everyone, only people they follow, or only people they mention in a tweet.\n\nTweets with limited replying are labeled and the reply icon is grayed out for users who can’t reply, yet they still can view, retweet, retweet with a comment, share, and like those tweets.\n\nTo be sure, Twitter is aware that while the updated prompts feature may not entirely bring about the end of mean tweets (from trash-talking, say, between sports fans to the frequent bullying and harassment that occurs on the platform), the experiment shows that, if prompted, some users might reconsider what they say when composing that next tweet.\n\nThe prompts feature is being rolled out now to iOS and Android users with English language settings enabled.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/05/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2021/06/22/twitter-super-follows-and-ticketed-spaces-features/5301847001/", "title": "Twitter wants you to test two of its new features, Super Follows and ...", "text": "Help wanted: Twitter needs a few good users in the U.S. to test two of its newest features where they can make money, Super Follows and Ticketed Spaces, and freely give their feedback.\n\nIn a publicly open declaration for user engagement, the social media company announced Tuesday that users can apply to try Super Follows and Ticketed Spaces on their mobile devices to tell them what is or isn't working.\n\n\"We’re looking for a small group of people to be the first to try Ticketed Spaces and Super Follows with their audiences and share feedback,\" said Twitter in a blog post. \"Help us test and improve these experiences before they launch more broadly in the coming months.\"\n\nBig tech battle for creators:Facebook taunts Apple: Social network won't take a cut on creators' revenue until 2023\n\nBroadband barriers:Electricity transformed rural America nearly a century ago.

That represents a 38% premium over the closing price on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed that he had become Twitter's biggest shareholder , and an 18% premium over its closing price Wednesday.\n\nMusk said the cash offer was his \"best and final offer,\" according to the SEC filing, adding that if it's not accepted he would have to reconsider his position as a shareholder.\n\nThe Tesla CEO sent an offer letter to the company Wednesday night, according to the filing.\n\n\"I invested in Twitter as I believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe, and I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy,\" he said in the letter to Twitter. \"However, since making my investment I now realize the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form. Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company.\"\n\nThe letter was addressed to Bret Taylor, the chair of the Twitter board, not CEO Parag Agrawal, who assumed that title last fall. It concludes: \"Twitter has extraordinary potential. I will unlock it.\"\n\nTwitter issued a statement Thursday confirming that it had received the offer. The company said its board would carefully review the proposal \"to determine the course of action that it believes is in the best interest of the company and all Twitter stockholders.\" Twitter declined to comment as to when its board would meet to discuss the offer.\n\nTwitter TWTR Shares ofshot up as much as 13% in premarket trading on the offer Thursday, but soon retreated and were trading up about 5% at the market open. They were little changed at midday and slipped into negative territory, suggesting that investors had doubts the offer will be accepted.\n\nBut it will be difficult for Twitter to reject Musk's bid at the price he is offering, said Dan Ives, tech analyst with Wedbush Securities.\n\n\"Musk is putting the Twitter board's backs against the wall,\" Ives said. \"The premium is at a level that will be hard to see other bids occurring.\"\n\nBut to get a return on a bid this high, Twitter would need to do more to bring in subscriber revenue and cut costs, Ives said. Musk's commitment to use the company to promote greater free speech doesn't do much, if anything, to increase its profitability, Ives said.\n\n\"Musk making this about free speech is the exact opposite of what every other corporate raider would do about monetizing the company's value,\" he added. \"It's historic and bizarre at the same time.\"\n\nMusk has 81.6 million Twitter followers, far more than any other other CEO, and is a much more prolific tweeter than the handful of celebrities who have even more followers than he does.\n\nMusk a frequent critic of Twitter\n\nWhile other critics of Twitter complain the social media platform has not done enough to control the spread of misinformation , Musk has expressed more concern about efforts to limit what users are allowed to tweet. Last month he said he was giving \" serious thought \" to creating a new social media platform.\n\n\"Given that Twitter serves as the de facto public town square, failing to adhere to free speech principles fundamentally undermines democracy,\" Musk tweeted last month. \"What should be done?\"\n\nLast week, Musk disclosed he had been buying shares of Twitter since late January, and that he had spent $2.6 billion to accumulate 73.1 million shares, which at the time represented a 9.1% stake, according to what the company had disclosed at that point about the number of shares that are held by investors.\n\nIn February, Twitter announced a plan to repurchase $2 billion worth of shares in an effort to raise its stock price. It has since repurchased 37 million shares, according to a disclosure filing on Thursday, reducing the number of shares outstanding by that amount.\n\nThat reduction in total shares increased Musk's stake to 9.6% without him having to purchase even one additional share. And it reduced the total value of the company by $2 billion based on Musk's $54.20 offer price.\n\nAfter Musk's stock purchase disclosure, he initially accepted an offer of a seat on the board, an agreement that included a cap on his total investment in the company at 14.9%.\n\nBut just days later, on Sunday, Agrawal disclosed that Musk had decided not to join the board , thus removing that limit on his ownership.\n\nMusk's investment in Twitter, and the original announcement that he would take a position on its board of directors, stirred concerns among some employees who did not want to be associated with the often controversial executive.\n\nAgrawal sent a memo to employees Thursday announcing that there would be a company-wide meeting Thursday afternoon to \"discuss today's news and what's next.\"\n\n\"It's important that we all come together today as #OneTeam,\" he said in the brief notice of the meeting.\"\n\nMusk ha been unusually silent on his plans for Twitter in the days since he declined the spot on Twiter's board. He has yet to spell out the specifics of what changes he wants at the company.\n\n\"Right now there's more questions than answers as to his next step,\" said Ives.\n\nHow Musk could pay for his purchase\n\nMorgan Stanley MS Musk did not disclose how he intends to fund his purchase. He said he has hired Wall Street giantas his financial advisor for the transaction.\n\nAlthough Musk is the richest person on Earth, most of his $274 billion net worth is tied up in his holdings in the publicly-traded stock of Tesla and privately-held SpaceX, and he has been reluctant to sell shares of Tesla beyond what he needed to in order to pay taxes.\n\nTesla TSLA Shares ofslipped 3% in early trading Thursday, perhaps on fears that Musk would sell shares in order to raise cash, or that he could be distracted from his duties at Tesla by his latest interest in Twitter.\n\nJUST WATCHED Twitter responds to Elon Musk not joining its board Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Twitter responds to Elon Musk not joining its board 03:03\n\nIt's very possible that Musk won't need to sell Tesla shares and instead could use them as collateral to borrow the money he needs to buy Twitter, Ives said. Musk's Tesla shares are worth about $177 billion, even with the modest decline in premarket trading Thursday.\n\n\"Banks will be lining up to be part of the consortium of lenders to the world's richest person,\" said Ives.\n\nAnd even if he sold the number of Tesla shares he would need to buy all the outstanding shares of Twitter, Musk still would have a controlling stake in the company.\n\nIt's not clear if he would also try to be CEO of Twitter, especially since he is already CEO of both Tesla and SpaceX. But it's unlikely that Agrawal would continue as CEO, a role he assumed last November when Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey suddenly stepped down as CEO.\n\n\"I don't see Musk and Agarwal sharing any candle-lit dinners,\" said Ives\n\nMusk prefers privately-held companies\n\nVirgin Galactic SPCE Musk is not a fan of having his companies publicly traded. While other private space exploration companies such ashave gone public , SpaceX had remained privately held, despite speculation it is ripe for a public offering. And in August of 2018, he announced — on Twitter — that he was thinking of taking Tesla private , saying he thought that was its best path forward.\n\nMusk's tweet about taking Tesla private, in which he said he had \"funding secured\" for the offer when he did not, got him in trouble with the SEC. He eventually had to give up the position as chairman of Tesla, and agree to have his tweets with material information about Tesla reviewed by other executives at the company.\n\nTaking a company private, or keeping it private, reduces the oversight the watchdog agency has on its operations.\n\nThe price he suggested for Tesla at that time, $420 a share, was seen highlighting April 20, the unofficial holiday of marijuana enthusiasts. This time, Musk's $54.20 per share offer for Twitter also includes \"4.20.\"\n\n— Donie O'Sullivan, Brian Fung and Brian Stelter contributed to this article.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore", "Mark Thompson", "Cnn Business"], "publish_date": "2022/04/14"}]}

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nKennedy Space Center, Florida (CNN) The launch of NASA's historic Artemis I moon mission has been postponed after the team was unable to work through an issue with one of the rocket's four engines.\n\n\"It's too early to say what the options are,\" said Mike Sarafin, Artemis mission manager at a NASA press conference. \"We really need time to look at all the information, all the data. We're going to play all nine innings here. We're not ready to give up yet.\"\n\nThe next opportunity to send the Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft on their journey is September 2, but whether or not another attempt is made that day depends on how testing goes.\n\nSarafin confirmed that \"Friday is definitely in play\" if the team can resolve the issue while the rocket sits on the pad within the next 48 to 72 hours.\n\nThe next launch window is September 2, opening at 12:48 p.m. ET and closing at 2:48 p.m. ET. The next window after that is September 5, opening at 5:12 p.m. ET and closing at 6:42 p.m. ET.\n\n\"Launch controllers were continuing to evaluate why a bleed test to get the RS-25 engines on the bottom of the core stage to the proper temperature range for liftoff was not successful, and ran out of time in the two-hour launch window,\" according to an update from NASA. \"Engineers are continuing to gather additional data.\"\n\nThe launch team knew that the bleed test was a risk because they weren't able to include it in previous wet dress rehearsal tests simulating the launch, and Monday was the first time demonstrating that, Sarafin said.\n\nCurrently, the issue doesn't suggest an engine problem, but rather an issue within the bleed system that is used to cool the engine, he said.\n\n\"We need the engine to be at the cryogenically cool temperature such that when it starts, it's not shocked with all the cold fuel that flows through it. So we needed a little extra time to assess that,\" Sarafin said.\n\nThe team also saw an issue with the vent valve at the inner tank and the combination of issues convinced the team they needed more time, Sarafin said.\n\nIf a substantial fix is needed the team may require more time to address it and roll the rocket stack back into the Kennedy Space Center's Vehicle Assembly Building, a process that takes 3 1/2 days.\n\nThe launch team still needs to troubleshoot the engine issue and will keep the rocket in its current configuration to gather data and assess what needs to be done. Both the Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft remain stable, according to NASA officials.\n\nPrior to the scrub, the countdown was extended into an unplanned hold as the launch team worked on a troubleshooting plan for one of the rocket's four engines.\n\nThat's because the launch team discovered an issue with an engine bleed in engine #3. Attempts to reconfigure it were unsuccessful.\n\nDuring engine bleeds, hydrogen is cycled through the engine to condition it for launch. Three of the four engines are performing as expected, but engine #3 experienced an issue.\n\n\"There were also a series of weather issues throughout the launch window. We would have been a no-go for weather at the beginning of the window due to precipitation. Later on in the window, we would have been no-go for lightning within the launchpad area,\" Sarafin said.\n\nPreviously, 80% favorable weather conditions had been forecast for the beginning of the window, which opened at 8:33 a.m. ET, but the weather changed as that time inched closer.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, who traveled to Kennedy Space Center in Florida with second gentleman Doug Emhoff to watch the launch, underscored the United States' commitment to NASA's Artemis program in comments made after the postponement.\n\n\"While we hoped to see the launch of Artemis I today, the attempt provided valuable data as we test the most powerful rocket in history,\" Harris said via Twitter . \"Our commitment to the Artemis Program remains firm, and we will return to the moon.\"\n\nThe 322-foot-tall (98-meter-tall) stack is sitting on Launchpad 39B at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\n\nNASA Administrator Bill Nelson addressed the scrub shortly after it was announced, stressing that Artemis I is a test flight.\n\n\"We don't launch until it's right,\" Nelson said. \"They've got a problem with the gases going on the engine bleed on one engine. It's just illustrative that this is a very complicated machine, a very complicated system, and all those things have to work. You don't light the candle until it's ready to go.\"\n\nIt's something Nelson has personal experience with. As an astronaut, he was on the 24th flight of the Space Shuttle. It was scrubbed four times on the pad and the fifth try resulted in a flawless mission.\n\n\"Had we launched on any one of those scrubs, it wouldn't have been a good day,\" he said.\n\nSeveral issues cropped up after the rocket began fueling after midnight.\n\nOffshore storms with the potential for lightning prevented the team from beginning the fueling process, due to start at midnight, for about an hour.\n\nThe hold was lifted at 1:13 a.m. ET, and the tanking process began to load the rocket's core stage with supercold liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen.\n\nThe team stopped filling the tank with liquid hydrogen twice due to an initial leak as well as a pressure spike, but tanking resumed for the core stage and began for the upper stage, or the interim cryogenic propulsion stage.\n\nThe team also discovered a line of frost on the inner stage flange. At first, engineers thought the frost may indicate the presence of a crack in the tank, but it turned out to be a crack in the external foam. The team shared that the issue had been resolved since the foam crack did not indicate a leak.\n\nEngineers also experienced an 11-minute delay in communications between the Orion spacecraft and ground systems. The issue could have impacted the beginning of terminal count, or the countdown that begins when 10 minutes remain on the clock before liftoff. The team was able to work through the issue, which was the result of a simple misconfiguration.\n\nIn addition to the visit by Harris, appearances by celebrities like Jack Black, Chris Evans and Keke Palmer and performances of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" by Josh Groban and Herbie Hancock and \"America the Beautiful\" by The Philadelphia Orchestra and cellist Yo-Yo Ma were planned as part of the program.\n\nMission overview\n\nWhen Artemis I launches, Orion's journey will last 42 days as it travels to the moon, loops around it and returns to Earth -- traveling a total of 1.3 million miles (2.1 million kilometers). When it returns to Earth, the capsule will splash down in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of San Diego.\n\nWhile the passenger list doesn't include any humans, it does have passengers: three mannequins and a plush Snoopy toy will ride in Orion.\n\nThe crew aboard Artemis I may sound a little unusual, but they each serve a purpose. Snoopy will serve as the zero gravity indicator -- meaning that he will begin to float inside the capsule once it reaches the space environment.\n\nCameras inside and outside of Orion will share images and video throughout the mission, including live views from the Callisto experiment , which will capture a stream of Commander Moonikin Campos sitting in the commander's seat. If you have an Amazon Alexa-enabled device, you can ask it about the mission's location each day.\n\nExpect to see views of Earthrise, similar to what was shared during Apollo 8 for the first time, but with much better cameras and technology.\n\nScience experiments and technology demonstrations are riding in a ring on the rocket. The 10 small satellites, called CubeSats, will detach and go their separate ways to collect information on the moon and the deep space environment.\n\nThe inaugural mission of the Artemis program will kick off a phase of space exploration that lands diverse astronaut crews at previously unexplored regions of the moon and eventually delivers crewed missions to Mars.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/08/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/03/world/nasa-artemis-rehearsal-scrub-scn/index.html", "title": "NASA's Artemis I mega moon rocket test postponed - CNN", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe final, crucial prelaunch test of NASA’s Artemis I mission to the moon was halted Sunday due to issues that prevented the safe loading of propellants into the mega rocket.\n\nThe agency’s next opportunity to begin fueling the 322-foot-tall (98-meter-tall) Artemis I rocket stack, including NASA’s Space Launch System and Orion spacecraft, is on Monday.\n\n“We’ve fixed and we’ve reconfigured from where we were earlier today,” said Charlie Blackwell-Thompson, Artemis launch director, during a press conference Sunday. “Our team has met and has laid out our plan for how we get back to tanking tomorrow, so that is all worked out.”\n\nThe team is still troubleshooting the fan issue and is hoping to reach a solution this evening. If that goes according to plan, they will resume tanking the rocket at 7 a.m. ET Monday and begin the countdown around 2:40 p.m. ET.\n\nThe test, known as the wet dress rehearsal, began on Friday afternoon at 5 p.m. ET.\n\nThe wet dress rehearsal simulates every stage of launch without the rocket actually leaving the launchpad. This includes powering on the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft, loading supercold propellant into the rocket’s tanks, going through a full countdown simulating launch, resetting the countdown clock and draining the rocket tanks.\n\nOperations were stopped on Sunday before loading propellants into the core stage of the rocket “due to loss of ability to pressurize the mobile launcher,” according to an update shared by the agency.\n\nPrime and redundant supply fans for the mobile launcher weren’t working properly and each encountered different issues, Blackwell-Thompson said.\n\n“The fans are needed to provide positive pressure to the enclosed areas within the mobile launcher and keep out hazardous gases. Technicians are unable to safely proceed with loading the propellants into the rocket’s core stage and interim cryogenic propulsion stage without this capability.”\n\nThe fans ensure that gases don’t build up and cause fire hazards or an increase in hazards, Blackwell-Thompson said.\n\nPrior to this issue on Sunday afternoon, Artemis I weathered a powerful thunderstorm at Kennedy Space Center on Saturday.\n\nFour lightning strikes hit the lightning towers within the perimeter of Launchpad 39B. While the first three were low-intensity strikes to tower two, the fourth strike was much more intense and hit tower one.\n\nWhen these strikes occurred, the Orion spacecraft and SLS rocket core stage were powered up. The rocket’s interim cryogenic propulsion stage and boosters were not.\n\nThe fourth strike was fairly rare, because it was a positively charged cloud to ground strike and far stronger than the others, according to NASA’s weather experts.\n\nThe fourth lightning strike was “the strongest we have seen since we installed the new lightning protection system,” tweeted Jeremy Parsons, deputy manager of the exploration ground systems program at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center, who has been providing regular updates all weekend. “It hit the catenary wire that runs between the 3 towers. System performed extremely well & kept SLS and Orion safe. Glad we enhanced protection since Shuttle!”\n\nEach of the towers are topped with a fiberglass mast and series of overhead, or catenary, wires and conductors that help divert lightning strikes away from the rocket, Parsons explained. This new system provided more shielding than the one used during the Shuttle program. It also has an array of sensors that can determine the condition of the rocket after lightening strikes, preventing days of delays caused when teams have to assess the rocket.\n\n“We don’t believe that (fan issue) was related to the storm or to the lightning event,” Blackwell-Thompson said. “It continued to run normally during the storm activities. And then it was running this morning for several hours before it encountered a problem.”\n\nDespite the strikes and delays, team were prepared to carry on with the wet dress rehearsal Sunday until they encountered the tanking issue.\n\nParsons shared a reminder that this is the point of the wet dress rehearsal – working out the kinks of a new system before launch day.\n\n“A nice thing about this being a test, and not launching today, is that we have flexibility with the test window to work through first time issues,” Parsons tweeted.\n\n“We’re having a lot of new experiences as we set up for the Artemis I mission in particular,” said Mike Sarafin, Artemis mission manager, during the press conference. “And one of the new experiences was literally watching a 32-story-tall rocket sit out there and have lightning strike around it with this lightning protection system. It did a perfect job of protecting the vehicle.”\n\n“The team is prepared for this, we just we just need to get through a few technical issues,” Sarafin added. “They’ve demonstrated incredible discipline and toughness, and I’m confident we’re going to get there soon.”\n\nThe results of the wet dress rehearsal will determine when the uncrewed Artemis I will launch on a mission that goes beyond the moon and returns to Earth. This mission will kick off NASA’s Artemis program, which is expected to return humans to the moon and land the first woman and the first person of color on the lunar surface by 2025.\n\nWhat to expect next\n\nWhen the wet dress rehearsal resumes, it will involve loading the rocket with more than 700,000 gallons (3.2 million liters) of supercold propellant – the “wet” in wet dress rehearsal – and then the team will go through all the steps toward launch.\n\n“Some venting may be seen during tanking,” according to the agency, but that’s about it for visible action at the launchpad.\n\nThe Artemis I rocket stack can be seen at sunrise on March 23 at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Ben Smegelsky/NASA\n\nThe team members will count down to within a minute and 30 seconds before launch and pause to ensure they can hold launch for three minutes, resume and let the clock run down to 33 seconds, and then pause the countdown.\n\nThen, they will reset the clock to 10 minutes before launch, go through the countdown again and end at 9.3 seconds, just before ignition and launch would occur. This simulates what is called scrubbing a launch, or aborting a launch attempt, if weather or technical issues would prevent a safe liftoff.\n\nAt the end of the test, the team will drain the rocket’s propellant, just as it would during a real scrub.\n\nDepending on the outcome of the wet dress rehearsal, the uncrewed mission could launch in June or July.\n\nDuring the flight, the uncrewed Orion spacecraft will launch atop the SLS rocket to reach the moon and travel thousands of miles beyond it – farther than any spacecraft intended to carry humans has ever traveled. This mission is expected to last for a few weeks and will end with Orion splashing down in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nArtemis I will be the final proving ground for Orion before the spacecraft carries astronauts to the moon, 1,000 times farther from Earth than where the International Space Station is located.\n\nAfter the uncrewed Artemis I flight, Artemis II will be a crewed flyby of the moon, and Artemis III will return astronauts to the lunar surface. The time line for the subsequent mission launches depends on the results of the Artemis I mission.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/04/03"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/science-health/957786/artemis-1-behind-nasa-moon-to-mars-mission", "title": "Artemis 1: behind Nasa's 'Moon-to-Mars' mission | The Week UK", "text": "Nasa’s 50-year wait to send humans back to the Moon has been delayed after the US space agency was forced to call off the inaugural launch of the world’s most powerful rocket. The first mission in the Artemis programme, which aims to get humans back on the Moon for the first time in more than half a century, was “scrubbed” at the last minute after “a fraught eight hours which saw weather delays, a suspected crack in the thermal casing, a hydrogen leak and, finally, a fatal engine cooling problem”, said The Telegraph. “Just minutes after the lift-off window opened” on Monday morning, the decision was made to postpone the mission. Engineers are now working furiously to find a solution to the coolant issue, with hopes that the rescheduled launch can still go ahead this week. What is the Artemis mission? Named after the Greek goddess of the hunt, the Moon and chastity, the Artemis programme is Nasa’s attempt to return humans to the lunar surface – “but unlike Apollo, these missions are designed to keep us there”, said tech and science site Gizmodo. To that end, Nasa and its international partners are planning to build a lunar space station called Gateway, to support activities both on and around the Moon. It is hoped this will eventually serve as a springboard to send humans to Mars. Artemis 1 “represents a crucial turning point in NASA’s moon plans”, said CNBC. The 42-day mission involves the inaugural launch of the massive Space Launch System (SLS) mega-rocket, which will carry the unmanned Orion spacecraft beyond the Moon. “The 98-metre Space Launch System is the most powerful rocket NASA has ever built,” said Sky News, “and in this crucial testing phase it will fly further than any spacecraft built for humans: 40,000 miles past the far side of the moon and 280,000 miles from Earth.” Skip advert According to Nasa, each of its two boosters generates more thrust than 14 four-engine commercial airliners combined. “The purpose of Artemis 1 is to put vehicles and systems through their paces before putting astronauts aboard in 2024,” said The Times.\n\nFor Artemis 1, the Orion capsule, which can hold up to six astronauts, will carry just mannequins, including Commander Moonikin Campos, and a Snoopy soft toy to float around the cabin as a zero gravity indicator. Provided this initial test flight is a success, Artemis 2 will carry four as-yet-unnamed astronauts on an eight-to-ten day mission that includes a fly-by of the Moon. Artemis 3, planned for 2025, will finally land humans on the lunar surface, with Nasa saying the crew will include the first woman and person of colour. All 12 people to have landed on the Moon, between 1969 and 1972, have been white men from the US. What is the timeline? Nasa is not commenting publicly about the rescheduled Artemis 1 launch but it could be as soon as Friday or next Monday, weather permitting and provided engineers solve the engine cooling issue. “Launch opportunities are limited by the stage of the moon and lighting conditions upon re-entry, among other considerations,” reported Space.com, so if Nasa misses this window then the next launch attempt is likely to be in October. No firm timeline for the next stage of the project, which includes establishing a permanent base on the Moon followed by a manned mission to Mars, has been announced but it is not likely to get the go-ahead until the end of the decade or into the 2030s. Is it worth it? With the world in the midst of an energy and cost-of-living crisis, many are questioning the value of spending tens of billions of dollars on sending a handful of people into space. It is estimated that US taxpayers will end up paying $93bn to fund the Artemis programme, with Florida Today arguing that the giant SLS “stands at risk of going down as one of the biggest boondoggles in spaceflight history if Nasa can’t find a way to control costs”. The Observer said in an editorial: “It is a colossal investment and there are nagging doubts that it is justified at a time when private space companies, such as Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin and Elon Musk’s SpaceX, are developing giant reusable rockets that could slash deep-space mission cost.” Skip advert Others have suggested it would be more cost-efficient to send robots into space in place of humans, seeing as they require no life-support system and do not need to be brought home.

Space correspondent Kristin Fisher will bring us moment-by-moment reporting from the launch, along with a team of experts.\n\nAlmost 50 years after the last Apollo mission ventured to the lunar surface, NASA has established a program that promises to land humans on unexplored lunar regions and eventually the surface of Mars -- and it all begins with Artemis I.\n\nIt's no coincidence that the Artemis program is named for the twin sister of Apollo from Greek mythology. Artemis will pick up where the famed Apollo program left off in 1972 by sending crewed missions to the moon, but in a new way.\n\nGoals of the Artemis program include landing diverse crews of astronauts on the moon and exploring the shadowy lunar south pole for the first time. The ambitious effort also aims to establish a sustained presence on the moon and create reusable systems that can enable human exploration of Mars and perhaps beyond.\n\nBut none of this is possible without first taking one big leap. When Artemis I launches on September 3, the uncrewed mission will test every new component that will make future deep space exploration possible before humans make the journey in 2024 and 2025 aboard Artemis II and Artemis III, respectively.\n\nThe mission team expects liftoff of the new Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft on Saturday from Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\n\nAfter launching from Earth, Artemis I will go on a 37-day mission. During the journey, the Orion spacecraft will travel 40,000 miles (64,000 kilometers) beyond the moon -- 30,000 miles (48,000 kilometers) farther than the record set during Apollo 13. This path mimics the journey that the Artemis II crew will take in 2024.\n\nIt will be the farthest that any spacecraft built for humans has flown, according to NASA officials.\n\nHistoric launchpad 39B is no stranger to monster rockets, as NASA Administrator Bill Nelson pointed out at a news conference earlier in August. It was once the home of the Saturn V rocket, which carried the Apollo missions to the moon and lifted off with 7.6 million pounds of thrust. The SLS rocket will punch off the pad with 8.8 million pounds of thrust.\n\n\"As we embark on the first Artemis test flight, we recall this agency's storied past, but our eyes are focused not on the immediate future but out there,\" Nelson said.\n\n\"It's a future where NASA will land the first woman and the first person of color on the moon. And on these increasingly complex missions, astronauts will live and work in deep space and we'll develop the science and technology to send the first humans to Mars.\"\n\nA new generation of exploration\n\nReturning to the moon, with an eye on an eventual trip to Mars, requires a new ride.\n\nLessons learned from the Apollo and shuttle programs informed the design of the Space Launch System rocket, the world's most powerful rocket. The mega moon rocket will propel the spacecraft almost 1,000 times farther than the International Space Station's location in low-Earth orbit. The SLS rocket will boost Orion to a speed of 22,600 miles per hour (36,370 kilometers per hour) to escape Earth's gravity and reach the moon.\n\n\"It's the only rocket that's capable of sending Orion and a crew and supplies into deep space on a single launch,\" said John Honeycutt, Space Launch System program manager at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama.\n\nAtop the rocket is the Orion spacecraft, designed to carry a crew through deep space and safely return the astronauts to Earth.\n\nThe spacecraft has a crew module, a service module and a launch abort system that has the capability to take the spacecraft and its crew to safety during any emergency that could occur during launch or ascent. Orion's trajectory through space will test the craft's ability to maintain communication with Earth beyond the moon and protect its crew from radiation.\n\nBeneath Orion is the European Service Module.\n\n\"It's the power house side of the vehicle where it's got the primary propulsion, power and life support resources we need for Artemis I,\" said Howard Hu, Orion program manager at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston.\n\nThe Orion spacecraft has hardware and software that will allow future crews to have complete insight into what's happening with their vehicle when they are thousands of miles from home, Hu said.\n\nOne of the biggest trials for Orion may be testing its heat shield, the largest one ever built.\n\nWhen the spacecraft returns to Earth in October, it will face temperatures half as hot as the sun's surface and hit the top of Earth's atmosphere at 25,000 miles per hour (40,200 kilometers per hour) -- that's 32 times the speed of sound, Nelson said.\n\n\"Orion will come home faster and hotter than any spacecraft has before at 32 Mach,\" Nelson said. \"On the space shuttle, we were at 25 Mach, which is about 17,500 miles an hour (28,160 kilometers per hour).\" (Mach 1 is the speed of sound.)\n\nThe heat shield has been tested on Earth, but returning from space is the one true test that simulations can't completely replicate.\n\n\"Re-entry will be great to demonstrate our heat shield capability, making sure that the spacecraft comes home safely, and of course for future missions, protecting the crew,\" Hu said.\n\nThe ultimate test\n\nAll of the objectives for the inaugural Artemis flight will demonstrate capabilities necessary for when Orion carries humans to deep space. The list includes an overall safe flight, the performance of the SLS rocket, testing the heat shield and retrieving the spacecraft once it splashes down in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of San Diego.\n\nOrion won't carry a crew on this initial mission, but it will be full of data from the flight -- including sensors attached to some very necessary passengers. Three mannequins will ride aboard Artemis I to simulate what humans might experience, and the data from their sensors will reveal how much vibration they experienced, as well as radiation exposure and the utility of their flight suits and radiation vests.\n\nBecause Artemis I is a test flight, the Artemis team is willing to take more risks, said Mike Sarafin, NASA's Artemis I mission manager. Taking these risks now can eliminate issues when actual crew are aboard, he said.\n\nBut more than all of the data and science the mission team will garner is the idea of resuming human space exploration by taking a big step forward from Apollo to Artemis.\n\n\"Artemis I shows that we can do big things things that unite people, things that benefit humanity -- things like Apollo that inspire the world,\" Nelson said. \"And to all of us that gaze up at the moon, dreaming of the day humankind returns to the lunar surface: Folks, we're here, we are going back and that journey, our journey, begins with Artemis I.\"", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/08/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/26/world/nasa-launches-forecaster-artemis-i-scn/index.html", "title": "What it's like forecasting for NASA launches - CNN", "text": "Turn to CNN for live coverage from Kennedy Space Center in Florida, starting on Saturday morning and running through the Monday morning launch.

The fire, which remains 0% contained as of Monday morning, has charred more than 15,000 acres in central California's Mariposa County, officials said. California Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency for the region, which frees additional resources to battle the fire. About 2,500 personnel are working to help extinguish the blaze, which has been burning since Friday and has destroyed at least 10 structures and damaged five others. The wildfire comes as much of the US has been experiencing sweltering heat and worsening drought conditions fueled by climate change\n\n2. Ukraine\n\nRussian missile strikes hit the southern Ukrainian port of Odesa , just one day after Ukraine and Russia agreed on a deal that would allow the resumption of vital grain exports from the region. \"Russia agreed to some deal on grain export, but immediately after this attacked it -- showing they want to continue to threaten the world's food security,\" Ukrainian member of parliament Oleksiy Goncharenko told CNN. The deal promised to unblock ports on the Black Sea to allow the safe passage of grain and oilseeds -- some of Ukraine's most important exports . Russia has been blocking maritime access to those ports, meaning that millions of tons of Ukrainian grain have not reached the many countries that rely on the food source. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Russia's missile attack \"casts serious doubt\" on the grain deal. The US is now working with Ukraine on a \" Plan B \" to get grain exports out of the country.\n\nJUST WATCHED Video shows Russian missile hitting Odesa harbor Replay More Videos ...

Monkeypox\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the monkeypox outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. This comes as the US is reporting more than 2,800 probable or confirmed monkeypox cases in 44 states, DC and Puerto Rico, according to the CDC. Two of the cases have been identified in children . Globally, more than 16,500 cases have been reported so far in 74 countries. WHO defines a public health emergency of international concern, as \"an extraordinary event\" that constitutes a public health risk to other countries through the international spread of disease. Although monkeypox is not a sexually transmitted disease, it spreads through skin-to-skin contact. In this outbreak, the virus has mostly been spreading among men who are in close contact with other men.\n\n4.

Crews will ride aboard Artemis II on a similar trajectory in 2024, and astronauts are slated to arrive at the lunar south pole in late 2025 on the Artemis III mission. The Artemis program aims to land the first woman and the first person of color on the moon.\n\nThe agency will share live views and coverage in English and Spanish before, during and after the Artemis I launch on its website and on NASA TV. The broadcast will begin at 5:45 a.m. ET as supercold propellant is loaded into the SLS rocket.\n\nAfter the launch, NASA will conduct a briefing and later Saturday will share the first Earth views from cameras aboard the Orion spacecraft. The Virtual Telescope Project will attempt to share live views of Orion on its way to the moon shortly after launch.\n\nOrion’s journey will last about 38 days as it travels to the moon, loops around it and returns to Earth – traveling 1.3 million miles (2.1 million kilometers). The capsule will splash down in the Pacific Ocean off San Diego on October 11.\n\nCameras inside and outside of Orion will share images and video throughout the mission, including live views from the Callisto experiment, which will capture a stream of a mannequin called Commander Moonikin Campos in the commander’s seat. If you have an Amazon Alexa-enabled device, you can ask it about the mission’s location each day.\n\nHere’s everything you can expect before, during and after the launch.\n\nCounting down to launch\n\nEarly Saturday, the launch team will conduct a briefing on weather conditions and decide whether to begin fueling the rocket.\n\nIf everything looks good, the team will begin fueling the rocket’s core stage and then move on to fueling its upper stage. Afterward, the team will top off and replenish any of the liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen that dissipates during the fueling process.\n\nAbout 50 minutes before launch, the final NASA test director briefing will occur. The launch director will poll the team to make sure every station is a “go” 15 minutes ahead of liftoff.\n\nAt 10 minutes and counting, things kick into high gear as the spacecraft and rocket go through the final steps. Much of the action takes place in the final minute as the ground launch sequencer sends the command for the rocket flight computer’s automated launching sequencer to take over.\n\nIn the last few seconds, hydrogen will burn off, the four RS-25 engines will start, resulting in booster ignition and liftoff at T minus zero.\n\nJourney to the moon\n\nThe solid rocket boosters will separate from the spacecraft about two minutes into the flight and splash down in the Atlantic Ocean, with other components also jettisoning shortly afterward. The core stage of the rocket will separate about eight minutes later and fall toward the Pacific, allowing for Orion’s solar array wings to deploy.\n\nThe perigee raise maneuver will occur about 12 minutes after launch, when the interim cryogenic propulsion stage experiences a burn to raise Orion’s altitude so it doesn’t reenter the Earth’s atmosphere.\n\nShortly afterward is the trans-lunar injection burn, when the ICPS boosts Orion’s speed from 17,500 miles per hour (28,163 kilometers per hour) to 22,600 miles per hour (36,371 kilometers per hour) to escape the pull of Earth’s gravity and set off for the moon.\n\nAfter this burn, the ICPS will separate from Orion.\n\nAround 9:45 p.m. ET, Orion will make its first outbound trajectory correction burn using the European Service Module, which provides the spacecraft with power, propulsion and thermal control. This maneuver will put Orion on a path to the moon.\n\nThe next few days after launch, Orion will venture out to the moon, coming within 60 miles (96 kilometers) during its closest approach on day six of the journey. The service module will place Orion in a distant retrograde orbit around the moon on day 10.\n\nOrion will also surpass the distance record of 248,654 miles (400,169 kilometers) – set by Apollo 13 in 1970 – on day 10 when it loops around the moon. The spacecraft will achieve its maximum distance from Earth of 280,000 miles (450,616 kilometers) on September 23 when it ventures 40,000 miles (64,373 kilometers) beyond the moon.\n\nREAD MORE: Artemis I by the numbers\n\nThis is 30,000 miles (48,280 kilometers) farther than Apollo 13’s record.\n\nOrion will make its second-closest approach of the lunar surface, coming within 500 miles (804 kilometers), on October 5.

Plus a nationwide teacher shortage and more.\n\nHere are some of the top headlines:\n\nSupporters of an influential Iraqi Shi'ite cleric fired rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns into Iraq's Green Zone today, and security forces returned fire. It's the latest escalation of a months-long political crisis in the country. At least 30 people have died after two days of unrest. The World Health Organization's top director in the Western Pacific, Dr. Takeshi Kasai, has been removed from his post. That's after an AP investigation found that dozens of staffers accused him of racist, abusive, and unethical behavior. And a prosecutor yesterday announced a widespread indictment, targeting members of what she called, \"a violent street gang,\" that's been targeting the Atlanta area homes of famous athletes and entertainers. The indictment says Mariah Carey, wide receiver Calvin Ridley, and others, had their homes broken into.\n\n♦\n\nThe Justice Department notified a federal judge yesterday that authorities had identified a limited set of materials seized from Mar-a-Lago this month that may contain information protected by attorney-client privilege. The Justice Department filing comes after a US district judge signaled her intent to appoint a special third-party master to screen documents taken from former President Donald Trump's Florida residence. But the new Justice filing seems to show that federal authorities had already assigned a so-called privileged review team. Trump lawyers had requested that a third party sort and review material that may not be relevant, or information that may be designated as privileged. AP reporter Eric Tucker explains.\n\nEric Tucker:\n\nWe are learning new details about the FBI investigation into the presence of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago. The Justice Department submitted a brief court filing today in which it said it had already completed its review of potentially privileged documents recovered from Mar-a-Lago earlier this month. It said it had retrieved and located a subset of potentially privileged documents related to the attorney-client privilege. They submitted this filing because the Trump legal team has requested the appointment of a special master to do its own review of potentially privileged documents recovered from Donald Trump's estate.\n\nThe Justice Department, in saying that it has already completed its review of the documents, is effectively suggesting that the appointment of a special master is no longer necessary or important, because it is saying that it has effectively already done the work that a special master would be tasked with doing.\n\nThursday, we're going to hear arguments in a court in Florida, in West Palm Beach, about the Trump legal team's request for a special master. The Justice Department filing today suggests the department views that request as effectively moot because it's already finished its review. But we're anticipating that the Trump legal team is going to continue to push forward for the appointment of the special master to review documents for potential privilege concerns. And the judge on Saturday, Judge Aileen Cannon, who's overseeing the case, signaled that she was sympathetic to the Trump legal team. And she said that her preliminary intent was indeed to appoint a special master. We have not heard from her since the filing to know whether or not she's been affected or swayed by what the Justice Department said today.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nThe legal dispute is playing out as a separate court in Florida authorized the release of the redacted affidavit used to support an unprecedented search at Trump's property. It indicates that possible evidence of obstruction could be found at Trump's home. In the affidavit, federal investigators also revealed that an initial collection of 15 boxes of documents, transferred from Mar-a-Lago to the National Archives in January, had 184 classified documents. That's prompted a separate assessment of whether the unsecured documents pose any new threat to national security. In its new filing yesterday, the Justice Department said that US intelligence officials are in the process of that assessment.\n\n♦\n\nStudents across the country are heading back to school over the next few weeks. But will there be enough teachers to meet them there? Producer PJ Elliott spoke with education reporters Alia Wong and Kayla Jimenez to find out.\n\nAlia Wong:\n\nSo the reasons aren't all that surprising, it's a really difficult political climate that has led to a lot of distrust in teachers and a lot of resistance to them. So it's just, frankly, not an appealing time to be an educator.\n\nPay has remained relatively stagnant. There have been a few districts that have moved to raise salaries, but overall there's really sort of low public investment in this profession. And all of this has led to record low morale.\n\nFewer than half of all teachers agree that the \"stress and disappointments\" of their jobs are worth it. And that has been a significant decline from the three-fourths of teachers who said the same thing before the pandemic.\n\nPJ Elliott:\n\nSo Kayla, I'm going to toss it to you here now. What are the schools doing to fill these positions and replace these teachers that are leaving?\n\nKayla Jimenez:\n\nAnd I go back to the note from the president of the NCTQ and she said that schools are lowering their barriers for entry. And so there are schools in 12 states, I believe, since last year alone, have lowered those barriers. And so we're seeing that some others are offering really high sign-on bonuses and others are asking teachers to fill in for other teachers. And we saw that, too, there's a substitute shortage as well.\n\nOne of the teachers that I spoke to, Hong Anh Hong, from San Jose, California, when I walked in to interview her, she told me that she was exhausted because she had filled in for her colleagues' prep periods for the past five days. So she didn't have a break and she was supervising school lunches and breaks. So that, too, schools are grappling with that substitute and staff. Also there's staffing shortages, which maybe Alia, you want to touch on.\n\nAlia Wong:\n\nYeah. So schools are also struggling with shortages in a lot of these support roles, not only paraprofessionals, but also school bus drivers, custodians, the kind of staff that, frankly, we don't give a lot of attention to normally. Without these other personnel who really contribute to the school ecosystem, students will really struggle to have the engaging experiences they need at a time when the stakes arguably haven't been higher. This is the fourth school year that will have been somehow affected by COVID. The onus is really on schools now to catch up students to where they need to be had a pandemic not occurred. And that's particularly true for the students of color, this low income students, whose progress fell furthest behind due to remote learning.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nNASA's Artemis 1 mission, which was scheduled to launch yesterday, was scrubbed. Official cited an engine cooling issue and other concerns that came during final preparations. The mission was set to bring three test dummies to the moon and back. And the next flight window is now Friday at the earliest. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson.\n\nBill Nelson:\n\nI am very proud of this launch team. They have solved several problems along the way, and they got to one that needed time to be solved. This is a brand new rocket. It's not going to fly until it's ready. There are millions of components of this rocket and its systems, and needless to say, the complexity is daunting when you bring it all into the focus of a countdown.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nThis will be the first flight in NASA's Artemis project. It aims to put astronauts back on the moon for the first time since the Apollo mission ended 50 years ago.\n\n♦\n\nAmerica's local election officials are being pushed to their limits. A lack of enough funding, staff shortages, and abusive phone calls are just some of the problems they face, as political reporter Ken Tran tells PJ Elliott ahead of this fall's midterms.\n\nKen Tran:\n\nThey're feeling sort of prospective. They've always done a lot of work that goes unnoticed by a lot of voters. For example, when you go to a polling place, you go in and you vote and that's it. But election officials have always dealt with lack of funding, staffing shortages. Now, after the 2020 election, harassment and threats.\n\nSo going into the midterm elections now, it's sort of all ramping up and coming together to sort of... It's become the final nail in the coffin for a lot of officials. And they're starting to get worried that a lot of them are leaving and it doesn't bode well for either the midterms or 2024.\n\nPJ Elliott:\n\nKen, let's go more into that. You just said the consequences for 2024 in future elections. What do you mean by that exactly?\n\nKen Tran:\n\nSo one thing I heard a lot from officials, that there's a lot of institutional knowledge that's really hard to replicate. And a lot of these officials have been in the job for decades, 10, 20, 30 years. But since a lot of them are leaving, there are a lot more younger officials now to fill in those shoes. But again, they don't possess that institutional knowledge that these older directors had. And in North Carolina, for example, their election law book, according to one official, was three and a half to four inches thick. That's something you can't really teach a new official in advance of an election and in maybe a year or two years. It takes a really long time to learn all that and be able to address any sort of mishaps that might happen in running an election.\n\nPJ Elliott:\n\nIn your article, you wrote about the logistical nightmare that these local election officials have to face. Can you talk more about that?\n\nKen Tran:\n\nSo one thing that an official described as a logistical nightmare has been a new problem of just mountains and mountains of public records requests from Donald Trump's false claims of election fraud in the 2020 election. Their elections have faced a lot more scrutiny now and more people, just ordinary voters, are sending in public records requests to sort of see what's going on.\n\nOne, now retired, official, told me that the ratio compared to 2018, of records requests, is now five to one. And these requests sometimes are the exact same. People will send five of the same requests and it has this exact same wording and they're requesting the exact same things. And also they request documents sometimes going back to really old elections, like 2000. And election office don't hold documents that far back, so they have to figure out a way to get them to fill those requests, because they're legally obligated to.\n\nAnd also some of these requests ask for, to look at signatures or maybe date of births to verify ballots, for example. But that's something that they can't provide. So they have to redact all these minute things for each request and they can't just say, \"No, we can't do that.\" Because they're legally obligated to.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYou can find Ken's full story with a link in today's episode description.\n\n♦\n\nIt's the final US Open of Serena Williams' historic career. She's won the tournament six times, and began her final run with a win last night, in straight sets, over Danka Kovenić. A slew of celebrities were in attendance at her match, ranging from former President Bill Clinton to Mike Tyson. And her super fans from across the country and the world have flocked to New York this week to celebrate the 40 year old's legendary career as one of the greatest athletes of all time. Fan Paula Hughes is one of them.\n\nPaula Hughes:\n\nWe saw her as a young child being able to navigate these predominantly white spaces and the fact that she didn't have to downplay herself. And she could wear her hair with beads at the end I have today, or she could be as loud or fun and crazy and vibrant as her personality in every single form as it came. And she never had to water herself down to be able to excel in these places. It's really so touching, and that's a story that resonates with all of us.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSerena will next play No. 2 seed Annett Kontaveit in the second round tomorrow. Meanwhile, on the men's side, top seed Daniil Medvedev began his tournament with a win yesterday, while No. 2 Rafael Nadal will kick things off tonight. You can tune in on the ESPN networks.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd you can find 5 Things every morning, right here, wherever you're listening right now.

For the ice sheet to correct that imbalance, it will lose an estimated 100 trillion tons of ice, adding at least 10.8 inches to global average sea levels.\n\nThat’s “a very conservative rock-bottom minimum,” said Jason Box, a glaciology professor with Denmark's geological survey.\n\nGreenland's contribution to sea level rise could be more than 2 feet within the century if the pace of warming continues, the authors reported in the journal \"Nature Climate Change,\" even though the study doesn't attach specific time frames.\n\nMany nations committed during the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change to hold the line on emissions to rein in rising global average temperatures, but it could be decades before the world reaches net zero emissions.\n\nWhat's the takeaway?\n\nWilliam Colgan, a senior researcher at Denmark's geological survey, said the work is a \"strong cautionary tale.\"\n\n\"If we can stop the warming to the point where we're not flickering around the 2012-type climate indefinitely, we can save ourselves a huge amount of potential sea level rise,\" he said. \"We can reduce the harm and reduce the sea level rise.\"\n\nEither way, the world is already on the hook for at least the 274 millimeters, roughly 10.8 inches, of sea level rise from Greenland, he said: “That’s going to come out over the next century, no matter what we do.”\n\nSecretary-general of the U.N.:These five steps will help us kick our fossil fuel addiction and save the planet\n\nThat's their best-case scenario, said David Bahr, a study co-author and glaciologist at the Institute for Arctic and Alpine Research at the University of Colorado Boulder.\n\n\"None of us who wrote this paper are going to be at all surprised when we blast right past that,\" he said. \"It’s entirely plausible that it’s going to be twice as bad.”\n\nIt is \"entirely likely\" the sea level could rise an estimated 30 inches – a projection not out of line with previous forecasts, Bahr said: \"That’s a very bad case scenario. We're talking about large portions of places like New York, Miami and Bangladesh disappearing.\"\n\nWhat does melting ice have to do with sea level rise?\n\nGreenland's melting ice has been a key driver of the 11-inch average sea level rise observed along U.S. coastlines over the past 100 years, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That rate has accelerated during the past 40 years.\n\nSecond only to the thermal expansion of warming ocean water, Greenland melting accounts for an estimated 20% of sea level rise, said Bahr.\n\nAny additional melting from Greenland's ice sheet would be on top of whatever global average sea rise occurs from warmer oceans, melting glaciers and ice sheet melting in Antarctica.\n\nThe 10.8 inch estimate is a bit higher than the International Governmental Panel on Climate Change projected last year as Greenland's contribution to sea level rise by 2100. But the study's findings won't mean an immediate change to U.S. projections for sea level rise issued earlier this year because the estimates are built to capture a range of plausible sea-level rise, said Ben Hamlington, a research scientist with NASA's sea level and ice group.\n\n“Studies like this could change how we interpret one scenario vs. another, but wouldn’t require a revision in the scenarios themselves,“ Hamlington said.\n\nWhat did researchers study?\n\nThey looked at the \"snow line,\" the boundary between ice sheet areas exposed to melting and those that were not between 2000 and 2019. They also studied meltwater runoff, tidewater ice flow and snow accumulation.\n\nThe study is unique, the researchers said, because they used satellite measurements and personal observations rather than computer modelling typically used to make sea level rise projections.\n\nThey also looked at two extreme years, 2012 and 2018, both influenced by fluctuating pressures over the ocean known as the North Atlantic Oscillation.\n\nDuring 2012, the negative phase of the oscillation pushed in excess heat and Greenland saw the greatest ice melt of this century so far. During a positive phase in 2018, colder air moved over the island's west side, suppressing surface melt.\n\nIf warmer conditions such as those of 2012 occur more often, the study's co-authors said Greenland's contributions to sea level rise could double or even triple.\n\nWhat does equilibrium mean for the ice sheet?\n\nThe ice sheet is mapped in two zones: the upper area where snow and ice accumulates, and the lower section, which receives less snow and includes the area that is melting.\n\nWhen one area gets larger than the other, the ice sheet becomes out of balance, Colgan said. At this point, the melt zone is growing larger, and warmer temperatures are moving the line between the two zones upward, shrinking the top accumulation area.\n\n“We have caused the ice sheet to go out of equilibrium because we’ve melted it in all the wrong ways,” Bahr said. “We’re melting it faster than the ice can move downstream and replenish areas that are melting.”\n\nThe changes aren’t just apparent to scientists, Colgan added.

The only way to stop the warming, they say, is that \"enormous amounts of carbon dioxide have to be extracted from the atmosphere.\"\n\nThe burning of fossil fuels such as oil, coal and gas release greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere, causing global temperatures to increase and sea levels to rise.\n\nThe scientists modeled the effect of greenhouse gas emission reductions on changes in the Earth's climate from 1850 to 2500 and created projections of global temperature and sea level rises.\n\n\"According to our models, humanity is beyond the point of no return when it comes to halting the melting of permafrost using greenhouse gas cuts as the single tool,\" lead author Jorgen Randers, a professor emeritus of climate strategy at the BI Norwegian Business School, told AFP.\n\n\"If we want to stop this melting process we must do something in addition – for example, suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and store it underground, and make Earth's surface brighter,\" Randers said.\n\nScientists are seeing an 'acceleration of pandemics':They are looking at climate change\n\nThe study said that by the year 2500, the planet's temperatures will be about 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than they were in 1850. And sea levels will be roughly 8 feet higher.\n\nThe authors suggest that global temperatures could continue to increase after human-caused greenhouse gas emissions have been reduced as the continued melting of Arctic ice and carbon-containing permafrost increase water vapor, methane and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.\n\nThe melting of Arctic ice and permafrost also would reduce the area of ice reflecting heat and light from the sun.\n\nAccording to the study, to prevent the authors' projected temperature and sea-level rises, all human-caused greenhouse gas emissions would have had to be reduced to zero between 1960 and 1970.\n\nTo prevent global temperature and sea level rises after greenhouse gas emissions have ceased, and to limit the potentially catastrophic effects on Earth's ecosystems and human society, at least 33 gigatons of carbon dioxide would need to be removed from the atmosphere each year from 2020 onward through carbon capture and storage methods, according to the authors.\n\nThat's roughly the total amount of carbon dioxide the global fossil fuel industry emitted in 2018, according to Business Insider.\n\nOne expert, Penn State University meteorologist Michael Mann, told USA TODAY that he was skeptical of the computer model used in the study: \"The climate model they have used is a very low complexity model. It doesn’t realistically represent large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns, such as ocean circulation, etc.\n\n\"While such models can be useful for conceptual inferences, their predictions have to be taken with great skepticism. Far more realistic climate models that do resolve the large-scale dynamics of the ocean, atmosphere and carbon cycle, do NOT produce the dramatic changes these authors argue for based on their very simplified model.\n\n\"It must be taken not just with a grain of salt, but a whole salt-shaker worth of salt,\" Mann said.\n\nAnother expert, Mark Maslin, a professor of climatology at University College London, also pointed to shortcomings in the model, telling AFP that the study was a \"thought experiment.\"\n\n\"What the study does draw attention to is that reducing global carbon emissions to zero by 2050 is just the start of our actions to deal with climate change,\" Maslin said.\n\nThe study authors urge other scientists to follow up on their work: \"We encourage other model builders to explore our discovery in their (bigger) models, and report on their findings.\"\n\nMore:Recent global warming has wiped out 6,500 years of cooling, study says", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/08/29/nasa-artemis-launch-sea-level-rise-serena-williams-us-open-hurricane-season-its-mondays-news/7930608001/", "title": "NASA Artemis I launch, sea level rise, Serena Williams at US Open ...", "text": "NASA's Artemis I rocket won't be going to the moon today, after all.

I don't think there's anything too crazy about them,\" said Adam Sobel, a professor of applied physics and mathematics at Columbia University in New York City who studies atmospheric and climate dynamics.\n\nThe paper was written by an independent think tank in Australia called Breakthrough National Centre for Climate Restoration. It offers a scenario for 2050 in a world where humans didn't lower carbon emissions enough to keep the global temperature from rising.\n\nLast year's United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report said the world’s nations must quickly reduce fossil fuel use to keep the rise in global temperatures below 1.5 degrees Celsius. The transitions, the report said, must start now and be well underway in the next 20 years.\n\nThe Australian report imagines a world where that didn't happen and global temperatures warmed by 3 degrees Celsius or even more. That's a rise of 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit. While that may not seem like a lot, on a worldwide scale it is expected to result in massive, catastrophic shifts to the weather, agriculture and even the habitability of some areas.\n\n\"Three degrees Celsius by 2100 is a pretty middle-of-the-road estimate. It's not extreme and it's totally believable,\" if serious action isn't taken, Sobel said.\n\nThe writers say their scenario offers a \"glimpse into a world of 'outright chaos' on a path to the end of human civilization and modern society as we have known it, in which the challenges of global security are simply overwhelming and political panic becomes the norm.\"\n\nTheir scenario follows this outline:\n\n2050\n\nIn the years leading up to 2050, policy makers fail to cut greenhouse gas emissions. The case for the global climate-emergency mobilization necessary to keep temperatures from rising is \"politely ignored.\" Global greenhouse gas emissions peak in 2030 and begin to fall due to a drop in fossil fuel use, but damage has been done and warming reaches 3 degrees Celsius.\n\nBy 2050, sea levels have risen 1.6 feet and are projected to increase by as much as 10 feet by 2100.\n\nGlobally, 55% of the population lives in areas subject to more than 20 days of lethal heat a year, beyond the human threshold of survivability.\n\nNorth America suffers from devastating weather extremes, including wildfires, heatwaves, droughts and flooding. China's summer monsoons fail and water in Asia's great rivers are severely reduced from the loss of more than one-third of the Himalayan ice sheet.\n\nA billion people displaced\n\nWithin 30 years from today, ecosystems in coral reefs and the Amazon rainforest collapse, affecting fishing yields and rainfalls.\n\nDeadly heat conditions turn many areas unlivable, resulting in more than a billion people being displaced in West Africa, tropical South America, the Middle East and South-East Asia.\n\nTwo billion people globally are affected by lack of water. Food production falls by one-fifth as droughts, heat waves, flooding and storms affect crops.\n\nRising ocean levels make some of the world's most populous cities uninhabitable, including Mumbai, Jakarta, Canton, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Lagos, Bangkok and Manila. Billions of people must be relocated.\n\nThis leads to fights over land, resources and water and potentially to war and occupations.\n\nAll too possible\n\nThe scenarios given in the paper are all too likely, experts say.\n\nJonathan Patz is a physician and director of the Global Health Institute at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He's been studying the health effects of global warming for two decades.\n\n\"There are studies showing a doubling of the number of people at risk for hunger by mid-century because of droughts,\" he said. \"And a wider prevalence of infectious diseases like malaria, dengue and the Zika virus. It could result in forced migrations and massive refugee problems.\"\n\nHe noted that just before the Syrian civil war began in 2011, one of the area's most severe droughts on record pushed rural to urban migration rates to four times normal and resulted in food riots.\n\nWe’re already getting a taste of what’s to come, said David Doniger, who directs the climate program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental nonprofit based in New York City. He cited this year’s extreme weather that’s resulting in historic flooding in the Midwest, as well as last year’s giant wildfires and severe storms nationwide.\n\nImagine that on a global scale, he says.\n\nThis past December, a record-shattering heat wave in Australia caused temperatures to soar above 120 degrees in some spots.\n\n“All of these things are going to compound,\" he said. \"People are going to be forced to migrate or die. All of this is going to get worse and combine in ways that worsen political tensions and create instability.\"\n\nThe United States is not immune to any of this, said Solomon Hsiang, who studies climate change economics and directs the Global Policy Laboratory at the University of California-Berkeley. His research has found that colder countries such as Canada and Russia may benefit from warming because they'll have more arable land. But not the United States, which \"is already too warm to be a big winner,\" he said.\n\nThe Southeast and the Midwest will fast see bigger, stronger storms and wilder weather, causing flooding, damaging businesses and homes and disrupting farming. The West will see more droughts and wildfires.\n\nHsiang's research shows a roughly 20% chance that conditions not unlike the Dust Bowl could be almost continuous, he said. That was a four-year period from 1935 to 1938 in which a severe drought and dust storms swept from Texas to Nebraska, killing livestock and destroying crops. Dust from the storms reached as far as New York City.\n\nWe have the technology\n\nThe good news, scientists say, is that we have the technology to shift to a carbon-neutral energy system today.\n\n\"We’re not waiting for solutions,\" Patz said. \"We’re simply waiting for the political will to understand that the solutions are here. Clean energy is not a matter of waiting, it’s a matter of implementing.\"\n\nSuch enormous undertakings are not unprecedented. Hsiang cites the tremendous economic shifts that helped fight World War II.\n\n\"When we've faced real threats, we've been willing to make these kinds of large-scale changes,\" he said.\n\nThe decisions we make will be ones future generations will remember us for, Hsiang said.\n\n\"The same way we look back today and have pride in the things our grandparents did to defend democracy — our grandchildren are going to look back and have feelings about what we did today,\" he said.\n\n\"What those feelings are will depend on what we decide to do.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/06/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/15/us/us-sea-level-rise-report-noaa-climate/index.html", "title": "US sea levels will rise rapidly in the next 30 years, new report shows", "text": "(CNN) A new report provides an alarming forecast for the US: Sea level will rise as much in the next 30 years as it did in the past 100 -- increasing the frequency of high-tide flooding , pushing storm surge to the extreme and inundating vulnerable coastal infrastructure with saltwater.\n\nThe interagency report , led by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, shows how scientists are increasingly confident that US coasts will see another 10 to 12 inches of sea level rise by 2050.\n\nThe implications of that forecast are enormous.\n\n\"This report is a wake-up call for the US, but it's a wake-up call with a silver lining,\" NOAA chief Rick Spinrad said at a news conference on Tuesday. \"It provides us with information needed to act now to best position ourselves for the future.\"\n\nThe projected sea level rise will lead to a significant increase in the frequency of coastal flooding even on sunny days, scientists report. High-tide flood events in coastal cities -- New York, Washington , Miami and others -- have already doubled in annual frequency since 2000, turning what researchers say used to be a \"rare event\" into a \" disruptive problem .\"\n\nEvery inch of sea level rise also amplifies hurricane storm surge, coastal erosion and wetland loss -- impacts which US coasts are already well familiar with.\n\n\"Decades ago, powerful storms were what typically caused coastal flooding,\" NOAA reports. Today, due to sea level rise, \"even common wind events and seasonal high tides regularly cause [high-tide flooding] within coastal communities, affecting homes and businesses, overloading stormwater and wastewater systems, infiltrating coastal groundwater aquifers with saltwater, and stressing coastal wetlands and estuarine ecosystems.\"\n\nThe report didn't set out to quantify how expensive these events would get in the future or how they would impact the economy. But Nicole LeBeof, the director of NOAA's National Ocean Service, noted that millions of people live along the coast, and the rest rely on products that enter the country through ports on the coast.\n\n\"What I will say is that the magnitude of these impacts, direct and cascading, will be high,\" LeBeof said at a news conference. \"Forty percent of the US population lives within 60 miles of our coastlines. There will be highly variable impacts along those coastlines, but there's no denying that a large portion of our economy and revenue and tax base are right there, front and center.\"\n\nCatastrophic sea level rise\n\nBeyond 2050, the amount of sea level rise the US will experience is highly dependent on how much the world cuts fossil fuel emissions and limits global temperature rise.\n\nRobert Kopp, a climate scientist at Rutgers University and co-author on the report, said sea level rise is becoming \"increasingly sensitive to the amount of warming\" the planet is experiencing.\n\nFor example, if global warming can be held to around 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels, NOAA estimates sea level rise in the US could be limited to 2 feet by the end of the century.\n\nIf temperatures are allowed to skyrocket, that forecast increases to 7 feet.\n\nPart of the reason that range is so large is the uncertainty over future changes in the world's largest ice sheets and how they will respond to rapid temperature rise. Faster melting of the Greenland or West Antarctic ice sheets could lead to catastrophic sea level rise in the United States by the end of the century.\n\nBen Hamlington, the sea level change team lead at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and a co-author on the report, pointed to the potential collapse of Antarctica's Thwaites glacier , also known as the \"Doomsday glacier,\" which scientists have said would lead to irreversible changes around the globe.\n\n\"We know where these different events could be triggered that would lead to rapid sea level rise, potentially,\" Hamlington told CNN. \"For right now, it's important that we build in that uncertainty into our scenarios, that possibility of that happening, and that's what we've done.\"\n\nWilliam Sweet, oceanographer at NOAA's National Ocean Service and the lead author on the report, said it's important that this report gives decision-makers a range of plausible outcomes beyond 2050.\n\n\"Considering the knowns and unknowns are very important for certain types of decision making,\" Sweet said. \"Those that are very risk averse, who really can't stand to be wrong, need to know these types of outcomes.\"\n\nStorm surge and 'sunny day' flooding\n\nThe report serves as an update to the federal government's 2017 sea level projections , using tide gauge and satellite observations combined with findings from the latest UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report to assess changes the country has already experienced and what is still to come.\n\nThe frequency of high-tide flooding has grown substantially in the past two decades, the report shows.\n\n\"We already are seeing once-rare tidal flooding events becoming increasingly frequent,\" Kopp said. \"So today along the Jersey Shore, flooding events that used to happen in the 1950s every year or two are now happening for several days a year on average.\"\n\nA man kayaks through high-tide flood waters in downtown Annapolis, Maryland, on October 29, 2021.\n\nTwenty years ago, New York City would experience these \"sunny day\" flood events around five days a year; that frequency has now shot to 10 to 15 days.\n\nIn Miami, Florida, and Charleston, South Carolina, the frequency ballooned from two days in 2000 to five to 10 days in 2020. Researchers say these increases will continue to accelerate and spread to other coastal cities in the next few decades.\n\nAnd sea level rise has already made tropical cyclones and hurricanes more deadly and more destructive . Storm surge — the water pushed onshore by a storm's winds — can now spread farther inland because of higher baseline sea level.\n\n2021 study , which Kopp also co-authored, found that sea level rise caused by the climate crisis added another $8 billion in flood damage to Superstorm Sandy's impacts.\n\nAnd as water piles up along the coast, rivers and streams that drain into the ocean can also be blocked, which forces water back upstream and extends the flooding farther inland. In 2021, Hurricane Ida's powerful storm surge reversed the flow of the Mississippi River near New Orleans — something the US Geological Survey said was \"extremely uncommon.\"\n\nAll of these impacts worsen considerably with an additional foot of sea level rise through 2050.\n\n\"Today's disruptive, sunny day high tide flooding is a growing problem in many communities, but that will become damaging flooding in 30 years time due to this increase of a foot or more in many East and Gulf Coast communities,\" Sweet said. \"So what is now disruptive will become outright damaging to our infrastructure and to our commerce unless action is taken.\"\n\nLimiting the worst\n\nEven if the world can slash fossil fuel emissions in the coming decades and put a cap on global warming, the report emphasizes that the sea level rise projections are essentially locked in through 2050. Oceans will continue to climb due to the warming that humans have already caused.\n\nAnd because tens of millions of people in the US already live in coastal areas at risk of flooding — with more people migrating to the coasts each year, partly due to ongoing land development — researchers say there will be a drastic rise in human exposure as well as the country's critical infrastructure.\n\n\"We need to collectively as a country understand that there's only so much sea level rise that can occur until real problems start surfacing in our communities,\" Sweet said. \"We need to recognize that it's largely an elevation issue at this point when storm surge flooding becomes replaced by tidal flooding.\"\n\nBut we can limit the worst long-term outcomes by reducing fossil fuel emissions, researchers say. The high-end forecasts for 2100 can be avoided if fossil fuel emissions are slashed.\n\n\"The next 30 years are pretty well in our headlights right now,\" Sweet said. \"We can give actionable information, but beyond that, emissions matter.\"\n\n\"It's collectively in our hands to determine what our future scenario will actually be.\"\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.", "authors": ["Rachel Ramirez"], "publish_date": "2022/02/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2012/11/27/climate-change-hurricane-sandy/1730251/", "title": "UN climate scientist: Sandy no coincidence", "text": "Karl Ritter, Associated Press\n\nGlobal warming has re-emerged as an issue in Washington following Sandy.\n\nU.N. climate panel set to start releasing portions of its fifth report next year.\n\nThe damage caused by Sandy was worse because of sea level rise.\n\nDOHA, Qatar (AP) -- Though it's tricky to link a single weather event to climate change, Hurricane Sandy was \"probably not a coincidence\" but an example of the extreme weather events that are likely to strike the U.S. more often as the world gets warmer, the U.N. climate panel's No. 2 scientist said Tuesday.\n\nJean-Pascal van Ypersele, the vice chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, predicted that as stronger and more frequent heat waves and storms become part of life, people will stop asking whether global warming played a role.\n\n\"The new question should probably progressively become: Is it possible that climate warming has not influenced this particular event?\" he told the Associated Press in an interview on the sidelines of U.N. climate negotiations in Qatar.\n\nYpersele's remarks come as global warming has re-emerged as an issue in Washington following the devastating superstorm - a rarity for the U.S. Northeast - and an election that led to Democratic gains.\n\nAfter years of disagreement, climate scientists and hurricane experts have concluded that as the climate warms, there will be fewer total hurricanes. But those storms that do develop will be stronger and wetter.\n\nIt is not correct to say Sandy was caused by global warming, but \"the damage caused by Sandy was worse because of sea level rise,\" said Princeton University climate scientist Michael Oppenheimer. He said the sea level in New York City is a foot higher than a century ago because of man-made climate change.\n\nOn the second day of a two-week conference in the Qatari capital of Doha, the talks fell back to the bickering between rich and poor countries that has marked the negotiations since they started two decades ago. At the heart of the discord is how to divide the burden of cutting emissions of heat-trapping gases, including carbon dioxide.\n\nSuch emissions, primarily from the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil, have increased by 20 percent since 2000, according to a U.N. report released last week.\n\nVan Ypersele said the slow pace of the talks was \"frustrating\" and that negotiators seem more concerned with protecting national interests than studying the science that prompted the negotiations.\n\n\"I would say please read our reports a little more. And maybe that would help to give a sense of urgency that is lacking,\" he said.\n\nMarlene Moses, the head of a coalition of island nations that view the rising sea levels as an existential threat, said that was good advice.\n\n\"These are the kind of people that it is probably a good idea to listen to,\" she said. \"It is very much in the interest of small islands to focus on the science, which is why we have always based our positions on the latest research and why here we are calling for dramatically higher ambition.\"\n\nSince 1990, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, has released four reports with projections on how global warming will melt glaciers and ice caps, raise sea levels and shift rainfall patterns with impacts on floods and droughts. The panel shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize with climate campaigner Al Gore, the former U.S. vice president.\n\nThe IPCC is set to start releasing portions of its fifth report next year. Van Ypersele would not discuss the contents except to say the report will include new research on the melting of ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, boosting previous estimates on sea level rise.\n\nHe said the scientific backing for man-made climate change is now so strong that it can be compared to the consensus behind the principles of gravity.\n\n\"It's a very, very broad consensus. There are a few individuals who don't believe it, but we are talking about science and not beliefs,\" Van Ypersele told AP.\n\nClimate change skeptics say IPCC scientists have in the past overestimated the effect of the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere and underplayed natural cycles of warming and cooling. Others have claimed the authors, who aren't paid for their work, exaggerated the effects that climate change will have on the environment and on human life.\n\nNegotiators in Doha are supposed to start talks on an elusive global treaty to rein in emissions. They have set a deadline of 2015 to adopt that pact, which would take effect in 2020.\n\nAmong other topics, they are discussing how to help poor countries convert to cleaner energy sources and adapt to a shifting climate, as well as extending the expiring Kyoto Protocol, an agreement that limits the greenhouse emissions of industrialized countries.\n\nThe U.S. rejected the Kyoto deal because it didn't cover world-leading carbon polluter China and other fast-growing developing countries. Other rich countries including Canada and Japan don't want to be part of the extension, which means it will cover less than 15 percent of global emissions.\n\n\"Japan will not be participating in a second commitment period, because what is important is for the world is to formulate a new framework which is fair and effective and which all parties will join,\" Japanese delegate Masahiko Horie said.\n\nMeanwhile, a series of recent climate reports have underscored the depth of the challenge before the U.N. climate negotiators. A report released Tuesday by the U.N. Environment Program warned current climate projections are likely too conservative because they don't factor in the thawing of permafrost - a layer of soil that stays frozen year-round in cold climates.\n\nLead author Kevin Schaefer, of the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Colorado, said 1,700 gigatons of carbon are locked up in permafrost primarily in the U.S., China, Russia and Canada. He called for further studies on the potential climate impact if it's released, saying up to 39 percent of total emissions could come from permafrost by 2100.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2012/11/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/18/world/wmo-climate-report-2021-temperatures-sea-level-oceans-intl/index.html", "title": "UN chief says Ukraine a 'wake-up call' to ditch fossil fuels as WMO ...", "text": "(CNN) The world's oceans in 2021 grew to their warmest and most acidic levels on record, while melting ice sheets helped push sea levels to new heights, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said on Wednesday, prompting a call to action from United Nations chief António Guterres.\n\nOceans saw the most striking extremes as the WMO detailed a range of turmoil wrought by climate change in its annual State of the Global Climate report.\n\nThe WMO report follows on the latest UN climate assessment, which warned that humanity must drastically cut its greenhouse gas emissions or face increasingly catastrophic changes to the world's climate.\n\nThe levels of climate-warming carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere in 2021 surpassed previous records, the WMO said.\n\nAn aerial view of land between the Pacific Ocean and a lagoon in Funafuti, Tuvalu.\n\nGuterres said that the war in Ukraine was a wake-up call for the world to ditch fossil fuels.\n\nRead More", "authors": ["Story Reuters", "Angela Dewan"], "publish_date": "2022/05/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/02/28/climate-change-remaking-america/1917169/", "title": "Why you should sweat climate change", "text": "Wendy Koch, USA TODAY\n\nMore American children are getting asthma and allergies, and more seniors are suffering heat strokes.\n\nFood and utility prices are rising. Flooding is overrunning bridges, swamping subways and closing airport runways.\n\nPeople are losing jobs in drought-related factory closings. Cataclysmic storms are wiping out sprawling neighborhoods. Towns are sinking.\n\nThis isn't a science-fiction, end-of-the-world scenario. Though more anecdotal than normal — today, at least — these scenes are already playing out somewhere in the United States, and they're expected to get worse in years ahead. In fact, a remaking of America is likely in our lifetimes — a flicker in geological time. This will transform how and where we live, work and play.\n\nMassachusetts' climate will start to look more like North Carolina's, and Illinois will begin to feel like Texas. Montana's Glacier National Park, a glorious site that draws tourists from around the world, will likely lose its glaciers.\n\nClimate change is partly the culprit. Scientific research shows that it's increasing the risk and intensity of heat waves, downpours, drought and wildfires. A key factor: the burning of fossil fuels. With these changes come rising sea levels and acidified oceans. So when Superstorm Sandy struck New York harbor in October, the flooding that killed scores of people, ruined thousands of homes and closed subways as well as airports came amid already rising seas.\n\nAs the planet edges this year toward what some scientists say will be the highest concentration of heat-trapping carbon dioxide emissions in at least 800,000 years, USA TODAY reporters will travel the country to explore places where climate change is already affecting lives.\n\nNot all of it is bad news. As with any change, there will be winners and losers, especially at the local level. There will be longer growing seasons, lower heating bills and fewer cold-related deaths. Melting Arctic sea ice is opening the Northwest Passage off Alaska's coast, sought for centuries as a trade route, to tourism, maritime shipping and oil exploration.\n\nYet on a national level, the losers will probably outnumber the winners, according to a draft report of the third National Climate Assessment released by the U.S. government in January. It cites peer-reviewed research indicating that the rising demand for cooling will outpace the diminished demand for heating, and sweltering summers will contribute to more additional deaths than would be prevented by milder winters. Increased production of fossil fuels near Alaska will further warm the planet.\n\nAmericans can adapt to some climate change, and indeed already are, but a continuing rise in global carbon emissions will make adapting increasingly costly and difficult — especially in densely developed coastal areas.\n\nSome potential impacts, such as higher flood insurance premiums for luxury waterfront homes or more bald spots on ski slopes, might seem trivial. Others — lower home values on the coasts, heat-related deaths in the Midwest or the relocation of entire villages in Alaska — not so much.\n\nThe effects of this new world are reverberating from coast to coast:\n\n• \"Who's going to hire me now?\" asks Barbara Roberts,56, who lost her job of 36 years a month ago when a Cargill beef-processing plant in Plainview, Texas, closed its doors. The facility, which employed 2,000 people, was starved of cattle because of the drought. Roberts, who earned $13.70 an hour plus benefits, says she hurt her back after 20 years on the production line, leaving her unable to lift heavy items. The only other large decent-paying employer in town, she says, is Walmart.\n\n• \"My house isn't straight anymore. It's tilted,\" says Jeff Miskill, a general contractor in Norfolk, Va., where rising sea levels have contributed to repeated flooding throughout the city and a shifting of the ground under his home. \"You can feel it inside. You feel like you're walking uphill.\"\n\nMiskill says neighbors aren't worried about the semantics of what's happening, whether climate change or flooding. \"Call it what you will,\" he says, \"but we have a water problem.\"\n\n• \"My windows and doors are rotted away,\" says Stanley Tom, 52, the tribal administrator of Newtok, Alaska, a place where severe flooding is always a risk. The area's infrastructure was built on permafrost — soil saturated with frozen water — that because of higher temperatures, is now melting into mud. Roads and runways have been ruined, and water supplies are contaminated.\n\nAll of Newtok's 350 or so residents are being relocated from the eroding coastline to higher ground because, as Tom says, \"the village is sinking.\"\n\nInside 'the mixed bag'\n\nNo doubt, scores of politicians and millions of Americans are skeptics. After all, no single storm, heat wave or wildfire — unlike longer-term patterns — can be linked directly to climate change. These esteemed scientists don't have all the answers, particularly as their projections stretch far into the future. While almost all agree on the broad contours of human-induced climate change, they continue to refine the details as new data and better tracking technology — such as a series of NASA satellites launched in 2000 — become available.\n\n\"It's a mixed bag,\" says Kerry Emanuel, a climate scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, about the link between extreme weather and climate change. Though Emanuel once doubted the evidence, he now says it's clear the world is warming beyond its natural variability. He notes that there are clearer links to some weather events than others.\n\nEmanuel, author of What We Know About Climate Change, says rainfall may have the clearest climate link. He says it now occurs less often, but when it does rain, we're more likely to experience downpours. So wet regions will be wetter, causing flash flooding. Dry ones will get drier, resulting in drought. Heat, of course, is another consequence. So a heat wave that used to occur once every 100 years now happens every five years.\n\nAn indicator of that warming is the rising concentration of carbon-dioxide emissions in the atmosphere — now at 396 parts per million, according to January data by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It was about 275 parts per million two centuries ago, and some research suggests that it probably hasn't exceeded 400 ppm — likely within the next few years worldwide — in at least 800,000 years. Leading climate scientists, including NASA's James Hansen, warn that concentrations above 350 ppm risk planetary perils, including melting ice sheets and rapidly spreading drought.\n\nThe most recent decade was the nation's hottest on record, and 2012 was the hottest single year. The average U.S. temperature has risen 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit since reliable record-keeping began in 1895 — 80% of that has occurred since 1980. The increase might seem small, but scientists warn that a ripple effect can trigger \"tipping points,\" beyond which the planet may not be able to recover.\n\nFor example, the warmer the air, the more summer Arctic sea ice is lost. The more sea ice that's lost, the more warming occurs because ice reflects sunlight while water absorbs it. As the atmosphere warms, it holds larger amounts of water vapor, which could help energize everything from hurricanes to snowstorms. And the cycle continues.\n\nAverage U.S. temperatures will likely rise at least another 2 to 4 degrees in most places in the next few decades and between 3 to 10 degrees by 2100, depending on the amount of oil, gas and coal we burn, according to the draft of the 2013 National Climate Assessment. The report, written by 240 private and government scientists, is based on hundreds of studies published in science journals.\n\nHigher temperatures mean higher sea levels, too. The reason's simple: As water warms, it expands. While global sea level has risen 8 inches since 1900 and is projected to rise another 1 to 4 feet by 2100, the problem is worse along the U.S. Atlantic Coast. The U.S. Geological Survey has found that its sea level is rising three to four times faster — about 1.5 inches per decade — because of differences in ocean currents, salinity, water temperatures and land movements.\n\nThe economic costs of all these changes are enormous — not only for those directly affected but also for the nation's taxpayers, who are stuck with the bills for disaster relief, national flood insurance and drought-related crop losses. In February, f or the first time, the non-partisan General Accountability Office said climate change puts the U.S. government at \"high risk \" of financial exposure. NOAA says 11 extreme weather and climate events last year alone in the United States cost more than $1 billion each.\n\nClimate change will also strain the U.S. military by triggering unpredictable water, food and energy shortages, according to a 2012 study commissioned by the CIA and done by the National Research Council, a private non-profit group. Emanuel says Defense Department officials worry about the political unrest that climate disruptions could cause, putting the threat in stark terms: \"It's right up there with (North) Korea and Iran.\"\n\nAt the heart of it: Water\n\nFor Jimmy Strickland, climate issues aren't theoretical. They're business. He owns an accounting firm with a one-story brick office building two blocks from Norfolk's waterfront. During his 35 years in the Hague section of town, three huge storms have struck — all in the past decade. Each time, his building flooded and had to be closed at least two months for repairs that cost his insurance company about $250,000.\n\n\"You lose time, and time is money,\" Strickland says. He's devised precautions. When Sandy came, he and his wife spent a couple of days preparing, installing door dams, moving furniture and putting computers atop desks. They spent 36 hours vacuuming up water as it seeped inside and then ran dehumidifiers.\n\n\"It's a nuisance,\" Strickland says. He has asked the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for funding to retrofit his offices to prevent flooding. Yet he wonders whether taxpayers should foot the bill for that.\n\nWhile Norfolk is second only to New Orleans for sea level rise, partly because its land is naturally sinking, other coastal U.S. cities — Boston; Charleston, S.C.; Miami; New York; Seattle; San Francisco; Tampa — are vulnerable, too.\n\n\"It's a harbinger of things to come,\" says Leonard Berry, a geoscience professor at Florida Atlantic University, of the regular high-tide flooding on Miami's streets. The Army Corps of Engineers expects South Florida's sea level will rise 3 to 7 inches by 2030; the range jumps from 9 to 24 inches by 2060.\n\nAs sea levels rise, storm-related flooding — such as occurred after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 — can disrupt oil refineries and pipelines. They can damage rail lines that carry coal to power plants, or runways at 13 of the nation's largest airports, which are located within 12 feet of current sea level, or nuclear power plants in Southern California, according to the National Climate Assessment.\n\nWhile there's to o much water in some places, there's not enough in others. Drought afflicted as much as 65% of the contiguous states last year and still lingers in more than half of the country. Corn, wheat and soybean crops were decimated, prompting a rise in food prices. Nearly two dozen ethanol plants in 13 states halted production because they lacked a key ingredient: corn.\n\nIn Plainview, Texas, Cargill's plant closing took workers by surprise.\n\n\"They didn't tell us 'til that day,\" Roberts says. \"It was 10:45 a.m. when the announcement came: 'Everyone off the floor.' \" She says they went to the cafeteria for the news. \"We didn't go back to the floor. We went home.\"\n\n\"The U.S. cattle herd is at its lowest level since 1952,\" Cargill Beef's president, John Keating, said in announcing the closure. He said the company delayed it \"as long as possible,\" hoping the drought would break. \"Unfortunately,\" he added, \"the drought has not broken.\"\n\nRoberts, who says she'll collect severance pay until March 19, expects she'll have to tap her 401(k) savings to pay bills. She'd consider going elsewhere to find work, but with so many others laid off, she doesn't know who would buy her home.\n\nOthers have suffered from, if not drought, the heat itself.\n\n\"It's the silent killer,\" says Laurence Kalkstein, a University of Miami professor who studies the effect of heat on health. He says if climate change brings hotter — but still variable — weather, more heat-related deaths will likely occur. He says heat can cause fatalities among even the fittest, though he points out that the elderly and those with physical and mental ailments are most vulnerable.\n\nRiley Kimble was found dead in a tiny stifling apartment without air conditioning in Chicago last July on a day when outside temperatures reached 103 degrees. The city's medical examiner said heat stress contributed to his death and that of at least two dozen others. He was 59.\n\nHis stepdaughter, Nicole Hughes, who grew up with Kimble and her mother in Chicago but now lives in Tempe, Ariz., says he suffered from schizophrenia. As a young man, before his illness struck, she says, he was a college student and avid reader who helped her with homework. He was the only dad she ever knew.\n\nErnestine Williams says she's struggling to \"keep it together\" since her daughter Mary, then 56, died in the same Chicago heat wave. She lives on a widow's pension but has taken in Mary's three young adult children, who she says took the death \"real hard. ... No one was prepared for that.\"\n\nWhere are we headed?\n\nMany climate scientists warn of potential catastrophe ahead. Ken Caldeira of the Carnegie Institution for Science has looked at what would happen if people burned all of the fossil fuels available over the next few centuries. He predicts, based on mathematical models, a hotter climate like that of 100 million years ago when dinosaurs roamed the Earth.\n\nJeffrey Archer, a professor of geophysical sciences at the University of Chicago, says that even if fossil fuel use stops, current high CO2 levels will linger in the atmosphere for millennia — what he calls \"the long tail.\"\n\nEven so, some of these scientists are technology optimists.\n\n\"I'm not at all without hope,\" Archer told journalists at an MIT climate conference in December. He says geo-engineering, which involves trying to manipulate the Earth's climate, might find a way to suck carbon out of the sky (but, alas, not out of the oceans).\n\nThey see a possible new source of cheap, carbon-free energy. While today's solar, wind and nuclear power emit no CO2, the first two can be costly and intermittent, and the last — embraced by many climate experts such as Emanuel but not environmentalists — lacks public support because of safety concerns.\n\nAlmost every day, researchers in some part of the world announce breakthroughs. In February alone, Australia's Monash University discovered a new energy-efficient material that can capture and store CO2 emissions from coal-fired power plants. The University of Southern California developed a new type of lithium-ion batteries capable of holding three times as much energy.\n\nThere are also efforts to adapt to climate change. Norfolk, for example, has elevated some streets and houses. Its City Council is considering other steps, including a requirement that new or renovated homes in flood-prone areas be built at least 2 feet — instead of the current 1 foot — above the community's flood level.\n\nFEMA is updating flood maps, which are used to set insurance requirements and building codes. Its new ones for New York City's Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island boroughs, prepared before Sandy, have twice as many homes and businesses at high risk for flooding — an additional 35,000 buildings — as did the maps from 1986. Those in flood zones will have to elevate homes or pay higher flood insurance premiums.\n\nIn an omen for possibly millions of coastal U.S. residents, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has called for many with Sandy-damaged homes to relocate rather than rebuild. He's seeking federal funds to buy about 10,000 homes, at pre-Sandy prices, and return the land to nature.\n\nPublic health officials are also taking steps to adapt such as opening cooling centers for vulnerable people like Kimble on sweltering days.\n\nKim Knowlton, a health professor at Columbia University, says people need to act quickly, adding: \"Climate change is not a place and time distant — it's here and now.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/02/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/environment/2016/04/13/climate-change-fossil-fuels-rallying-cry-keep-ground/81926856/", "title": "The new climate rallying cry: keep it in the ground", "text": "Story by Sammy Roth and photographs by Jay Calderon, The Desert Sun | April 13, 2016\n\nNobody said a word as the auctioneer took his place at the lectern, but the tension was deafening.

Some of the activists held signs: \"Our lands, our future,\" or, \"Don't auction our climate.\"\n\n\"OK, let's start the sale, ladies and gentlemen. The first parcel on there is No. 1266, it's up there in the upper corner if you want to follow along. It consists of 162-plus acres of it, located out in Juab County. And who will give me an opening bid of $2 to start? Two-dollar bid?\"\n\nThe protesters hadn't planned to disrupt the auction. But once the bidding got underway, they couldn’t help themselves. A few of them started chanting, and soon everyone joined in. Their voices got louder and louder: \"People gonna rise like the water, gonna calm this crisis down. I hear the voice of my great-granddaughter, saying, 'Keep it in the ground!'\"\n\nA federal official told the activists that if they didn't quiet down, Salt Lake City police would escort them out. He gave them 60 seconds to stop chanting; police officers stood, ready to act.\n\nThey stopped chanting — but only for a few minutes, unable to sit silently as oil and gas leases were auctioned off for as little as $2 an acre. This time, they didn't get another chance. As police moved in and ordered them to leave, one of the protesters, Tim Ream, shouted at the bidders, \"Show this to your grandkids! Show it to them and explain what’s happening with the climate!\"\n\nWhat's happening with the climate isn't complicated: For every ton of carbon humanity emits by burning fossil fuels, the world is getting hotter.\n\nThe Salt Lake City protesters had a simple demand for President Barack Obama: Stop making public land and water available for oil and natural gas drilling. It's a message that's taking hold across the country. In recent months, activists associated with the “keep it in the ground” movement have protested federal auctions in Denver, Milwaukee, New Orleans, Reno and elsewhere. They've got supporters in Congress, including a presidential candidate, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\n\nTHE CURRENT: Sign up for The Desert Sun's energy and water newsletter\n\nAny serious plan to deal with climate change, these activists say, requires the United States to start limiting the extraction of fossil fuels — immediately. They point to studies showing that if the world doesn't keep the vast majority of its coal, oil and gas in the ground, global warming will almost certainly exceed 2 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial times, the target adopted by 195 nations in Paris last year. Scientists once believed that 2 degrees of warming would be relatively safe, but recent studies have found that even less warming could be catastrophic for people, animals and the natural systems that underpin human civilization.\n\nThe world is already 1 degree Celsius warmer than it was before the Industrial Revolution.\n\n\"Nobody is saying we want to stop burning fossil fuels today, or that we have the ability to stop burning fossil fuels today,\" said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, the country's largest environmental group. \"What we're saying is that the challenge of climate change is a severe one. The need to act has never been more urgent.\"\n\nCritics of \"keep it in the ground\" say cutting back on drilling would do nothing to limit demand for fossil fuels, which still generate two-thirds of the country's electricity. They believe policymakers should limit their focus to reducing demand for coal, oil and gas, either by taxing carbon or by providing incentives for clean energy. \"Keep it in the ground\" supporters favor those steps, but say they aren't enough to confront climate change.\n\nOther critics point to the economic pain that transitioning to clean energy could inflict. While scientists and economists generally agree that the long-term benefits of fighting climate change far outweigh the short-term costs, there's little question that abandoning fossil fuels would lead to job losses in regions where coal, oil or gas development is a significant economic force.\n\nA lot is riding on this year's presidential election.\n\nIf Americans elect Donald Trump or Ted Cruz — both of whom reject the overwhelming scientific consensus that humans are causing global warming — international efforts to curb climate change could unravel. Cruz has written bills designed to boost oil and gas production, and has promised to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement. Trump, true to form, has released few specifics about his energy policy, although he's criticized Obama's carbon regulations. Hillary Clinton has pledged to limit oil and gas production, although she has a long history of supporting fossil fuels and fracking, including during her tenure as secretary of state. Only Sanders has consistently opposed fossil fuel development.\n\nWhoever wins the Democratic and Republican nominations, most climate advocates say they'll have an easy choice in November.\n\n\"I wish it didn't boil down to a partisan political issue,\" said Michael Mann, a Pennsylvania State University climatologist who has researched long-term temperature changes. \"Unfortunately, we've now arrived at a point where there really is this remarkable contrast between the two parties…with one party, we will move backward. With the other party, we will move forward.\"\n\nClimate change is already happening: Massive ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland are melting faster than expected, causing the oceans to rise. Extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and more intense, with Hurricane Sandy and the California drought offering a preview of what the future might hold. Infectious diseases are expanding outside their old geographic comfort zones, with scientists saying rising temperatures could help Zika virus spread in North America.\n\nMeanwhile, plants and animals are dying — and so are people, although it's hard to calculate an exact number. The World Health Organization estimates that by 2030, climate change will be responsible for about 240,000 deaths per year. Some of those deaths will be caused by heat and disease, but researchers say the biggest contributor will be childhood undernutrition, as a result of reduced crop production across much of the planet.\n\nLimiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius is still within the realm of possibility — barely.\n\nThe math is simple: If humanity wants good odds of staying under 2 degrees Celsius, between two-thirds and four-fifths of the world's proven fossil fuel reserves must stay in the ground, according to calculations by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the Carbon Tracker Initiative. By century's end if not sooner, the planet will need to be powered almost entirely by zero-carbon energy sources like solar, wind, hydropower and maybe nuclear, climate advocates say.\n\nREAD MORE: Why fighting climate change won't destroy the economy\n\nClimate change isn't like other political issues, said Bill McKibben, an environmental activist who co-founded 350.org and led the opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline. With most debates between Democrats and Republicans, he said, \"the best response is usually to figure out a compromise in the middle,\" and then revisit the problem as needed. But with climate change, such a strategy could be catastrophic, he said. At current rates of fossil fuel consumption, the world has a few decades at most before it burns its way past 2 degrees Celsius.\n\n\"Our problem here is that the two sides, fundamentally, are not industry and environmentalists, or Republicans and Democrats,\" McKibben said. \"At the very bottom, the two sides are physics and human beings. And that's an extremely tough negotiation, because physics doesn't care. We have no leverage on physics.\"\n\nClimate scientists reported in February that just 2.5 degrees of warming would probably cause sea-level rise of 80 feet over a few thousand years, forcing the abandonment of New York, London and Shanghai. The impacts are already being felt: Rising seas regularly flood South Florida, and a football field's worth of Louisiana coastline is disappearing every 48 minutes, largely due to global warming.\n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which is known for its conservative estimates, projects between one and three feet of global sea-level rise by the end of the century. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is less optimistic, saying the United States could experience 6.6 feet of sea-level rise by 2100. If the oceans rise just six feet, 13.1 million people in the United States would be displaced, according to a recent study led by researchers at the University of Georgia.\n\n\"It's our actions that we're doing now that are committing us to this very long-term future,\" said Peter Clark, an Oregon State University climate scientist, who led the study predicting long-term sea-level rise of 80 feet. \"Do we want to be responsible for that type of Earth for the citizens at that time?\"\n\nThe \"keep it in the ground\" activists don't want to be responsible. In Salt Lake City, the movement is led by Elders Rising, a group of seniors who hope to leave a livable planet for their grandchildren. They're old-school environmentalists, some of whom have been arrested for civil disobedience.\n\nOne of the group's founders, Jill Merritt, isn't optimistic about the future. Ask her what she sees on the horizon, and she'll tell you human beings are going to drive themselves to extinction.\n\nThen why bother fighting, she was asked? Why work so hard to keep fossil fuels in the ground?\n\n\"What's the alternative for somebody who is serious about the immorality of all this?\" she said. \"If I'm alive, I have to do something.\"\n\nPresident Obama has made climate change a top priority. It might not be enough.\n\nAt the Paris summit, Obama promised America would cut its carbon emissions 26 to 28 percent by 2025. His administration has rolled out stricter fuel-efficiency standards for cars and trucks, tens of billions of dollars in funding for renewable energy, and rules designed to limit methane leaks from oil and gas production. The centerpiece of his climate policy, the Clean Power Plan, would cut power-plant emissions by a third if it's upheld by the Supreme Court.\n\nREAD MORE: At Paris climate talks, nations looked to California\n\nBut while experts praise those efforts, they say the next president must do more — much more.\n\nEven if every country meets its Paris commitments, global warming will still reach 3.6 degrees Celsius, one recent study found. Another analysis was more optimistic, projecting a best-case scenario of 2.7 degrees of warming — still significantly above the 2-degree threshold.\n\nAnd the United States isn't even on track to meet its modest Paris commitment. A recent analysis by the Rhodium Group, a global research firm, found that even under the most optimistic assumptions — including faster-than-expected technological improvement — America will fall short.\n\n\"The gap is pretty wide, because we really need to limit warming to 1.5 degrees in order to give many countries and wildlife species and ecosystems a chance to survive,\" said Brune, the Sierra Club executive director. \"We have a long way to go. And what the U.S. has committed to certainly won't get us there.\"\n\nThere's only so much a president can do on climate without action from Congress. Many climate experts have called for a carbon tax, or a market-based cap-and-trade system to give polluters a financial incentive to cut back. But those steps would require legislation, which would require 60 votes to clear a filibuster in the Senate. Even if Congress comes around in five or 10 years, it might be too late.\n\nJeffrey Sachs, director of Columbia University's Earth Institute and an adviser to United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, is confident the world will transition from fossil fuels to clean energy. But he's not sure it will happen fast enough to avoid warming of 2 degrees Celsius.\n\n\"Will we do this? Absolutely. But will we do it in time? It's a very close call,\" he said. \"I have no doubt that as the climate continues to become more unstable — as people begin to experience more shocks and disruptions all over the world — there will be a turn to decarbonization.\"\n\nThe transition is happening, fueled by the falling cost of solar panels and by government support for clean energy. For the first time, the world built more clean energy capacity than it did fossil fuel capacity in 2015, according to a United Nations report. Global investment in clean energy grew to $286 billion, more than double the investment in coal and natural gas, the report found.\n\nREAD MORE: How the solar industry scored big wins in California, Congress\n\nIt wasn't enough. Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels skyrocketed past 400 parts per million last year, increasing faster than at any point during the last 66 million years, according to one study. The numbers are still rising, and they'll probably keep rising so long as power plants, cars, farms, residential and commercial buildings, and other sources keep spewing planet-warming greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.\n\n\"Every country needs to make a plan to decarbonize. Every country's going to have to do that as fast as possible, and the only exceptions should be the very, very poor countries,\" Sachs said. \"They should be given the leg up, that those fossil fuels are ones that will continue to be used.\"\n\nThe \"keep it in the ground\" movement has its roots in opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline, which would have carried high-polluting tar sands oil from Canada to Nebraska. When Obama rejected the pipeline in November, he borrowed the movement's language, saying, \"If we’re going to prevent large parts of this Earth from becoming not only inhospitable but uninhabitable in our lifetimes, we're going to have to keep some fossil fuels in the ground.\"\n\nEven before Obama killed Keystone XL, the movement had started shining a spotlight on federal fossil fuels. In September, more than 400 groups and individuals sent a letter to the president, urging him to stop issuing new leases for coal, oil and gas on federal land and offshore waters.\n\n\"If we were serious about a world that was only going to be 1.5 or 2 degrees warmer — which would already be a disaster; 1 degree has already melted the Arctic — we can't build any new fossil fuel infrastructure at all,\" said McKibben, who helped launch the movement. \"We've got to stop building pipelines. We've got to stop building coal transport facilities. We've got to stop here and around the world doing any of this stuff immediately.\"\n\nAbout 32.2 million acres of federal land are already under lease for oil and gas exploration, with an additional 475,000 acres under lease for possible coal mining, according the most recent data from the federal Bureau of Land Management, which administers about 250 million acres of public land. Offshore, about 26 million acres of water are under lease for oil and gas development.\n\nCritics say the federal fossil fuel program's biggest climate impacts could be yet to come. A report commissioned by two environmental groups — the Center for Biological Diversity and Friends of the Earth — found last year that federal fossil fuels in areas that haven't yet been leased contain up to 450 gigatons of carbon pollution.\n\nThe impact of those emissions would be staggering. Researchers with the Carbon Tracker Initiative, a financial think tank, calculated in 2011 that to maintain an 80 percent chance of keeping global warming to 2 degrees, the world could emit just 565 more gigatons of carbon dioxide — and that number has continued to shrink since then.\n\nREAD MORE: Climate change far more than an environmental issue\n\nThe 565-gigaton figure is just one estimate of the world's remaining \"carbon budget.\" The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change calculated in 2013 that humanity could emit another 1,000 gigatons of carbon dioxide, although that would give us just a two-thirds chance of keeping global warming below 2 degrees.\n\nWhatever the exact number, the situation is dire: Earth’s proven fossil fuel reserves contain at least 2,795 gigatons of carbon dioxide, according to the Carbon Tracker Initiative. That means companies can’t be allowed to burn the vast majority of the fossil fuels in their arsenals, let alone go looking for new reserves in places like the Arctic, said Sachs, the adviser to Ban Ki-moon.\n\n\"It's just arithmetic. If you measure all of the carbon dioxide that would be released if we burned all the coal, oil and gas in our reserves, we'd blow our carbon budget many, many times over,\" he said. \"The companies, basically, cannot go on doing what they’re doing. Of course they don't like that message. It’s a blow to their capitalization. It strands their assets.\"\n\nObama gave the \"keep it in the ground\" movement a major victory in January, halting new coal leases while federal officials review the coal program's climate impacts. His administration also announced last month that it wouldn't open the southeast Atlantic coast to offshore oil and gas development, reversing an earlier decision that would have brought drilling to the region for the first time.\n\nBut Obama's Bureau of Land Management is still issuing onshore oil and gas leases, and his Bureau of Ocean Energy Management is moving forward with plans to lease offshore areas in the Arctic and the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThrough a spokesperson, Bureau of Land Management Director Neil Kornze declined to be interviewed for this story. In an emailed statement, he defended the Obama administration's record on climate change, pointing to the president's goal of approving 20,000 megawatts of renewable energy capacity on public land by 2020. Federal officials have already approved 35 solar farms, 11 wind farms and 12 geothermal facilities, although it's not clear all of those projects will be built.\n\nObama has also set a goal of cutting methane emissions from the oil and gas sector 40 to 45 percent below 2012 levels by 2025. That initiative targets planet-warming methane gas that leaks or is intentionally released during the drilling and transport of oil and gas — not the carbon dioxide emitted when the gas is eventually burned.\n\nSCORCHED EARTH: How climate change is altering the deserts of the Southwest\n\nKornze declined to answer a question about whether promoting oil and gas drilling is consistent with limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius. In response to that question, Interior Department spokesperson Amanda DeGroff listed some of the administration's climate change successes, including cutting energy use and promoting the development of clean energy.\n\n\"The Department of the Interior is committed to safely and responsibly managing the development of oil and gas on public lands in a way that continues to meet our nation's energy needs while advancing renewable forms of energy,\" DeGroff said in an emailed statement. \"Since the President took office, wind energy has tripled and solar has increased twenty-fold. Actions at home to facilitate this type of development show that we are serious about taking on the challenge of climate change and demonstrating leadership on the global stage.\"\n\nVaughn Lovejoy would probably have a lot to say to Kornze and Obama.\n\nAs president of the Salt Lake City chapter of the Audubon Society in the 1980s, Lovejoy worked to protect forests from development. He later went on a \"vision quest\" at Great Basin National Park, he said, which inspired him to leave the pharmaceuticals industry and spend 20 years as a volunteer coordinator for TreeUtah, which plants and cares for trees. He likes to talk about the importance of \"transforming human consciousness\" to encourage harmony with the natural world.\n\nBut Lovejoy said that until recently, he was in denial about the environmental degradation his generation has caused. That changed on Sept. 14, 2015, when his grandson Johnathon was born — incidentally, the day before the 400-signature \"keep it in the ground\" letter landed on Obama’s desk.\n\nAs he looked into his grandson's eyes, Lovejoy later wrote, \"The last vestiges of my denial about the future of our world, the world he had just entered, shattered.\"\n\n\"Humanity is not coming close to making the fundamental changes necessary to save Earth from rising temperatures, melting glaciers, dying forests, rampaging wildfires, extreme weather events and the extinction of countless species,\" he wrote in November for Catalyst Magazine.\n\nLOSING SNOW: What global warming means for water supplies\n\nSitting in his Salt Lake City living room on an overcast morning in February — the day before the auction he helped disrupt — Lovejoy explained why he helped found Elders Rising.\n\n“My generation…we were the ones who came of age in the '60s. There was, for this period of time, this sense that we had of optimism — a vision that, number one, the world needed changing, and number two, by golly, we were going to do it,\" he said. \"And now here we are, 40 years later. And during the course of our professional careers here on the planet, there's been more decimation done in the last 40 years than in all of human history.\"\n\nElders Rising made plans to protest the federal oil and gas auction, which was originally scheduled for November. But the Bureau of Land Management postponed the event at the last minute, saying its auction room wasn't big enough for all the activists who planned to attend. The agency rescheduled the auction for the Salt Palace Convention Center in February.\n\nBy February, Elders Rising had joined with a dozen other local and national groups to organize a protest. The morning of the auction, activists gathered outside the convention center in Salt Lake City, where they sang, raised signs and chatted with local TV reporters. Eventually, they unfurled a huge \"KEEP IT IN THE GROUND\" banner and marched into the auction room, chanting the whole way.\n\nBefore they went inside, Tim Ream — a San Francisco-based activist with the group WildEarth Guardians — made a speech to rally the troops. He noted that the United States has emitted more climate pollution than any other country. He said it's America’s responsibility to start limiting fossil fuel extraction, even if other countries don't follow suit right way.\n\n\"On our public lands — the coal, oil and gas that we own, the carbon that is ours, that we have political power over — we need to make that an example for the world by keeping it in the ground,\" Ream said, to cheers and applause. \"Half of all the carbon in the United States is actually owned by us. We can actually shut it down.\"\n\nThe drama continued after the auction ended. In an unprecedented tactic for climate activists, Utah environmental writer Terry Tempest Williams submitted late bids for three pieces of land that hadn't drawn any interest from bidders at the auction, just in case a company later changed its mind and decided to lease them. The Bureau of Land Management still hasn't finalized the results of the auction, so it's unclear if anyone matched her late bids.\n\n\"It has deeply shaken my core as an American citizen to watch these beautiful, powerful public lands that are all of ours, and our inheritance, being sold for $2 an acre, $3 an acre,\" Tempest Williams said after the auction. \"Two dollars an acre? That doesn't buy us a cup of coffee, and yet that's what we’re being told that America's lands are worth.\"\n\nCritics of \"keep it in the ground\" say limiting fossil fuel extraction could cause energy prices to spike, or else force the United States to import more coal, oil and gas from overseas. The best and only way to curb climate change, they say, is a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade system, which would reduce demand for fossil fuels by making them more expensive than clean energy.\n\n\"If you don't address the demand side, the supply side won't come,\" said economist Frank Wolak, director of Stanford University's Program on Energy and Sustainable Development. \"Everything we use, you name it, it has fossil fuels in it. That's the absurdity of this argument.\"\n\nRep. Jared Huffman, D-San Rafael, called those kinds of arguments \"nonsense.\" The United States has more than enough fossil fuels at its disposal to keep the lights on as the country transitions to clean energy, he said, without the federal government opening up more leases.\n\n\"We are awash in oil and gas. Coal is dying. There's simply no reason to continue to let these extractive industries call the shots on public resources,\" Huffman said. \"These fossil fuel deposits are under our federal lands and off our shores — they belong to the American people. They don't belong to Exxon or Shell or whatever extractive industry wants to profit from them.\"\n\nEXTINCTION CRISIS: How climate change is intensifying threats to nature\n\nHuffman introduced the Keep It in the Ground Act in the House of Representatives earlier this year, building on a similar bill that Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley introduced in the Senate last year. Both bills would end new federal fossil fuel leases, and terminate existing leases that are not currently producing coal, oil or gas.\n\nHuffman knows his legislation won’t pass, but he hopes to move the national conversation forward.\n\n\"This is an important way to tell members of Congress and the administration that a growing movement across the country wants to see them do the right thing,\" he said.\n\nSanders has promised he would end federal fossil fuel leasing. He has also called for a ban on hydraulic fracturing, the drilling technique commonly known as fracking. Largely because of a fracking boom over the last decade, America has become the world's top oil and gas producer.\n\n\"To my mind, global climate change is the greatest threat facing the planet, and there is no question that this will be among my top priorities as president,\" Sanders said in a statement. \"I believe we must aggressively move away from fossil fuels and toward a sustainable energy future by making huge new investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy.\"\n\nClinton told an activist earlier this year that ending fossil fuel extraction on federal land is \"a done deal,\" although she didn't explain what exactly that means. Campaign spokesperson Jesse Ferguson told The Desert Sun that Clinton \"will begin phasing down fossil fuel production on federal lands,\" and will \"reform our current leasing program to ensure taxpayers get a fair deal and oppose offshore drilling in the Atlantic and Arctic Ocean.\"\n\nClinton also wants the United States to generate enough renewable energy to power every home in the country by 2027, and to cut oil consumption by one-third over that time period.\n\nThe Desert Sun reached out to all three Republican presidential candidates to ask for their views on fossil fuel extraction. None of their campaigns responded to multiple requests for comment.\n\nPUBLIC OPINION: Most Americans say climate is changing, humans to blame\n\nCruz’s views are the easiest to pin down. The Texas senator denies the world is getting warmer, and has called climate change a liberal plot to control \"the economy, the energy sector and every aspect of our lives.\" He's introduced bills that would approve the Keystone XL pipeline, open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling and prohibit the federal government from regulating carbon emissions and fracking. He voted against a bipartisan compromise bill last year that ended the ban on crude oil exports, since it also extended tax credits for solar and wind energy.\n\nTrump is more of a wild card. Like Cruz, he rejects the scientific consensus on human-caused climate change, and he's criticized Obama's carbon regulations as economically disastrous. He's also slammed Obama for funding clean energy development. He once tweeted that Palm Springs had been \"destroyed — absolutely destroyed — by the world's ugliest wind farm.\"\n\nBut the fossil fuel industry is wary of Trump, whose policy proposals are few and far between. The real estate mogul supported the extension of the wind tax credit last year, and he's criticized Cruz for receiving so much campaign funding from oil companies. The American Energy Alliance — a pro-fossil fuel lobby group with ties to the billionaire Koch brothers — says on its website that it would be \"difficult at this time to determine if (Trump) would be a strong advocate for American families in the White House on this policy area.\"\n\nOhio Gov. John Kasich — who has little chance of winning the Republican nomination — acknowledges that the climate is changing, but says he isn't sure how big a role humans play. He criticized the Paris climate talks, saying Secretary of State John Kerry \"should have gone (to Paris) to get our allies together to fight ISIS instead.\" He also signed a bill temporarily freezing Ohio’s clean energy mandate, although he later criticized state lawmakers for recommending the freeze be extended indefinitely.\n\nTHE CURRENT: Sign up for The Desert Sun's energy and water newsletter\n\nAsked which presidential candidate they prefer on climate, most \"keep it in the ground\" activists interviewed for this article chose Sanders. They pointed to his early opposition to Keystone XL, his aversion to corporate interests, and his willingness to talk about the ways that capitalism and income inequality could worsen the impacts of climate change on poor communities.\n\nClinton, on the other hand, had received $300,000 from oil and gas interests this election cycle as of late March, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. That was far less than Cruz's $1 million haul, but nearly three times as much as Kasich had received and 29 times as much as Trump had received. As secretary of state, Clinton aggressively promoted fracking overseas, urging governments to allow U.S. firms to drill for natural gas, even in the face of intense public opposition in some of those countries.\n\nAnother sticking point for climate activists: As secretary of state, Clinton said the Obama administration was \"inclined\" to approve Keystone XL. Later, as a presidential candidate, she came out against the pipeline. Similarly, she spent much of her tenure in the Cabinet negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal that environmental groups say could undermine global climate efforts. As a presidential candidate, she announced her opposition to the final version of the deal.\n\n\"She could have easily said that the Keystone pipeline is not in our best interest, and so we shouldn't let them do that. And she didn't. In fact, she was really wish-washy about it,\" said Kathy Albury, who along with Lovejoy and Merritt co-founded Elders Rising in Salt Lake City.\n\nOthers climate advocates have taken Clinton's side. Huffman — the California congressperson who introduced the Keep It In the Ground Act — endorsed Clinton, saying she's gotten better on climate change during the presidential campaign.\n\n\"Secretary Clinton has been refreshingly strong on climate and clean energy. You can speculate that maybe Sen. Sanders — maybe the activism that he has brought to the race has helped move her,\" Huffman said. \"Whatever the case, I like what she’s saying.\"\n\nINTERACTIVE: Where the presidential candidates stand on climate\n\nEven if the federal government were to stop issuing new oil and gas leases, the next steps for the \"keep it in the ground\" movement would be harder. Ending new leases is one thing; ending existing leases, not to mention fossil fuel extraction on private land, is another thing.\n\nReam, from WildEarth Guardians, has a few ideas for how to make that all happen. Federal officials could start by revoking existing leases that are not currently producing coal, oil or gas, he said. Then they could raise royalty rates on producing leases, so that the costs of drilling reflect the climate impacts of burning those fuels. Higher royalty rates would force companies to shut down a lot of wells and mines, Ream predicted.\n\n\"Fossil fuels are harming the public financially, and as soon as we do a proper accounting on them, everybody will realize that,\" he said. \"We’re confident that will shut down the program.\"\n\nReam thinks that if the United States limits fossil fuel extraction, investors around the world will increasingly wonder whether coal, oil and gas are smart investments. Investors are already getting nervous: More than 500 institutions have collectively pledged to divest $3.4 trillion from fossil fuel companies, according to 350.org, an advocacy group. Some of those companies could face legal action, too: Several state attorneys general are investigating whether oil giant ExxonMobil deliberately misled investors and the public about the risks posed by climate change, by funding campaigns to raise doubts about climate science.\n\nLimiting extraction is far from the only thing the next president can do to reduce emissions, experts say. Other steps could include continuing to tighten fuel-efficiency standards for cars and trucks, cracking down on \"short-lived climate pollutants\" like methane and hydrofluorocarbons, and issuing new regulations to prompt more energy-efficient homes, businesses and appliances.\n\nMann, the Penn State climate scientist, said government support for clean energy is key. While solar power is getting cheaper every year, lobbyists backed by the fossil fuel industry continue to do \"everything they can to subvert incentives for renewable energy at the state level,\" Mann said.

They also looked back at what the Earth's climate was like millions of years ago, when carbon dioxide levels were higher than today, primarily due to volcanic activity.\n\nGlobal warming is caused by the burning of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal, which release greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and oceans. Those gases have caused global temperatures to rise to levels that cannot be explained by natural causes.\n\nThe paper said that a hothouse Earth trajectory would almost certainly cause widespread river flooding, increase the risk of damage from coastal storms, and eliminate coral reefs (and all of the benefits they provide for societies) by the end of this century or earlier.\n\nMore:Global heat, fires and floods: How much did climate change fuel that hellish July?\n\nMore:Global warming risk: Rising temps from climate change linked to rise in suicides\n\nStudy lead author Will Steffen said \"our study suggests that human-induced global warming of (3.6 degrees) may trigger other Earth system processes, often called ‘feedbacks,’ that can drive further warming – even if we stop emitting greenhouse gases.\"\n\nThe feedbacks include methane release from thawing permafrost, loss of snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere, loss of Arctic summer sea ice, and dramatic reduction of Antarctic sea ice and polar ice sheets.\n\n“These tipping elements can potentially act like a row of dominoes,\" said study co-author Johan Rockstrom of the Stockholm Resilience Centre, an independent research institute that specializes in sustainable development and environmental issues.\n\n\"It may be very difficult or impossible to stop the whole row of dominoes from tumbling over. Places on Earth will become uninhabitable if 'hothouse Earth' becomes the reality,” he said.\n\nSteffen added that these feedbacks would be difficult to influence by human actions. They could not be reversed, steered or substantially slowed.\n\nThe study \"Trajectories of the Earth System in the Anthropocene\" was published in the peer-reviewed journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nAs for what to do to prevent a hothouse Earth, it's easier said than done: Decarbonize the world economy, end deforestation, improve farming techniques and promote carbon-capture technologies, among other recommendations.\n\nThis can \"only be achieved and maintained by a coordinated, deliberate effort by human societies to manage our relationship with the rest of the Earth system, recognizing that humanity is an integral, interacting component of the system,\" according to the study. \"Humanity is now facing the need for critical decisions and actions that could influence our future for centuries, if not millennia.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/08/06"}]}

He was 91.\n\nLeader of the Soviet Union from 1985 until its dissolution in 1991, Gorbachev tried to revive the moribund communist state by introducing polices of economic and political openness, known as perestroika and glasnost.\n\nBut the reforms quickly overtook him and resulted in the collapse of the authoritarian Soviet state, the freeing of Eastern European nations from Russian control and the end of decades of East-West nuclear confrontation, bringing the Cold War to a conclusion.\n\nWhen Gorbachev turned 90 last year, Russian President Vladimir Putin -- a critic of Gorbachev's policies -- hailed him in a letter published by the Kremlin as “one of the most outstanding statesmen of modern times who made a considerable impact on the history of our nation and the world.”\n\nRemembering those we lost: Celebrity Deaths 2022\n\nEven though Gorbachev won the 1990 Nobel Peace Prize for his role in ending the Cold War, he was despised by many at home as Russians blamed him for the collapse of the once-fearsome Soviet Union. When he ran for president in 1996, Gorbachev received less than 1% of the vote.\n\nIn a 1992 interview with The Associated Press, Gorbachev said he would do it all over again.\n\n“I see myself as a man who started the reforms that were necessary for the country and for Europe and the world,” he said.\n\nGorbachev presented a more modern, friendlier face to the rest of the world than that of his predecessors atop the Soviet regime, even if he didn't intend to dismantle it.\n\nUltimately, he was pushed by democratic activists led by Moscow's mayor, Boris Yeltsin, to abolish the Communist Party, eliminating a totalitarian regime that had taken over Eastern Europe and spread communism worldwide.\n\n\"Mikhail Gorbachev was arguably the most important world leader since World War II,'' said Paul D'Anieri, a professor of political science at the University of California at Riverside and the author of the 2019 book “Ukraine and Russia.\"\n\n\"The clarity with which he saw the flaws in Soviet communism and the bravery with which he tackled them are not diminished by the fact that his reforms ultimately failed in Russia. Gorbachev almost single-handedly ended the Cold War and in the process brought freedom to over a dozen countries and hundreds of millions of people.\"\n\nGorbachev served as general secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, in effect its leader, and in 1990 he became the Soviet Union's first and only president.\n\nUnder his rule, the Soviets began withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in 1988, ending a disastrous 10-year military campaign that saw 15,000 Soviet soldiers and about 1 million Afghan civilians killed.\n\nHe was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1990 for his efforts at arms control in which he and President Ronald Reagan agreed to the first reductions in nuclear stockpiles between the two nations.\n\nA year later, Gorbachev was out of power as the Soviet Union was disbanded and its Eastern European bloc freed, followed by the first free elections in more than 70 years won by his arch-enemy, Yeltsin. Gorbachev's resignation signaled the end of the Cold War period that followed World War II, which was marked by rising tensions between the United States and its allies against the Soviets and their puppet states.\n\nGorbachev hoped to revive Soviet fortunes, devastated by central planning of the economy and hampered by attempts to keep pace with a military buildup under Reagan, whose pursuit of a space-based anti-nuclear missile system agitated the Soviets. The two leaders agreed to stop making nuclear weapons and eliminate some.\n\nGorbachev's changes were criticized at home as either too much too fast or not enough, as common goods grew scarce on store shelves, civic unrest grew, particularly among the Baltic and Caucasus states, and national economic problems deepened.\n\nAs Moscow weakened, Eastern bloc countries abandoned communism, and some republics long dominated by the Soviets demanded independence. In August 1991, hard-liners in the government launched an abortive coup d'etat. They ordered the Soviet Army to put down demonstrations in Moscow, but the soldiers refused at the urging of Yeltsin.\n\nAfter the failed takeover, Gorbachev attempted to change the party further, but his power had been overwhelmed by the democratic forces. He resigned from the presidency on Dec. 25, 1991, a day before the Soviet Union dissolved.\n\nGorbachev's rise to power, after Leonid Brezhnev's death in 1982 and the two leaders who briefly followed Brezhnev, roughly coincided with that of Reagan, who was first elected in 1980 with a political appeal based in part on hardline anti-communism. The two met in five summits, the first in Geneva in 1985, where they sat around a fire with only interpreters present in an effort to find common ground and build a relationship, both between themselves and between their countries.\n\nIn 1987, they signed a treaty eliminating all nuclear-armed ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges of 310 to 3,100 miles – the first agreement to reduce nuclear weapons.\n\nReagan famously invoked Gorbachev's name in his speech in 1987 at the Berlin Wall, when he demanded that the Soviet leader tear down the wall that divided the city between east and west and became emblematic of the Cold War.\n\n\"General Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, if you seek liberalization: Come here to this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!'' Reagan said.\n\nTwo years later, in 1989, the wall was opened to permit travel between the two Berlins, and it was gone a year later.\n\nGorbachev was born Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev on March 2, 1931, to a Russian-Ukrainian peasant family in the village of Privolnoye, Krasnogvardeisky district, Stavropol territory, an agricultural region in the south of the Russian republic.\n\nAfter leaving power, Gorbachev focused on his Gorbachev Foundation, focusing on change in Russia.

See his response 01:28\n\nUrsula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, wrote on Twitter that Gorbachev's role in ending the Cold War \"opened the way for a free Europe. This legacy is one we will not forget.\"\n\nWith his outgoing, charismatic nature, Gorbachev broke the mold for Soviet leaders who until then had mostly been remote, icy figures. Almost from the start of his leadership, he strove for significant reforms, so the system would work more efficiently and more democratically. Hence the two key phrases of the Gorbachev era: \"glasnost\" (openness) and \"perestroika\" (restructuring).\n\n\"I began these reforms and my guiding stars were freedom and democracy, without bloodshed. So the people would cease to be a herd led by a shepherd. They would become citizens,\" he later said.\n\nHe will be buried next to his wife at the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow, RIA Novosti reported citing the Gorbachev Foundation.\n\nFrom farm labor to party's rising star\n\nGorbachev had humble beginnings: He was born into a peasant family on March 2, 1931 near Stavropol, and as a boy, he did farm labor along with his studies, working with his father who was a combine harvester operator. In later life, Gorbachev said he was \"particularly proud of my ability to detect a fault in the combine instantly, just by the sound of it.\"\n\nHe became a member of the Communist Party in 1952 and completed a law degree at Moscow University in 1955. It was here that he met -- and married -- fellow student Raisa Titarenko.\n\nDuring the early 1960s, Gorbachev became head of the agriculture department for the Stavropol region. By the end of the decade he had risen to the top of the party hierarchy in the region. He came to the attention of Mikhail Suslov and Yuri Andropov, members of the Politburo, the principal policy-setting body of the Communist Part of the Soviet Union, who got him elected to the Central Committee in 1971 and arranged foreign trips for their rising star.\n\nIn 1978, Gorbachev was back in Moscow, and the next year he was chosen as a candidate member of the Politburo. His stewardship of Soviet agriculture was not a success. As he came to realize, the collective system was fundamentally flawed in more than one way.\n\nA full Politburo member since 1980, Gorbachev became more influential in 1982 when his mentor, Andropov, succeeded Leonid Brezhnev as general secretary of the party. He built a reputation as an enemy of corruption and inefficiency, finally rising to the top party spot in March 1985.\n\nMikhail Gorbachev, seen in 1984, when he was a Russian Politburo member and second in line at the Kremlin.\n\n'A man one can do business with'\n\nHoping to shift resources to the civilian sector of the Soviet economy, Gorbachev began to argue in favor of an end to the arms race with the West.\n\nHowever, throughout his six years in office, Gorbachev always seemed to be moving too fast for the party establishment -- which saw its privileges threatened -- and too slow for more radical reformers, who hoped to do away with the one-party state and the command economy.\n\nDesperately trying to stay in control of the reform process, he seemed to have underestimated the depth of the economic crisis. He also seemed to have had a blind spot for the power of the nationality issue: Glasnost created ever-louder calls for independence from the Baltics and other Soviet republics in the late 1980s.\n\nHe was successful in foreign policy, but primarily from an international perspective, with other world leaders taking note. Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher called him \"a man one can do business with.\"\n\nIn 1986, face to face with American President Ronald Reagan at a summit in Reykjavik, Iceland, Gorbachev made a stunning proposal: eliminate all long-range missiles held by the United States and the Soviet Union. It was the beginning of the end of the Cold War.\n\nHe was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1990 \"for his leading role in the peace process which today characterizes important parts of the international community.\"\n\nThe pact that resulted, the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, endured as a pillar of arms control for three decades until, in 2019, the United States formally withdrew and the Russian government said it had been consigned to the trash can.\n\nGorbachev speaks during a visit to Ottawa, Canada in 1990.\n\nHard-liners revolt\n\nWhile Gorbachev's arms control agreements with the US could be seen as also being in the Soviet interest, the breakaway of some of the countries of Eastern Europe, followed by German unification and NATO membership for the new unified Germany (West Germany had previously been in NATO), angered old-school Communists.\n\nIn August 1991, hard-liners had had enough. With Gorbachev on vacation in the Crimea, they staged a revolt. Boris Yeltsin, the president of the biggest Soviet republic -- Russia -- and a fierce critic of what he considered Gorbachev's halfway reforms, nevertheless came to his rescue, facing down and defeating the coup plotters.\n\nBut across the Soviet Union, republics -- one after another -- were declaring independence and on December 25, 1991, Gorbachev resigned as Soviet president. As he read his resignation speech, Gorbachev defined what likely will be his legacy: \"The country received freedom, was liberated politically and spiritually, and that was the most important achievement.\"\n\nThe red flag that flew over the Kremlin, symbol of the USSR, was lowered. The Soviet Union -- was over and Yeltsin was in control. \"We are living in a new world,\" Gorbachev said.\n\nIn April 2012, CNN's Christiane Amanpour asked Gorbachev whether he had engineered the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nGorbachev said there had been nothing in his speeches \"until the very end\" that had supported its disintegration: \"The breakup of the union was the result of betrayal by the Soviet nomenklatura, by the bureaucracy, and also Yeltsin's betrayal. He spoke about cooperating with me, working with me on a new union treaty, he signed the draft union treaty, initialed that treaty. But at the same time, he was working behind my back.\"\n\nIn 1996 Gorbachev ran against Yeltsin for the Russian presidency but got less than 1% of the vote.\n\nSpeaking out post-presidency\n\nThree years later, Gorbachev lost the love of his life -- his wife of 46 years, Raisa -- to cancer. The couple had one daughter, Irina. \"In the worst moments I was always very calm and balanced. But now that she's gone -- I don't want to live. The central point in our lives is gone,\" he said.\n\nBut Gorbachev did go on, speaking out on nuclear disarmament, the environment, poverty -- and in his wife's memory, set up with the family the Raisa Gorbachev Foundation to fight children's cancer.\n\nPreviously, he had established the Green Cross -- to deal with ecological issues -- and the International Foundation for Socio-Economic and Political Studies, or Gorbachev Foundation. In 2011, Gorbachev also launched the annual \"Gorbachev Awards\" to celebrate \"those who have changed the world for the better.\"\n\nGorbachev's involvement in Russian politics continued as well. He was head of the Social Democratic Party of Russia from 2001 until his resignation in 2004 over conflicts with party direction and leadership.\n\nIn 2007, he became head of a new Russian political movement -- the Union of Social Democrats, which in turn set up the opposition Independent Democratic Party of Russia.\n\nHe told CNN's Christiane Amanpour in 2012 that he agreed Russian democracy was \"alive\" but added: \"That it is 'well'... not so. I am alive, but I can't say that I'm fine.\" He explained that the \"institutions of democracy are not working efficiently in Russia, because ultimately they are not free.\"\n\nMixed legacy\n\nIn an interview with CNN in 2019, Gorbachev said the US and Russia must strive to avoid a \"New Cold War\" developing despite worsening tensions. \"This might turn out to be a hot war that could mean the destruction of our entire civilization. This must not be allowed,\" he said.\n\nAnd asked about the demise of the 1987 treaty he signed with Reagan, Gorbachev expressed a hope that such arms control agreements could be revived.\n\n\"All the agreements that are there are preserved and not destroyed,\" he said. \"But these are the first steps towards destruction of [that which] must not be destroyed in any case.\" The ultimate goal of arms control, he added, must be to get rid of nuclear weapons completely.\n\nGorbachev's legacy in the Baltics is also tarnished by his anti-Independence stance there. In 1991, as the push towards independence grew in the region, he ordered Soviet troops to crush demonstrations. A crackdown in January that year killed 14 people in Lithuania and five in Latvia.\n\nHis post-USSR life also included some surprises as he worked to raise money for his causes with appearances in advertisements for Pizza Hut and Louis Vuitton. In 2004 Gorbachev won a Grammy Award for best spoken word album for children for \"Prokofiev: Peter and the Wolf / Beintus: Wolf Tracks,\" which he recorded with former US President Bill Clinton and actress Sophia Loren.\n\nOther awards included the 2008 Liberty Medal from the US National Constitution Center and Russia's highest honor, the Order of St. Andrew, which was given to him on his 80th birthday in 2011 by then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev.\n\nBut to the end, Gorbachev was a leader more respected in other countries than at home. In Russia, he was reviled by some for destroying the Soviet empire and by others for moving too slowly in freeing his nation from the grip of communism. In the West, however, he remains the Nobel Peace Prize winner who helped end the Cold War.\n\n\n\nCorrection: This story has been updated to reflect that Gorbachev died at 91.", "authors": ["Susannah Cullinane", "Laura Smith-Spark"], "publish_date": "2022/08/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/12/26/passages-2013-list/4210837/", "title": "Passages 2013: List of notable deaths", "text": "USATODAY\n\nThis year's Passages, USA TODAY's annual roundup of notable people we lost in 2013, is a rich and often unexpected series of encounters.\n\nBelow, we remember the accomplishments of those who left us this year.\n\nBUSINESS\n\nHerbert M.

Welch\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nMandela spent 27 years in prison before his release in 1990\n\nHe was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993\n\nThe anti-apartheid leader retired from political life in 2004\n\nNelson Mandela, whose successful struggle against South Africa's apartheid system of racial segregation and discrimination made him a global symbol for the cause of human rights and earned him the Nobel Prize, died Thursday. He was 95.\n\nSouth African President Jacob Zuma announced Mandela's death at a news conference, saying, \"We've lost our greatest son.\" Mandela had been in failing health for months.\n\nMandela spent 27 years in South African prisons before his release in 1990. He negotiated with the nation's white leaders toward establishing democracy and was elected South Africa's first black president in 1994, serving one term.\n\n\"He probably will be remembered both inside and outside South Africa as a political saint,\" said Michael Parks, the former editor of the Los Angeles Times who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1987 for his coverage of Mandela and South Africa's struggles.\n\n\"He had flaws that he had to overcome. He had a temper he had to deal with. He had to deal with what was going to be life imprisonment. Not all his decisions were great decisions, but what political leader's are?\" Parks said.\n\nAs a young man, Mandela worked as a lawyer and political activist to dismantle white minority rule under which blacks were denied political rights and basic freedoms. He began by emulating the non-violent methods of India's Mahatma Gandhi. But a turn to violence as the leader of the armed wing of the African National Congress that included a bombing campaign against government targets led to his imprisonment for more than a quarter-century.\n\nA worldwide campaign against apartheid pressured the regime into releasing Mandela in 1990 at age 71. He vowed to seek peace and reconciliation with South Africa's whites — but only if blacks received full rights as citizens.\n\nAmid tense negotiations with the government and the threat of violence on all sides, Mandela emerged as a leader who guided South Africa to a new democratic government guaranteeing equal rights to all citizens. Four years later, Mandela became his nation's first black president.\n\nMandela's charisma, stoic optimism and conciliation toward adversaries and oppressors established him as one of the world's most recognizable statesmen of the 20th century and a hero of South African democracy.\n\n\"If you want to make peace with your enemy, you have to work with your enemy,\" Mandela once said. \"Then he becomes your partner.\"\n\nMandela was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 along with South Africa's president at the time, Frederik Willem de Klerk, for working together to dismantle apartheid.\n\nHe was born Rolihlahla Mandela in Mvezo, a village on the Mbashe River in the Transkei region on the eastern cape of South Africa in 1918. He lived his earliest years in Qunu, a village so small there were no roads, only footpaths, and families lived in huts. He was a member of the Xhosa-speaking Thembu tribe.\n\nHe was baptized in the United Methodist Church and given the name Nelson by a teacher.\n\nHis father, a counselor to the tribal chief, died when Mandela was 9. He was adopted by the chief and lived in the more sophisticated provincial capital, where he attended a Wesleyan mission school, learning English and excelling in track and boxing. He studied law at the University of Fort Hare and University of Witwatersrand after fleeing to Johannesburg to avoid a marriage arranged by the tribal regent.\n\nThere he became involved in the anti-apartheid movement and in 1943 joined the African National Congress, where he became a leader in resistance against the ruling National Party and its apartheid policies.\n\nHe was charged with treason in 1956, along with 155 other activists, but the charges were dropped. The government outlawed the ANC in 1960, and Mandela went underground to work against the regime.\n\nMandela veered from non-violence as a method for change and argued for setting up a military wing of the ANC and violent tactics to bring down apartheid. Opposition to the regime's \"pass laws\" that dictated where black people were allowed to live and work grew intense, and in 1960, police fired on demonstrators and killed 69 people in what became known as the Sharpeville Massacre.\n\nIn 1961, Mandela became the leader of the ANC's armed wing in which he oversaw bomb attacks against government buildings. He was designated a terrorist by the white government and arrested in 1962. In June 1964, he was sentenced along with seven others to life in prison for plotting to overthrow the government through hundreds of acts of sabotage.\n\n\"I have cherished the idea of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities,\" he said, acting as his own lawyer at his trial. \"It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But if need be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.\"\n\nHe spent 18 years of his imprisonment at Robben Island Prison off Cape Town, where the harsh conditions included laboring in a lime quarry. During that time, he became the focus of an international campaign for release led by his lifelong friend and law partner, Oliver Tambo, and Mandela's wife, Winnie, whom he married in 1958 after his first marriage to Evelyn Mase ended in 1957.\n\nIn the 1980s, the ANC under Tambo ramped up bombing attacks to include civilian targets. In one of the worst examples, an ANC car bomb exploded in downtown Pretoria in May 1983, killing 19 people.\n\nIn an attempt to calm the violence, President P.W. Botha offered in 1985 to free Mandela if he would renounce violence as a tool for change. Mandela refused.\n\nDemands for Mandela's release became a popular civil rights cause in the Western world in the 1980s, along with calls for an end to apartheid from the United States and other nations. Worldwide economic sanctions against South Africa were tightened.\n\nIn the USA, public demonstrations and civil disobedience, often led by celebrities, were staged outside the South African government's diplomatic offices and other institutions aimed at pressuring the regime to free Mandela and abolish racial separatism laws. Under pressure from foreign nations and both whites and blacks in South Africa, de Klerk freed Mandela in 1990 and lifted the ban on the ANC.\n\nParks said Mandela's long imprisonment was a transformative experience in which he accepted his plight and found ways to use it to advance the cause of a multiracial South African future.\n\n\"What he did on Robben Island, he created essentially a school for the young black men who were sentenced for their activities by the apartheid government,\" Parks said. It was, he said, \"a school that trained them to look forward with optimism, to adhere to the ANC's strong belief that South Africa belonged to all the people who lived in it, black and white together.\"\n\nMandela emerged into a movement that had been scandalized by charges of heavy-handed tactics by Mandela's wife, Winnie, who had taken a major role in ANC activities while Mandela was in jail. She had publicly justified the murder of her political opponents in the black community, and her bodyguards were accused of terrorizing her adversaries.\n\nShe was convicted in 1991 of kidnapping in the murder of a 14-year-old boy accused of being an informant. Her six-year jail term was reduced to a fine on appeal, and Mandela divorced her in 1992.\n\nTwo years later, he became president of South Africa. In his inaugural speech, he said the struggle for freedom for blacks was difficult but in the end produced \"a united, democratic, non-racial and non-sexist government.\" He served one term, which ended in 1999.\n\nParks said Mandela's main accomplishment as president was \"not letting the country devolve into a racial war.\"\n\n\"It could have,\" Parks said. \"Everybody thought that was a great danger. In some respects, it was the personality of Mandela and the ANC's commitment to a non-racial society that saw it through.\"\n\nMandela retired from political life in 2004, at 85, to spend his final years in what he called \"quiet reflection\" with his third wife, Graca Machel, the widow of the former president of Mozambique. The two married on his 80th birthday in 1998.\n\nHe maintained a global presence through his Mandela Foundation and in 2007 organized a group of senior world figures he called The Elders to work on global problems. He became an advocate for HIV/AIDS after the death of his son, Makgatho, from the disease in 2005, despite strong taboos in his country against those who had the virus. Mandela was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2001.\n\nEmblematic of the dramatic changes in South Africa and his transformational role, the nation announced in February 2012, on the 22nd anniversary of his release from prison, that Mandela's image would appear on South African paper currency.\n\nUndergirding Mandela's career was an abiding dedication to diversity, inclusion and universal human rights while preserving ethnic and cultural differences, said Anders Hallengren, a Swedish historian and philosopher.\n\n\"Nelson Mandela's fight for freedom was guided by an idea of integrated integrity: All nations and all religious groups of the country should have equal rights and preserve their native tongues and cultural characteristics,\" Hallengren told USA TODAY.\n\n\"When the first 'black' government (of South Africa) was formed in 1994, it was in reality a 'rainbow government,' \" he said. \"Ministers of state were blacks, whites, Indians, Muslims, Christians, liberals.\"\n\n\"In Mandela's solution to the main problems of the world, all cultures meet on equal terms,\" Hallengren said.\n\nIn awarding the prize, the Nobel Committee said Mandela and de Klerk managed a peaceful transition to a new political order based on democracy through \"personal integrity and great political courage.\" It said that beyond ending racial suppression in South Africa, their \"policy of peace and reconciliation also points the way to the peaceful resolution of similar deep-rooted conflicts elsewhere in the world.\"\n\nOne of Mandela's last public appearances was in 2010, when he attended the closing ceremony of the World Cup soccer games in South Africa.\n\nIn his autobiography, Long Walk to Freedom, Mandela wrote that when he walked out of prison, his mission was \"to liberate the oppressed and the oppressor both,\" because both are robbed of their humanity when human freedom is restricted.\n\n\"I have walked that long road to freedom. I have tried not to falter,\" he wrote. \"I have made missteps along the way. But I have discovered the secret that after climbing a great hill, one only finds there are many more hills to climb.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/12/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/07/17/nelson-mandela-100th-birthday-south-africa/764000002/", "title": "Nelson Mandela 100th birthday: 100 facts about South African leader", "text": "Nelson Mandela, whose successful struggle against South Africa's apartheid system of racial segregation and discrimination made him a global symbol for the cause of human rights and earned him the Nobel Prize, would have turned 100 years old on Wednesday.\n\nOn the anniversary of his birth, here are 100 facts about the historic peacemaker who died in 2013.\n\n1. Nelson Mandela was the first black president of South Africa from 1994-1999 and the first president elected after the end of apartheid, an extensive system of segregation and discrimination based on race.\n\n2. Mandela’s real first name is Rolihlahla, meaning \"pulling the branch of a tree\" or \"troublemaker.\" He was given the name Nelson by a teacher because, in the early 20th century, South African children were often given English names due to the colonial presence in the country.\n\n3. For over 20 years, Mandela worked for the African National Congress, the opposition party that advocated for black civil and human rights under apartheid.\n\n4. Mandela's father, Nkosi Mphakanyiswa Gadla Mandela, died from lung disease. Nelson was 12 years old at the time.\n\n5. Mandela was then raised by a Thembu regent, Chief Jongintaba Dalindyebo, for whom his father was an adviser. The Thembu people traditionally reside in the eastern part of South Africa.\n\n6. Mandela often disguised himself to escape being arrested for his political activity, dressing like a fieldworker or a chef to evade the police.\n\n7. Dressed as a chauffeur, Mandela was arrested on August 5, 1962 for inciting strikes and leaving the country without permission. He would be in jail until 1990, serving time in multiple prisons including Robben Island, where he spent 18 years.\n\n8. In 1963, Mandela was also charged with sabotage. At his trial, which is now known as the Rivonia Trial, he gave his famous Speech from the Dock, stating, “I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.”\n\n9. In prison, Mandela lived in a small cell without a bed or plumbing, forced to do hard labor in a limestone quarry during the day.\n\n10. His work in the quarry permanently damaged Mandela’s eyes, injuring his tear glands so severely that the leader could not produce tears later in life.\n\n11. Mandela earned his bachelor of law degree from the University of South Africa while imprisoned.\n\n12. Robben Island was jokingly called the “University of Robben Island” because many of Mandela’s fellow inmates learned to read and write and debated politics and history while serving time alongside the leader. Some inmates even earned “diplomas” signed by Mandela.\n\n13. Mandela communicated with other anti-apartheid leaders, such as Desmond Tutu and Oliver Tambo, while still in prison. He also completed drafts of his best-selling autobiography \"Long Walk to Freedom.\"\n\n14. Mandela had six children: Madiba, Makaziwe, Magkatho, Pumla, Zenani and Zindzi. He also had 17 grandchildren and 19 great grandchildren.\n\n15. Three of Mandela’s children have died. Madiba died of a car accident at 24, Makaziwe died in infancy and Magkatho died of HIV/AIDS complications at 55.\n\n16. Mandela had three sisters, three half-brothers and six half-sisters.\n\n17. He was raised in Qunu, South Africa as a member of the Xhosa-speaking Thembu tribe.\n\n18. Mandela enjoyed many sports growing up. He was an avid boxer and long-distance runner from a young age. Mandela particularly enjoyed boxing because it offered everyone an equal chance to participate. In \"Long Walk to Freedom\", he said, “Boxing is egalitarian. In the ring, rank, age, color and wealth are irrelevant.”\n\n19. Mandela exercised every morning for the 27 years he spent in prison, according to the BBC.\n\n20. Mandela won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993, sharing the award with Frederik Willem de Klerk for the “peaceful termination of the apartheid regime, and for laying the foundations for a new democratic South Africa.”\n\n21. Mandela was baptized into the United Methodist Church and graduated from a Methodist high school.\n\n22. The leader was the first in his family to receive a formal education.\n\n23. Though Mandela started college at the University of Witwatersrand, he was expelled for participating in student protests.\n\n24. In college, Mandela thought he would pursue a career as an interpreter or clerk in the Native Affairs office of the South African government.\n\n25. Mandela also picked up acting and ballroom dancing at the university.\n\n26. After he was expelled, Mandela moved to Johannesburg in 1941 to avoid an arranged marriage by tribal leaders.\n\n27. Mandela’s first job after moving to Johannesburg was as a security guard at a mining company, where he also finished his bachelor’s degree through the University of South Africa.\n\n28. He became more interested in South African politics when he started working as a law clerk at the law firm Witkin, Sidelsky and Eidelman after moving to Johannesburg.\n\n29. In 1952, he opened the first South African black law partnership with a friend.\n\n30. In the same year, Mandela traveled around South Africa, leading the African National Congress Campaign for the Defiance of Unjust Laws. He promoted the Freedom Charter, a statement of the core principles of the ANC that advocated for equality for all South African people.\n\n31. He was the only black student in his law school class at the University of Witwatersrand.\n\n32. Mandela considered himself a poor student in college and law school, calling himself \"dismal,\" in his autobiography.\n\n33. During law school, Mandela became increasingly involved in politics, participating in a successful bus boycott to protest rising fares.\n\n34. In 1951, Mandela helped form the youth wing of the ANC, uniting young adults throughout South Africa against apartheid.\n\n35. Nelson Mandela was married to three women during his life: Evelyn Mase, Winnie Madikizela and Graça Machel.\n\n36. Mandela married Evelyn Mace, a nurse, in 1944. The couple had two sons and two daughters, but they divorced in 1958.\n\n37. Mandela was married to Winnie Mandela from 1958 until 1996. She was an anti-apartheid activist and served as the Deputy Minister of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology in South Africa from 1994-1996.\n\n38. Mandela was indicted for treason in 1955 for advocating for a violent overthrow of the South African government, though he was acquitted in 1961.\n\n39. In 1960, the ANC was banned in South Africa. The group was forced to operate underground. During this time, Mandela advocated for a military wing of the ANC called Umkhonto we Sizwe, or Spear of the Nation.\n\n40. In later years, he defended his endorsement of violent resistance, stating, “(I)t would be wrong and unrealistic for African leaders to continue preaching peace and nonviolence at a time when the government met our peaceful demands with force.”\n\n41. During the early 1960s, Mandela traveled around Africa and throughout England to garner support for the anti-apartheid movement, even receiving military training in Morocco and Ethiopia.\n\n42. The press referred to Mandela as the “Black Pimpernel,” a reference to Emma Orczy's 1905 novel \"The Scarlet Pimpernel,\" which features a character who hides from authorities during the French Revolution.\n\n43. Mandela would also call individual reporters during this time, telling them about the police’s ineptitude and how he would evade them.\n\n44. According to the Nelson Mandela foundation, as a child, Mandela was inspired to fight for justice by the stories of his ancestors who also advocated for equality in South Africa.\n\n45. The CIA played a role in Mandela’s ultimate arrest in 1962, tipping off South African authorities for fear he supported communism and would help its spread around the world.\n\n46. Initially, Mandela was classified as a Class D prisoner. This meant he could only receive one visit and one letter every six months on Robben Island.\n\n47. Mandela kept a garden throughout is time in prison. In \"Long Walk to Freedom,\" he wrote,“A garden is one of the few things in prison that one could control ... Being a custodian of this patch of earth offered a small taste of freedom.”\n\n48. Mandela was jailed with fellow ANC revolutionary Walter Sisulu, who also helped lead the fight against apartheid in South Africa.\n\n49. Mandela was not allowed to attend the funeral of his son or of his mother while he was in prison. Mandela’s mother died in 1968, and his son, Madiba, died in 1969.\n\n50. Mandela’s served his sentence in three prisons in South Africa: Robben Island, Pollsmoor Prison and Victor Verster Prison.\n\n51. In 1985, South African President P.W. Botha offered to release Mandela from prison if he would denounce armed rebellion in the country. Mandela refused, stating, “What freedom am I being offered while the organization of the people remains banned? Only free men can negotiate. A prisoner cannot enter into contracts.”\n\n52. In 1994, Mandela campaigned on “a better life for all,” promising to extend access to water, electricity, education and housing for all South Africans when he was running for president of South Africa.\n\n53. Mandela advocated for the voting age to be lowered from 14 to 16 in South Africa in the 1994 elections, though the policy was never enacted.\n\n54. Mandela was overwhelmingly elected president. The ANC received over 60 percent of the popular vote.\n\n55. In 1995, Mandela established the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which investigated human and civil rights violations committed against black South Africans under apartheid.\n\n56. The commission held over two years of hearings investigating sexual assault, torture, assassination and other injustices committed against black South Africans. Mandela called the commission a success and said it “has helped us move away from the past to concentrate on the present and the future.\"\n\n57. Mandela served only one term as president.\n\n58. In his 1994 inaugural speech, Mandela outlined his vision of South Africa as a united country, “a rainbow nation at peace with itself and the world.”\n\n59. Unification between white and black South Africans was central to Mandela’s administration, even appointing members of the National Party, the ruling party under apartheid, to his presidential cabinet.\n\n60. During the 1995 Rugby World Cup, Mandela encouraged black South Africans to root for the South African team, the Springboks. The team, which had been banned from international competition due to apartheid, became a launching point for reconciliation in South Africa.\n\n61. Mandela also appointed Frederik Willem de Klerk, the last South African president under apartheid, to co-serve as the Deputy President of South Africa from 1994-1996 with Thabo Mbeki, a black South African.\n\n62. Mandela’s administration focused on closing the disparity in wealth and resources between white and black South Africans. In 1994, nearly 30 percent of South Africans lacked a safe supply of water. In 1999, that number was approximately 20 percent.\n\n63. During Mandela’s administration, 1.5 million more South African children were enrolled in school and 2 million people gained access to electricity.\n\n64. Mandela was also a champion of women’s rights around the world. In his state of the nation address in 1994, he said, “Freedom cannot be achieved unless the women have been emancipated from all forms of oppression.”\n\n65. Mandela entertained celebrities such as Sugar Ray Leonard, Michael Jackson and Whoopi Goldberg in South Africa.\n\n66. Mandela also worked with leaders such as Cuba's Fidel Castro and Libya's Muammar Gaddafi, hoping to promote peace worldwide. Though he was criticized for befriending the leaders, he responded that “the enemies of countries in the West are not our enemies.”\n\n67. During his tenure, Mandela encouraged other nations to heal national divisions through reconciliation, including the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the conflict between India and Pakistan.\n\n68. Mandela helped meditate the ethnic conflict between the Tutsi and Hutu groups in the Burundian civil war after his term as president.\n\n69. In 1999, Mandela established the Nelson Mandela Foundation. According to their website, the non-profit is focused on promoting dialogue about equality and continuing Mandela's legacy for peace.\n\n70. Mandela also established the Nelson Mandela Children’s Fund in 1995 to help children struggling with hunger, abuse, exploitation and homelessness.\n\n71. Mandela was a firm believer in education, publicly stating, “Education is the most powerful weapon we can use to change the world.”\n\n72. After his term as president, Mandela worked with the Nelson Mandela Foundation to address rural poverty and inequality in South Africa.\n\n73. In 2007, a bronze statue of Mandela was mounted in Parliament Square in London. When the statue was unveiled, Mandela said, \"The history of the struggle in South Africa is rich with the stories of heroes and heroines, some of them leaders, some of them followers. All of them deserve to be remembered. We thank the British people once again for their relentless efforts in supporting us during the dark years.\"\n\n74. Mandela has received over 200 different awards for his contributions to peace in South Africa, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\n75. In 2012, scientists on South Africa’s southwest coast named a newly-discovered species of woodpecker after the leader called nelsonmandelai.\n\n76. Mandela’s name has also been used for a species of orchid, a racehorse and a nuclear particle, according to the Nelson Mandela Centre of Memory,\n\n77. In 2005, Mandela founded the Mandela Rhodes Scholarship that provides postgraduate funding for African students.\n\n78.

A lifelong fan of Indian food, his first meal after being released from prison was chicken curry.\n\n81. Mandela appears in Spike Lee’s 1992 film \"Malcolm X.\" He played a teacher and recited speeches by civil rights leaders.\n\n82. Mandela dedicated \"Long Walk to Freedom\" to his children, grandchildren and great grandchildren.\n\n83. Mandela also published \"Conversations with Myself\" in 2010, a collection of his speeches, letters and other talks.\n\n84. On his 80th birthday, Mandela was married to Graça Machel, a widow of the former president of Mozambique, Samora Machel.\n\n85. Mandela loved music, once saying “Music is a great blessing. It has the power to elevate and liberate us. It sets people free to dream. It can unite us to sing with one voice. Such is the value of music.” Mandela would often sing traditional South African songs to cheer up his fellow prisoners.\n\n86. In 2003, Mandela hosted the first 46664 concert, named after his prison number, at Green Point Stadium in Cape Town. The concert raised awareness about the spread of HIV/AIDS in South Africa.\n\n87. The ANC was deemed a terrorist organization under the Reagan administration. Mandela was still technically on U.S. terrorist watchlists until 2008.\n\n88. President Bill Clinton and Nelson Mandela were in office at the same time, and the two leaders were close. Clinton said Mandela often asked about Hillary and Chelsea Clinton, and Mandela would ask Chelsea about her homework on the phone.\n\n89. President Barack Obama called Mandela a “giant of history” in his eulogy at Mandela’s 2013 funeral.\n\n90. Mandela met with first lady Michelle Obama during her 2011 trip to South Africa.\n\n91. After his son died from complications surrounding HIV/AIDS, Mandela worked to fight stigma against the disease. In announcing the death of his son, Mandela said, “Let us give publicity to HIV/AIDS and not hide it, because the only way to make it appear like a normal illness like TB, like cancer, is always to come out and to say somebody has died because of HIV/AIDS.”\n\n92. In 2007, Mandela helped establish the Elders, a group of global leaders who promote peace and human rights worldwide. Members of the group have included former president Jimmy Carter, former secretary-general of the U.N. Ban Ki-moon and former secretary-general of the U.N. Kofi Annan.\n\n93. Mandela made his final public appearance during the World Cup closing ceremony in 2010 at the age of 92. The final came down to Spain and the Netherlands, with Spain taking home its first World Cup victory.\n\n94. In 2004, an 85-year-old Mandela said he was “retiring from retirement,” taking a step back from public life and his foundation to spend his final years with his wife,\n\n95. Mandela helped popularize the “Madiba shirt,” a traditional silk shirt typically with a colorful print.\n\n96. On Dec. 5, 2013 Nelson Mandela died at home in Houghton, South Africa, due to a recurring lung infection.\n\n97. Mandela’s memorial service was held at the First National Bank Stadium in Johannesburg. It was attended by family, South African leaders and more than 91 heads of state.\n\n98. Memorials were also held in Washington, D.C., Abu Dhabi and London following the leader’s death.\n\n99. In November 2009, the U.N. declared July 18 – the leader’s birthday – Mandela Day in honor of his contribution to peace around the world.\n\n100. Many South Africans refer to Mandela as “mkhulu,” which means grandfather in Zulu.\n\nResearch from the Nelson Mandela Foundation, The New York Times, Reuters, the Nobel Foundation and Long Walk to Freedom.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/07/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/in-our-schools/2021/12/04/maria-ressa-toms-river-albert-dietrich/8836315002/", "title": "Toms River Regional honors Nobel Peace Prize winner, former ...", "text": "TOMS RIVER - A downtown building owned by Toms River Regional schools will be named after former superintendent Albert J.

The building at 54 Washington St., which houses the district's central registration office as well as an employee health center, will be named after Dietrich.\n\nThe building is owned by the township, which leases it to the school district for $1 a year. The township council approved naming the building after Dietrich in March. Former Interim Superintendent Thomas Gialanella noted the school district had received a petition with more than 200 signatures requesting the building be named for Dietrich.\n\nDietrich, who passed away in February at age 85, was only 44 when he became superintendent of the Toms River Regional school district in 1979.

He wrote the district's first teachers contract and eventually became president of the Toms River Education Association, Toms River Regional's teachers union.\n\nHe developed the district's first alcohol and substance abuse program and founded Toms River's Regional's Alternative Learning Center, for at-risk students. He was inducted into Toms River Regional's Hall of Fame in 2003 and in 2014, he was inducted into the district's Athletic Hall of Fame because of his staunch support of scholastic sports.\n\nRessa, whose family moved to Toms River from the Philippines when she was 10 years old, graduated from High School North in 1982.\n\nThe 58-year-old Ressa, a journalist, was honored with the Nobel Peace Prize along with fellow journalist Dmitry Muratov. They were cited \"for their efforts to safeguard freedom of expression, which is a precondition for democracy and lasting peace,\" the Norwegian Nobel Committee announced in early October. Watch her reflect on the Peace Prize -- and the uncertainty of her situation -- in the video above.\n\nRessa spent nearly 20 years covering Southeast Asia as an investigative reporter for CNN, where her reporting included coverage of terrorist networks. In 2012 in the Philippines she launched The Rappler, an online news website known for its critical coverage of the government.\n\nIn 2020 she was arrested for and convicted of \"cyberlibel,\" a move that was widely condemned by human-rights groups.

She eventually learned how to play eight instruments under the tutelage of High School North teacher Donald Spaulding.\n\n“Everyone has a teacher who helped make them who they are. Mine is Donald Spaulding,” Ressa wrote in 2019, shortly after Spaulding died. “When we arrived in Toms River, I was the short, quiet kid who could barely speak English.\n\n\"Mr. Spaulding nurtured me and others like me: kids looking to belong, looking for our place in the world.

All are titles and recognition for which we are familiar with but may not realize that they belong to graduates of Tennessee’s private, nonprofit colleges and universities.\n\nTo highlight these success stories, the Tennessee Independent Colleges and Universities Association recently announced the inaugural class of outstanding honorees for the Tennessee Independent Colleges and Universities Association Hall of Fame.\n\nSeveral of the inductees are easily recognized and others less so, but they all have deeply and positively impacted our society.\n\nAmong the 24 individuals honored, the Class of 2020 includes: the late Civil Rights Champion and Congressman John Lewis, proclaimed presidential historian and biographer Jon Meacham, renowned psychiatrist and pioneer of minority mental healthcare Dr. Altha Stewart, and many more.\n\nEach of the Hall of Fame honorees credits their liberal arts education in Tennessee for helping them to expand their minds, to learn how to think critically, and to eventually tackle some of our nation’s biggest opportunities and challenges.\n\nMeet the honorees\n\nFormer U.S. Rep. John Lewis, who fought for decades against racial injustice, continued to push for fairness and equality until his death on July 17. Lewis began his civil rights work as a 17-year-old studying Theology at American Baptist College in Nashville. He later returned to earn a degree from Fisk University here where he broadened his work in social justice.\n\nThe education he received at these two Tennessee private colleges laid the foundation for him to make incredible contributions to our nation including: leading 600 protestors across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, adding four million minorities to the voter rolls, and ultimately acting as the ‘Conscience of Congress’ in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nHear more Tennessee Voices: Get the weekly opinion newsletter for insightful and thought provoking columns.\n\nPulitzer Prize winning biographer Jon Meacham graduated with a bachelor’s degree in English from Sewanee: The University of the South in 1991. He went on to become the youngest Editor-in-Chief of Newsweek, a regular contributor to The New York Times, and most famously, as a prolific presidential historian and biographer. Meacham said of his liberal arts education, “Sewanee gives us the capacity to draw on the lessons of the past in order to understand the present and shape the future.”\n\nDr. Altha Stewart was among the first class of women admitted to what is now Christian Brothers University in Memphis. She graduated with a degree in Biology in 1973. That foundation propelled her to Temple University Medical School. Dr. Stewart has dedicated decades to improving public medicine and minority issues in mental healthcare. She became the first black president of the American Psychiatric Association and is an internationally recognized expert in the field.\n\nWe invite everyone to take some time to read more about these and so many other outstanding Tennessee graduates who spent their formative years at private colleges and universities in our state. They are as varied as medical professionals, faith leaders, educators, philanthropists, and business leaders.\n\nWhile the term “liberal arts education” may have fallen out of favor with some, one only needs to look at how it helped John Lewis, Jon Meacham, Dr. Stewart, and others accomplish their goals.\n\nThese distinguished alumni learned about great literature and the lessons of history, how to think critically and analyze problems -- skills that ultimately helped them lead incredibly successful lives and change the world.\n\nToday, our private colleges and universities are at work preparing the next generation of leaders. As we confront the many challenges of 2020, that is now more important than ever.\n\nDr. Claude Pressnell is President of the Tennessee Independent Colleges and Universities Association.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/10/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/06/24/most-important-event-the-year-you-were-born/37164307/", "title": "The most important events from 1917 to 2017: WWI to Trump's election", "text": "Angelo Young and John Harrington\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nOver the past 100 years we’ve witnessed some of the most profound changes in human history.\n\nBetween wars, technological developments, progress in civil rights and breakthroughs in science and medicine, the old order that held back hundreds of millions of people has been swept away.\n\nCenturies-old empires crumbled as new ideologies – from communism to fascism – for better or worse found roots in many places of the world. Progressive human rights ideas also emerged and changed the world as women, blacks, and the LGBT community demanded, and often won, equal rights. Technology evolved, modifying and innovating our lives in ways never dreamed of.\n\nThe world certainly has progressed, but wars have raged on, and climate change has picked up speed, endangering the ecosystems of our planet.\n\nTo put this in perspective, 24/7 Wall St. has compiled a list of the most important event in each of the past 100 years. We drew on research material and news reports to determine what event had the biggest impact in a particular year.\n\n1919: National booze ban\n\n• Date: Oct. 28\n\n• Location: Washington D.C.\n\nCongress passes the 18th Amendment that bans the production, transport or sale of alcoholic beverages in the United States. The legislation opens the way for Prohibition, which lasts from 1920 to 1933. The public flouts the law, which succeeds in enriching gangsters and contributing to the rise of organized crime.\n\n1920: Women's suffrage\n\n• Date: Aug. 26\n\n• Location: Washington, D.C.\n\nThough the United States was founded under democratic principles, only a minority of its population (starting with white landowning males over the age of 21) could actually vote. But after the 19th Amendment of the Constitution is passed, women finally gain a voice and the right to cast their ballots.\n\nSports gambling:Why sports betting hasn't gone nationwide yet after Supreme Court ruling\n\n1921: Chinese Communists rise\n\n• Date: July 1\n\n• Location: Beijing\n\nIn a prequel to the rise of Mao Zedong and Red China, the Chinese Communist Party is founded, and three weeks later it convenes its first National Congress that is attended by Mao. It would take another 28 years before the Republic of China becomes the People's Republic of China.\n\n1922: British Empire shrinks\n\n• Date: Feb. 28\n\n• Location: London\n\nThe British Empire was at its peak toward the end of World War I, commanding a global population estimated to be as many as 570 million people, or about a fourth of the world's population at the time. The empire's size began to shrink in 1920, when Britain declared limited independence for Egypt, which leads to full independence two years later.\n\n1923: Great Kanto earthquake\n\n• Date: Sept. 1\n\n• Location: Tokyo, Yokohama, Japan\n\nThe Great Kanto earthquake, also known as the Tokyo-Yokohama earthquake, strikes the Japanese mainland at noon on Sept. 1, 1923, with a magnitude of 7.9 on the Richter scale. The death toll is estimated at 140,000 people. The force of the temblor destroys hundreds of thousands of homes that either collapse or are engulfed in fire. The quake sets off a tsunami that reaches a height of almost 40 feet at Atami in the Sagami Gulf, killing 60 people there. The most significant outcome of the catastrophe is the rebuilt Tokyo that would become a modern metropolis.\n\n1924: From Lenin to Stalin\n\n• Date: Jan. 21\n\n• Location: Moscow\n\nFollowing the death of Vladimir Lenin on Jan. 21, the new leader of the Soviet Union, Joseph Stalin, immediately begins a purge of political rivals. Some are simply moved to different positions, while others, like Leon Trotsky, the presumed successor to Lenin, are exiled. Stalin's paranoia grows as he takes control of the nation, and with it the level of violence and killing of anyone perceived to be a threat to his power and control.\n\n1925: Scopes monkey trial\n\n• Date: July 10\n\n• Location: Dayton, Tennessee\n\nAfter teaching the theory of evolution in a Tennessee high school, the state prosecutes science teacher John Thomas Scopes because state law prohibits such teaching as it runs counter to Biblical beliefs. The trial pits well-known Christian fundamentalist William Jennings Bryan against renowned attorney Clarence Darrow. The jury rules against Scopes, forcing him to pay a fine of $100 (about $1,460 in 2017 dollars). It would take another 43 years before the U.S. Supreme Court rules that laws punishing people for teaching evolution violate the First Amendment.\n\n1926: U.S. starts numbered highway system\n\n• Date: Nov. 11\n\n• Location: U.S.\n\nIn a precursor to the modern interstate highway system, the federal government introduces a national highway numbering system in an effort to standardize roadways, especially local roads and trails with names unfamiliar to outsiders. The U.S. Numbered Highway System makes it easier for the growing number of car owners to figure out how to get from one city or town to the next and opens the way for the great American road-trip tradition.\n\n1927: Lindbergh nonstop to Paris\n\n• Date: May 21\n\n• Location: New York to Paris\n\nWhen the monoplane The Spirit of St. Louis touches down at Le Bourget Field in Paris on the evening of May 21, Charles Lindbergh becomes the person to fly over the Atlantic Ocean nonstop. Lindbergh would become one of the heroes of the age. His feat fires the imagination of aspiring aviators about the commercial possibilities of flight. Lindbergh would stay in the news, but for regrettable reasons. A strong advocate for American isolationism in the 1930s, he is criticized for his admiration of Nazi Germany's aircraft industry. Also, his son would be killed during a bungled kidnapping attempt in 1932.\n\n1928: Earhart crosses Atlantic\n\n• Date: June 17-18\n\n• Location: Wales\n\nAmelia Earhart becomes the first woman to pilot a plane across the Atlantic, from Newfoundland to Wales, making her an American national heroine and feminist icon who would go on to set numerous aviation records. She would later set another record as the first person – man or woman – to fly solo from Hawaii to the U.S. mainland. Earhart and her co-pilot Fred Noonan would vanish over the Pacific Ocean in 1937 during Earhart's attempt to circumnavigate the globe. Recent evidence has emerged indicating Earhart may have sent distress signals after surviving a crash, possibly on the remote Gardner Island in the western Pacific Ocean.\n\n1929: Wall Street crashes\n\n• Date: Oct. 24-29\n\n• Location: New York City\n\nThe \"Roaring Twenties\" come to a halt on Black Tuesday in October 1929, when stocks take a nosedive, contributing to the Great Depression. Reasons for the worst economic downturn in American history include over-lending by weakly regulated banks, excessive stock price valuation, too many stocks purchased on margin, unrestrained exuberance that sends millions of people to convert their savings into stocks, tightening of the credit by the Federal Reserve and an agricultural drought.\n\n1930: Ho Chi Minh rises in Vietnam\n\n• Date: Feb. 2\n\n• Location: Hanoi\n\nIn an event that would have repercussions for U.S. foreign policy decades later, Vietnamese independence fighter Ho Chi Minh founds the Communist Party of Vietnam as part of his effort to oust French colonial occupiers. \"Uncle Ho,\" as he was known to his many supporters, was inspired by the Russian Bolsheviks, who oppose the Tsarist autocracy, seeing parallels between that struggle and the fight against the foreign occupiers of his country.\n\n1931: Empire State Building completed\n\n• Date: May 1\n\n• Location: New York City\n\nPresident Herbert Hoover inaugurates the completion of the Empire State Building on May Day. It becomes the tallest building of the iconic Manhattan skyline until the construction of the World Trade Center Towers are completed in 1973. Incredibly, the 86-story office building took only 13 months to build, with construction starting in March of the previous year.\n\n1932: Hitler becomes German\n\n• Date: Feb. 25\n\n• Location: Germany\n\nSeven years after Adolf Hitler renounces his Austrian citizenship, a fellow member of the Nazi Party gets him a low-level government job, which comes with automatic citizenship. This opens the way for him to run for office. Already a well-known party activist, it takes Hitler only two years from receiving his citizenship status to becoming the leader of Germany.\n\n1933: FDR elected\n\n• Date: March 12\n\n• Location: Washington, D.C.\n\nWith the Great Depression sending millions of Americans to soup kitchens and chasing whatever work they can find, newly elected President Franklin Delano Roosevelt begins his weekly \"Fireside Chats\" as Americans are eager for guidance and solace during those dark times. FDR's first radio talk explains to Americans in plain language why he ordered that banks would close temporarily at different time in different parts of the country. The purpose, he explains, is to curb panic rushes of withdrawals, which has been hurting efforts to stabilize the banking system.\n\n1934: Hitler consolidates power\n\n• Date: June 30\n\n• Location: Berlin\n\nGermans, who had been suffering from a disastrous economic depression in 1929-30, begin to embrace the ideas of the Nationalist Socialist Workers Party – the Nazi Party. It becomes the largest party after the 1932 elections. In 1933, Adolf Hitler is appointed chancellor of Germany. After President Paul von Hindenburg dies in 1934, Hitler then purges members of his own party – the bloody Night of the Long Knives – with the help of Nazi storm troopers and becomes the unquestioned leader of Germany.\n\n1935: FDR launches New Deal\n\n• Date: Aug. 14\n\n• Location: Washington, D.C.\n\nPresident Roosevelt, grappling with the Great Depression, signs into law his signature Social Security Act, a law that creates the country's first retirement security system. Earlier that year, as part of his \"New Deal\" policy, the president established the Works Progress Administration, a massive economic stimulus program, putting millions of Americans to work building the country's public infrastructure.\n\n1936: Owens flouts Nazis\n\n• Date: Aug. 3\n\n• Location: Berlin\n\nAs the concept of racial purity and superiority dominates Germany in the 1930s, African-American sprinter Jesse Owens of Oakville, Alabama, shows them who is the master racer. During the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, and under the gaze of Adolf Hitler, Owens wins four Olympic gold medals for the 100-meter and 200-meter sprints, the long jump, and the 100-meter relay.\n\nFrom Alaska to Florida:States with the biggest and smallest governments\n\n1937: UAW changes car industry\n\n• Date: Feb. 11\n\n• Location: Flint, Michigan\n\nNearly two years after the establishment of the United Automobile Workers (UAW), the union scores a major victory in Flint, Michigan. Workers at the General Motors Fisher Body Plant Number One lay down their tools and occupy the factory, demanding union representation, a fair minimum wage, safer working conditions, and not to outsource labor to non-union plants. Despite efforts by GM and local police to extricate them from the plant, including shutting off the heat, cutting off food supply, and attacks that leave 16 workers and 11 police officers injured, the strike lasts 44 days. The strike leads to an agreement between GM and the UAW, which includes a 5% pay raise and permission to talk in the lunchroom.\n\n1938: Anti-Semitism surges\n\n• Date: Nov. 9\n\n• Location: Germany, Austria, Sudetenland\n\nGrowing anti-Semitic scapegoating amid Germany's crippling economic conditions culminates in the Kristallnacht, or \"Night of Broken Glass,\" a pogrom sparked by a speech from German propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels. Storm troopers and other Nazi groups are ordered to attack and destroy Jewish businesses, homes and houses of worship. In one night of attacks in Germany, Austria and the German-speaking area of the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia, dozens of Jews are killed and tens of thousands are rounded up and sent to concentration camps.\n\n1939: World War II starts\n\n• Date: Sept. 1\n\n• Location: Westerplatte, Poland\n\nUnder the cover of predawn darkness, a German battleship floats quietly into the center of Danzig Harbor and opens fire on a Polish stronghold in Westerplatte, the first shots of World War II. In the following weeks, Nazi forces, including 2,000 tanks and 1,000 aircraft, would shatter Polish defenses and surround Warsaw, which surrenders 26 days after the Danzig Harbor attack.\n\n1940: McDonald's founded\n\n• Date: May 15\n\n• Location: San Bernardino, California\n\nBrothers Richard and Maurice McDonald open McDonald's Barbecue Restaurant, offering BBQ ribs, pork sandwiches and 23 other menu items. Eight years later, they would restructure their popular local business to focus on hamburgers, milkshakes and fountain sodas, emphasizing speed, a simple menu and low prices. In the 1950s, businessman Ray Kroc would buy out the brothers and grow McDonald's into what it is today – the world's largest restaurant chain.\n\n1941: Attack on Pearl Harbor\n\n• Date: Dec. 7\n\n• Location: Oahu, Hawaii\n\nKnowing the U.S. is gearing up to engage them in the Pacific Ocean theater of World War II, Japan deploys a massive air attack on U.S. Navy ships parked at Pearl Harbor. The surprise assault by 353 Japanese aircraft leads to the deaths of 2,403 people, including 1,177 sailors aboard the ill-fated USS Arizona, one of 19 vessels that were damaged or destroyed in the attack. Nearly 330 aircraft were also damaged or destroyed. The United States declares war on Japan the next day and three days later against Germany and Italy.\n\n1942: GIs arrive in Europe\n\n• Date: Jan. 26\n\n• Location: Northern Ireland\n\nThe first U.S. troops destined to fight in Europe in the world's greatest war arrive in Northern Ireland. It is the beginning of a military buildup that would culminate in the invasion of France more than two years later. Before then, the United States was providing only material support to its ally across the Atlantic, while building up what President Roosevelt called the \"Arsenal of Democracy\" in anticipation for the inevitable entry of the United States into the war in Europe.\n\n1943: Invention of LSD\n\n• Date: April 19\n\n• Location: Basel, Switzerland\n\nSwiss chemist Albert Hoffman had been studying the potential medicinal value of lysergic compounds when he accidentally exposed himself to LSD-25, which he had created years earlier in his lab. This was the first LSD trip, a quarter-century before the counterculture endorses the hallucinogenic compound. Hoffman describes the \"not unpleasant\" experience as \"uninterrupted stream of fantastic pictures, extraordinary shapes with intense, kaleidoscopic play of colors.\" Hoffman takes a second dose and writes a paper about his discovery. The U.S. Army tests the drug on soldiers numerous times from 1955 to 1967, briefly toying with the idea of using LSD as a weapon to disorient enemy soldiers during combat.\n\n1944: D-Day\n\n• Date: June 6\n\n• Location: Normandy France\n\nThe plan for the biggest one-day military campaign in history, the invasion of Normandy by Allied forces to push the Nazis out of France, is hatched in extreme secrecy a year earlier. The plan is conceived during the Quebec Conference by Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt. The invasion starts at 6:30 a.m. on five beaches, and over the next 24 hours about 4,900 Allied soldiers are killed, many of them the instant the doors of their Higgins transport boats opened directly into German machine gun fire.\n\n1945: World War II ends\n\n• Date: Sept. 2\n\n• Location: Multiple\n\nThe surrender of Japan marks the end of World War II amid one of the most tumultuous years of the 20th century. Earlier in the year, leaders of three nations – Benito Mussolini, Franklin Roosevelt and Adolf Hitler – die and Nazi Germany surrenders.

People live longer, eat better, have greater access to improved medical care and are freer to express their opinions and associate with whomever they want.\n\nThat optimism can be seen in population growth. Despite the two most devastating wars in human history, the world population has nearly tripled, from 1.9 billion to 7.5 billion, since 1917.\n\nOne hundred years is an eye blink in history, yet 100 years ago, women did not have the right to vote in the United States. African-Americans were prevented from voting in the American South. Labor unions were in their infancy and were weak, and laws reforming child labor had yet to be passed by Congress. All that changed because of women’s suffrage, the inexorable march of civil rights and the strengthening labor unions.\n\nOne hundred years ago, a person anywhere in the world was more likely than not to be illiterate. And there was a good chance he or she was the subject of colonial rulers in South America, Africa and Asia. Two world wars would spell the end of imperial houses in Austria-Hungary, Germany and Russia, and weaken the grip of another, Great Britain. Independence movements sprouted in Europe, Africa and Asia, yearning for freedom and expressing national pride.\n\nNationalism had its dark side, though, with fascist governments ruling Italy and Germany. It would take a world war to remove their scourge. Another form of totalitarianism, communism, would dominate the USSR and Eastern Europe for several generations, as well as China and other countries in Asia, before the West would triumph over the Soviet Union and its allies in the Cold War.\n\nSpeaking of the Cold War, that conflict launched the space race and accelerated technological progress, hastening the use of personal computers and cell phones. These inventions have fundamentally changed our lives – from the way we communicate to the way we shop and socialize – and made billions of dollars for the companies that make them and their founders. These products and innovations are a major part of the culture today.\n\nTo determine the most important event the year you were born, 24/7 Wall St. drew on research materials and media sources to compile its list. Deciding the most important event in a given year by its nature is a subjective exercise. In reaching our decisions, we chose the event that had the most far-reaching impact and was not necessarily the most famous event in a given year.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

She then began to share her experiences of living with the disease on social media under the name “Bowel Babe”, before becoming one of the three hosts of Radio 5 Live’s You, Me and the Big C in 2018.\n\nThe hit show was the brainchild of its late co-host Rachael Bland, who died of terminal breast cancer aged 40, just six months after the show’s launch.\n\nJames was praised for her candid approach to discussing cancer on the show, which she continued to co-host after Bland’s death alongside Lauren Mahon and Steve Bland, Rachael’s husband.\n\nThe show, which has featured a string of celebrities, has won plaudits for its “frank discussion” of cancer and how to deal with practical matters such as hair loss, finances and telling loved ones about the illness, said the BBC.", "authors": ["The Week Staff"], "publish_date": "2022/05/13"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/science-health/954825/extra-non-covid-deaths-increase", "title": "Unexplained surge in non-Covid deaths triggers calls for probe | The ...", "text": "Experts are demanding an urgent inquiry into whether thousands of non-Covid deaths since July could have been prevented.\n\nLatest Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures show a “devastating surge” of around 20,800 additional deaths in England and Wales in the past four months compared with the average for the same period in the five years up to 2019, said Metro. Of these extra fatalities, referred to as “excess deaths”, 45% were not related to coronavirus.\n\nAlthough a higher mortality rate is expected at this time of year, concerns are growing that NHS delays during the pandemic have left patients “with previously treatable conditions suffering illnesses that have now become fatal”, said The Telegraph.\n\nChancellor Rishi Sunak last month committed £5.9bn of extra NHS funding to help tackle the healthcare crisis. But almost six million people in England remain on waiting lists for elective procedures, “the highest number ever recorded”, the paper continued.\n\nAnd ambulance wait times are also “at a record high”. NHS records show that heart attack patients are now waiting an average of 53 minutes for help to arrive. The NHS target time to reach a suspected stroke or heart attack victim is 18 minutes.\n\nKevin McConway, emeritus professor of applied statistics at The Open University, said that the recent surge in excess deaths included “considerable excess numbers of deaths in people’s own homes, compared to the 2015-19 average”.\n\n“In the most recent week, there were 891 excess deaths at home that did not involve Covid-19 – that’s about 127 a day,” he told The Telegraph.\n\nThe Times reported last week that latest figures show that “private homes are the only setting where deaths in England and Wales have been consistently above the pre-pandemic average every month from January 2020 to June 2021”.\n\nONS data suggests these extra deaths in homes were driven by conditions including heart disease and dementia, which were the leading causes of deaths in England and Wales in September, followed by Covid-19.\n\nSarah Caul, head of mortality analysis at the non-ministerial department, said that the pandemic “appears to have had an indirect effect” on rates of deaths outside of healthcare settings.\n\n“This could be because of a combination of factors which may include health service disruption, people choosing to stay away from healthcare settings or terminally ill people staying at home rather than being admitted to other settings for end-of-life care,” Caul added.\n\n“More investigation is needed to understand this.”\n\nHer call for a probe into above-average death rates has been echoed Professor Carl Heneghan, an expert in evidence-based medicine at Oxford University.\n\n“If you look at where the excess is happening, it’s in conditions like ischaemic heart disease, cirrhosis of the liver and diabetes, all which are potentially reversible,” he told The Telegraph. “This goes beyond just looking at the raw numbers and death certificates.\n\n“We need to go back and see if these deaths have any preventable causes.”", "authors": ["Julia O"], "publish_date": "2021/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/media/954539/chris-mason-who-is-the-bbcs-new-political-editor", "title": "Chris Mason: who is the BBC's new political editor? | The Week UK", "text": "Chris Mason has come from relative obscurity to land one of the most coveted and prestigious jobs in British journalism.\n\nThe 42-year-old presenter was the surprise choice to replace Laura Kuenssberg as the BBC’s new political editor in April after a host of more well-known names ruled themselves out and a women-only shortlist was scrapped by executives.\n\nWhile unexpected, Mason is seen as a safe pair of hands during a time of transition for the broadcaster’s news department following a series of high-profile departures and constant accusations of political bias.\n\nWhat is his background?\n\nBorn in Bradford, West Yorkshire in 1980, both Mason’s parents were primary school teachers.\n\nWhile he is now required to “help millions of viewers to navigate Westminster drama from the doorstep of Downing Street”, The Times reported that he “got his break in more modest surroundings, battling against fake BBC news and introducing items like Babes on the Box for a haphazard student television show.”\n\nHailing the “straight-talking grammar school-educated ‘proud Yorkshireman’ from a working-class background”, the Daily Mail said he “briefly flirted with the dream of becoming a bus driver, before developing his insatiable appetite for news”.\n\nAfter graduating from Cambridge he began his journalism career as a trainee at ITN the week after 9/11.

Members of the public openly wept and howled outside the royal residences.

Rowling's 'gender wars' lunch | The Week UK", "text": "On Sunday afternoon, a group of women gathered for lunch – and proceeded to break the internet. The event was organised by J.K. Rowling and the attendees were all women’s rights campaigners who have been accused of holding transphobic or gender critical beliefs.\n\nThe boozy lunch took place at the River Café, an exclusive Michelin-star restaurant in Hammersmith, west London. It had initially been planned for pre-Christmas, but was rearranged due to the high Covid infection rates at the time.\n\nThe event followed the launch of a women’s rights campaign called Respect My Sex if you want my X, which “encourages voters to ask politicians for their views on sex and gender identity”, said The Times.\n\nAlthough Rowling had booked a private room, there was nothing secretive about the gathering. Many of the attendees took to Twitter to share photos of themselves hugging and laughing, with Helen Joyce, the author of Trans: When Ideology Meets Reality, tweeting that it was “a truly joyous celebration of sisterhood”.\n\nA truly joyous celebration of sisterhood pic.twitter.com/GF1Q9LLSAb — Helen Joyce (@HJoyceGender) April 11, 2022\n\nWho was there?\n\nGuests included journalist and feminist activist Julie Bindel, who co-founded the campaigning organisation Justice for Women, and Rosie Duffield, the Labour MP for Canterbury, who has been at the forefront of her party’s internal tensions over the conflict between women’s and trans rights.\n\nAlso in attendance was Kathleen Stock, the feminist philosopher who resigned from her post at Sussex University over her views on gender, and Maya Forstater, who famously lost her job in 2019 after tweeting about the difference between sex and gender identity.\n\nThe event on Sunday was the first time Rowling and Forstater had met, but it was Forstater’s case that propelled the Harry Potter author’s gender critical beliefs into the spotlight. In 2019, Rowling was accused of transphobia after she tweeted “IStandWithMaya” in support of Forstater’s employment battle.\n\nForstater told The Times that it had been “emotional” to meet the writer, whom she described as her “source of strength”.\n\nJournalist Suzanne Moore, who also attended the gathering, wrote in The Telegraph: “I have now read several accounts as to why [the lunch] took place. We must be a coven, or launching a campaign or plotting.”\n\nBut the “actual reason”, she continued, was “to eat, drink and be extremely merry, which seems never to have occurred to these steely investigative reporters”.\n\nTrans demonstration\n\nPink News pointed out that the lunch took place at the same time as a trans rights demonstration outside Downing Street in protest at the government’s decision to exclude transgender people from a UK conversion therapy ban.\n\n“Although Rowling once promised her trans followers that she would ‘march with you if you were discriminated against on the basis of being trans’, she was nowhere to be seen on the day of the protests,” added the publication.", "authors": ["The Week Staff"], "publish_date": "2022/04/12"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/politics/955384/mps-who-were-investigated-by-the-police", "title": "A history of MPs who were investigated by the police | The Week UK", "text": "The Metropolitan Police is considering an investigation into the alleged “BYOB” party that took place at No. 10 during the first lockdown, it has emerged.\n\nAccording to an email leaked to ITV, more than 100 Downing Street staff were invited to the event by Boris Johnson’s principal secretary, Martin Reynolds. The PM admitted to attending the garden party during Prime Minister’s Questions today, claiming that he believed it was a work event.\n\nA Met Police spokesperson said the force is “aware of widespread reporting relating to alleged breaches of the Health Protection Regulations at Downing Street”, adding that it is currently “in contact with the Cabinet Office”.\n\nIf Johnson is found to have breached the law by attending the outdoor gathering, he will join a list of MPs to have found themselves under police investigation. Here is a rundown of some of the other politicians who found themselves on the wrong side of the law.\n\nJabez Spencer Balfour A Liberal MP for Tamworth from 1880 to 1885 and Burnley from 1889 to 1893, Balfour was perhaps the most infamous fraudster politician of his era. A “late Victorian financial and property tycoon” he “amassed a fortune by exploiting the religious devotion and the temperance crusades of that era,” said HistoryToday. In 1892 he was at the centre of a scandal when the Liberator Building Society, which he set up and controlled, failed, leaving thousands of small investors penniless. He fled to Argentina, but was extradited before being tried and imprisoned for 14 years.\n\nJeremy Thorpe John Jeremy Thorpe served as a member of parliament for North Devon from 1959 to 1979 and was the leader of the Liberal Party from 1967 to 1976. “Dashing” and “charismatic”, he was perhaps Britain’s “most popular politician” in the early 1970s, The Sun said. In 1979, he found himself at the centre of “the trial of the century” when he was accused of conspiring to murder his former gay lover, Norman Scott, in what the BBC described as a “bizarre, ill-fated plot”. Thorpe was acquitted, but the trial ended his once-glittering parliamentary career. “Lurid speculation about what really happened and why dogged him for the rest of his life,” said The Guardian in 2018.\n\nJeffrey Archer The millionaire author and former Conservative politician was accused by the News of The World in 1986 of paying a prostitute £2,000. Then deputy chair of the Conservative Party, having been appointed by Margaret Thatcher in 1985, he resigned from his post soon after the story broke. In 2001 Archer was sentenced to an additional four years in prison after being found guilty of lying during a 1987 libel case he brought against the Daily Star after allegations he paid a prostitute for sex. Archer was found guilty on two counts of perverting the course of justice, and two counts of perjury. Before his sentencing, the judge presiding over the case said the “charges represent as serious an offence of perjury as I have had experience of and have been able to find in the books”, reported the BBC at the time.\n\nJonathan Aitken The Conservative MP “dramatically resigned from his post” in 1995 after The Guardian and Granada TV’s World in Action revealed that “a Saudi businessman had paid for a stay at the Paris Ritz hotel – in breach of ministerial rules,” reported the BBC at the time. Aitken launched a failed libel action against The Guardian and Granada, claiming he had quit his ministerial post to fight what he said was “the cancer of bent and twisted journalism”. But the case collapsed and Aitken admitted lying during the libel case. In 1999, he pleaded guilty to charges of perjury and perverting the course of justice and was jailed for 18 months, seven of which he served as a custodial sentence.\n\nThe expenses scandal The 2009 expenses scandal eventually saw five MPs and two peers jailed as a result of police investigation into false expenses claims. As Channel 4 reported, the jailing of so many MPs led to the “startling statistic\" that in 2011, while “0.13 per cent of the general population was in jail, a shocking 0.61 per cent of House of Commons members were in prison”. Ex-Labour MP David Chaytor was jailed for 18 months for fraudulently claiming more than £18,000, Labour’s Jim Devine was jailed for 16 months for claiming more than £8,000 and former Labour environment minister Elliot Morley was jailed for claiming £31,000. Eric Illsley, also formerly of the Labour Party, was sentenced to 12 months for falsely claiming £14,000, while former Labour minister Denis MacShane was jailed for six months after falsely claiming £12,900. Conservative peer John Taylor was sentenced to 12 months after claiming more than £11,000, while Paul White was given a nine-month sentence, returning to the House of Lords after being acquitted and repaying the £3,300 he wrongly claimed.\n\nKeith Vaz In 2016, Labour MP Keith Vaz came under police investigation over charges he “offered to buy cocaine for two male escorts”, reported The Guardian. The Metropolitan Police opened its investigation into whether Vaz had broken any drug laws after it received a complaint from Tory MP Andrew Bridgen. The investigation was eventually closed and Vaz did not face charges.", "authors": ["The Week Staff"], "publish_date": "2022/01/12"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/politics/957353/where-the-tory-leadership-candidates-stand-on-net-zero", "title": "Where the Tory leadership candidates stand on net zero | The Week ...", "text": "We will use the details you have shared to manage your registration.

The Azov battalion had by then been integrated into the Ukrainian National Guard.\n\nAn effective fighting force that's very much involved in the current conflict, the battalion has a history of neo-Nazi leanings, which have not been entirely extinguished by its integration into the Ukrainian military. ​\n\nIn its heyday as an autonomous militia, the Azov Battalion was associated with White supremacists and neo-Nazi ideology and insignia. It was especially active in and around Mariupol in 2014 and 2015. CNN teams in the area at the time reported Azov's embrace of neo-Nazi emblems and paraphernalia.\n\nAfter its integration into the Ukrainian National Guard, amid discussions in the US Congress about designating the Azov Movement a foreign terrorist organization, Ukraine's then minister of internal affairs, Arsen Avakov, defended the unit. \"The shameful information campaign about the alleged spread of Nazi ideology (among Azov members) is a deliberate attempt to discredit the 'Azov' unit and the National Guard of Ukraine,\" he told the online newspaper Ukrayinska Pravda in 2019.\n\nThe battalion still operates as a relatively autonomous entity. It has been prominent in defending Mariupol in recent weeks, and its resistance has been widely praised by members of the government.\n\nFor Putin, who has falsely claimed Ukraine's government is run by \"drug addicts and neo-Nazis,\" Azov presents an obvious target. Moscow has given the regiment an outsized role in the conflict, routinely accusing it of human rights abuses.\n\nOn March 7, Russia's ambassador to the United Nations blamed the Azov regiment for blocking an evacuation corridor in the besieged port city, saying they were using \"citizens as a human shield.\" That claim has been repeated consistently in Russian media.\n\nThe same day, Azov major Denis Prokopenko said in a video shared on the regiment's Twitter account that the \"attempts to organize a safe corridor for the (relocation) of civilian people... failed because of several actions of the enemy (Russian forces) in the assembly area.\"\n\nAfter the bombing of a Mariupol theater that was sheltering civilians and had \"children\" written in Russian on the ground on either side of the building, the Russian Defense Ministry accused \"militants of the nationalist 'Azov' battalion\" of carrying out the attack. ​\n\nIn the Russian disinformation playbook, the Azov movement is a tempting target -- one where fact and disinformation can be elided.\n\nKyiv citizens take part in military training for civilians conducted by Azov regiment veterans on February 6, 2022.\n\nThe existence of an identifiably Azov element within the Ukrainian armed forces -- and an effective element at that -- poses uncomfortable questions for the Ukrainian government and its Western allies, which continue to send arms to the country.\n\nCNN has reached out to ​Ukraine's defense ministry for comment.\n\nIn the not-too-distant past, Azov's leadership openly espoused ​White supremacist views and cultivated links with similarly minded groups and individuals in the West.\n\nIn 2010, Andriy Biletsky, now leader of the National Corps, the Azov movement's political wing, reportedly said his goal was to \"lead the White races of the world in a final crusade.\"\n\nIn a statement to CNN, the Azov regiment said it \"appreciates and respects Andriy Biletsky as the regiment's founder and first commander, but we have nothing to do with his political activities and the National Corps party\" -- adding the former commander never made such comments.\n\nThe statement said that Azov's \"motivation has always angered Russia. Therefore, disinformation attacks on the AZOV Regiment have not stopped since 2014.\"\n\nIt added that the movement has \"repeatedly denied allegations of fascism, nazism and racism,\" and have Ukrainians of all different backgrounds including \"Greeks, Jews, Crimean Tatars, Russians\" who \"continue to serve in AZOV.\"\n\n\"Most of them are Russian-speaking, most are Orthodox. But there are Catholics and Protestants, Pagans and those who profess Islam and Judaism, and there are atheists,\" Azov asserted.\n\nIt noted that the Azov regiment's role is as \"a special unit of the National Guard of Ukraine, and is subordinated exclusively to the Supreme Commander-in-Chief -- the President of Ukraine, by the way, a Jew.\"\n\n\"It would be absurd to think that we are united by the idea of white racism or nazism,\" the Azov statement added.\n\nDespite the Azov movement's international notoriety, Ukraine \"is not a cesspit for Nazi sympathizers,\" according to Alexander Ritzmann, a senior adviser at the Counter Extremism Project (CEP), based in Berlin.\n\nHe noted that in the last elections in Ukraine in 2019, Azov's political wing only won 2.15% of the vote, and Biletsky lost his seat in parliament.\n\nPlus -- Ritzmann says -- there are far-right actors prominent in Russia, too. \"There is a far-right extremist problem on both sides in the conflict, but there seems to be a bias in only reporting on Ukraine's far-right problem,\" he said.\n\nAzov's beginnings\n\nThe Azov Battalion was formed in 2014, the same year Russian-backed rebels began seizing territory across Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, and Russia invaded and captured Crimea. At the time, Ukraine's Ministry of Defense encouraged volunteer battalions to join the resistance campaign and help its struggling army.\n\nThe battalion's role in recapturing Mariupol in June 2014 from Russian-backed forces brought it \"hero status\" in Ukraine, said Ritzmann.\n\nBut that status came with baggage -- the far-right views of some members and neo-Nazi insignia. These included the black sun, \"a pagan symbol appropriated by Nazis for their pseudo-religion,\" and the Wolfsangel, \"a symbol that far-right extremists have also adopted,\" Ritzmann said.\n\nAndriy Biletsky, the leader of the National Corps political party, reportedly said his goal was to \"lead the White races of the world in a final crusade.\"\n\nAzov's leaders have denied the neo-Nazi associations, saying the Wolfsangel \"N\" and \"I' mean \"national idea.\"\n\nEven though the Azov Battalion was co-founded by Biletsky, who previously led the radical right group Patriot of Ukraine, the group was armed by the state and partly funded by local oligarchs in eastern Ukraine. That funding included money from the Jewish tycoon Ihor Kolomoisky, Ritzmann said. The US State Department sanctioned Kolomoisky in March 2021. The previous year, the US Justice Department placed him under investigation on accusations of embezzlement and fraud. ​\n\nCNN has reached out to Kolomoisky's lawyer for comment.\n\nInternational outreach\n\nWhen the Azov Battalion was brought under the command of the Ministry of Internal Affairs as a regiment in 2014, \"politically motivated fighters like (Andriy) Biletsky left and founded the Azov movement so they can do their ultra-nationalist, far-right work, which they were not allowed to do in the Ukrainian military,\" Ritzmann said.\n\nThe political party Biletsky formed, the National Corps, which the US Department of State described in 2018 as a nationalist hate group, \"is essentially the spine of what we today call the Azov movement,\" Kacper Rekawek, a research fellow with the Center for Research on Extremism (C-REX) at the University of Oslo, told CNN.\n\n\"The Azov movement is a dangerous key player of the transnational extreme-right and has served as a network hub for several years now, with strong ties to far-right extremists in many European Union countries and the United States,\" Ritzmann said.\n\nNationalist activists light flares and shout anti-Russian slogans during a demonstration in front of President Volodymyr Zelensky's offices in Kyiv on October 14, 2020.\n\nOlena Semenyaka, the head of the National Corps' international department, attended a festival in 2018 organized by German neo-Nazis; and in 2019 she spoke at the far-right Scanza Forum in Sweden alongside British neo-Nazi Mark Collett.\n\nSince forming in 2014, the ​Azov movement has grown to include a militia, summer camps for kids and paramilitary training centers. It runs activities, including music festivals, political events and mixed-martial-arts tournaments, as it promoted itself in the international far-right space.\n\nThe National Corps has repeatedly demonstrated its disdain for liberal values in its treatment of minority groups -- with few repercussions.\n\nA 2018 US State Department report found that the movement's militia \"attacked and destroyed a Romani camp in Kyiv after its residents failed to respond to their ultimatum to leave the area within 24 hours,\" in full view of the local police.\n\nThe 'Death Star'\n\n\"People always assume it (the Azov regiment and Azov movement) is one Death Star,\" Rekawek said. \"Year by year, the connections (between the regiment and the movement) are looser,\" he said, explaining that the battalion's ranks now include Ukrainians who have no affinity with its neo-Nazi past.\n\nRitzmann says the far-right element in Ukraine's army is no different to what's been detected in other militaries, such as in Germany and the US\n\n\"Presumably, far-right extremists serve in the Ukrainian military as they do in all other militaries -- valid data regarding the exact numbers are not available,\" he said.\n\n\"Back in 2015, the Azov Regiment itself claimed to have between 10% and 20% far-right extremists in their ranks,\" but those figures are possibly smaller today, he said.\n\nBut the regiment still uses the Wolfsangel symbol, and leaders of the Azov movement, who used to be commanders in the unit, continue to visit it, said Oleksiy Kuzmenko, a Ukrainian-American investigative journalist focusing on the Ukrainian far-right.\n\n\"The current leader of the Azov Regiment, Denis 'Redis' Prokopenko, is part of the core of the Azov movement since 2014, and served under commanders who went on to lead the Azov movement political and street wings,\" Kuzmenko told CNN.\n\nProkopenko's deputy, Svyatoslav \"Kalyna\" Palamar, has explicitly praised the movement's founder, Biletsky, as \"a leader who 'finds sponsors that really invest money' into the regiment,\" Kuzmenko said.\n\nIn this photo taken outside Kyiv on July 14, 2017, a student at a paramilitary camp for children calls the rank to attention.\n\nKuzmenko points out that as of 2021, the regiment was \"actively involved in the training of the movement's youth leaders,\" and its website has a link to the movement's YouTube channel.\n\n\"Ukraine and (the) West's inaction on these issues paved the way for Putin to quite literally weaponize them against Ukraine in an attempt to justify his aggression,\" Kuzmenko said.\n\n\"While it's correct to point (out that) Ukraine's far-right has minimal electoral support, they (Azov) have enjoyed near impunity for violence aimed at minorities, were unchecked in their efforts to build influence in military and security forces, and have been normalized by Ukraine's senior leaders,\" he said.\n\nIn a statement to CNN on Wednesday, Prokopenko said: \"Whoever calls us Nazis is deeply mistaken. We have young brave soldiers who give their lives for the independence of Ukraine and throw themselves under enemy tanks.\"\n\nForeign fighters\n\nSince it formed, the Azov movement has recruited foreign fighters motivated by White supremacism to fight in Ukraine, experts say. Russia's full-scale invasion of the country, and Zelensky's call for foreign volunteers to join the fight, have raised concerns about radicalization in the war.\n\n\"My concern is that people, especially far-right extremists in Europe, (will gain) combat experience and training in the Ukrainian theater and then use that for terrorist attacks in Europe proper,\" Colin P. Clarke, senior research fellow at the New York- based ​foreign policy research nonprofit the Soufan Center, told CNN.\n\nValentyna Konstantynovska, aged 79, holds a weapon during basic combat training for civilians organized by the Azov regiment on February 13, 2022.\n\nIn 2020, Buzzfeed reported that Ukraine deported two members from the US-based neo-Nazi group the Atomwaffen Division, who were trying to gain combat experience with Azov.\n\nRekawek, an expert on foreign fighters at C-REX, said Azov has only been able to recruit 20 foreign fighters since the start of the 2022 invasion. CNN has not been able to verify those figures independently.\n\nFor its part, Russia also has a thriving ultra-nationalist scene that is tolerated by the authorities.\n\nThe Russian Imperial Movement (RIM), an extreme-right militia based in St. Petersburg, ​was, in 2020, the first White supremacist group to be categorized as \"Specially Designated Global Terrorists\" by the US State Department. While the RIM has worked in opposition to Putin's regime, it has supported the Russian side in the war against Ukraine -- training Russian militants to join pro-Russian separatists in the conflict, according to the Center for International Security and Cooperation (CISAC) at Stanford University\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin meets with French Front National party leader Marine Le Pen at the Kremlin in Moscow on March 24, 2017.\n\n\"They have never confronted their own nationalists,\" said Rekawek. ​Experts say Russia has also been a player in Europe's far-right space, with France's Marine Le Pen and Italy's Matteo Salvini enjoying close links with Putin before the 2022 invasion.\n\nAnd of the \"few hundred western individuals with extreme right-wing or 'nationalist' convictions\" who traveled to fight in the Ukraine conflict around 2014, \"most of those extremist volunteers fought on the side of the pro-Russian separatists,\" according to a CEP report published in March\n\nRitzmann has found pro-Russian groups calling for volunteers in his research. This includes \"the Russian security contractor Wagner Group, which has a history of displaying Nazi insignia,\" he said in the CEP report.\n\nBut amid the tide of millions of refugees and untold damage to Ukrainian cities, some experts say Russia's fixation on a minor player like the Azov movement serves a purpose -- allowing the Kremlin to frame the conflict as an ideological and even existential struggle. However remote from reality that may be.\n\nThis story has been updated to include a statement from the Azov regiment.", "authors": ["Analysis Tara John", "Tim Lister"], "publish_date": "2022/03/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/30/economy/recession-economists-nber/index.html", "title": "Who decides if the US is in a recession? Eight economists you've ...", "text": "New York (CNN Business) Prominent Wall Street economists like Mark Zandi, investing luminaries like ARK Invest's Cathie Wood and executives like JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon can make recession predictions until they're blue in the face , but their guidance will remain just that — an economic forecast.\n\nThat's because, in the United States, the economy isn't broadly and officially considered to be in a recession until a relatively unknown group of eight economists says so.\n\nThe economists, who serve together as the Business Cycle Dating Committee are hand-selected by and work under the umbrella of the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), a private nonprofit organization. They have no predetermined meeting dates and their deliberations are private. There are no fixed term dates and the final determination of who gets to serve on the committee is made by one man: NBER president and Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist James Poterba.\n\nThere is a clear lack of racial diversity amongst the eight members, and NBER has never had a member who has been a racial minority, according to Gary Hoover, co-chair of the American Economic Association Committee on the Status of Minority Groups in the Economics Profession.\n\nAll NBER members are experts in macroeconomics and business cycle research. Each is over 60 years old, and they are all associated with prestigious universities. The group includes two women, one of whom is married to another member.\n\nThe NBER's recession designations are used and accepted exclusively by the US government, businesses, investors and journalists.\n\nI shall not attempt to define recession, but I know it when I see it\n\nWhile a recession is commonly defined by two consecutive negative quarters of gross domestic product growth, there's no steadfast rule governing what defines a recession in the United States.\n\nInstead, the Dating Committee abides by a relatively vague definition that allows for wiggle room: A recession, they write , \"involves a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months.\"\n\nThe committee also takes its time in defining when a recession begins and ends, making sure to look at data on a broad timeline. The designations often come retroactively — which means the US could currently be in the middle of a recession without anyone officially recognizing it until after the fact.\n\nFor example, inflation is at a 40-year high, the US economy contracted during the first quarter of the year, stock markets are on the brink of their worst half-year performance since 1932 and consumer sentiment has plummeted, but there is no guidance on when the committee will next meet and what they will decide.\n\nThe group says it takes a wide look at economic indicators — real personal income less transfers, nonfarm payroll employment, real personal consumption expenditures, wholesale retail sales adjusted for price changes, employment as measured by the household survey, and industrial production. But there is no fixed rule about which measures they use in their process or how they are weighted in the committee's decisions.\n\nThe short-lived, Covid-induced recession in 2020, for example, only had one quarter of negative growth. But \"the committee concluded that the subsequent drop in activity had been so great and so widely diffused throughout the economy that, even if it proved to be quite brief, the downturn should be classified as a recession.\"\n\nWith so much focus on the state of the economy, and so many official sources looking to one group to determine whether the United States has entered a downturn, NBER has an outsized role influencing American politics, policy and financial decision-makers.\n\n\"There's an awful lot of symbolic value attached to whether we're in a recession,\" said Richard Wolff, professor of economics emeritus at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. \"It is taken seriously up on the Hill and by policy makers across the country, it's important.\"\n\nBut Wolff finds that even professional economists don't know where the official recession designation come from: \"It's one of those mysteries that isn't inquired into because people have accepted these things as gospel — the rulings just seem to come down from on high.\"\n\nIn recent years, however, critics have said the NBER's recession and expansion determinations fail to consider the economic state of many underrepresented Americans.\n\nA lack of inclusion\n\nThe NBER says the last recession ended in April 2020 but the recovery was two-pronged, something that the Department of Labor designated as \"K-shaped\": sharp growth for the affluent and stagnant for the less well-off.\n\n\"Analysis of private data from various sources appears to bear out that low-wage workers have borne the brunt of the pandemic induced recession,\" they wrote.\n\nThe Department of Labor found that while workers making over $60,000 had returned to pre-pandemic employment levels by August of 2020, low-wage workers' levels of employment were still down about 40%.\n\nLow-wage workers, the Department of Labor concluded, would likely feel the impact of long-term earnings reductions, weakened savings and increased inequality for years to come.\n\nWhen economists and policymakers look to study previous recessions, they will be using dates that \"don't necessarily represent the full breadth of experiences in this country,\" said Valerie Wilson, who is director of the Economic Policy Institute's Program on Race, Ethnicity, and the Economy as well as president of the National Economic Association. \"More diversity on the committee will bring in perspectives and other ideas about how we understand the health of the economy.\"\n\nIn recent years there has been a push by policymakers and the Biden administration to include more diverse thinking in economic analysis.\n\nJanet Yellen, America's first woman Treasury secretary and its first woman Fed chair, has argued that the lack of women and minority economists at the Federal Reserve and the federal government is a top priority. That lack of diversity, she said, skews viewpoints and limits the issues of discussion.\n\nIncreased scrutiny and discussion about representation has focused on the Federal Reserve board of governors, on which Lisa Cook became the first Black woman to serve last month. But the NBER, which is a private institution that receives government funding and works closely with former, future and present government officials, has largely avoided criticism.\n\nThere should be more focus on an organization that \"makes significant policy decisions,\" said Wilson. \"They should look beyond topline numbers,\" she said.\n\nEconomists' diversity problem\n\nThe NBER doesn't have to contend with public attention the way the federal government does, so it's a much more insular community. Those outside of that community know very little about its inner workings, said Wilson — and those who do push back are \"extremely underrepresented minorities who have less power.\"\n\n\"I think the economics profession is notorious for being one of the least-diverse professions or disciplines along a number of lines: racial, gender and diversity in schools of thought,\" added Wilson.\n\nIt's difficult to break through and get people to consider new frameworks for how we understand disparity and inequality. This creates an unbreakable cycle as storied economists lead editorial boards of peer-reviewed journals. Getting published in those journals is essential to receiving tenure at the universities that the government and organizations like NBER recruit from.\n\n\"It's incestuous,\" said Wolff, who attended Harvard University undergrad, received his Master's degree at Stanford and his PhD in economics at Yale, where he was a classmate of Yellen's.\n\n\"Fundamental issues that ought to be part of the conversation in our economic system are excluded as if they don't exist,\" said Wolff. \"You have a community of old, White graduates from the same elite institutions and what they think is important is important. If you think differently, you're out of the club.\"\n\nWolff said he's benefited greatly from being a \"poster boy\" of the charmed inner circle of economists that he calls an old-boy network -— but that \"someone has to be the one that says the emperor is naked.\"\n\nThe NBER declined to comment on the diversity of its economists but did confirm that the current members of the Business Cycle Dating Committee are Robert Hall of Stanford University; Robert J. Gordon of Northwestern University; James Poterba of MIT; Valerie Ramey of University of California, San Diego; Christina Romer of University of California, Berkeley; David Romer of University of California, Berkeley; James Stock of Harvard University; and Mark W.

Other findings:\n\nWomen were over 40% more likely than men to be absent from work without pay, with childcare needs being the most likely to result in an unpaid absence.\n\nLatino and Black workers were also more likely to miss work and not get paid compared to their white counterparts.\n\nAbout two-thirds of Latino and 57% of Black workers did not receive pay when they were absent due to personal illness, childcare needs, or other obligations.\n\n“The pandemic caused unpaid work absences across the entire workforce, but data on gender and race highlight the greater toll on women and minority populations,” Mona Shah, senior program officer at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, said in a statement. “Policymakers should consider how paid sick leave policies can promote public health and advance equity.”\n\nModerna's omicron COVID booster gets authorized by UK regulators\n\nBritish drug regulators have become the first in the world to authorize an updated version of Moderna's coronavirus vaccine that includes protection against the omicron variant, which the government said would be offered to people aged 50 and over starting in the fall.\n\nEach dose of the booster shot will target both the original COVID-19 virus that was first detected in 2020 and the omicron BA.1 variant that was first picked up in November. In a statement Monday, the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency said the side effects were similar to those seen for Moderna's original booster shot and were typically “mild and self-resolving.”\n\nThe decision to authorize is based on clinical trial data showing Moderna’s new booster induced more neutralizing antibodies against BA.1, the original omicron variant, when compared to the company’s 50 microgram booster dose of original COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. regulators have asked vaccine makers to develop a booster targeting the BA.4 and BA.5 omicron subvariants. In an interview with NBC News, White House COVID coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha said the new boosters may be available “in a few short weeks” to anyone over the age of 12.\n\nAmericans haven't been to the dentist since before COVID\n\nNearly 1 in 3 Americans haven’t been to the dentist since before the COVID-19 pandemic began, according to a new survey from invisible aligners company Byte.com.\n\nAccording to the Byte survey, the top reasons for delaying dental visits are:\n\nCost. Respondents said it’s too expensive, 59%\n\nBeing too anxious or afraid of the dentist, 44%\n\nJust don’t want to go, 39%\n\nWorried about needing a procedure, 34%\n\nNot having dental insurance, 33%\n\nThe sample size of that survey was small, but several dentists that spoke to USA TODAY said they weren't surprised by the results.\n\nThe further out people push that first return visit, the scarier the procedures and total bill could become, said Dr. Sodabeh Etminan, dental director at the University of Illinois’ Mile Square Health Center, a network of health centers in the Chicago area.\n\nShe said anyone who hasn’t been to the dentist since before the pandemic needs to make it a priority.\n\n“I know it's easier said than done,\" Etminan said. \"Go in and get it done.

CBS, Aljazeera, France’s BFM TV and ITV have all reported the invasion in ways that illustrate deep bias, informed by a belief system that screams of an old-world, White-led, order.\n\nITV News correspondent Lucy Watson on ITV reporting back to the studio summed up the collective hypocrisy and underlying narrative that the Ukrainian war has exposed when she said: “The unthinkable has happened…this is not a developing, third-world nation; this is Europe!”\n\nAccording to the narrative she believes, “unthinkable things” happen only in “third world nations” (now an outdated and derogatory term, someone should tell her), and that narrative is perpetuated by the type of stories she and many like her, have heard about the continent.\n\nIn Africa, it’s the stories of conflict in Ethiopia, insurgency in Mozambique, election violence in Uganda, and the recent coups in Mali, Chad, Guinea, Sudan, Burkina Faso and Guinea Bissau. But it’s clear that far too many are not paying attention to them because the people in these stories are not rich or from the Global North.\n\nIt’s the reason why the ‘unthinkable things’ that happen in places like Africa are typically reported in terms of issues, numbers and trends – rather than the people, the emotions and the lives destroyed. In Africa our stories tend to offer simplistic analysis that lacks context and nuance, and prioritizes headline-grabbing proclamations, like this one from UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres about an “an epidemic of coup d’états” in response to the six coups in five out of 54 African countries over an 18-month period.\n\nThese examples have shown us that global media is complicit in perpetuating racist narratives, by not encouraging diversity in its newsrooms and giving an unrestricted platform to reporters and influential spokespeople with implicit biases that are left unchallenged. But rather than dwelling on this, I want to share some of the facts that should make us all rethink the traditional and stereotypical ways we dismiss non-White, non-rich countries and their people.\n\nThe traditional world order is undergoing a dramatic shift, driven by Covid-19, China, Russia, and movements like #MeToo and #BlackLivesMatter. The new world order is providing an opportunity for the world to rethink the little they know about the rest of the world.\n\nBy 2050, Nigeria will overtake the United States as the world’s third-most-populous country with a population of 400 million people. That’s one reason enough to pay attention. Africa’s population is growing rapidly and experts predict it will account for half the world’s people growth in the next two decades.\n\nThis means that more than a quarter of the world’s population will be on just one continent – Africa. The thought that the world will be overrun by Africans (no blue eyes or blonde hair here) will be an uncomfortable idea for some people, especially if they are unaware of the roughly 125,000 millionaires, 6,200 multimillionaires, 275 centimillionaires, and 22 billionaires that exist on the continent today.\n\nIndeed, a report by the University of Southern California in 2019, highlighted how poorly Africa is depicted in the US. It also revealed that Americans seldom see mentions of Africa or Africans on TV entertainment shows or in the news.\n\nWhen they do, the portrayals are often negative and stereotyped. According to the report, most mentions of Africa (43%) appeared on national or local news and tended to be ‘hard’ news stories which often fed the stereotype. After politics (32%), crime received the most mentions (16%), while business and the economy accounted for just 8% of news coverage.\n\nOver 60 research papers, reports, books, academic journals that we analyzed from the year 2000 written on Africa in the media told us that poverty, conflict, corruption, disease and poor leadership were the five frames through which most stories are told about Africa.\n\nThis persistent portrayal of a single story is the reason why over the years, Africans have fought back with hashtags like #TheAfricaTheMediaNeverShowsYou and #SomeoneTellCNN over a 2015 CNN report describing Kenya as a “hotbed of terror,” for which it later amended. And organizations like Africa No Filter, which set out to shift stereotypical narratives about Africa, were created. It’s the reason why the Twittersphere erupted recently when journalist Alan Macleod put together his greatest hits of racist coverage of the Ukraine invasion – thank you, Alan!\n\nContrary to what negative media portrayals might have you believe, Africa actually has some of the world’s fastest-growing economies. For example, to most of the world, Rwanda is synonymous with its 1994 genocide. But with an average GDP growth predicted of 6.7 between 2021-2025, it is in the top five of the fastest-growing economies alongside India. Rwanda has been able to attract foreign direct investment and is one of the easiest places to do business in Africa (after Mauritius) according to a World Bank index. This means Rwanda and countries like Seychelles, Mauritius, Ivory Coast, Ghana and Kenya are worth considering as potential destinations for investment, not just development dollars.\n\nDon’t ignore the data that shows that there are more than 400 companies that earn annual revenues of $1 billion or more in Africa, or that the second fastest-growing tourism market in the world is right here in Africa.\n\nIt’s also unlikely that many in the Global North will know any of this because it doesn’t fit the narrative both have been fed about non-white, ‘third world countries.’\n\nThe fastest-growing developer community and tech start-up ecosystem in the world is in Africa. Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania are ranked in the top 20 Global Crypto Adoption Index. This means they have some of the highest grass-roots adoptions of cryptocurrencies in the world. In fact, Kenya has been ranked first in the world when it comes to peer-to-peer cryptocurrency transactions. Given all this digital activity, it is hardly surprising that Africa is one of the fastest-growing markets in terms of venture capital activities and financial technology.\n\nAfrica is also regarded as the world’s second-fastest-growing and profitable payments and banking market after Latin America, according to this McKinsey study.\n\nThe reality is that much of what is happening in Africa today is unexpected. For example, six countries; Namibia, Cape Verde, Ghana, South Africa, Burkina Faso, and Botswana have a higher Press Freedom Index rating than the USA, according to Reporters Without Borders.\n\nBut that doesn’t fit the persistent image of a broken continent where nothing works, and where its sad, dependent people lack agency to make a change. The truth is there is new dynamic energy and entrepreneurial spirit on the continent which is a story that is largely untold, and its evidenced by the low esteem with which those in the Global North hold us.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter.

Sauter\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nThe U.S. Census estimates that 13.4 percent of Americans, about 42 million, lived below the poverty line in 2017.\n\nOf course, poverty is far from evenly distributed across the United States, and depending on a person’s race, gender, occupation, and social status, Americans are far less, or far more, likely to live in poverty. Some groups are more than twice as likely to experience poverty as the average American.\n\nBoth personal responsibility and structural pressures can lead to poverty, and experts often argue which affects poverty more. But some factors outside of the control of the individual — including being a woman, black, Hispanic, a child, or a disabled person — are an indicator that one is more likely to live in poverty.\n\nGreg Acs is vice president at the Income and Benefits Policy Center of the Urban Institute, an economic and social policy think tank. Acs helped explain the complexity of poverty, and why those certain groups are more likely to experience poverty. “The issue with poverty is that it's both a cause and a consequence of factors in the economy and society and personal decisions. So you'll find some groups that have higher poverty rates than others in no small part due to their inability to generate a lot of income on their own as a result of historical, economic, social, and personal factors.”\n\nMore:Brad Paisley, Kimberly Williams-Paisley to open free grocery store for those in need\n\nMore:Wealth in America: Where are the richest and poorest states based on household income?\n\nMore:What is the worst city to live in your state? Find out.\n\n24/7 Wall Street reviewed 2017 American Community Data from the U.S. Census Bureau to identify 11 distinct groups of Americans who are more likely than their peers to live in poverty. It is important to note that the more commonly reported poverty rate is based on the Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey, but to consistently use the level of detail required to break down poverty rates for specific groups, we used American Community Survey data in all cases.\n\nSome of the groups on this list are more likely to grow up in difficult homes, poor neighborhoods, and inadequate school systems. They face discrimination and limited work or advancement opportunities, and the effects of generational poverty, all which make it more likely they will live in poverty.\n\n11. Service workers\n\n• Poverty rate: 10.7 percent\n\n• Total in poverty: 26.2 million\n\n• Service workers as percentage of U.S. population: 8.2 percent\n\n• Service workers as percentage of poor population: 6.6 percent\n\nThe 10.1 percent poverty rate among service workers might not seem especially high, given that the national poverty rate is 13.4 percent, but Americans who are employed are far less likely to live in poverty than those who are not. For example, only 4.9 percent of America’s full-time workforce lived below the poverty line, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, half the poverty rate among service workers. Service workers represent a major part of the American workforce, and a large share of service workers earn minimum wage or close to it. As of 2017, two-thirds of all American workers earning the minimum wage or less were in service occupations. The current federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour, which, assuming a 40-hour work week, would not be enough to bring an individual with no dependents above the poverty level. Many states and municipalities have already passed, or are currently considering passing, legislation to increase the local minimum wage to $15 an hour.\n\n10. Women\n\n• Poverty rate: 14.5 percent\n\n• Total in poverty: 23.6 million\n\n• Women as percentage of U.S. population: 51.0 percent\n\n• Women as percentage of poor population: 55.4 percent\n\nWhile 12.2 percent of men in the United States live in poverty, the poverty rate for women is 14.5 percent. Because women face a number of unique challenges they at a greater risk of poverty and financial hardship. Women are paid far less than men — women earned 81.3 percent of men's median earnings in the second quarter of 2018. While much of this gap can be explained by the kinds of occupations women occupy, the pay gap between men and women persists even when job duties and qualifications are equal. Women with masters and doctoral degrees earn 71.9 percent of what men with a similar education earn, and they are paid less in nearly every occupation. Women are also more likely than men to work in low-paying occupations and spend more time providing unpaid caregiving to children or elderly family members.\n\nMore:Progress in fighting poverty in America has slowed despite recent economic recovery\n\n9. Hispanics and Latinos\n\n• Poverty rate: 19.4 percent\n\n• Total in poverty: 11.2 million\n\n• Hispanics and Latinos as percentage of U.S. population: 18.2 percent\n\n• Hispanics and Latinos as percentage of poor population: 26.2 percent\n\nSome 19.4 percent of Hispanic and Latino Americans live in poverty, far above the nationwide poverty 13.4 percent poverty rate for all Americans. Two factors contributing to the high poverty rate among Hispanics and Latinos are the group's relatively low education and earnings levels. Just 16.0 percent of Hispanic and Latino adults have a bachelor’s degree, half of the nationwide college attainment rate of 32.0 percent — for all races. Individuals with a college degree are more likely to hold advanced, high-paying jobs and report higher incomes overall. In the second quarter of 2018, the typical Hispanic or Latino workers earned just 76.9 percent of the median earnings for all workers.\n\nA large share of Latino workers also face racial discrimination that can reduce the likelihood of gaining employment and ultimately lead to lower earnings. According to a poll conducted by National Public Radio, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, one in three Hispanics and Latinos living in America report being discriminated against when applying for jobs.\n\n8. Children under five\n\n• Poverty rate: 20.2 percent\n\n• Total in poverty: 3.9 million\n\n• Children under 5 as percentage of U.S. population: 6.1 percent\n\n• Children under 5 as percentage of poor population: 9.2 percent\n\nChildren cannot earn incomes on their own, and so they are reliant entirely on the incomes of their parents to stay out of poverty. Compared to working-age adults or senior citizens, children are significantly more likely to live in poverty — 18.4 percent of Americans under age 18 live in poverty, compared to 12.6 percent of 18 to 64 year olds and 9.3 percent of senior citizens. And the most vulnerable children are the youngest. While 17.8 percent of children age 5 to 17 live in poverty, 20.2 percent of children under 5-years-old do.\n\n7. Non-citizen immigrants\n\n• Poverty rate: 20.4 percent\n\n• Total in poverty: 4.5 million\n\n• Non-citizens as percentage of U.S. population: 7.0 percent\n\n• Non-citizens as percentage of poor population: 10.6 percent\n\nOf the 44 million immigrants to the United States, slightly less than half have become citizens. Regardless of citizenship status, foreign-born people living in the United States are more likely than natural born Americans to live in poverty. About 20 percent of non-citizen immigrant residents earn poverty wages. Finding steady employment as an immigrant can be particularly difficult due to language barriers, discrimination, and more. Permanent employment status can help pave the path to citizenship, which helps explain why those who are not yet citizens are particularly likely to earn low wages. The Census is widely believe to heavily undercount those who currently live in the country illegally, and poverty estimates for this group likely far exceed poverty rate of other immigrant groups.\n\n6. Black and African Americans\n\n• Poverty rate: 23.0 percent\n\n• Total in poverty: 9.1 million\n\n• African Americans as percentage of U.S. population: 12.5 percent\n\n• African Americans as percentage of poor population: 21.4 percent\n\nBlack and African Americans living in the United States face a wide range of institutional obstacles that make earning a steady, livable income, as well as the possibility of escaping poverty, extremely difficult. Black Americans are more than twice as likely as whites or Asian Americans to live in poverty. According to a report by the Brookings Institution, black Americans encounter inequalities in education, discrimination in the workplace, ineffective parenting, high incarceration rates, and more. One in eight Americans are black, but black Americans make up more than one-fourth of the nation’s poor population.\n\n5. Adults with less than a high school diploma\n\n• Poverty rate: 24.7 percent\n\n• Total in poverty: 6.3 million\n\n• Adults w/o a high school diploma as percentage of U.S. population: 8.1 percent\n\n• Adults w/o a high school diploma as percentage of poor population: 14.9 percent\n\nWhile there are several famous Americans who dropped out of high school or college and are now successful billionaires, generally educational attainment is a strong indicator of one's earnings potential. Most jobs that pay above poverty wages require, at the very least, a high school diploma, and a large share also require a bachelor’s degree. Among American adults, typical earnings correspond directly with educational attainment. The typical adult who did not graduate from high school earns $20,924 a year, roughly $8,000 less than median earnings for those graduated high school but did not proceed to higher education. The typical American with just a bachelor’s degree earns $51,094 a year, over $30,000 more than the median earnings for Americans who have not graduated high school.\n\n4. American Indian and Alaska Natives\n\n• Poverty rate: 25.4 percent\n\n• Total in poverty: 670,571\n\n• American Indian and Alaska Natives as percentage of U.S. population: 0.8 percent\n\n• American Indian and Alaska Natives as percentage of poor population: 1.6 percent\n\nNative Americans are still dealing with the effects of 400 years of persecution and discrimination. At the time of colonization, the U.S. government forced tribes onto remote reservations that often lacked natural resources or arable soil. Today, American Indians have the highest poverty rate of any major racial group in the United States, with one in four living below the poverty line. Those who live on reservations face obstacles such as food insecurity and associated health problems like diabetes.\n\n3. Americans with a disability\n\n• Poverty rate: 25.7 percent\n\n• Total in poverty: 9.6 million\n\n• Disabled as percentage of U.S. population: 11.8 percent\n\n• Disabled as percentage of poor population: 22.6 percent\n\nAs is the case with many conditions associated with poverty, causality goes both ways. Those who have a disability have a higher risk of becoming poor, and those who are poor have a higher risk of becoming disabled. Those with a disability, physical or otherwise, are much more likely to be unable to work. In 1990, the U.S. government passed the Americans With Disabilities Act, designed to ensure the financial security of people with a debilitating condition or injury. Still, evidence suggests that workplace discrimination continues, and the disabled generally have a harder time finding steady work and earning above-poverty wages. The unemployment gap between the disabled and not disabled has actually widened since the ADA was passed.\n\n2. The unemployed\n\n• Poverty rate: 30.4 percent\n\n• Total in poverty: 2.6 million\n\n• Unemployed as percentage of U.S. population: 2.7 percent\n\n• Unemployed as percentage of poor population: 6.1 percent\n\nMany people who live in poverty work full- or part-time, earning poverty level wages, but one of the more obvious contributors of poverty is earning no wages at all. Just 4.9 percent of those who were employed at least 27 weeks in 2016 lived in poverty. More than 30 percent of Americans who were unemployed and actively seeking work lived in poverty. Those who are unemployed are eligible for state unemployment benefits, but these are often not enough to escape poverty, particularly if the unemployed person has dependents to support. Those who live in poverty are also more likely to have difficulty finding employment for many reasons, including the fact that those growing up in poverty are less likely to have high school and higher education.\n\n1. Single recent mothers\n\n• Poverty rate: 44.3 percent\n\n• Total in poverty: 592,588\n\n• Unmarried recent mothers as percentage of U.S. population: 0.4 percent\n\n• Unmarried recent mothers as percentage of poor population: 1.4 percent\n\nA dependent child can be a significant cost burden, especially for single parent, and is often enough to push the parent — often a mother — and child into poverty. Among recent single mothers, an astounding 44.3 percent live in poverty. In comparison, just 11.4 percent of married recent mothers live in poverty. While an unplanned-for pregnancy can occur among people of all social and economic levels, low-income women have far more unwanted pregnancies than higher-income women. A 2011 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that low-income women were five times more likely to have an unplanned pregnancy than high-income women.\n\nDetailed findings\n\nMost people who live above the poverty line are able to do so through their jobs. For this reason, the groups that have higher poverty rates generally are less likely to be steadily employed, or are less likely to have high-salaried positions. The disabled and the poorly-educated, for example, are two of the most likely groups to be in poverty because they either cannot access certain kinds of jobs or are less attractive to potential high-paying jobs.\n\nThe importance of not only being employed but also well paid in order to stay out of poverty is evident in the poverty rate among Americans employed in the service industry, which, at 10.7 percent, is about twice the poverty rate for those who have jobs. Even full-time service industry workers, many of whom earn minimum wage, often earn poverty incomes.\n\n“In service industries, many of these jobs don't require the highest level of skill or education or training,\" Acs said. \"They do require a lot of personal responsibility and reliability, but because there's a large competitive pool of folks that can do those jobs, and to the extent that those jobs are gendered and there are gender differences that are baked into the way we value work, those jobs tend to pay less, and hence folks working in those jobs tend to have higher poverty rates.”\n\nMany of the groups on this list are racial or ethnic groups, including black, Hispanic, and American Indians. While the poverty rate for white Americans is around 10 percent, it is roughly double for black and Hispanic Americans, and it is 25 percent for American Indians.\n\nAttempting to explain the difficulties in assessing why certain social or economic groups have higher poverty rates, Acs said, “Racial and ethnic differences [in the poverty rate] are really complex.” He added that one major reason for the disparity is that these groups appear to have more limited access to opportunities for gainful employment, due in part to, he said “...discrimination, and the long-term structural barriers that affect the circumstance of the neighborhoods in which African Americans grew up, as opposed to neighborhoods where whites grew up.”\n\nFor many specific groups in poverty, there is the argument that individuals in high-poverty groups did not take actions that could lift them out of poverty, including obtaining an education and leaving their impoverished neighborhood. “But,” Acs noted, “the reason they didn't do those things was that their poverty or intergenerational poverty reduced those opportunities factors, and society constrains where people can live and what jobs they get offered.”\n\nHaving a child is a significant expense on a family, and larger families must earn more to escape poverty. Poor families are therefore more likely to be large, and for this reason, children are more likely than both working-age adults and the elderly to live in poverty.\n\nSingle parents, particularly single mothers, are one of the most impoverished groups in America, in part because impoverished Americans are more likely to have unwanted pregnancies, and also because supporting a child with a single source of income is more burdensome on an individual, who cannot rely on a partner for flexibility in childcare or income.\n\nMethodology\n\nBased on data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 24/7 Wall Street identified population groups that are more likely to live in poverty compared to other comparable groups. The share of service workers in poverty is based on the July 2018 U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Report “A profile of the working poor, 2016,\" which identifies the poverty rate for all workers employed in a profession for 27 weeks or more during 2016. The remainder of data on poverty rates came from the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2017 American Community Survey (ACS) one-year estimates. Average earnings by occupation, sex, and race also came from the 2017 ACS.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

But as Wall Street grapples with heading back-to-work, a rare chasm is growing between the finance giants.\n\nThe implications of these choices, and the resulting stratification of policies will likely ripple through the world of finance and out to Main Street in the coming months.\n\nCitigroup's chief executive Jane Fraser announced in March 2021 that the majority of the company's 210,000 employees will be allowed to go hybrid with three days in the office and two days at home each week. UBS made similar plans last month with the launch of their Virtual Worker Framework that will allow some US employees to work 100% remotely.\n\nGoldman Sachs, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley are taking hardline approaches, requiring employees to come into the office five days a week.\n\nThis shift toward flexibility on Wall Street comes as the industry faces a new competitive recruiting landscape -- Big Tech and cryptocurrency jobs offer recent graduates big salaries, big perks, and fewer hours in the office. Banks responded by dolling out higher base salaries and bonuses.\n\nBut money isn't always enough. A January study by MIT's Sloan Management Review found that flexibility on remote work arrangements was 150% more predictive of high employee retention rates than compensation levels.\n\nBanks like Citi are responding by offering Zoom-free Fridays, Citi Reset Day, an annual firmwide holiday, and hybrid work for those who want it.\n\nTom Naratil, President of UBS Americas, said his program will \"appeal to a more diverse pool of applicants and increase employee retention,\" giving the bank a competitive advantage in an increasingly competitive landscape. \"We recognize the world has changed and we continue to adapt so that we can deliver the best for our clients and our people,\" he said.\n\nSome banks don't agree with that stance. They're betting that hybrid work is a pandemic-era flash in the pan.\n\n\"Bringing our employees safely back to the office is core to our apprenticeship culture and client-centric business,\" said Andrea Williams, Goldman Sachs global head of media relations. \"What's clear through the process is that we are better together than apart, especially as an employer of choice for those in the beginning stage of their career.\"\n\nAbout 75% of Goldman Sachs staff is a Millennial or Gen-Zer.\n\nSo far, Goldman's bet is paying off. The bank's summer internship program saw a record 236,000 applicants in 2022, a 17% increase from 2021 and 202,000 full-time first-year applicants, a 27% increase year-over-year.\n\nGoldman was one of the only firms to hold an in-person program for summer interns in 2021 and will do the same this year.\n\nMorgan Stanley CEO James Gorman said during a keynote speech at the Australian Financial Review Business Summit in Sydney last month that it's unrealistic to expect to excel at a job without being physically present.\n\n\"A lot of us have gone into the mindset of 'Jobland',\" Gorman said. \"Well if you're in 'Careerland,' you need to be around other people to learn from them a bit.\"\n\nWe're in the middle of a restarting phenomenon, said Steven Davis, a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. The nature of work will become stratified -- companies will decide where they stand on hybrid work and workers will sort themselves based on their own preferences.\n\nA lack of diversity\n\nThe problem is that older workers, women, and workers of color have expressed stronger preferences to work from home or in a hybrid setup. That means companies that require their employees to commute into the office full time may end up lacking diversity on their teams.\n\nA recent Axios-Harris Poll survey found that 52% of women say they enjoy working remotely and would like to do so in the long term, compared with 41% of men. About 15% of women say working in person allows for more camaraderie among colleagues, compared with 25% of men, and 52% of Black workers and 50% of women say working from home is better than working in the office when it comes to advancing in their careers, compared with 42% of men.\n\nA shortage of child care workers in the United States is also weighing on women who are unable to return find the affordable caretakers they need to enable them to return to the office, said Ileen DeVault, professor of labor history at the School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University,\n\n\"If you let everybody choose what they want to do, it looks like women and minority group members will spend less time on the worksite than men and white employees,\" said Davis. \"People seem to like the workplace less when they are in a distinct minority. And it's not just about gender, race and ethnicity. It also shows up with respect to political persuasion, and religious beliefs.\"\n\nThis could make the workplace \"an even less minority-friendly place.\" he said. \"Individual worksites might become more homogeneous.\"\n\nJust 5% of Goldman Sachs managing director class are Black, and 30% of the class are women, CEO David Solomon reported in his 2021 annual report and shareholder letter. The class is the most diverse to date but \"we still have much work to do to build and retain a pipeline of diverse leadership,\" he said, noting that the company was hiring additional diversity recruiters and expanding sponsorship and development programs for diverse talent.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nWall Street has long been considered a pacesetter for US policy and corporate culture at large , and it appears that Washington is echoing the calls of David Solomon, James Gorman, and Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan.\n\n\"Because of the progress we've made fighting Covid, Americans can not only get back to work, but they can go to the office and safely fill our great downtown cities again,\" President Joe Biden announced in his State of the Union address.\n\nBut a growing number of Big Tech companies including Facebook, Twitter and Slack have already made remote work their permanent norm. Apple and Google are embracing hybrid models, for now. Management consulting company McKinsey has called this change a once in a generation reimagining of work, but warned that it would take years of experimentation to find the right calibration.\n\nThe proof, said Davis of the Booth school, is in the pudding (or in this case, the patents). The share of new patent applications that advance work from home technologies has been following an upward trajectory since the onset of the pandemic.\n\nThat improved technology will be a force in supporting \"a new equilibrium where many organizations do have hybrid work as an important feature of their working arrangements,\" he said.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated when Citi announced its hybrid plan.

The early weeks of Trump’s presidency indeed match his campaign rhetoric, replete with an executive order seeking to make assault against police officers a federal crime.\n\nAmericans are understandably divided by Trump’s “law and order” approach to policing reform. Research suggests Americans’ reactions to Trump’s policies will be shaped both by their own experiences with police and by their moral predispositions.\n\nIt starts with race. Anyone discussing policing in the U.S. needs to grapple with the fact that there is a wide racial divide in perception of police performance.\n\nA Cato Institute survey found a strikingly high number — 73% — of African Americans and 54% of Hispanics believe that police are “too quick” to resort to deadly force with citizens. Only 35% of whites agree. Similarly, African Americans and Hispanics are also 20 to 30 points less likely than whites to believe that their local police treat all racial groups equally or are held accountable for misconduct.\n\nDifferent personal and vicarious experiences with the police undergird this divide.\n\nThe survey found that African Americans are nearly twice as likely as white Americans to report police swearing at them or to know someone physically mistreated by police.\n\nRelated content:\n\nInvestigate policing in the USA: Our view\n\nOn prison reform, should nation follow in footsteps of Louisiana?: Column\n\nOfficers fired after video shows handcuffed suspect stomped on the head\n\nInterestingly enough, the study also found that African Americans report being stopped by police disproportionately more than whites as their incomes rise. This suggests that police are disproportionately scrutinizing black drivers in nice cars or in nice neighborhoods. Overall, higher-income African Americans report being stopped about 1.5 times more frequently than higher-income white Americans (and lower-income black and white Americans as well).\n\nBut what explains how the majority of Americans evaluate the police, given that most Americans haven’t had negative interactions with them? For instance, despite Republicans and Democrats having access to the same video footage of police shootings in previous years, survey data show that they’ve reached dramatically different conclusions.\n\nStarting points\n\nStrong majorities of Republicans believe that police only use deadly force when necessary (80%), are impartial (78%) and courteous (74%), and are held accountable for their actions (76%). This stands in contrast to Democrats, among whom a majority believe police are too quick to use lethal force (63%), fail to be impartial (60%), and aren’t held accountable (59%). Race can’t explain this pattern: It persists among white Republicans and white Democrats as well.\n\nSo why do Democrats tend to believe that policing suffers from systemic problems, while Republicans think problems are isolated or confined to “bad apples”? Social psychology may offer some answers.\n\nSocial psychologists have found that moral judgments strongly affect evaluations of controversial facts. Before we’ve even had a chance to sort through the empirical evidence, our minds tend to make rapid effortless moral judgments. We then engage in post-hoc reasoning to defend our conclusions.\n\nIn sum, people often engage in what scientists call “motivated reasoning,” where moral judgments come first and the justifications come later.\n\nThe morality of the issue\n\nWhile each of us shares the same moral instincts to one degree or another, some moral commitments are more salient than others to liberals or conservatives.\n\nData show conservatives place greater emphasis on societal order and thus tend to be more deferential toward authority figures like the police. Likewise, respect for authority figures may significantly drive positive attitudes toward the police, irrespective of the circumstances, particularly among conservatives.\n\nIn contrast, liberals are inclined to be more skeptical of authority figures and to empathize more particularly with vulnerable groups who report disparate treatment from the police, such as African Americans. This general propensity to empathize is a significant predictor of white Democrats’ belief that the justice system is racially biased.\n\nNaturally, there are exceptions. Not every Democrat is skeptical of the police, and not every Republican is deferential to authority. Nevertheless, data clearly show us a clear divide when it comes to how partisans think about authority.\n\nWith that in mind, policing reform is possible, but it’s hard. The U.S. is a vast and diverse country with about 18,000 law enforcement agencies. Widespread and comprehensive reform in such an environment is difficult. Yet there are areas of emerging consensus, with clear majorities across partisan and racial groups supporting body cameras and independent agencies investigating police misconduct.\n\nWhen tackling policing reform, Trump should put himself in other people’s shoes. There are many law-abiding Americans who shudder when they hear about giving “power back to the police,” and Trump would be well served to understand why.\n\nEmily Ekins is a political scientist and director of polling at the Cato Institute.

And in New York City, one patient has tested positive for orthopoxvirus, the family of viruses to which monkeypox belongs, NYC health officials announced in a news release Friday.\n\nThe case is being treated as a \"presumptive positive\" case until confirmed pending CDC testing and the patient is currently isolating, the release states.\n\nNew York City health officials had also tested one other patient for monkeypox, but that case has been ruled out, health officials said. City officials have been working with state authorities from the New York State Department of Health in their investigation of the two cases, both of which were identified Thursday.\n\nNew York State Health Commissioner Dr. Mary T. Bassett said in a statement Friday that \"the current risk to the public is low.\"\n\n\"Reports of suspected cases of monkeypox in the United States and elsewhere are concerning. While a possible case in New York State awaits confirmatory testing by our local and federal partners, the Department has alerted health care providers in New York State so that they can consider this unusual diagnosis if their patients present with symptoms,\" Bassett said.\n\nMeanwhile, recent monkeypox infections have been identified in several other regions around the world where the virus is not usually common, including Canada, Great Britain, Italy, Northern Ireland and Spain.\n\n\"We have a level of scientific concern about what we're seeing because this is a very unusual situation. Monkeypox is normally only reported in West Africa or Central Africa, and we don't see it in the United States or in Europe -- and the number of cases that are being reported is definitely outside the level of normal for what we would see,\" Jennifer McQuiston , deputy director of the Division of High Consequence Pathogens and Pathology within the CDC's National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, told CNN on Thursday.\n\n\"At the same time, there really aren't that many cases that are being reported -- I think maybe a dozen, a couple dozen -- so, the general public should not be concerned that they are at immediate risk for monkeypox,\" she said. \"We're working through the investigations.\"\n\nOverall, \"we have people who are being monitored for diseases all the time,\" CDC spokesperson Christine Pearson wrote in an email, Thursday. That means that if someone might have been exposed to a pathogen, their health is monitored, and they should see physicians if they develop symptoms.\n\nAs for the six people currently being monitored for potential monkeypox, they all \"are healthy, with no symptoms and are considered at low risk for monkeypox,\" Pearson wrote, adding that none were seated next to the ill passenger and none had direct contact.\n\nAs the CDC's investigation continues, discussions have started to include the topic of vaccines.\n\nCDC 'discussing and evaluating' smallpox vaccine\n\nCDC officials are evaluating whether smallpox vaccine should be offered to healthcare workers treating monkeypox patients and other people who may be at \"high risk\" for exposure to monkeypox, McQuiston said.\n\n\"It's definitely something that we're discussing and evaluating, whether offering smallpox vaccine makes sense in the current setting,\" she said. \"We'll be closer to making recommendations for that in the next day or so.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED How vaccines stop the spread of viruses Replay More Videos ...

But cases have been identified that were associated with international travel or importing animals from areas where the disease is more common. After the virus jumps from an animal to a human, human-to-human transmission of monkeypox can occur when a person encounters the virus through direct contact to: large respiratory droplets, bodily fluids, or lesions on the skin.\n\nMonkeypox symptoms can include fever, headache, muscle aches and swollen lymph nodes. A characteristic of the disease is that it can cause lesions and a rash on the body , including the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet.\n\n\"This is not a disease that is going to sweep across the country,\" Dr. Daniel Bausch, president of the American Society of Tropical Medicine & Hygiene, told CNN on Thursday.\n\n\"From a public health angle, of course, we need to investigate and respond -- I think the general population should just be aware of this -- but there's certainly no reason to panic and I think it's highly, highly, highly unlikely that we will get any sort of large outbreak of this,\" he said. \"And if you haven't had contact in Massachusetts and you're not related to the person who had disease or in that link at all -- until we have any other reason to expect or to understand how this disease got into the United States -- your risk of getting monkeypox is really low.\"\n\nA monkeypox mystery\n\nIn Massachusetts, physicians donning the same personal protective equipment they wear for Covid-19 patients have been treating the US monkeypox patient at a special pathogens unit within Massachusetts General Hospital, where he originally was diagnosed.\n\n\"They were undergoing a workup related to symptoms and the infectious diseases physician seeing the patient, learning about some of the cases in the United Kingdom, decided that the patient could possibly have monkeypox,\" Dr. Erica Shenoy, medical director for the Regional Emerging Special Pathogens Treatment Center and associate chief of the infection control unit at Massachusetts General Hospital, told CNN on Thursday.\n\n\"Then we had discussions with our state public health officials. The decision was made that yes, they did meet criteria for testing,\" Shenoy said. The patient tested positive.\n\n\"I think to the public overall, there really is no clear risk at this point,\" Shenoy said. \"This is an evolving situation that we're looking to understand better -- why these clusters that have been reported as well in the UK and in Portugal and Spain are happening, and to better understand the epidemiology.\"\n\nBoth in the United Kingdom and Canada, health authorities have noted that many of the monkeypox cases were identified in men who have sex with men -- but the virus is not typically described as a sexually transmitted infection and investigations into these recent cases continue.\n\nMonkeypox was first discovered in 1958 when two outbreaks of a pox-like illness were seen in colonies of monkeys that were kept for research, leading to the name \"monkeypox,\" according to the CDC. The first human case of monkeypox was reported years later in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo, during a time when intense efforts were underway to eliminate smallpox.\n\nIn the United States, the last outbreak of monkeypox recorded was in 2003, when 47 confirmed and probable cases were reported in six states: Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, Ohio and Wisconsin. \"No instances of monkeypox infection were attributed exclusively to person-to-person contact,\" according to CDC.\n\nAll of the people infected with monkeypox during that outbreak became ill after having contact with pet prairie dogs, the CDC found. Those pets were housed at an animal vendor's facilities in Illinois where they may have been infected with the virus. The facilities housed other small mammals imported from Ghana that tested positive for monkeypox virus: two African giant pouched rats, nine dormice and three rope squirrels.\n\n\"The prairie dogs got monkeypox from the imported animals and then passed it on to the humans,\" Bausch said. \"It's a bit of a misnomer calling it monkeypox.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nKennedy Space Center, Florida (CNN) The launch of NASA's historic Artemis I moon mission has been postponed after the team was unable to work through an issue with one of the rocket's four engines.\n\n\"It's too early to say what the options are,\" said Mike Sarafin, Artemis mission manager at a NASA press conference. \"We really need time to look at all the information, all the data. We're going to play all nine innings here. We're not ready to give up yet.\"\n\nThe next opportunity to send the Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft on their journey is September 2, but whether or not another attempt is made that day depends on how testing goes.\n\nSarafin confirmed that \"Friday is definitely in play\" if the team can resolve the issue while the rocket sits on the pad within the next 48 to 72 hours.\n\nThe next launch window is September 2, opening at 12:48 p.m. ET and closing at 2:48 p.m. ET. The next window after that is September 5, opening at 5:12 p.m. ET and closing at 6:42 p.m. ET.\n\n\"Launch controllers were continuing to evaluate why a bleed test to get the RS-25 engines on the bottom of the core stage to the proper temperature range for liftoff was not successful, and ran out of time in the two-hour launch window,\" according to an update from NASA. \"Engineers are continuing to gather additional data.\"\n\nThe launch team knew that the bleed test was a risk because they weren't able to include it in previous wet dress rehearsal tests simulating the launch, and Monday was the first time demonstrating that, Sarafin said.\n\nCurrently, the issue doesn't suggest an engine problem, but rather an issue within the bleed system that is used to cool the engine, he said.\n\n\"We need the engine to be at the cryogenically cool temperature such that when it starts, it's not shocked with all the cold fuel that flows through it. So we needed a little extra time to assess that,\" Sarafin said.\n\nThe team also saw an issue with the vent valve at the inner tank and the combination of issues convinced the team they needed more time, Sarafin said.\n\nIf a substantial fix is needed the team may require more time to address it and roll the rocket stack back into the Kennedy Space Center's Vehicle Assembly Building, a process that takes 3 1/2 days.\n\nThe launch team still needs to troubleshoot the engine issue and will keep the rocket in its current configuration to gather data and assess what needs to be done. Both the Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft remain stable, according to NASA officials.\n\nPrior to the scrub, the countdown was extended into an unplanned hold as the launch team worked on a troubleshooting plan for one of the rocket's four engines.\n\nThat's because the launch team discovered an issue with an engine bleed in engine #3. Attempts to reconfigure it were unsuccessful.\n\nDuring engine bleeds, hydrogen is cycled through the engine to condition it for launch. Three of the four engines are performing as expected, but engine #3 experienced an issue.\n\n\"There were also a series of weather issues throughout the launch window. We would have been a no-go for weather at the beginning of the window due to precipitation. Later on in the window, we would have been no-go for lightning within the launchpad area,\" Sarafin said.\n\nPreviously, 80% favorable weather conditions had been forecast for the beginning of the window, which opened at 8:33 a.m. ET, but the weather changed as that time inched closer.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, who traveled to Kennedy Space Center in Florida with second gentleman Doug Emhoff to watch the launch, underscored the United States' commitment to NASA's Artemis program in comments made after the postponement.\n\n\"While we hoped to see the launch of Artemis I today, the attempt provided valuable data as we test the most powerful rocket in history,\" Harris said via Twitter . \"Our commitment to the Artemis Program remains firm, and we will return to the moon.\"\n\nThe 322-foot-tall (98-meter-tall) stack is sitting on Launchpad 39B at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\n\nNASA Administrator Bill Nelson addressed the scrub shortly after it was announced, stressing that Artemis I is a test flight.\n\n\"We don't launch until it's right,\" Nelson said. \"They've got a problem with the gases going on the engine bleed on one engine. It's just illustrative that this is a very complicated machine, a very complicated system, and all those things have to work. You don't light the candle until it's ready to go.\"\n\nIt's something Nelson has personal experience with. As an astronaut, he was on the 24th flight of the Space Shuttle. It was scrubbed four times on the pad and the fifth try resulted in a flawless mission.\n\n\"Had we launched on any one of those scrubs, it wouldn't have been a good day,\" he said.\n\nSeveral issues cropped up after the rocket began fueling after midnight.\n\nOffshore storms with the potential for lightning prevented the team from beginning the fueling process, due to start at midnight, for about an hour.\n\nThe hold was lifted at 1:13 a.m. ET, and the tanking process began to load the rocket's core stage with supercold liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen.\n\nThe team stopped filling the tank with liquid hydrogen twice due to an initial leak as well as a pressure spike, but tanking resumed for the core stage and began for the upper stage, or the interim cryogenic propulsion stage.\n\nThe team also discovered a line of frost on the inner stage flange. At first, engineers thought the frost may indicate the presence of a crack in the tank, but it turned out to be a crack in the external foam. The team shared that the issue had been resolved since the foam crack did not indicate a leak.\n\nEngineers also experienced an 11-minute delay in communications between the Orion spacecraft and ground systems. The issue could have impacted the beginning of terminal count, or the countdown that begins when 10 minutes remain on the clock before liftoff. The team was able to work through the issue, which was the result of a simple misconfiguration.\n\nIn addition to the visit by Harris, appearances by celebrities like Jack Black, Chris Evans and Keke Palmer and performances of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" by Josh Groban and Herbie Hancock and \"America the Beautiful\" by The Philadelphia Orchestra and cellist Yo-Yo Ma were planned as part of the program.\n\nMission overview\n\nWhen Artemis I launches, Orion's journey will last 42 days as it travels to the moon, loops around it and returns to Earth -- traveling a total of 1.3 million miles (2.1 million kilometers). When it returns to Earth, the capsule will splash down in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of San Diego.\n\nWhile the passenger list doesn't include any humans, it does have passengers: three mannequins and a plush Snoopy toy will ride in Orion.\n\nThe crew aboard Artemis I may sound a little unusual, but they each serve a purpose. Snoopy will serve as the zero gravity indicator -- meaning that he will begin to float inside the capsule once it reaches the space environment.\n\nCameras inside and outside of Orion will share images and video throughout the mission, including live views from the Callisto experiment , which will capture a stream of Commander Moonikin Campos sitting in the commander's seat. If you have an Amazon Alexa-enabled device, you can ask it about the mission's location each day.\n\nExpect to see views of Earthrise, similar to what was shared during Apollo 8 for the first time, but with much better cameras and technology.\n\nScience experiments and technology demonstrations are riding in a ring on the rocket. The 10 small satellites, called CubeSats, will detach and go their separate ways to collect information on the moon and the deep space environment.\n\nThe inaugural mission of the Artemis program will kick off a phase of space exploration that lands diverse astronaut crews at previously unexplored regions of the moon and eventually delivers crewed missions to Mars.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/08/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/28/world/nasa-phrases-artemis-1-explained-scn/index.html", "title": "What the words you'll hear during the moon mission launch really ...", "text": "Turn to CNN for live coverage from Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Saturday afternoon.

Apollo 17 would be the program’s final moon mission.\n\nHere are some important things to know about the Apollo 15 mission on its 50th anniversary.\n\nThe crew\n\nApollo 15’s crew consisted of David Scott, Al Worden and James Irwin.\n\nScott, the commander, was selected as an astronaut as part of the third group of NASA astronauts in 1963. He flew three times in space and is the last living commander of an Apollo mission that landed. He was the seventh human to walk on the moon.\n\nIrwin served as Apollo Lunar Module pilot. He was the eighth person to walk on the moon and the first, and youngest, of those astronauts to die.\n\nWorden was the command module pilot. He orbited the moon 74 times in the command module Endeavour while Scott and Irwin completed their mission on the moon.\n\nWorden and Irwin both were members of the fifth group of NASA astronauts, chosen in 1966. Irwin died 1991 and Worden in 2020.\n\nThe spacecraft\n\nApollo 15’s command and service module was named Endeavour (CSM-112), after HMS Endeavour. The lunar module (LM-10) was named Falcon after the United States Air Force Academy mascot.\n\nScott said he chose the name Endeavour because its captain, James Cook, had commanded the first purely scientific sea voyage, and Apollo 15 was the first lunar landing mission on which there was a heavy emphasis on science.\n\nApollo 15 took with it a small piece of wood from Cook's ship while Falcon carried two falcon feathers to the moon in recognition of the crew's service in the Air Force.\n\nIf Apollo 15 had flown as an H mission as initially planned, it would have used a different command service module (CSM-111) and lunar landing module (LM-9). Instead, CSM-111 was used by the Apollo–Soyuz Test Project in 1975, but the lunar module went unused and is now at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex.\n\nEndeavour is on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio.\n\nNice duds\n\nThe Apollo 15 astronauts wore redesigned space suits.\n\nOn all previous Apollo flights, including the non-lunar ones, the commander and lunar module pilot had worn suits with the life support, liquid cooling and communications connections in two parallel rows of three.\n\nOn Apollo 15, the new suits had the connectors situated in triangular pairs. This new arrangement, along with the relocation of the entry zipper (which went in an up-down motion on the old suits), to run diagonally from the right shoulder to the left hip, aided in suiting and unsuiting in the cramped confines of the spacecraft.\n\nIt also allowed for a new waist joint, letting the astronauts bend completely over and also sit on the rover.\n\nUpgraded backpacks allowed for longer-duration moonwalks.\n\nWorden wore a suit similar to those worn by the Apollo 14 astronauts, but modified to interface with Apollo 15's equipment.\n\nGear needed only for lunar surface extravehicular activities (aka EVAs or space walks), such as the liquid cooling garment, was not included with Worden's suit, as the only EVA he was expected to do was one to retrieve film cartridges from the Scientific Instrument Module bay on the flight home.\n\nNice ride\n\nScott and Irwin arrived on the moon’s surface at 6:16 p.m. on July 30.\n\nWhile Apollo 14’s moon-walking crew had the luxury of a two-wheeled hand cart, Apollo 15 took things a step further by delivering a four-wheeled cruiser to the moon.\n\nThe Lunar Roving Vehicle could be folded into a space 5 feet by 20 inches. Unloaded, it weighed 460 pounds and when carrying two astronauts and their equipment, 1,500 pounds.\n\nEach wheel was independently driven by a ¼ horsepower electric motor.\n\nAlthough it could be driven by either astronaut, the commander always drove.\n\nTravelling at speeds up to 6 to 8 mph, it meant for the first time the astronauts could travel farther from their lander and still have enough time to do scientific experiments.\n\nThe Apollo 15 rover bore a plaque, reading: \"Man's First Wheels on the Moon, Delivered by Falcon, July 30, 1971.”\n\nUpon arriving at the surface of the moon, one of the first things Scott and Irwin did was set up the rover.\n\nOnce it was set up and in motion, Scott said: \"Okay. Out of detent; we're moving,\" while maneuvering the rover away from Falcon in mid-sentence.\n\nThese were the first words uttered by a human while driving a vehicle on the moon.\n\nIf you’re wondering, “detent” is defined as “a mechanical or magnetic means to resist or arrest the rotation of a wheel, axle or spindle. Such a device can be anything ranging from a simple metal pin to a machine.”\n\nThe rover carried a television camera, controlled remotely from Houston. The resolution was not high compared to the still photographs that would be taken, but the camera allowed the geologists on Earth to indirectly participate in Scott's and Irwin's activities.\n\nWhile on the moon\n\nOnce the rover was up and running, Scott and Irwin drove to “Elbow Crater.”\n\nThe astronauts took samples there and then drove to another crater on the flank of Mons Hadley Delta, where they took more.\n\nAfter concluding this stop, they returned to the lander to drop off their samples and prepare to set up the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package, the scientific instruments that would remain when they left.\n\nThe first EVA lasted 6 hours and 32 minutes.\n\nOn the second surface mission, the crew went to Spur Crater, where they collected a sample that came to be known as the “Genesis Rock.”\n\nThis rock is believed to be part of the early lunar crust. The hope of finding such a specimen had been one reason this site had been chosen.\n\nThe second EVA lasted 7 hours, 12 minutes.\n\nDuring the third and final EVA, the crew struggled to retrieve some samples, but they did prove an important scientific theory.\n\nScott used a feather and hammer to demonstrate Galileo's theory that all objects in a given gravity field fall at the same rate, regardless of mass, in the absence of aerodynamic drag.\n\nHe dropped the hammer and feather at the same time; because of the negligible lunar atmosphere, there was no drag on the feather, which hit the ground at the same time as the hammer.\n\nThe EVA lasted 4 hours, 49 minutes and 50 seconds.\n\nBack to Earth\n\nFalcon lifted off the moon at 1:22 p.m. on Aug. 2 after 66 hours and 55 minutes on the lunar surface. Docking with the command surface module took place just under two hours later.\n\nThe crew spent the next two days working on orbital science experiments, including more observations of the Moon from orbit.\n\nEndeavour departed lunar orbit at 5:22 p.m. on Aug. 4.\n\nThe next day, during the return to Earth, Worden performed a 39-minute EVA to retrieve film cassettes from the service module's scientific instrument module bay, with assistance from Irwin, who remained at the command module's hatch.\n\nAt approximately 197,000 miles from Earth, it was the first \"deep space\" EVA in history, performed at great distance from any planetary body.\n\nAs of 2021, it remains one of only three such EVAs, all performed during Apollo's J-missions under similar circumstances.\n\nRough landing\n\nAs the crew capsule fell toward the ocean on Aug. 7, one of the three parachutes failed after deploying.\n\nFortunately, only two were required for a safe landing, with a third there for redundancy.\n\nUpon landing in the North Pacific Ocean, the capsule and crew were recovered and taken aboard the recovery ship, USS Okinawa, after a mission lasting 12 days, 7 hours, 11 minutes and 53 seconds.\n\nWalters can be reached at twalters@gannett.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2021/11/23/michael-strahan-blue-origin-space-flight-gma-announcement/8733076002/", "title": "Michael Strahan in space: 'GMA' host to join third Blue Origin flight", "text": "Move over, William Shatner – it's Michael Strahan's turn to travel out of this world.\n\nThe \"Good Morning America\" host is going to be on Blue Origin's next flight to space, the former NFL football player announced on the morning show Tuesday.

Phil Scott's weekly news conference.\n\nOver 30 \"presumptively positive\" cases have been reported by Manchester Medical Center, said Health Commissioner Mark Levine, after the center's urgent care conducted a series of antigen tests to regional residents.\n\nThose that test positive on antigen tests, which differ from PCR tests, are \"not considered to be a lab-confirmed test\" said Levine. Antigen tests tend to not be included in Vermont's number of cases, and those that were either confirmed positive or \"false negatives\" would need to be tested by the Health Department.\n\nLevine stated that the Health Department has already set up a pop-up site in Londonderry for July 15, and he encouraged those that tested positive, as well as others in the region to attend it.\n\nIn regards to the outbreak, Mike Smith, secretary of the state's Agency of Human Services, cautioned Vermonters against failing to quarantine after traveling to \"hotspots\" outside of the state's designated safe areas. He further went on to recommend residents should not attend social events or gatherings following those trips where they know they are \"bound to have close contacts\" with other people.\n\n\"It is a pattern that I'm starting to get a little concerned about,\" said Smith.\n\n\"We all need to do our part. Risky behavior can lead to outbreaks.\"\n\nBoth Levine and Smith were hesitant to call it \"the Manchester outbreak\", citing that where people were getting tested did not reflect where they had contracted the virus.\n\n_________\n\nGov.

The action will not roll back opening-up procedures, Scott said — but will provide a mechanism through which the administration can update guidelines as necessary.\n\n_________\n\nTwo statewide grant programs — aimed at providing relief to Vermont's dairy industry and health care system — were announced Tuesday.\n\nThe Vermont COVID-19 Agriculture Assistance Program will be offering a total of $25 million in federal funding to dairy producer and processors stating Friday, July 17.\n\nThose eligible include dairy farmers and processors who were operating as of March 1 and were subsequently impacted by the pandemic, either through income loss, additional expenses or market disruption of dairy prices.\n\nAn estimated 25 Vermont dairies have closed operations since March 1, according to Anson Tebbetts, secretary of the sate's Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets, during the governor's news conference. Prior to the pandemic, the state saw a loss of 1.5 farms per month.\n\n\"This has been a direct result of what happened when the markets went away for our dairy farmers,\" Tebbetts said.\n\nApplications are available via the Agency's website, and must be completed by Oct. 1.\n\n--------------\n\nThe Health Care Stabilization Grant Program is additionally set to launch this Friday, intended to give $275 million of financial assistance to Vermont health care providers.\n\nApplications must be completed by August 15, and will be evaluated and distributed based on \"demonstrated need\", as opposed to a first come, first serve basis.\n\nThe program is intended to cover a wide variety of providers, organizations and small-scale practices including health centers, dentists, mental health and substance abuse treatment providers, physical therapists, and emergency medical service providers.\n\n\"We want to continue to meet the needs of providers during and after this time of crisis,\" said Mike Smith, secretary of the state's Agency of Human Services. \"If providers are not certain if they are eligible, we want them to apply anyway.\"\n\nCash grants for the first round of this program will cover expenses between March 1 and June 15.

Individuals from counties in these states that have less than 400 cases per million people can travel to Vermont without the 14 day quarantine mandate required of other travelers.\n\nThese states are:\n\nOhio\n\nPennsylvania\n\nDelaware\n\nMaryland\n\nWest Virginia\n\nVirginia\n\nThe District of Columbia\n\nThis accounts for about 19 million people across 216 counties, a population which Scott hopes will support the struggling hospitality industry in the state. Travelers must travel by personal vehicle, and cannot fly or take a bus or train.\n\nVermont has already allowed travel without quarantine from low-risk counties in New York, Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts.\n\n__________\n\nThursday, June 25, 2020\n\nSeven new cases of COVID-19 reported in Vermont on Thursday brought the total number of positive cases to 1,191, according to Health Department data.\n\nThree people are hospitalized with COVID-19, while 12 people are hospitalized and under investigation for the virus. The state said that 938 people across the state have recovered.\n\nThe number of deaths attributable to COVID-19 remained at 56. A total of 60,709 people have been tested for the virus.\n\n__________\n\nThe Chittenden Solid Waste District's drop-off center in South Burlington will be reopening on Saturday, June 27 after being temporarily closed during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nCustomers will be required to wear facial coverings and vehicles will be metered into the facility, according to the organization's website. The facility will be open on Monday, Friday and Saturday between 8 a.m. and 3:30 p.m.\n\nThe facility is currently not accepting large bulky items such as mattresses, furniture, or construction material. Items that will be accepted and their fees can be found on the Chittenden Solid Waste District's website at cswd.net/facility-locations/south-burlington-drop-center.\n\n__________\n\nWednesday, June 24, 2020\n\nDuring the Governor's meeting Wednesday, Health Commissioner Mark Levine gave updates on outbreaks and clusters of COVID-19 across the state.\n\nWinooski outbreak: The total cases are 114 so far with its peak in early June. According to Levine we are \"clearly on a downward and stable slope.\" He said it takes time for numbers to peter out because of the 7 to 14 day incubation perid.\n\nRutland County cluster: A Rutland County employer in the Fair Haven area has 12 cases within its population. Testing is being performed on employees and community wide testing is expected to be announced soon. Levine would not identify the business but said it was not of the type where consumers would be coming in and out.\n\nWindham County family cluster: one family in Windham County has multiple cases. Testing is being performed today in Brattleboro. Levine said the number of cases there is less than 10 but would not give an exact number as to not inadvertently identify the family.\n\nLevine said a cluster is when cases are confined to one main source such as a family, household or business and not distributed across the population. The term outbreak is used when transmission is beyond one particular source, he said.\n\n__________\n\nThere were 20 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the state cumulative total to 1,184. Hospitalizations increased to four (from two) and those hospitalized under investigation decreased from 17 to 9 over the last 24 hours.\n\nDeaths remained at 56. Total people being monitored increased by 20 to 1,230.\n\nThose recovered total 930, while 1,296 completed being monitored and 59,860 tests have been performed so far.\n\n__________\n\nThe University of Vermont Medical Center is scaling back some limitations on visitors to the hospital. Every Vermont hospital began restricting visitation in March to slow the spread of COVID-19.\n\nEffective today, UVM Medical Center is allowing one \"consistent\" family member or support person in inpatient and procedural areas. Outpatient restrictions remain in place, where family and friends are not allowed to accompany patients into their doctors' offices unless patients requires support and assistance to meet with their doctors.\n\nFor pediatric patients, one parent or support person is recommended, but both parents may be permitted to visit when \"necessary and appropriate,\" based on unique care needs and circumstances determined by the care team.\n\nPatients arriving in the emergency department or urgent care may also be accompanied by one consistent family member or support person.\n\n__________\n\nNational Life Group in Montpelier announced it cut 53 jobs in Vermont as a result of the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The insurance company also cut 30 jobs in Texas and 12 in \"other remote locations,\" according to a news release.\n\nMehran Assadi, chairman, president and CEO of National Life, said in a statement the company does not anticipate any further job cuts.\n\nNational Life employees have been working remotely since mid-March, with the exception of a few dozen essential workers who continue to report to the office in Montpelier, the news release said. The company is currently planning a phased return to the office, which will not occur before July 20.\n\n__________\n\nTuesday, June 23, 2020\n\nOne new case of COVID-19 brought the state cumulative total to 1,164. Hospitalizations increased to two (from none) and those hospitalized under investigation increased from 8 to 17 over the last 24 hours.\n\nDeaths remained at 56. Total people being monitored are 1,210.\n\nThose recovered total 927, while 1,270 completed being monitored and 59,328 tests have been performed so far.\n\n__________\n\nSmugglers' Notch Resort reopens for travelers and locals June 26. Activities such as pools, water parks, guided hiking, disc golf and 20 miles of mountain biking trails are expected to be open. Food and beverage service will be available on-site. Social distancing and enhanced cleaning protocols will be employed.\n\n__________\n\nEmployees of restaurant and retail shops in downtown Burlington can park for free.\n\nTemporary free parking will be available at the Lakeview/College Street garage. Those who haven't done so previously need to sign up for FlexVal and fill out a sign up form.\n\nEmployees will receive a printed reusable validation parking pass to use until the end of July. The period could be extended.\n\n__________\n\nSome Vermonters who apply for unemployment insurance will see an increase to their weekly benefits.\n\nThe announcement came from Gov. Phil Scott and the Vermont Department of Labor Tuesday, as part of a series of changes to the state's Unemployment Insurance (UI) program.\n\nBeginning the first week of July, maximum weekly UI claims will increase from $513 to $531.\n\nIn addition to the benefits increase, Vermont employers will see a lowering of their UI tax rates as of July 1.\n\n“This tax relief will help reduce the burden on employers who’ve had to make difficult decisions to protect the health and safety of their workers and help limit the spread of COVID-19 in Vermont,” said Governor Scott in a news release.\n\n“We know Vermonters made a tremendous economic sacrifice in order to respond to this virus, and we will continue to pull every lever we can to help workers and employers recover from this pandemic.”\n\n__________\n\nChittenden Solid Waste District's South Burlington Drop-Off Center will resume its operations starting June 27.\n\nThe facility will reopen at limited capacity, with new hours (Mondays, Fridays and Saturdays from 8 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.) and temporary flat fees while precautions are ongoing for the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAll customers and visitors will be required to wear facial coverings when entering the Drop-Off Center. Trailers, wood waste, mattresses, and major electronic appliances (air conditioners, dehumidifiers, refrigerators) are not currently allowed.\n\n__________\n\nMonday, June 22, 2020\n\nFour new cases of COVID-19 were reported Monday by the Vermont Department of Health, bringing the cumulative total to 1,163.\n\nNo additional deaths were reported — the total remains at 56.\n\nNo people were reported hospitalized for the disease, although eight are under observation in a hospital.\n\nThe number of people being monitored for symptoms stands at 1,142 and the number who have completed monitoring is 1,241. These numbers include close contacts of confirmed cases and people traveling to Vermont from out-of-state who have enrolled in the state's Sara Alert program.\n\n_____________\n\nDarn Tough Vermont announced on Monday that it had to lay off nearly 50 employees.\n\n\"A few months ago we couldn’t grow fast enough,\" the company wrote on its social media account. \"There are larger problems in the world, and we get that.

The demographic with the largest growth in positive cases is people aged 18 to 44.\n\nLevine said the spikes in these states have been widely attributed to “a breakdown in the willingness of the public to adhere to the simple precepts of avoiding mass gatherings, hence an inability to physically distance; and to wear facial coverings.”\n\nResidents must still follow these guidelines despite the hot weather and Vermont’s success so far in lowering the number of new cases per day, Levine said. Guidelines also recommend regular hand-washing and staying home when sick.\n\n“We can’t lose track of the fact that the virus hasn’t gone anywhere,” Levine said.\n\n_____________\n\nAn inmate who was being brought into the Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility in South Burlington has tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nAgency of Human Services Secretary Mike Smith said officials believe the inmate had contact with some staff members and some other inmates before the test came back positive on Saturday. It is unclear whether the inmate was in contact with others in the general population. Health Department officials are conducting contact tracing.\n\nCorrections officials have been testing inmates for COVID-19 upon intake to facilities throughout the state, Smith said. All inmates and staff in the South Burlington prison will be tested.\n\nAnother inmate last week tested positive after being brought into the Marble Valley Regional Correctional Facility in Rutland. Smith said that testing over the weekend turned up no other positive cases at the facility. A second mass-test of the Rutland facility will be conducted next week.\n\nIn late May and early June, the Department of Corrections had tested all staff and inmates in its facilities and reported no new positive cases. An outbreak in March at the Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans Town was the only recorded spread of the virus in a Vermont prison.\n\n___________\n\nThe number of cases associated with an outbreak of COVID-19 in Winooski and Burlington has risen to 110, Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine said Monday.\n\nLevine said he believes health officials have been successful in identifying those who could have been affected to try to suppress the outbreak, but the outbreak will not be over until there is no new activity that can be connected back to those involved.\n\n“It’s so common to use the forest fire analogies these days, so I would use the term ‘smoldering,’” Levine said. He added, “We’re doing what we can to contain it, and we’re doing a great job actually, but the bottom line is, to say that it’s fully contained. It’s not quite there yet.”\n\nLevine gave the following breakdown of the cases associated with the Winooski outbreak:\n\nThe median age of those affected is 24.\n\n65% of the cases were adults, and 35% were children.\n\n30% of the 110 cases reported having COVID-19 symptoms.\n\n126 people have been contacted by contact tracers. 19 of those contacts have gone on to be positive cases.\n\n____________\n\nThe VNA & Hospice of the Southwest Region (VNAHSR) is re-opening its outpatient therapy clinic in Manchester, the health group reported Monday.\n\nAppointments physical and occupational therapy will be staggered to minimize coronavirus exposure to patients and staff, according to a news release.\n\nPatients who seek appointments are encouraged to contact their health providers, or call the clinic directly at (802) 362-6509.\n\n============\n\nSunday, June 21, 2020\n\nA dozen new cases of COVID-19 were reported Sunday by the Vermont Department of Health, bringing the total cases in Vermont to 1,159. No additional deaths were reported, which keeps the state's total at 56.\n\nThere are no people hospitalized with the disease but 11 are currently under investigation. An additional 817 people have been tested statewide, bringing the total to 57,845.\n\nThe number of people being monitored for symptoms stands at 1,018 and the number who have completed monitoring is 1,209.

The state's total fatalities related to the coronavirus now stand at 56.\n\nSix new cases of the disease were reported in the department's mid-morning update, for a cumulative total of 1,135. Three of the cases are in Chittenden County. Addison, Bennington and Rutland counties each had one new case.\n\nStatewide, about 917 people have recovered from the virus and 54,745 people have been tested.\n\nTwo people are hospitalized for the disease, the department said; nine people are hospitalized and under investigation as possible cases.\n\n________\n\nU.S. and state flags will be lowered to half-staff on Friday at all state facilities as part of a monthly observance of Vermonters who have died due to COVID-19, Governor Phil Scott announced.\n\nVermont's first fatality from the new coronavirus took place March 19, 2020. A month later, after 35 deaths, Scott ordered flags to be lowered on the eighteenth of every month until the end of the year.\n\nFifty-six people in Vermont have died from the disease; the most recent death was reported on June 18.\n\n____________\n\n============\n\nWednesday, June 17, 2020\n\nNo new cases have been reported in Vermont, which currently has 1,129 cases, according to the Vermont Department of Health's dashboard Wednesday.\n\nSo far, about 915 people have recovered from the virus and 53,663 people have been tested.\n\nOne person is in the hospital for COVID-19 and four are hospitalized under investigation.\n\nNo additional deaths have been reported — that total remains at 55, according to the data.\n\n_________\n\nThe Farmers To Families nutrition assistance program has been extended through August, Vermont's congressional delegation announced Wednesday.\n\nA pair of Vermont-based organizations, Willing Hands and the Abbey Group, secured contracts to continue the food box-delivery program for two more months, according to news release from Sen. Patrick Leahy, Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Peter Welch.\n\nThe program will bring an additional $8.5 million in aid from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to Vermont and the Upper Valley with New Hampshire, much of which will go toward buying produce and dairy from local farms, the news release stated.\n\nDetails on how to sign up to receive food boxes can be found on the Vermont Department of Emergency Management’s website: https://vem.vermont.gov.\n\n_________\n\nThe recent decline in new cases of COVID-19 after an oubreak in Winooski and Burlington's Old North End earlier this month is a positive sign, Burlington Mayor Miro Weinberger said during a press briefing Wednesday afternoon.\n\nParticularly for Burlington, Weinberger noted, the low number of new cases in the past week bodes well that an influx of college students moving in on June 1 didn't lead to an additional surge in cases.\n\n“If they were bringing the virus with them and infecting others I think we’d be seeing that now reflected in these numbers,\" Weinberger said.\n\nDr. Stephen Leffler, president of the UVM Medical Center, said he was \"sure there were asymptomatic people that came\" to Burlington during that time period but Vermont's efforts to curb the spread of the coronavirus — unlike other states —probably limited the impact.\n\n\"Vermont’s still really doing it right,\" Leffler said. \"People are in general all masking, we’re social distancing well. We’re being smart about how we open up our businesses.\n\n“There’s pretty good evidence now that shows each of us wearing a mask helps us prevent spread to someone else,\" he said. \"It’s a relatively small sacrifice that each of us can make and we can keep transmission down.\"\n\n_________\n\nAlso during Wednesday's briefing, Weinberger explained Burlington's plans to allocate resources to \"racial equity and police transformation” effforts.\n\nOn top of an immediate commitment of $300,000 to the city's Fund for Racial Equity and Police Transformation, paid for via cuts to the police department, Weinberger said he's confident similar savings could expand that amount closer to $1 million during the next fiscal year.\n\nAdditionally, the city has another $300,000 in small business relief and rental assistance that it will look into spending \"through the lens of racial justice,\" he said.\n\nAnd the city will explore using an anticipated $1 million in federal funds marked for community investment next year to serve anti-racism efforts, Weinberger said.\n\n“I think there’s some real opportunity looking at all these funds about how to make progress with racial justice,\" the mayor said.\n\n_________\n\nTuesday, June 16, 2020\n\nThe Working Lands Enterprise Board, affiliated with the Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food & Markets, has announced that 16 businesses will receive over $250,000 in COVID-19 Response Business Development Grants in agriculture and forestry. The awards will focus on business response, shifting marketing strategies, or other activities that may improve business recovery.\n\nOne grant recipient, The Royal Butcher of Braintree, intends to respond to the surge in demand for slaughter and meat processing. Current bottlenecks in processing will require urgent need to meet the local demand for this butcher’s services.\n\n“These dollars will allow us to expand our business while helping farmers who need our services during the pandemic,” Justin Sauerwein of The Royal Butcher said in a news release. The Royal Butcher, established in 2003, is a USDA inspected slaughterhouse and meat processor, attending to the needs of local livestock and dairy farms.\n\n_________\n\nThe New England Foundation for the Arts announced the launch of the New England Arts Resilience Fund, part of the nationwide United States Regional Arts Resilience Fund, an initiative of the U.S. Regional Arts Organizations and The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.\n\nThe New England Arts Resilience Fund is also supported by federal CARES Act funding from the National Endowment for the Arts. The Fund was created in response to the impact of COVID-19 on the nation’s arts infrastructure and will support New England nonprofit arts and cultural organizations with recovery and planning capital for a post-pandemic future.\n\nThe New England Arts Resilience Fund will provide approximately 50 non-matching grants, generally in the range of $10,000-$75,000, with potential for a small number of grants up to $100,000. The fund prioritizes organizations, communities, populations and art forms that have historically had less access to major financial resources for sustainability and seeks in particular to support organizations that are led by and deeply engage communities of color.\n\n_________\n\nTravelers looking to make a trip to Canada or Mexico will have to wait at least another month after the Department of Homeland Security extended border closures with both countries due to the coronavirus pandemic, USA Today reported.\n\nThe borders, including Vermont's border with Quebec, will remain closed to nonessential travel until July 21.\n\n\"Based on the success of the existing restrictions and the emergence of additional global COVID-19 hotspots, the Department will continue to limit non-essential travel at our land ports of entry with Canada and Mexico,\" Chad Wolf, acting Secretary of Homeland Security, said in a statement. \"This extension protects Americans while keeping essential trade and travel flowing as we reopen the American economy.\"\n\n“This is a decision that will protect people on both sides of the border as we continue to fight COVID-19,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said.\n\n_________\n\nVermont State Treasurer Beth Pearce announced the launch of the Municipal Emergency Statewide Education Property Tax Borrowing Program to assist municipalities as they manage their finances and cash-flow needs during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBased on eligibility, the program will cover interest incurred for short-term borrowing meant to manage the effects of statewide education property-tax delays as a direct result of COVID-19. Eligible “short-term borrowing costs” do not include principal payments, fees, or any interest on borrowings not directly attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMunicipalities can learn more, and apply, by visiting https://www.vermonttreasurer.gov/content/local-government.\n\n_________\n\nThree additional positive cases of COVID-19 were reported in Vermont, bringing the pandemic total to 1,130, according to Vermont Department of Health data.\n\nAt the same time, about 914 people have recovered from the virus, the data showed, and 52,890 people have been tested.\n\nTwo people are in the hospital for COVID-19, and 10 are hospitalized under investigation — the same numbers as Sunday.\n\nNo additional deaths have been reported — that total remains at 55, according to the data.\n\nMonday, June 15, 2020\n\nGov. Phil Scott extended a state of emergency through July 15. That action does not roll back opening-up procedures, Scott said — but provides a mechanism by which guidelines can be updated (relaxed or tightened, as needed) in an orderly, methodical way.\n\n_________\n\nOutdoor camping facilities may operate at 100% capacity, beginning today, the governor announced. Campground use had been capped at 50% capacity.\n\nQuarantine guidelines from out-of-state campers will remain in place.\n\n_________\n\nOne additional positive case of COVID-19 was reported in Vermont on Sunday, bringing the pandemic total to 1,128, according to Vermont Department of Health data.\n\nAt the same time, about 912 people have recovered from the virus, the data shows, and 52,557 people have been tested, the data showed.\n\nTwo people are in the hospital for COVID-19, and 14 are hospitalized under investigation — the same numbers as Sunday.\n\nNo additional deaths have been reported — that total remains at 55, according to the data.\n\n________\n\nDespite uptick in cases due to a cluster in Winooski in early June, Vermont seems to be back on a reliable path toward containing and tracking the coronavirus (# of cases dipped to just three over the weekend), according to Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine.\n\nStatewide, effective ways of managing outbreaks can take place even as restrictions are relaxed, he said.\n\nSerology tests (that test blood for the presence of, or exposure to, coronavirus) would be of limited utility in Vermont, where the population that has been exposed remains very low by national standards (Levine's best guess is 5%).\n\nLess invasive and more comfortable tests (front-of-nose; saliva) are in development, and will, until a vaccine is developed, make it easier for people to seek out testing, Levine added.. Tests with “real-time” results might conceivably be required for entrance to large sports or entertainment venues.\n\nThe “Sara Alert” app used by the Health Department is a tool for communication between Vermonters and the Department of Health – and is not a “tracking app” that reports the user’s location, Levine said. The state has no plans to implement detailed case-tracking software.\n\n_________\n\nUpcoming governor's news conference topics this week:\n\nWednesday: Long-term health facilities.\n\nFriday: Health guidance on K-12 school re-openings.\n\n============\n\nSunday, June 14, 2020\n\nTwo additional positive cases of COVID-19 were reported in Vermont on Saturday, bringing the pandemic total to 1,127, according to Vermont Department of Health data.\n\nAt the same time, 909 people have recovered from the virus and 50,982 people have been tested, the data showed.

She died in a Victorian house 74 years ago that is now preserved on the Drury University campus.\n\nWhile O'Neill is not a name-brand artist like Georgia O'Keeffe or Frida Kahlo, her fandom stretches from Taney County to Tokyo.\n\nIt is not a lukewarm type of fandom.\n\n\"I was doing research and got hooked,\" Buhr said. She hails from another part of Missouri and said she wasn't too familiar with O'Neill until the art museum added some pieces to its O'Neill collection in 2013.\n\n\"I think most people who get into Rose O'Neill become huge fans,\" Buhr said. \"There are a lot of superfans.\"\n\nNow, O'Neill — who has received a small, sudden flurry of national attention in recent months with a story in Smithsonian magazine and by being included in a New York women's history exhibit — is the subject of a massive retrospective show at Springfield Art Museum that begins Friday, April 13. It runs through Aug. 5.\n\nAnd while Springfield's museum is spotlighting Kewpies, it also hopes to draw attention to the broad range of O'Neill's creations.\n\n\"She was so diverse that she was an awesome woman,\" said Donna Timm, president of the International Rose O'Neill Fan Club.\n\nThe artist, who had a 300-acre spread near Walnut Shade along with a New York City studio, a Connecticut country home and an Italian villa on the Isle of Capri, had even more career lanes than houses.\n\nO'Neill got her start at age 13 by winning a Nebraska newspaper drawing contest, but she also made sculpture, calligraphy, poetry, fiction, illustration and clothes.\n\nReaders of today's best-selling graphic novels by Alison Bechdel or Kate Beaton might thank O'Neill for blazing a trail.\n\nIt is likely, historians say, that an 1896 O'Neill cartoon strip printed in Truth magazine was the first cartoon ever published by an American woman.\n\nBy her early thirties, O'Neill was twice divorced, never to remarry — a social status that meant borderline scandal in the early 20th century.\n\nO'Neill also spoke out against uncomfortable women's fashions (it was the corseted era of \"Downton Abbey,\" after all), championing a national contest in 1915 that invited women to design more practical clothes.\n\nWhether working in her studios or hosting an unceasing lineup of guests at her art colony in Connecticut, O'Neill preferred to wear airy, flexible garb. She called it her \"aura.\"\n\nA 1968 account from the Missouri Historical Review makes much of O'Neill's \"rose or wine-colored velvet flowing robes over Grecian-style gowns of peach silk.\"\n\nO'Neill was also an intense political supporter of women. While living in New York City's Greenwich Village, she contributed her talents to the suffragist movement, helping secure the right to vote for New York State women following an election in 1917. (That's right: Men voted on whether women should get to.)\n\nSome of O'Neill's posters and postcards that were designed for that suffrage campaign were recently loaned from Ozarks collections for \"Hotbed,\" an exhibit at the New-York Historical Society that celebrated contributions by women artists and activists in Greenwich Village.\n\n\"After O'Neill made money with Kewpies, she bought an apartment on Washington Square, so she’s right there, using her art to support the suffrage movement,\" said Sarah Gordon, a New-York Historical Society curator.\n\nGordon said that O'Neill put the Kewpies' cheery image to work selling suffragism to male voters. O'Neill used the latest printing technology of the day — chromolithography — to quickly, cheaply make posters that showcased equality between men and women as a new, powerful way to support family life.\n\n\"There's a couple (in the poster),\" Gordon said. \"She’s got short hair, she’s wearing a flowy dress, very flowy and comfortable-looking, they're holding hands, they’re looking at each other, you can tell they're talking. They’re very much an image of a new woman, a new kind of relationship at the time, reinventing marriage, reinventing relationships.\"\n\nThe caption? \"Together for home and family – vote yes for the woman suffrage amendment.\"\n\nIf all that sounds like a like a lot to take on for one person, that's because it was.\n\n\"Oh, Rose could do it all,\" David O'Neill, Rose's great-nephew, told the News-Leader on Tuesday. He said he lent 15 to 20 pieces to Springfield Art Museum for the show. Until October, he ran a small Rose O'Neill museum in Springfield's Galloway neighborhood.\n\nThe artist's prolific, unconventional nature — and her reputation as a highly paid commercial illustrator and doll designer, not purely a fine artist — has kept her on the sidelines of American art, said Buhr, with Springfield Art Museum.\n\n\"Rose O'Neill is not so well known nationally because she was involved in so many things,\" Buhr said. \"It sort of fragmented her legacy. Lots of people advocated for part of her legacy, but there wasn't a concerted effort to unite all aspects of her life.\"\n\nUntil now.\n\nTitled \"Frolic of the Mind,\" Springfield's O'Neill exhibit will include 150 works. Some were lent from far-flung museums, including the Smithsonian, others from private collections in the Springfield area. Some items came from Bonniebrook, the restored O'Neill house 7 miles north of Branson that is now a museum.\n\nBuhr has been working on \"Frolic of the Mind\" for the past four years, a length of time that's not uncommon for putting together a show of this type.\n\nFor example, Buhr examined 150 original O'Neill illustrations in the collection of The Huntington, a library and art museum in San Marino, California. Springfield ended up borrowing 10 of them for \"Frolic of the Mind.\"\n\nMany of these pieces date from O'Neill's six years as a staff illustrator at Puck magazine — a publication as well known at the turn of the 20th century as GQ today.\n\n\"The readership was almost entirely men,\" Buhr said. \"Women did work at Puck, but they were in the bindery department. They did not produce content.\"\n\nWomen illustrators who wanted to be part of that era's golden age of magazine publishing were employed by titles like Ladies' Home Journal and Good Housekeeping.\n\n\"Illustrating was seen as a legitimate job for women,\" Buhr said. \"They could work at home. That protected their virtue.\"\n\nBut for O'Neill to break into Puck was \"unusual,\" Buhr said. She got the job just a few years after arriving in New York City at age 19.\n\nBuhr said the illustrations O'Neill made for Puck covered a range of topics: women and children, the western expansion of the United States, Native American scenes and race relations.\n\nShe signed many of her illustrations at the time \"O'Neill Latham,\" Buhr said, using her first husband's last name. O'Neill was the primary breadwinner for the couple.\n\nSpringfield Art Museum also borrowed O'Neill works from Kansas City's Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art. Many of these were sketches of family members that date back to O'Neill's days as a child prodigy — \"things she did at 13, 14,\" in Buhr's words.\n\nWhen Rose was young, the O'Neills moved from Pennsylvania to a sod house on the prairie outside Omaha, Nebraska.\n\nO'Neill's father was a Shakespeare-quoting would-be bookstore owner who steeped his children in reading. Her mother commuted into town to earn money for the family.\n\n\"Rose’s father was a stay-at-home parent in the 1800s, very unconventional,\" Buhr said. \"He declared when she was a teeny child that Rose would be an actress. Her sister was already a painter.\"\n\nRose's sister Lee went on to study with the Spanish artist Joaquin Sorolla and settled in California.\n\nBy age 13, it was clear that Rose's talents also lay in the in visual arts. She never went to art school, but she taught herself to draw by looking at pictures in her father's books.\n\nA lack of formal training didn't stop O'Neill from writing, either: Her first book, \"The Loves of Edwy,\" was published in 1904. Her great-nephew, David O'Neill, said she wrote it at Bonniebrook and made 65 original illustrations to accompany the story.\n\n\"She was thirty years old, successful, beautiful, and surrounded on all sides by unceasing hosannas of adulation,\" wrote The New Yorker about that period of O'Neill's life.\n\nDuring those years, O'Neill often retreated from New York's hustle to the \"forest primeval\" of the Ozarks, as she called it in one of her letters.\n\n\"Rose O'Neill is among those authors to leave town early this season,\" reported the New York Times Saturday Review of Books on July 3, 1909, in a brief item that ran beside an update on Mark Twain.\n\n\"Mrs. Wilson, as this author is known in private life, has a ranch, Bonniebrook, in Missouri, where she is now enjoying her vacation, miles from a railroad and all other signal points of civilization.\"\n\nIt was likely on that trip when O'Neill came up with the Kewpie concept: They were first published in the December issue of that year's Ladies' Home Journal.\n\nIn the next few years, Kewpies became \"the most widely known cartoon character until Mickey Mouse,\" wrote the State Historical Society of Missouri.\n\nLike the work of Walt Disney, O'Neill's vision for Kewpies could hardly be more American.\n\nShe once wrote, \"I have tried to put into the little fellows, and make them show forth, the national naiveté, jocularity, amiability, adventure, philosophy, and benevolence.\"\n\nIn 1912, a German company began manufacturing bisque Kewpie dolls.\n\nThe merchandise made O'Neill heaps of money.\n\nThe month after Kewpie dolls went on the market, O'Neill received $5,000, Ozarks Alive blogger Kaitlyn McConnell reported, quoting a 1913 St. Louis Post-Dispatch story.\n\nThat's a monthly income worth more than $127,000 in 2018 dollars.\n\nAs an illustrator and writer, she was already making $20,000 per year before America fell under the Kewpie spell — more than half a million dollars, in today's terms.\n\nBy age 60, O'Neill's Kewpies had earned her more than $26 million in today's money — economic value generated by a woman who once wrote, \"I have no system and hardly any intelligence about my work.\"\n\nSome days, she surged ahead with work for long hours. Other days, she rode on horseback near Bonniebrook or swam in nearby Bear Creek.\n\nPerhaps predictably, once she found success, people came to O'Neill asking for help.\n\n\"It's sort of a sad story,\" said Buhr, with Springfield Art Museum. \"She was so generous. She was an empathetic person at her core. Eventually, she was almost penniless at the end.\"\n\nBut while the Kewpie money flowed, strangers wrote to O'Neill telling of their struggles. After she bought Castle Carabas, her Connecticut house, would-be artists took advantage of her \"boundless hospitality.\"\n\n\"It is a well-established fact,\" wrote The New Yorker, \"that guests invited for a weekend remained two years.\"\n\nO'Neill made friends easily. Buhr said that in a letter, O'Neill described meeting the poet Witter Bynner at a gathering in her New York City home.\n\n\"He showed up at her apartment in Washington Square on a hot night in the summer,\" Buhr said. \"(O'Neill) convinced everyone to change into Grecian robes. They recited poetry, drank iced Rhine wine, sang songs and stayed up till dawn dressed in togas. He (Bynner) had just met them all.\"\n\n\"She was like the party person,\" Buhr said. \"You’re just so fascinated, you’re drawn to them. I came across stories like that from others who knew her. They were just sucked in.\"\n\nPeople \"sucked in\" by O'Neill included those in the French art world. As early as 1906, she was the first American woman elected to the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts, meaning she had fewer hoops to jump to get her work into the organization's notoriously picky Paris art shows, called \"salons.\"\n\nThat was an achievement in the art world of that era.\n\n\"The Impressionists were not permitted to exhibit in that salon,\" said Art Haseltine, a Springfield collector and O'Neill fan. \"Not long after that, here we have Rose O’Neill permitted to be exhibited in the salon. It’s extraordinary.\"\n\nSome O'Neill art shown in Paris will be included in Springfield Art Museum's upcoming show, said Buhr, the museum curator.\n\nIn 1921, O'Neill exhibited what some critics have called her \"serious drawings,\" the \"Sweet Monsters,\" at Galerie Devambez in Paris, where O'Neill is rumored to have hobnobbed with Auguste Rodin, the sculptor who made \"The Thinker.\"\n\nThe following year, the same art was shown at a gallery in New York.\n\nThe Sweet Monsters drawings — inspired by mythology and the depths of O'Neill's dream life — were a hit back in the Roaring Twenties. Buhr said two Paris museums each bought an O'Neill drawing.\n\nBut for people drawn to the Kewpies' sweetness and light, the monsters can be kind of a lot to deal with, despite their transatlantic pedigree.\n\n\"The first time I saw Sweet Monsters, I thought 'oh my, oh my — what was she thinking?'\" said Timm, the president of the International Rose O'Neill Fan Club. \"But the more you learn about Rose, the more you understand where she was coming from, where she was in that time in her life.\"\n\nA somewhat erotic sculpture with similar themes, \"The Embrace of the Tree,\" brought about a similar reaction when it was displayed near the College of the Ozarks chapel in the early 1990s, said Susan Scott, director of the Bonniebrook Historical Society.\n\n\"It caused such a fuss,\" Scott said. Some students' parents were scandalized. \"It ended up in a warehouse temporarily. People still ask a lot of questions about it.\"\n\nScott oversees the restored Bonniebrook property north of Branson. She said the sculpture is now displayed in the setting O'Neill chose after bringing it from Connecticut in 1937.\n\n\"It's Greek mythology,\" Scott said, \"and that kinda weirds people out a bit, like the Sweet Monsters kinda weird people out.\"\n\nNot everyone is weirded out, though.\n\nHaseltine, the Springfield art collector, said O'Neill's serious art and magazine illustrations prompted him to start buying pieces, some of which he's loaned to Springfield Art Museum for the current show.\n\nHaseltine said he's never attended a Kewpiesta, the annual spring convention and trading session held in Branson by the International Rose O'Neill Fan Club.\n\nStill, he gets Kewpies.\n\n\"The Kewpie part funded her lifestyle,\" Haseltine said, \"which if that hadn't happened, a lot of stuff wouldn't survive.\"\n\nThis year's Kewpiesta is slated to begin April 19, said Timm, the club president who helps run the event.\n\nDespite a global decline in doll-collecting in which doll enthusiasts have seen their collections sell for 35 to 40 cents on the dollar, original Kewpie dolls still hold much of their value, Timm said.\n\nKewpiesta soldiers on. Timm said when the event began in 1968, 600 people attended. She expects at least 120 this year.\n\nO'Neill's biography may hold the key to her future cultural relevance, as much as the dolls.\n\nVernon and Marlys Jordan are Des Moines, Iowa, collectors who also loaned objects for the upcoming Springfield exhibit. They've collected O'Neill books and letters, among other items.\n\n\"What I become fascinated with is the lady herself and the life she led,\" Vernon Jordan told the News-Leader. \"The more you learn, the more you’re fascinated. It's quite a life for a person to live at that period of time. She was far ahead of her time, especially as far as the role of women goes.\"\n\nAt Springfield Art Museum, Buhr said that she's organized \"Frolic of the Mind\" to appeal to as much of the public as possible.\n\n\"We have a little bit of everything,\" she said. \"My hope is that people get a full sense of who she was. She was an eternal optimist.\"\n\nIt's O'Neill season\n\n\"Frolic of the Mind: The Illustrious Life of Rose O'Neill\"\n\nSpringfield Art Museum, 1111 E.

UK residents aged 8 and over will be invited to create a recipe and the finalists will be judged by a panel including famed baker Mary Berry, Monica Galetti and the Buckingham Palace head chef Mark Flanagan.\n\nThe winning recipe will then be made available to the public ahead of the Jubilee Weekend.\n\nOther events planned to mark the occasion include the “BBC Platinum Party at the Palace” – a live concert which promises to bring together some of the world’s biggest entertainment stars to celebrate significant moments from the Queen’s reign.\n\nOn Thursday June 2, more than 1,500 towns, villages and cities throughout the UK and its overseas territories will light a beacon to mark the Jubilee. The capitals of Commonwealth countries will also light beacons – even as sentiment towards the British monarch in the Commonwealth now differs throughout different nations.\n\nThe Jubilee Weekend celebrations will also see “Big Jubilee Lunches” take place across Britain, including flagship events in London and at Cornwall’s Eden Project – where the idea for the lunches originated.\n\nA Platinum Jubilee Pageant will also be held, in which artistic performers, dancers, musicians, military personnel, key workers and volunteers will unite to tell the story of Queen Elizabeth II’s reign in a festival of creativity. It will take place in London and will include street arts, theater, music, circus, costumes, and visual technology.\n\nPhotos: The life of Queen Elizabeth II Eddie Mulholland/WPA Pool/Getty Images Queen Elizabeth II is the longest-reigning monarch in British history.

Since the club opened its doors in 1957, musical superstars have launched their careers and introduced the world to future best-selling records by playing to its intimate crowds.\n\nThe club became known for nurturing new talent in the late ’60s and ‘70s (it was instrumental in the careers of James Taylor, Joni Mitchell and Tom Waits, among others) and today is a vital stop on the way to musical stardom.\n\n“The Troubadour was where everybody went to hang out and to be noticed. You wanted to make yourself known to the record community at large, you go to the Troubadour, play an open mic night.” recalled Linda Ronstadt in the CNN Film “Linda Ronstadt: The Sound of My Voice.”\n\nHere are some of the greats who’ve taken the stage at the Troubadour:\n\nBob Dylan\n\nThe Troubadour was originally conceived as a club for singer-songwriters, or “modern day troubadours” as founder Doug Weston called them. The club’s status as a kingmaker was cemented over years by the talent discovered there.\n\nPlaying to an audience of fellow musicians and music executives, artists including Billy Joel, Tom Waits, Joni Mitchell, Linda Rondstadt and Nina Simone made their cases for stardom. One of the first notable singer-songwriters to take the Troubadour stage early in his career was Bob Dylan.\n\nHe played an impromptu jam session with a local band at a small, staff-only gig in 1964, according to the Troubadour. Dylan went on to become one of the most influential singers and songwriters of his generation, creating a long list of famous tracks, including “The Times They Are a-Changin’” and “Like a Rolling Stone.”\n\nHis performance at the Troubadour became the first in a long line of history-making performances from artists big and small for the next six decades.\n\nJames Taylor and Carole King\n\nThe Troubadour’s earned its reputation in the ’60s and ‘70s for its influential role in the early careers of many popular performers.\n\nFor this reason, it became the perfect place for musicians to find like-minded peers and form lifelong relationships.\n\nJames Taylor and Carole King, both iconic musicians in their own right, forged a lasting friendship in the wings of the Troubadour’s stage. Taylor debuted at the Troubadour in 1969, a gig that was a big deal to him at that time.\n\n“It had a proper stage and a backstage, and if you did well there people noticed it and the word got out,” he said, reminiscing about the experience. The pair met through a mutual friend and immediately hit it off, with King playing piano for Taylor and later beginning a solo career with his encouragement.\n\nBefore King made her own debut at the Troubadour, she ran through her setlist for Taylor, and he heard a song he immediately fell in love with. Taylor later recorded “You’ve Got a Friend” with King’s permission, and it went on to become one of his biggest hits.\n\nThey have acknowledged the importance of the Troubadour in their careers and friendship many times. In 2007, they performed an encore of their joint 1970 concert at the Troubadour for the venue’s 50th anniversary. They later took that show on the road bringing their 2010 Troubadour Reunion Tour to arenas around the world.\n\nElton John\n\nAs the Troubadour gained notoriety, many artists came from overseas and headed straight to the venue to play for their first American crowd. Gordon Lightfoot made his US debut there in 1964, and Lily Allen made hers over 40 years later in 2006.\n\nPerhaps most notably, on six nights in August 1970, Elton John was catapulted into the American consciousness with a series of shows that started his US career. Introduced by Neil Diamond to a crowd of industry giants including Linda Ronstadt, Brian Williams, Stephen Stills, and David Crosby, John made a serious impression and received a stellar review by Los Angeles Times’ critic Robert Hilburn.\n\nIn an interview with the Times, John described the performances saying, “the atmosphere during those nights at the Troubadour was electric. Something inside me just took over. I knew this was my big moment and I really went for it.”\n\nAn imagining of what the concert must have felt like to those in attendance was recreated in a scene in John’s biopic “Rocketman.” In the scene, John (played by Taron Egerton) lifts the crowd in a moment of transcendence where everything clicked.\n\nLenny Bruce\n\nThough known for its role in finding music legends, the Troubadour has also been a home to a myriad of comedy greats. Lenny Bruce performed at the club in the early ’60s and his raucous set resulted in his arrest on obscenity charges. His legacy and his contributions to comedy were remembered nearly 30 years later by his family and peers in a tribute event, hosted and televised from the Troubadour.\n\nBruce became the first of many comedians to perform on that stage. Richard Pryor recorded his debut album there in 1968, and Steve Martin performed at the venue as a relative unknown.\n\nThe Troubadour continues to welcome stand-up fans. Sarah Silverman, Zach Galifianakis and Dave Chappelle have all performed sets at the venue. The club’s cult status has also made it the perfect spot to host special events for cult TV shows. Abbi Jacobson and Ilana Glazer performed two shows there ahead of the second season of “Broad City” in 2014, and the cast of “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” performed their first live rendition of “The Nightman Cometh” in 2009.\n\nGuns N’ Roses\n\nComing out of its heyday in the 1970s, the Troubadour needed to change its tune to keep up with the country’s changing musical tastes.\n\nInstead of targeting folk singers and songwriters, the club began to feature the glam rock and metal bands that dominated the 1980s. Metallica made its LA debut at the club in August of 1982 and Warrant in 1984.\n\nFuture superstars Guns N’ Roses made a name for themselves locally after playing gigs around Los Angeles, including at the fabled Troubadour.\n\nThe local buzz got them on the radar of record executive David Geffen, whose label went to see their Troubadour set on June 6, 1986, and signed them soon after to a worldwide deal that made Guns N’ Roses a household name.\n\nHarry Styles\n\nThe Troubadour continued to keep up with the changing musical landscape through the 1990s and beyond. Pearl Jam played their first show under the name Pearl Jam and Radiohead played their album “OK Computer” for the first time in the US. Korn, System of a Down, Franz Ferdinand and Fiona Apple also all debuted on the Troubadour stage.\n\nIn modern times, the club has become the perfect place to host secret concerts or exclusive shows. Coldplay debuted songs off of their new album “X&Y” at a secret show in 2005, and Billie Eilish played an exclusive with SiriusXM and Pandora for fans of her debut album. Harry Styles made his solo US debut in 2017 at the venue with special guest Stevie Nicks in a show that paid homage to the Troubadour’s folk roots.\n\n“At the Troubadour, the percussive piano on ‘Woman’ began like Elton’s ‘Bennie and the Jets.’ The folky glimmer of his ‘Meet Me in the Hallway’ shimmered like Bowie’s ‘Space Oddity,”’ wrote Rolling Stone in a review of the concert.\n\nThe Troubadour’s notoriety has made it an essential stop on the tours of performers big and small, old and new. The coronavirus pandemic forced the club to turn to crowdfunding and public outreach, but it is now back in business, welcoming crowds on Santa Monica Boulevard and adding to its roster of legendary performances.", "authors": ["Foren Clark"], "publish_date": "2022/01/02"}]}

Stephen Morrison of the Center for Strategic and International Studies that bears highlighting, and it provides a measure of hope as the pandemic heads toward its second anniversary.\n\nThough Fauci believes COVID may never be eliminated, as measles and polio have been in the U.S., he said we may soon be able to control the disease to the point it no longer impedes everyday life. That would require a certain level of community immunity as well as access to medications to treat people who are most at risk.\n\nFauci described that state as, \"getting the level of infection that causes severe disease low enough that we can incorporate this infection – some people have said learning to live with it. ... I believe we are possibly approaching that.''\n\nCDC guidance for cruises becomes optional Saturday\n\nCruise lines will have the option to ignore CDC guidelines on ships by this weekend.\n\nThe CDC's Framework for Conditional Sailing Order, which was extended and modified in October, will expire Saturday. At that point the health agency's COVID guidance for cruise ships will become voluntary, the CDC confirmed to USA TODAY Wednesday.\n\nThe CDC \"is transitioning to a voluntary COVID-19 risk mitigation program\" the agency said in a statement shared by spokesperson David Daigle. The program includes guidance and recommendations for safe trips on cruises.\n\nThe U.S. is averaging more than 750,000 new coronavirus infections daily, fueled by the omicron variant. At a Senate hearing Tuesday, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said confirmed COVID cases in cruise ships have risen 30-fold in the last two weeks.\n\n-- Morgan Hines\n\nThat cloth mask may not be enough, but CDC not changing guidance\n\nAs new variants continue to emerge, including the extremely contagious omicron, experts are calling for upgraded protective options such as N95 and KN95 masks. CDC chief Dr. Rochelle Walensky, however, said Wednesday that the CDC does not plan to recommend Americans toss out their cloth masks in favor of masks with superior filtration.\n\n\"The best mask is the mask you will wear,\" she said.\n\nStill, finding and purchasing superior-quality masks on the consumer market at a fair price is possible now – and it might be the next, best purchase you can make to protect yourself and others during the COVID-19 pandemic. The N95 and KN95 masks both are rated with 95% filtration efficiency. N95 masks are certified by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health. KN95s – which the CDC notes are the most widely available masks – are manufactured in China and meet standards specific to China.

Find out here how many times can you reuse your mask and how to best store and clean it.\n\nHas omicron surge 'turned a corner'?\n\nAmerica's tally of new cases ticked down slightly for the first time since Christmas, a USA TODAY analysis of Johns Hopkins University data shows.\n\nThere were 5.23 million reported infections nationally in the week ending Tuesday, down from 5.28 million in the seven-day period ending Monday. The earlier tally likely included tests deferred into that week from a long holiday weekend.\n\nU.S. case counts are up 34% from a week ago, and on Tuesday 47 states reported higher case counts than a week earlier; 21 states set records for cases in a week; 48 states reported more COVID-19 patients in hospital beds; and 41 states reported more COVID-19 patients in intensive-care units, data from Johns Hopkins and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services show.\n\nStill, there are encouraging signs. Boston has been a hot spot, but Dr. Mark Siedner of Massachusetts General Hospital told CBS in Boston there are early indications the city has \"turned a corner.\" One of those comes from a wastewater tracking system. Virus particles found in wastewater are no longer infectious but can still be measured and can reflect trends among people contributing to the wastewater.\n\n“The wastewater data are in, and the news is good,\" tweeted Bill Hanage, associate professor at Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health. The data is \"providing solid evidence, that importantly can't be put down to exhausted testing capacity or other factors.\"\n\n– Mike Stucka\n\nCalifornia study confirms omicron symptoms less severe than delta\n\nA study of data from 70,000 COVID patients in Southern California revealed that omicron resulted in less severe disease than other variants, a finding that supports similar research from South Africa and Britain.\n\nDr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said at a White House COVID response briefing Wednesday that Kaiser Permanente of Southern California studied the patients, all of whom tested positive in December. The vast majority of the positive samples were the omicron variant, which resulted in a rate of hospitalizations of about half of delta infections, she said. The variant also drastically cut hospital stays to an an average of less than two days.\n\nWalensky and other public health officials, however, have repeatedly warned that the sheer volume of infected Americans still means that many hospitals are being strained by high numbers of patients.\n\nThat cloth mask may not be enough, but CDC not changing guidance\n\nAs new variants continue to emerge, including the extremely contagious omicron, experts are calling for upgraded protective options such as N95 and KN95 masks.

The CDC will work with states to submit requests for school districts in need of additional rapid tests. Once the initial requests are submitted, the first shipments will be delivered later this month, according to a fact sheet provided by the White House.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services will also expand lab capacity to support up to 5 million additional PCR tests per month. Schools can gain access to the additional PCR tests by submitting requests to three federally funded regional providers that offer testing materials, supplies and lab results through four regional hubs.\n\nShortages grow more widespread – but the next one is anybody's guess\n\nShortages at grocery stores across the country have grown more acute in recent weeks as omicron continues to spread and winter storms have piled on to the supply chain struggles and labor shortages. The scarcity of some goods being reported nationwide is widespread, impacting produce and meat as well as packaged goods such as cereal. Curt Covington, senior director of institutional credit at AgAmerica, told USA TODAY that the trends for specific food shortages are intermittent and varied.\n\n“Shortages depend on the item, store and region of the country,” Covington said. “Shortages can be driven by supply chain issues, consumer behavior or environmental factors, so it’s hard to pinpoint what will be affected next.”\n\nResearchers in Texas, Washington state also see decline in latest surge\n\nWastewater followers aren't alone in forecasting a decline in the omicron surge. Modeling by several universities also shows the wave of infections may have crested – and hospitalizations and deaths should eventually follow. COVID-19 infections peaked Jan. 6, according to researchers at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington’s School of Medicine. That’s close to estimates by the University of Texas, Austin, COVID-19 Modeling Consortium, which puts the peak somewhere from Jan. 9-13.\n\n“That’s a range between the most pessimistic and optimistic scenarios,” said Lauren Ancel Meyers, director of the consortium.\n\nBecause hospitalizations lag infections by about two weeks, the University of Washington team estimated the daily U.S. hospital census, including incidental admissions with COVID-19, will peak by Jan. 25.

Oregon's DOJ opened a civil investigation into the Center for COVID Control this week for violations of the Unfair Trade Practices Act, spokesperson Kristina Edmunson said.\n\nThe company operates testing sites across the nation – some as \"pop-ups\" run out of sheds and mobile storage units. Many Americans have rushed to the sites amid a surge of COVID-19 cases driven by the omicron variant and a national shortage of tests. But dozens of people nationwide have reached out to USA TODAY expressing concerns about the company.\n\nMany said they discovered the sites by searching for nearby testing options on Google and were surprised by how the sites were run. Some said they received their test results later than promised or not at all.\n\nAt least two people filed complaints about the Center for COVID Control testing sites to the Oregon Department of Justice in October, USA TODAY reported last week. The individuals expressed concerns about the safety and legitimacy of the sites, alleging the sites offer \"fake testing.\" One said they were given a test labeled as having expired in June of 2021.\n\n– Grace Hauck, USA TODAY\n\nFDA extends expiration date on COVID-19 tests in Florida by 3 months\n\nFederal regulators have approved a three-month extension on COVID-19 testing kits that technically expired months ago.\n\nThis means nearly 1 million COVID-19 tests the federal government considered expired will now be made available to Floridians who have been struggling to find tests.\n\nFlorida Commissioner of Agriculture and gubernatorial candidate Nikki Fried alleged in late December that Gov. Ron DeSantis stockpiled COVID-19 tests that were “set to expire imminently,” despite the high demand for such tests as omicron surged.\n\nDuring a news conference with DeSantis on Thursday in West Palm Beach, Florida, Kevin Guthrie, the director of the state Division of Emergency Management, confirmed that Florida had 800,000 to 1 million COVID-19 tests that expired Dec. 26-30.\n\nAccording to Guthrie, they had originally expired in September, but the state received a three-month extension on those test kits from the manufacturer and federal regulators.\n\n– Frank Gluck, Fort Myers News-Press\n\nContributing: – Felicity Warner, Reviewed; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/01/12"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/uk-news/954130/can-michael-gove-save-christmas", "title": "Can Michael Gove 'save Christmas'? | The Week UK", "text": "We will use the details you have shared to manage your registration.

Here's what ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: Dana Peterson is an executive vice president and chief economist at The Conference Board. The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own.\n\nHow does a war on the other side of the world impact US consumers at home? In the case of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it’s felt at the dinner table: Yes, the war will likely be the main topic of dinner conversation, but it will also make the food on the table a lot more expensive.\n\nSanctions, import bans, destruction of infrastructure, a refugee crisis, and supply chain disruptions due to the conflict in Ukraine are stoking global food prices and risking shortages. Importantly, higher prices and potentially falling inventories could mean greater food insecurity in the US and around the world. But there are actions businesses and governments can take to help ease the pain.\n\nFind other sources\n\nThe war in Ukraine is seriously disrupting production and exports of grain to vulnerable countries. Not only is it making farming in Ukraine more difficult, but sanctions are disrupting logistics for producing things like fertilizer. Moreover, sanctions prohibit select debt transactions for the Russian Agricultural Bank, which helps support the country’s agricultural sector.\n\nRussia and Ukraine combine to produce 6% of all grains grown globally, according to our calculations of United Nations data, but export an outsized 16% of cereals like wheat, corn, oats and barley, according to the International Trade Centre. These grains go into everything from breakfast cereal to bread, pasta and corn syrup, which sweetens beverages. Further, they provide feed for animal stocks, meaning inflation for proteins, like chicken or pork, will also continue to rise. Ukraine also produces half of the world’s supply of sunflower oil. As such, food producers will need to reformulate to substitute sunflower oils, used in certain foods, with other oils.\n\nBusinesses can protect themselves by finding alternative sources of grain: diversifying supply chains or substituting alternatives in domestic or other unaffected markets where possible. This diversification and substitution would help mitigate some of the costs they will ultimately pass down to consumers.\n\nMeanwhile, higher prices for food in relatively wealthy economies, such as the US, could dent consumer spending and, consequently, overall GDP growth. Food and beverage prices in the US are up an astounding 8% from a year ago, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Further expected food price increases due to the war in Ukraine are part of the reason that The Conference Board forecasts that total personal consumption expenditure inflation, which measures prices for consumer goods and services, will linger above 6% year-over-year for much of 2022.\n\nBoost benefits\n\nThese supermarket price-spirals will increase food costs for all Americans and increase food insecurity for households that spend a significant portion of their income on food. In 2020, food comprised 10% of the total expenses for the wealthiest households but claimed as much as 15% of the expenses for the poorest households, per the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Census Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey reveals that as of mid-March, more than 21 million people in the US did not have enough food in the last week either some of the time or often. The war will likely worsen these figures.\n\nTo help Americans in need, the Federal Emergency Management Agency could be deployed and social safety net programs, like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, could be expanded. Additionally, the federal government can make sure that school food programs, which provide nutrition to millions of children, remain fully funded.\n\nTap reserves\n\nThe good news is that other economies can step in immediately to feed the world. What determines this is whether these economies have stockpiles that can be tapped for exports and the internal infrastructure and labor force to facilitate ramped-up trade.\n\nIndia, the US, the European Union, Brazil and Canada are especially well-positioned to increase grain exports, according to the USDA. By the end of the 2021-2022 growing season, the US is forecasted to have an excess of 18 million metric tons of wheat, 37 million tons of corn, and 2.6 million tons of barley, oats, sorghum and rye combined, according to the USDA.\n\nPolicymakers can identify excess stocks of grain and partner with NGOs to distribute food to vulnerable nations. Governments can also draw from domestic reserves to help cushion the effects of a grain-supply shock on consumers.\n\nGovernments can also dedicate greater shares of their budgets to increasing food production, including spending on equipment, R&D and infrastructure.\n\nInvest more in food production\n\nIn the US, for example, federal government subsidies for domestic farmers — which include loans, quotas and food purchases, among other measures — can be changed to support greater grain output. In addition, the government can stop paying farmers to leave their land unplanted (it does this to keep prices under control and improve environmental health).\n\nBusinesses can also help support increased grain production via financing and direct investment in equipment and labor.\n\nReduce waste\n\nBusinesses, from supermarkets to cafeterias at private firms, can reduce food waste with better ordering and refrigeration tactics. Indeed, the USDA estimates that up to 30% to 40% of the food supply in the US is wasted.\n\nLimit the use of corn in fuel\n\nThe US government could also limit the use of corn, 40% of which goes into ethanol, which is blended into gasoline.\n\nThese solutions may be easier said than done. Nonetheless, it is important that businesses and governments work together to help keep food affordable.

Water companies in these areas are considering more hosepipe bans on millions of customers in coming weeks.\n\nOn Monday, the EU’s climate monitoring agency Copernicus said that much of Europe experienced a drier-than-average July, with several local records broken in the west for low rainfall and drought hitting several parts of southwestern and southeastern Europe.\n\nIn its monthly climate update, Copernicus said those conditions facilitated the spread and intensification of wildfires, fueled also by back-to-back heat waves in parts of Europe, in what is shaping up to be one of the continent’s hottest summers on record.\n\nThe new data comes as the world grapples with a food crisis only just abating as Russia lifts its blockade of grain exports from Ukraine. Extreme weather and supply chain issues have worsened the crisis and are likely to persist for some time.\n\nA recent report by the Joint Research Centre, the European Commission’s science service, forecast a drop of 8-9% in the production of grain maize, sunflowers and soybeans in the EU because of hot and dry conditions over the summer, well below the five-year average.\n\nCopernicus Senior Scientist Freja Vamborg said that “dry conditions from previous months combined with high temperatures and low precipitation rates seen in many areas during July may have adverse effects on agricultural production and other industries such as river transport and energy production.”\n\nMonths with little rain\n\nIn July, water reservoirs in several parts of Europe were at a very low levels, insufficient to sustain demand, according to Copernicus.\n\nSouthern England experienced its driest July since records began in 1836, while the month across the United Kingdom was the driest July in more than 20 years. The UK saw just 46.3mm, or 56%, of its average rainfall for the month following a long run of drier-than-average months, with the exception of February.\n\nIn France, July saw a total rainfall of 9.7mm, which made it the driest July there since records began in 1959 and represented a rainfall deficit of 85% compared to the 1991-2020 average.\n\nA puddle of water in the nearly dried-up river bed of the Rhine in Cologne, western Germany.

In mid-July at Cremona – around halfway along the Po – the water was more than 8 meters below “hydrographic zero,” impacting hydroenergy production, agriculture and transport.\n\nCopernicus said the situation improved as a result of rainfall towards the end of the month, which brought a 40cm increase for the river, although hydropower production in the region was still affected.\n\nJuly was also globally one of three warmest recorded, close to 0.4 degrees Celsius above the 1991-2020 average, and the sixth-hottest July in Europe, Copernicus said.\n\nSpain, France and the United Kingdom experienced at least one day over 40 degrees Celsius last month. In the UK, temperatures climbed to over over 40 degrees Celsius (104.5 degrees Fahrenheit) on July 19 with the English village of Coningsby recording 40.3C for the first time ever.\n\nMeanwhile, Spain reported its hottest July in over 60 years on Monday.\n\n“July 2022 has been extremely hot in Spain, the warmest since at least 1961, with an average temperature of 25.6 ºC [78.1 Fahrenheit], which is 2.7 ºC [4.9 Fahrenheit] higher than the normal average,” the country’s national weather agency AEMET said in a post on Twitter. July was “0.2 ºC [0.4 Fahrenheit] higher than that of July 2015, which until now was the warmest month of July,” it added.", "authors": ["Lauren Said-Moorhouse Angela Dewan", "Lauren Said-Moorhouse", "Angela Dewan"], "publish_date": "2022/08/08"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/europe/956449/from-fertiliser-to-famine-the-global-food-shortage-explained", "title": "From fertiliser to famine: the global food shortage explained | The ...", "text": "It will have “a big effect on world agricultural markets, but not that big”, says Aaron Smith, professor of agricultural economics at the University of California, Davis. Other big producers, such as the EU, the US, Canada, Australia and India, should be able to cover some of the shortfall. But it takes time for recipient countries to rearrange their supply chains and place orders with new sources, and panicked investors have sent wheat prices soaring by as much as 50%.\n\nMany Ukrainian farmers have joined the defence effort, and farms in the east of the country are being ravaged by Russian attacks. Overall, Ukraine’s spring sowing of barley, maize and other crops will be less than half of the 2021 level, its agriculture ministry reports. Russia’s food exports, meanwhile, have reduced drastically because foreign traders are unwilling to do business there; President Putin also recently said that Russia would “monitor” food exports to “hostile” nations.\n\nUkraine banned exports of wheat and other food last month to secure its own wartime supplies, but at this point it can’t really export anyway: Russian warships are blocking access to its Black Sea ports; they have also destroyed port infrastructure and grain storage facilities, and have bombed at least three civilian ships carrying Ukrainian goods.\n\nNow the war has stopped most food exports from Russia and Ukraine, pushed up oil prices and further disrupted global supply chains . As a result, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation reported in March that global food prices had risen to their highest recorded level; cereals have gone up by 40% since last March, cooking oils by 55%, meats by 20%.\n\nIn addition, Russia, Ukraine and Belarus produce much of the world’s fertiliser supply. Prices of all these goods had already been trending upward, due to Covid-19, as well as fuel price rises that increased the cost of food production and shipping.\n\nUkraine and Russia boast some of the most fertile land on Earth. Both are major agricultural producers, particularly of wheat, maize, barley and sunflower oil. Together, they grow about 15% of the world’s wheat, but account for about 30% of global wheat exports; Ukraine alone supplies about 50% of the global market for sunflower oil.\n\nThe effects will be felt everywhere, but particularly in some nations in the Middle East and Africa, which are heavily reliant on Russian and Ukrainian wheat. Egypt, which gets 80% of its wheat imports from Ukraine and Russia, has had to fix the price of bread and devalue its currency. In Tunisia and Lebanon, there are flour shortages. High food prices have caused unrest as far afield as Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Peru.\n\nHow bad will things get?\n\nArab nations are likely to fare the worst. They remember that the high food prices of the Great Recession were a major factor in the Arab Spring protests that erupted in 2010. In conflict-ridden Yemen, 31,000 people already face famine conditions, and that number could increase fivefold this year. Indonesia is almost out of its beloved Indomie instant noodles, made with Ukrainian wheat. Cameroon’s bakeries are seeing long lines for bread. Somalia is facing its worst drought in decades, but can’t turn to Egyptian imports to make up the difference.\n\nThe world food system is already under strain: the UN World Food Programme thinks that 44 million people are at risk of famine. And this is before the effects of the fertiliser shortage become apparent.\n\nWhat effect will that have?\n\nEven before the war, the fertiliser market was in turmoil because of Covid, high fuel prices (fertiliser production relies heavily on natural gas) and sanctions on Belarus – which, like Russia, is a major exporter of potash, ammonia, urea and other soil nutrients. In March, Russia responded to sanctions by suspending fertiliser exports; while supplies from Ukraine, a major supplier to Europe, have largely stopped.\n\n“Wheat will impact a few countries,” warns David Laborde of the International Food Policy Research Institute. “The fertiliser issue can impact every farmer everywhere in the world.” Brazil, the world’s largest producer of coffee, soybeans and sugar, imports 20% of its fertiliser from Russia. In the UK, over the past year prices have gone from about £250 a tonne to nearer £1,000. Farmers face a choice between reducing fertiliser purchases, in which case yields will be lower, or charging higher prices. Either way, consumers will see higher costs.\n\nWhat can governments do?\n\nIn Britain, food prices are rising – they were up 5% in the year to February – but though this will affect those on low incomes, the overall impact is likely to be limited: around 10% of UK house­hold income is spent on food. In Algeria, Kenya and Pakistan, by contrast, it makes up more than 40% of household spending.\n\nNormally, poorer governments would have to intervene in food markets in these circumstances, yet budgets are severely stretched due to the pandemic leaving little room for direct support. Fragile econ­omies such as Egypt’s and Tunisia’s that borrowed large amounts during the pandemic will find it harder to keep paying subsidies for food, especially if prices keep climbing.\n\nWhen will things get better?\n\nIt all depends on the length of the war, and climatic conditions in the world’s major cereal-producing areas. China is anticipating its worst wheat crop in history, and the US Midwest is seeing very dry conditions; though Australia and India are expecting bumper crops.\n\n“What we can’t afford now is a major drought in Kazakhstan, Europe or Argentina,” says David Laborde. “Markets will explode. I don’t want to paint a bleak picture. If the planet will be generous to us this year, we should be OK. But a bad shock right now could bring us to the verge of a major food crisis.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/12/business/food-crisis-ukraine-russia/index.html", "title": "War has brought the world to the brink of a food crisis - CNN", "text": "London (CNN Business) Svein Tore Holsether says the world is careening toward a food crisis that could affect millions of people.\n\nRecord high natural gas prices have forced the company he runs, fertilizer producer Yara International , to curtail its production of ammonia and urea in Europe to 45% of capacity. With less of those two essential agricultural ingredients, he expects knock-on effects for global food supplies\n\n\"It's not whether we are going to have a food crisis. It's how large that crisis will be,\" Holsether told CNN Business.\n\nTwo weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine, the prices of key agricultural products produced in the region have skyrocketed. The biggest problem is wheat , a pantry staple. Supplies from Russia and Ukraine, which together account for almost 30% of global wheat trade, are now at risk. Global wheat prices hit an all-time high earlier this week.\n\nAnother major problem is access to fertilizer. Essential for farmers to hit their production targets for crops, it's never been more expensive, as exports from Russia grind to a halt. Output in Europe has also plunged thanks to the surging price of natural gas, a key ingredient in nitrogen-based fertilizers like urea.\n\nThe situation is ringing alarm bells for global health experts. The cost of corn, soybeans and vegetable oils has been jumping, too.\n\nAgriculture ministers from the G7 countries said Friday they \"remain determined to do what is necessary to prevent and respond to a food crisis.\"\n\nBut fearing shortages, countries are already turning inward, which could ultimately leave less food for those in need.\n\nEgypt just banned the export of wheat, flour, lentils and beans amid growing concerns over food reserves in the Arab world's most populous state. Indonesia has also tightened export restrictions on palm oil, which is a component in cooking oil as well as in cosmetics and some packaged goods like chocolate. It's the world's top producer of the product.\n\nThe G7 ministers called on countries to \"keep their food and agricultural markets open and to guard against any unjustified restrictive measures on their exports.\"\n\n\"Any further increase in food price levels and volatility in international markets could threaten food security and nutrition at a global scale, especially among the most vulnerable living in environments of low food security,\" they said in a statement.\n\nWestern countries with more access to agriculture will be hurt, too. Consumers there have already been stung by higher prices, and the situation is poised to deteriorate further.\n\nRussia, Ukraine and global food supplies\n\nEven before Russia launched a war in Ukraine, the global food system was strained. Snarled supply chains and unpredictable weather patterns — often the result of climate change — had already pushed food prices to their highest level in about a decade. Affordability was also an issue after the pandemic left millions out of work.\n\nThe number of people on the edge of famine has jumped to 44 million from 27 million in 2019, the UN's World Food Programme said this month.\n\nThe conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which both play crucial roles in the carefully calibrated system of global food production, stands to make the situation worse.\n\nGlobal wheat prices have fallen from record highs in recent days, but remain elevated. They're expected to stay that way for some time, according to Rabobank commodity analyst Carlos Mera.\n\nThe wheat planting season, which is about to begin in Ukraine, will be disrupted by fighting. It's not clear there will be enough farmers to till the land, as people in the country take up arms — or whether they'll be able to access machinery and other essential products that would typically arrive through Black Sea ports.\n\n\"It's anyone's guess if Ukraine will be able to export anything for the rest of this year, or next year, or in the foreseeable future,\" Mera said. The country also accounts for half of all exports of sunflower oil\n\nGetting products from Russia onto the world market has also gotten more difficult, because businesses don't want to risk running afoul of sanctions or deal with the logistics of traveling near a war zone.\n\nRussia and Ukraine serve as the breadbasket for countries in the Middle East and North Africa that depend on imports. Many will be hit hard as a result. The United States and Europe will feel the pain, too, since the run-up in prices for important agricultural goods will affect businesses that produce food in every market.\n\n\"Any serious disruption of production and exports from these suppliers will no doubt drive up prices further and erode food security for millions of people,\" the Agricultural Market Information System said in a recent report\n\nFertilizer costs soar\n\nThe brewing crisis goes beyond wheat and oils. Russia, along with its ally Belarus, is also a major exporter of the fertilizers needed to plant a wide range of crops. But right now, everyone is shunning their stock.\n\n\"Nobody wants to touch a Russian product right now,\" said Deepika Thapliyal, a fertilizer expert at Independent Commodity Intelligence Services. \"If you look at all of the traders, all of the buyers, they're very scared.\"\n\nThe price of natural gas is exacerbating the issue. Fertilizer producers outside of Russia and Belarus need gas to make nitrogen-based products like urea, which is used when sowing crops to boost yield and even promotes their deep-green color.\n\nBut Holsether, the CEO of Yara, said costs have gotten too high to keep operations running at scale. He's not sure when European production will be at full capacity again.\n\n\"There's a large part of the industry that's at risk of not being able to deliver products to the farmers, and that will have an impact on the crop yields quite rapidly,\" he said.\n\nFarmers have the incentive right now to pay what they need to get fertilizer, since prices for their products are going up, too. Not everyone has this option, however. Urea has been trading near $1,000 per metric ton, about four times the price at the start of 2021, according to Chris Lawson, the head of fertilizers at CRU Group, a market intelligence firm.\n\nCountries without domestic fertilizer production may also struggle to access it, with huge consequences for the global food system.\n\n\"You can't grow massive fields of wheat, barley or soy without fertilizer,\" said Johanna Mendelson Forman, a professor at American University who specializes in war and food. Farmers in Mexico, Colombia and Brazil are already worried about shortages, she added.\n\nThe consequences\n\nOn Monday, Russian fertilizer and coal billionaire Andrey Melnichenko broke with President Vladimir Putin and called for peace in Ukraine, noting that a global food crisis looms.\n\nThe war \"has already led to soaring prices in fertilizers which are no longer affordable to farmers,\" Melnichenko told Reuters. \"Now it will lead to even higher food inflation in Europe and likely food shortages in the world's poorest countries,\" he added.\n\nThe G7 agriculture ministers said Friday that their countries would leverage humanitarian aid where they can to mitigate fallout from the war. But they may also be hamstrung by a dearth of supplies and rising prices.\n\n\"If Ukrainian fields lie fallow this year, aid agencies such as ours will be forced to source new markets to compensate for the loss of some of the world's best wheat,\" David Beasley, executive director of the World Food Programme, said in an op-ed published in the Washington Post this week. \"Doing so will come at a vastly inflated cost.\"\n\nBeasley noted that Ukrainian wheat has also been essential to feeding populations in other countries facing conflict, including Afghanistan, Sudan and Yemen.\n\n\"The vast majority of wheat is used for human consumption, and that's irreplaceable,\" Rabobank's Mera said.\n\nAnd it won't just be countries grappling with famine or war that feel the effects.\n\nThe affordability of food is a problem for lower-income shoppers everywhere, Mendelson Forman emphasized. In April 2021, about one in seven American adults experienced food insecurity over the past 30 days, according to the Urban Institute.\n\n\"We're used to a globalized system of trade to get all kinds of varieties of food,\" she said. \"People will see it in their pocketbooks, and they'll see it in the grocery stores.\"\n\n— Mostafa Salem contributed reporting.", "authors": ["Julia Horowitz", "Cnn Business"], "publish_date": "2022/03/12"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/uk-news/957386/is-the-uk-facing-a-water-shortage", "title": "Is the UK facing a water shortage? | The Week UK", "text": "Households have been warned by water companies to cut their water usage or risk taps running dry as the UK battles a scorching two-day heatwave.\n\nSwathes of England have been issued with the Met Office’s first ever red extreme weather warning today, as temperatures are expected to beat the UK’s record of 38.7C, set in Cambridge in 2019, climbing as high as 40C on Tuesday.

It comes as shortages have led to long lines and overwhelmed hospitals in hot spots while Americans crisscross the country for the holiday season.\n\n\"I know you're tired. I know you're frustrated. We all want this to be over,\" Biden said in his remarks from the White House State Dining Room \"But we're still in it. And this is a critical moment. But we also have more tools than we've ever had before.\"\n\nAmericans will not be able to request the at-home tests online until January, meaning they can't access the kits before millions are expected to travel for Christmas. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the administration is still working through details of the program, including how many kits will be available for households and whether some groups would be prioritized.\n\nThe 500 million tests – among eight versions approved by the Food and Drug Administration – are in addition to 50 million tests the federal government began distributing this month to community health centers. Biden said his administration has also worked to make it easier to search online to find nearby COVID-19 tests.\n\n'No this is not March 2020,' Biden says\n\nThe U.S. has lagged behind other nations in testing capacity. Pressed by reporters about the shortages, Biden said, \"I don't think anybody anticipated that this was going to be as rapidly spreading as it did.\"\n\nThe moves come as the country faces a new challenge in the fight against COVID-19: Federal health officials announced Monday the omicron variant accounted for 73% of new cases last week, a nearly six-fold increase in the new variant’s share of infections in only one week.\n\nBiden thanked Americans for their \"perseverance and courage\" and returned to a familiar message: urging Americans to get vaccinated and receive their third booster shot. He stressed the unvaccinated face a greater likelihood of hospitalization or death from COVID-19.\n\n\"If you're not fully vaccinated, you have good reason to be concerned,\" Biden said. He told people who are vaccinated to \"remain vigilant\" and wear face masks indoors in public settings but said they are protected from severe illness and death.\n\n\"If you got your booster shot, if you are vaccinated and follow the precautions that we all know well, you should feel comfortable celebrating Christmas and the holidays as you plan. You've done the right thing.\"\n\nDespite the urgency, Biden rejected concerns that the U.S. could return to where it was in March 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic started.\n\n\"No, this is not March of 2020. Two hundred million people are fully vaccinated. We're prepared. We know more. We just have to stay focused.\"\n\nTHE LATEST ON COVID: Some good news for California?\n\nOMICRON OVERTAKES DELTA: But no, it's not just like March 2020\n\nBiden pointed to stockpiled medical equipment at hospitals as another difference. And because of greater overall knowledge about the virus, Biden said schools don't need to shut down like last year.\n\n\"We should all be concerned about omicron but not panicked,\" Biden said.\n\nThe president also announced plans to send six emergency response teams to Michigan, Indiana, Wisconsin, Arizona, New Hampshire and Vermont and will stand up new federal testing sites with the first location in New York City this week.\n\n\"This free testing is going to help reduce the waiting lines,\" Biden said. \"Sometimes it's hours. We're going to continue to add federal testing sites where needed, so if you want an immediate test, there's a place where you can go get it.\"\n\nHOLIDAYS IMPACTED?: What to know about Omicron amid the holidays\n\nSome major U.S. cities announced new restrictions on Monday to address a spike in COVID-19 cases. The District of Columbia re-imposed its mask mandate and said city employees would be required to get vaccinated, including receiving a booster shot, while Los Angeles officials said its New Year’s Eve party planned for downtown will be streamed with no in-person audience.\n\nWhy the US lags behind on rapid testing\n\nThe administration has taken some previous steps to expand access to test kits, but experts have criticized the government for not doing more – particularly for not making tests as cheap and easy to get as they are in the United Kingdom and some other countries. Psaki on Dec. 6 dismissed the idea of sending free tests to all American households, drawing criticism from many health experts.\n\n\"Should we just send one to every American?\" Psaki said, raising issues such as the cost of doing so.\n\nPart of the reason the U.S. hasn't been able to keep up with the demand for testing stems from regulation of the industry, according to Michael Mina, an epidemiologist and testing expert who serves as chief science officer at biotech software company eMed.\n\nMina said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has been regulating rapid COVID-19 tests as medical devices instead of a public health tool, requiring companies to conduct clinical trials that cost millions of dollars and last months. That slows the process of getting tests in the hands of American consumers, he said, and only a handful of COVID-19 rapid test manufacturers have kits available in the U.S., compared to the global market.\n\n\"We're in a pandemic, a fast-moving respiratory infectious disease, and speed of a result is much more important for a public health test than sensitivity,\" Mina said. \"This is about (stopping) transmission. Nobody is talking about a new test for medical purposes.\"\n\nLooking abroad, the U.K. has been able to stand up one of the most robust rapid test distribution programs in the world, Mina said, because they recognized the need for a more efficient regulatory framework to deal with the speed of this virus' transmission.\n\n\"They immediately saw the need to think about these tests differently,\" Mina said of the U.K. \"And in two years it's just unfathomable, in my view, that we have not recognized that the way we're were evaluating rapid tests is just antiquated.\"\n\nBiden has tried to make more tests available ahead of the holiday season. Earlier this month, he unveiled his winter strategy amid growing fears of the highly transmissible omicron variant, which included requiring private health insurance companies to cover the total cost of at-home COVID-19 tests next year and distributing free, at-home tests through health centers and rural clinics.\n\nThe White House also announced a $1 billion investment to boost the supply of at-home rapid COVID-19 tests in October, with the aim of making millions of rapid tests available to Americans as the holiday season ramped up.\n\nBut images of long lines at drive-through testing sites and the words \"sold out\" next to images of at-home testing kits on pharmacy websites raises questions about whether the White House is doing enough to battle an expected explosive surge, particularly as Americans travel for the holidays and the omicron variant begins to spread at a faster clip.\n\n\"It’s spotty. In some places you can easily get a test. But in other places, you can’t,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci, Biden’s top coronavirus adviser said during remarks at the National Press Club Monday. \"I know that. I’ve tried myself.”\n\n'Viral blizzard' is coming\n\nDr. Scott Gottlieb, who led the Food and Drug Administration for the first two years of the Trump administration, said the government is “probably not” doing all it can to provide access to rapid antigen testing.\n\nDuring a meeting with the USA TODAY Editorial Board earlier this month, Gottlieb said the country has a “critical window” to make COVID-19 tests more ubiquitous as omicron spreads more widely. People need to test themselves not just once before attending a gathering or other higher-risk environment; they need to test the day before, the day of and the day after, he said.\n\n“Flooding the market with diagnostic home diagnostic tests for the next four months, to me, makes eminent sense,” Gottlieb said, “and the best way to do that is to directly subsidize it.”\n\nVideo:Dr. Scott Gottlieb talks about omicron\n\nMichael Osterholm, who advised Biden on COVID-19 during the presidential transition, warned last week that a “viral blizzard” is coming. Osterholm said on CNN that millions of Americans are likely to be infected by omicron over the next three-to-eight weeks.\n\n“That will be overlaid on top of delta,” he said, “and we’re not yet sure exactly how that’s going to work out.” Delta is another highly contagious variant of the coronavirus.\n\nDr. Celine Gounder, an epidemiologist who advised Biden's transition team on COVID-19, said the president needs to refocus the conversation around hospitalizations and deaths, rather than infections and cases.\n\nIn places like New York City, where the population is highly vaccinated, cases are on the rise but hospitalizations are not. But in places with low vaccination rates, a surge in cases could lead to a surge in hospitalizations and deaths and overwhelm the health care systems.\n\n“It's tragic because we have those tools to move beyond this, but we're just not using them,” Gounder said. “I think people need to understand vaccines work best at a population level, they're not on/off switches at the individual level.”\n\nJust over 60% of the population is fully vaccinated, according to the CDC.\n\nAs he urged the unvaccinated to get their shots, Biden noted that former President Donald Trump, who has many followers hesitant of getting the COVID-19 vaccine, said over the weekend that he received his booster shot.\n\n\"Maybe one of the few things he and I agree on,\" Biden said.\n\nRepublicans make up an increasingly disproportionate share of those who remain unvaccinated, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health research organization that has been tracking vaccinations. Political partisanship trumps age, race, education level or insurance status as a predictor of whether someone is vaccinated.\n\nBiden’s efforts to impose vaccine requirements on many workers have been impeded by the courts.\n\nWhile a federal appeals court on Friday reinstated a federal rule that workers at larger businesses get vaccinated or be regularly tested, the Labor Department announcedit would give businesses more time to comply because of the uncertainty created by legal challenges.\n\n$700K for defying vaccine requirement?:Democrats push for jump in workplace fines\n\nMore:Biden delays enforcement of COVID-19 vaccine-or-test rules for businesses as courts hear legal challenges\n\nWorkers who are not fully vaccinated won’t have to be regularly tested for the coronavirus until Feb. 9, more than a month after the original deadline of Jan. 4.\n\nThe administration is also fighting challenges to requirements that health care workers and federal contractors be vaccinated.\n\n\"These rules are going to keep workers safe, and keeping workers safe will help keep businesses open,\" Biden said.

The country was, however, hit with similarly devastating floods in 2010.\n\n“Pakistan is in dire need and the damages are here and we will be in this a very long time,” Ophoff said. “It’s not months but years we are talking about.”\n\nThe 33 million people impacted by the floods and rain represent 15% of the population.\n\nAmong 1,136 people killed since mid-June were 386 children, the National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA) said Monday, as the unrelenting rain raised fears of more fatalities to come. Nearly half a million homes have been destroyed, according to NDMA.\n\n“By the time this is over, we could well have one quarter or one third of Pakistan under water,” Pakistan’s climate change minister Sherry Rehman told Turkish news outlet TRT World last week.\n\n‘Water gushed in’\n\nDramatic scenes of disaster have unfolded in Pakistan as floods inundated the country.\n\nIt was raining but not heavily, Ali Jan told Reuters Monday, as he stood surrounded by water in Chadsadda in northern Pakistan. But that quickly changed.\n\n“Suddenly the outer wall of the compound collapsed and water gushed in,” Jan said. “We barely managed to save ourselves. By the time the women were leaving the house, the water had become almost waist-deep. We evacuated the women and the cattle. The rest is there for you to see.

Satellite images from Maxar Technologies shared with CNN show how communities have been wiped out, leaving behind little more than bare Earth and dust.\n\nPakistan is responsible for less than 1% of the world's planet-warming gases, European Union data shows, yet it is the eighth most vulnerable nation to the climate crisis, according to the Global Climate Risk Index. It's paying a hefty price, not only with lives but destroyed schools, homes and bridges.\n\nOfficials estimate the total bill will be $10 billion.

Countries from the United States to Turkey are pitching in with aid, rescue helicopters, food and medical supplies. Yet the need is greater than what the world is giving.\n\nThese devastating scenes and eye-watering recovery costs are what the climate crisis looks like at 1.2 degrees Celsius of global warming since industrialization.\n\nBut the world is on track for warming of more than 2 degrees Celsius, analyses show , and scientists warn every fraction of a degree of warming will worsen the impacts of the crisis.\n\nFahad Saeed, a climate scientist with the group Climate Analytics, who is based in Islamabad, told CNN that Pakistan was in a Catch-22 situation. The country needs money to adapt to the crisis, yet because it has to pay for the damage that extreme weather is already causing it will struggle to find the funds it needs to adjust.\n\n\"What is happening right now at 1.2 degrees centigrade of warming is not because of the poor people in Pakistan,\" he said. \"They are not responsible for it, and this brings out the issue of climate justice in a very clear form.\"\n\nHe added that Pakistan, like so many developing nations, needed to bring more people out of poverty, a difficult thing to do in the midst of back-to-back extreme weather events with such little financial support from abroad.\n\nSaeed said Pakistan was in \"a position to present a strong case\" at the COP27 international climate talks in Egypt this November that other nations should help it pay to pick up the pieces. Developed and developing nations have remained generally divided over the issue for years.\n\nThe developed world agreed more than a decade ago to transfer at least $100 billion a year by 2020 to developing nations to help their transitions away from fossil fuels, but also to help them adapt to climate change. That amount has never been delivered in full.\n\nMore controversial is the issue of who should pay for the destruction.

It has also become a dangerous task for health workers who, as part of the government's zero-Covid policy, are required to spend long hours outdoors covered head to toe in airtight PPE equipment as they administer the tests.\n\nSeveral videos of Covid workers collapsing on the ground from heatstroke have gone viral on social media.\n\nThe heat wave has also caused power shortages in some regions and hit the country's crop production, threatening to further push up food prices.\n\nAnd the worst might be still to come, according to Yao Wenguang, a Ministry of Water Resources official overseeing flood and drought prevention.\n\n\"It is predicted that from July to August, there will be more extreme weather events in China, and regional flood conditions and drought conditions will be heavier than usual,\" Yao told state-run Xinhua news agency last month.\n\nCounting the costs\n\nChina is a \"sensitive area\" that has been significantly affected by climate change, with temperatures rising faster than the global average, according to the country's latest Blue Book on Climate Change , published by the China Meteorological Administration last August.\n\nBetween 1951 and 2020, China's annual average surface temperature was rising at a pace of 0.26 degrees Celsius per decade, the report said. Sea levels around China's coastlines rose faster than the global average from 1980 to 2020, according to the report.\n\nThe changing climate can make extreme weather events -- such as summer floods, which China has grappled with for centuries -- more frequent and intense, said Johnny Chan, an emeritus professor of atmospheric science at the City University of Hong Kong.\n\nA warmer atmosphere can hold more water vapor, potentially leading to heavier rainstorms, while global warming can alter atmospheric circulation, which can contribute to extreme weather such as heat waves, Chan said.\n\n\"We should be really concerned, because these extreme weather events actually affect the most underprivileged, disadvantaged and vulnerable parts of the population -- those in the rural areas, or those who don't have air conditioning or live in very crowded conditions,\" Chan said.\n\nResidents spend their time in an air-raid shelter to escape summer heat amid a heat wave warning in Nanjing, Jiangsu province on July 12.\n\nFor China, the sheer size of its population and economy means the scale of damage caused by extreme weather events is often massive.\n\nTropical cyclones, floods and droughts are estimated to cost China about $238 billion annually -- the highest in the Asia Pacific region and nearly three times the estimated loss suffered by India or Japan, according to a report released last year by the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nHeat wave-related mortality in China rose by a factor of four from 1990 to 2019, reaching 26,800 deaths in 2019, according to a Lancet study published in 2020.\n\nNew reality\n\nMeanwhile, many Chinese are only just beginning to realize that climate change will affect them personally.\n\nIn 2019, researchers found that compared to other countries, public concerns over global warming and climate change in China were \"relatively low.\"\n\nThe Chinese government has promised to bring greenhouse gases to a peak before 2030 and to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060.\n\nFor many Chinese, the dangers of extreme weather fueled by climate change hit home last summer, when devastating floods killed 380 people in the central city of Zhengzhou, the provincial capital of Henan province.\n\nRescuers help evacuate stranded residents at the entry to an expressway in flood-hit Zhengzhou, central China's Henan Province on July 23, 2021.\n\nLast July, the city of 12 million was pelted with what its water station called a \"once in a thousand years\" downpour, but local authorities were ill-prepared and failed to heed the five consecutive red alerts for torrential rain -- which should have prompted authorities to halt gatherings and suspend classes and businesses. Flood water gushed into the tunnels of the city's subway system , trapping hundreds of passengers and killing 12 of them in a tragedy that gripped the nation.\n\nJUST WATCHED See aftermath of devastating floods in Henan in 2021 Replay More Videos ...

In May, authorities in the southern metropolis of Guangzhou suspended schools, advised residents to work from home, closed construction sites and suspended public transportation in parts of the city following alerts for torrential rains.\n\nThis June, the Chinese government released a new policy document to improve its response to climate change, which it said was not only creating long-term challenges but also made the country more vulnerable to \"sudden and extreme\" events.\n\n\"Climate change has already brought serious adverse impacts to China's natural ecological system, and has continued to spread and penetrate into economy and society,\" the government said in its national climate change adaptation strategy.\n\nIt vowed to make China a \"climate-resilient society\" by 2035, by building a nationwide system to monitor and assess climate risks, and by boosting early warning capabilities.\n\nLiu said the policy document is a \"very big and ambitious\" piece of guidance for local governments, but it lacks details on implementation.\n\n\"The impact of climate change can be very localized and its threat to vulnerable communities can be very different from place to place,\" she said. \"Local governments still need to develop more detailed and tangible plans to implement this grand strategy.\"", "authors": ["Nectar Gan"], "publish_date": "2022/07/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/02/asia/pakistan-floods-climate-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html/", "title": "Pakistan floods: What you need to know | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nMore than one third of Pakistan is underwater, according to satellite images from the European Space Agency (ESA), as deadly floodwaters threaten to create secondary disasters.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 00:52 - Source: CNN See volunteers use bedframe to rescue people from deadly floods\n\nFood is in short supply after water covered millions of acres of crops and wiped out hundreds of thousands of livestock.

As much as 450 mm (nearly 18 inches) has been recorded along the coast of KwaZulu-Natal in that time. In Durban, 307 mm (nearly 12 inches) fell in only 24 hours, which is more than four times the normal amount for the entire month of April.\n\nAfter a brief rain-free respite Thursday, rain is set to return to the same areas on Friday and will persist off and on through the weekend, as a cold front stalls over the country's east.\n\nShipping containers fell over in the heavy rains and winds in Durban.\n\nTeams worked to evacuate people in areas that experienced \"mudslides, flooding and structural collapses of buildings and roads,\" Sipho Hlomuka, a member of the Executive Council for Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs in KwaZulu-Natal, said on Twitter Tuesday.\n\n\"The heavy rains have affected power lines in many municipalities with technical teams working around the clock to restore power,\" Hlomuka added.\n\nFlooded power stations were inaccessible in the hard-hit eThekwini municipality, Mayor Mxolisi Kaunda told reporters, while water mains were also damaged.\n\nThe local government asked private and religious institutions to assist with emergency relief operations, and have requested help from the South African National Defense Force to provide aerial support, he said.\n\nA severely damaged road and home following heavy rains in Durban on Tuesday.\n\nThe extreme weather comes just months after heavy rainfall and floods hit other parts of southern Africa, with three tropical cyclones and two tropical storms over just six weeks from late January.

And as natural disasters increase in frequency and severity as a result of rising global temperatures, cities that had previously not been thought of as the frontline of the climate crisis have begun to experience extreme, and in some cases deadly, weather events.\n\nA research team, led by Professor Lei Zhao, an environmental engineering expert at the University of Illinois, found that average summer temperatures could rise between 1.9C and 4.4C by the end of the century. “No matter how much the world warms, cities will have it worse,” said Bloomberg.\n\nHere are some of the cities at risk from climate change.\n\nJakarta, Indonesia Of the 100 cities with the highest risk of environmental harm, 99 are in Asia, according to a 2021 report by risk analysts Verisk Maplecroft which ranked 576 global cities. The riskiest of all, the report found, is Jakarta. Indonesia’s low-lying coastal capital is “plagued with dire air pollution” which is compounded by “perennial threats from seismic activity and flooding”, the report said. Another unique problem is that Jakarta is also “the world’s fastest-sinking city”, Vox added. With limited access to water, many of the more than 10 million residents have to extract groundwater which is contributing to the subsidence. President Joko Widodo is planning to move Indonesia’s capital to a “yet-to-be-built city in Kalimantan” on the island of Borneo in an effort to combat future issues, The Guardian said.\n\nDelhi, India The same risk report ranked Delhi the second most vulnerable city to climate change. In fact, 13 of the 20 highest risk cities were found to be in India, with Chennai, Agra and Kanpur ranking in the top ten. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has also ranked Kolkata and Mumbai as the top two cities most at risk of coastal flooding by 2070. Verisk Maplecroft found that pollution was the primary threat to the health of India’s urban populations, and particularly Delhi's, noting that “noxious air caused almost one in five deaths in India in 2019”, while water pollution was found to cause around 400,000 deaths every year.\n\nLima, Peru Lima has been found to be the most at-risk city in the Americas. Air pollution caused by vehicle emissions is a significant contributor to this calculation. Researchers at the University of Chicago have found that if the World Health Organization’s guidelines on atmospheric pollutant levels were met, the population’s life expectancy could increase by an average of 4.7 years. The city’s population is particularly vulnerable as a result of poor-quality housing and infrastructural problems, the United States Agency for International Development (US AID) has reported.\n\nLagos, Nigeria Africa’s most populous city could “soon be unliveable”, CNN reported. While Nigerians are “used to the yearly floods that engulf the coastal city” during the country’s rainy season, this year Lagos Island experienced extreme levels of flooding. “The floods paralyze economic activity, at an estimated cost of around $4bn (£2.9bn) per year”, the broadcaster said. Verisk Maplecroft’s Climate Change Vulnerability Index reveals that cities in Africa will “come off worse” to environmental threats, not only because the continent is most exposed to severe climate threats, but because “it is also least able to mitigate their impacts”. In comparison, South Africa’s “relative wealth and lower exposure cushions its major urban centres”.\n\nKarachi, Pakistan With a population of more than 16 million people, Karachi has experienced the deadly effects of extreme heat in recent years and now ranks as the world’s 12th riskiest city. In 2015, more than 1,200 of the city’s residents died as the result of a heatwave with temperatures reaching 49℃. To the country’s east, Lahore is ranked as the 15th most at-risk city. UN forecasts indicate Karachi's population could increase to more than 20 million by 2030. Pakistan is susceptible to increased temperatures, monsoon variability and extreme weather events as a result of climate change, and it is feared that this “coupled with a growing population and economic strain” will have severe implications for the health of Karachi residents, a 2021 medical research paper published in Science Direct found.\n\nPort-au-Prince, Haiti With rising temperatures set to increase the frequency and severity of weather events such as hurricanes and flooding, Haiti’s capital is at extreme risk of climate change. It is projected that Haiti will experience both an increase in storm strength and temperatures, as well as a decrease in dry-season precipitation, according to US AID. A 2011 forecast found that people living in Haitian cities including Port-au-Prince are likely to be at a two to four times higher risk of tropical cyclones than non-urban populations. The city has also been heavily damaged by high-magnitude earthquakes in the past decade.\n\nMiami, Florida “There is an inescapable truth about life in South Florida,” author and journalist Mario Alejandro Ariza wrote on the online university magazine Yale Environment 360 last year: “This low-lying region is set to be swallowed by the sea.” Boris Johnson echoed this warning at Cop26, telling world leaders that Miami could be “lost beneath the waves” if global temperatures were to rise by four degrees. Some studies estimate the surrounding sea could rise by six inches by 2030, “and infrastructure planners are bracing for two feet by 2060”, said Ariza. A six-feet rise by the end of the century is both “likely”, and “likely catastrophic”, he said. Nearby Florida Keys could also see main roads flood by 2025. Estimates of the cost of raising roads to avoid infrastructural damage have come out with a “staggering price tag” of $750m (£550.5m), and “where exactly all that cash will come from remains unclear”, said the Miami Herald.\n\nMuscat, Oman The capital of Oman “got a preview of what’s coming for cities in the Arabian peninsula” in March this year when temperatures reached 41.3C, a mercury reading expected nearer to June, said Bloomberg. In October 2021, a “rare and intense cyclone” also caused severe damage in the city, NPR reported. The last time a cyclone of this severity hit the country was in 2007, but climate change is “making disasters like this more common”.", "authors": ["Julia O"], "publish_date": "2021/09/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/07/24/pakistan-one-worlds-leading-victims-global-warming/809509002/", "title": "Pakistan is one of the world's leading victims of global warming", "text": "Abdul Salam\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nPakistan contributes less than 1 percent of the world's greenhouse gases blamed for causing global warming, yet its 200 million people are among the world's most vulnerable victims of the growing consequences of climate change.\n\nThe nation is facing ever-rising temperatures, drought and flooding that threaten health, agriculture, water supplies and hopes for development of a society that ranks in the bottom quarter of nations, based on income per person.\n\nPakistan is among 10 countries affected most by climate change, according to the 2018 Global Climate Risk Index released by the public policy group Germanwatch.\n\nBridging the Middle East and South Asia, Pakistan is in a geographic location where average temperatures are predicted to rise faster than elsewhere, increasing 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius) by the year 2100, according to a 2012 World Wildlife Fund report.\n\nThis past April 30, the temperature in the southern city of Nawabshah soared to 122.4 degrees Fahrenheit (50.2 degrees Celsius), the hottest day on earth ever recorded in April, the Pakistan Meteorological Department and World Meteorological Organization said. It was even hotter in the southern city of Turbat on May 28, 2017, when the temperature hit a sizzling 128.3 degrees Fahrenheit (53.5 Celsius).\n\n“We are planning to move to other places due to extreme heat in our area,\" Nawabshah resident Azhar Rashid said in an interview. \"We are surprised by every new summer here starting with high temperatures that badly affect our daily routine and jobs.”\n\nSo far this year, more than 60 people have died from the heat in Karachi, the country's largest city. Many more die of heat-related illnesses across the country, but exact numbers of deaths are not kept.\n\nIn June 2015, more than 1,200 people died from the heat nationwide and 65,000 were treated for heat illnesses, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority for the Karachi region reported.\n\nDepleting water supplies are another problem in a country where 60 percent of the land receives less than 10 inches of rain per year. Rivers are mainly fed by the Hindu Kush-Karakoram Himalayan glaciers, which are melting rapidly due to global warming.\n\nMore:Global warming risk: Rising temperatures from climate change linked to rise in suicides\n\nMore:Climate Point: Summer is getting warmer, faster\n\nMore:CSI Earth: Human 'fingerprints' detected in Earth's seasonal temperature changes\n\nMuhammad Akmal, a professor at Peshawar Agriculture University, said Pakistan's rising temperatures are also being boosted because forests are being destroyed as people clear areas for housing and other development. The trend also is resulting in less fertile land for farming.\n\nAkmal said global warming is extending summer-like weather to virtually the entire year, from January until November.\n\nAt the same time, “the rise in the use of vehicles causes heat and more ozone-destroying gases that transform the environment into a furnace,” he said.\n\nPakistan, which has the world's sixth-largest population, is projected to add nearly 100 million people by 2050, causing great strains on its resources. Plus, ambitious plans for economic development could mean the country increases carbon emissions by 300 percent over the next 15 years, as more cars clog roads and demand for electricity expands, according to projections.\n\nThe country's government has pledged to reduce emissions by 2030, as required by nations that signed the Paris Climate Accord, but it has not said how it will accomplish that given its development hopes.\n\nFeeding the growing population will be a challenge as the melting of glaciers and higher water evaporation rates caused by hotter temperatures will mean less irrigated water and smaller harvests of staples such as wheat and rice.\n\n“Recently we have seen devastating results of this growing mess,\" said Aamir Amjad, senior program coordinator at the Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Freedom, a liberal policy group. \"Humans are forced to migrate and switch their livelihoods, the yield of crops has decreased ... (and) \"the cycle of extreme weather has either expanded or intensified.”\n\nDespite all these environmental challenges, climate change has not been a major issue debated during the campaign for a new national assembly to be elected Wednesday. Instead, issues such as corruption and improving social services have dominated the debate among candidates.\n\nDuring the last five years, only the Pakistan Movement for Justice party, favored to score gains in the election, focused on environmental issues in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province by launching a program to plant a billion trees to reduce heat across the province.\n\n“We need to teach new generations about the environment and encourage researchers to conduct empirical studies on climate change issues,\" Amjad said. \"Their findings will help to streamline policies.”\n\nA 2017 report by the Asian Development Bank concludes that northern parts of the country will suffer the biggest increases in temperatures and that water per capita will decrease at an alarming rate in coming years.\n\nThe report also warned that extreme climate change events, such as heavier rains that cause flooding, will damage the country's gas, oil, and power infrastructure. Warmer temperatures also may affect the efficiency of nuclear plants, it said.\n\n“There is a need to develop drought- and heat-tolerant crops that show optimum performance even with changes in climate patterns,” the report said. It also called for construction of water storage systems, investment in renewable energy, \"improved weather forecasting and warning systems, retrofitting of critical energy infrastructure, and construction of dikes or sea walls.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/07/24"}]}
