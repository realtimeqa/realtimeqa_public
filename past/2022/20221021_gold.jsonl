No debt has been canceled thus far.\n\nThe Department of Justice has asked the Supreme Court to step in and reinstate the student loan forgiveness program while the legal challenges play out.\n\nThe administration officially launched the application on October 17, following a brief “beta period” during which its team assessed whether tweaks were needed.\n\nIf the courts ultimately allow the program to move forward, not every student loan borrower is eligible for the debt relief. First, only federally held student loans qualify. Private student loans are excluded.\n\nSecond, high-income borrowers are generally excluded from receiving debt forgiveness. Individual borrowers who make less than $125,000 a year and married couples or heads of households who make less than $250,000 annually will see up to $10,000 of their federal student loan debt forgiven.\n\nIf a qualifying borrower also received a federal Pell grant while enrolled in college, the individual is eligible for up to $20,000 of debt forgiveness. Pell grants are awarded to millions of low-income students each year, based on factors including their family’s size and income and the cost charged by their college. These borrowers are also more likely to struggle to repay their student debt and end up in default.\n\nHere’s what else borrowers need to know about the new student loan forgiveness plan:\n\nWhen will I receive my debt relief?\n\nIt’s unclear when, or if, borrowers will see debt relief under Biden’s program.\n\nAdministration officials expected to be able to grant relief before January, when payments were set resume after the pandemic-related pause expired. But the legal challenges put that timeline in jeopardy.\n\nOn November 22, the Biden administration extended the pandemic-related pause on payments until 60 days after the litigation is resolved. If the program has not been implemented and the litigation has not been resolved by June 30, payments will resume 60 days after that.\n\nThe White House has said that it has already approved 16 million applications for debt relief. The Department of Education will hold on to that information so it can quickly process those borrowers’ relief if the government prevails in court.\n\nIf and when the program moves forward, an estimated 8 million borrowers may receive debt relief automatically because the Department of Education already has their income on file.\n\nIf the government restarts taking applications, borrowers can apply online here: https://studentaid.gov/debt-relief/application.\n\nApplicants can expect to receive an email confirmation once their application is successfully submitted. Then, borrowers will be notified by their loan servicer when the debt cancellation has been applied to their account.\n\nBorrowers were expected to have until December 31, 2023, to submit an application.\n\nWhat kind of federal loans are eligible?\n\nThere are a variety of federal student loans and not all are eligible for relief. Federal Direct Loans, including subsidized loans, unsubsidized loans, parent PLUS loans and graduate PLUS loans, are eligible.\n\nBut federal student loans that are guaranteed by the government but held by private lenders are not eligible unless the borrower applied to consolidate those loans into a Direct Loan by September 29.\n\nThe Department of Education initially said these privately held loans, many of which were made under the former Federal Family Education Loan program and Federal Perkins Loan program, would be eligible for the one-time forgiveness action – but reversed course in September when six Republican-led states sued the Biden administration, arguing that forgiving the privately held loans would financially hurt states and student loan servicers.\n\nDefaulted Federal Family Education Loans and defaulted Perkins Loans are still eligible for the debt relief even if they are privately held.\n\nWhat year is the income threshold based on?\n\nIf Biden’s program is allowed to move forward, eligibility is based on a borrower’s adjusted gross income for either tax year 2020 or 2021. Adjusted gross income can be lower than your total wages because it considers tax deductions and adjustments, like contributions made to a 401(k) retirement plan.\n\nA taxpayer’s adjusted gross income can be found on line 11 of IRS Form 1040.\n\nHow will the government know what my income was?\n\nThe Department of Education says it already had income information for nearly 8 million borrowers, likely because of financial aid forms or previously submitted income-driven repayment plan applications. If the program is allowed to move forward, those borrowers will automatically receive the debt relief if they meet the income requirement, unless they choose to opt out. The department has said it will email borrowers who will be considered for debt relief but don’t need to apply.\n\nMillions of other borrowers will need to apply for student loan forgiveness if the Department of Education doesn’t have their income information on file. When they submit the application, borrowers are required to self-attest that their income is under the eligibility threshold. They are required to certify that the information provided is accurate upon penalty of perjury.\n\nThe Biden administration has said that applicants who are “more likely to exceed the income cutoff” will be required to submit additional information, like a tax transcript. Officials expect that just 5% of borrowers with eligible federal student loans would not qualify due to the income threshold.\n\nWill I have to pay taxes on the amount of debt canceled?\n\nBorrowers will not have to pay federal income tax on the student loan debt forgiven, thanks to a provision in the American Rescue Plan Act that Congress passed last year.\n\nBut it’s possible that some borrowers may have to pay state income tax on the amount of debt forgiven. There are a handful of states that may tax discharged debt if state legislative or administrative changes are not made beforehand, according to the Tax Policy Center. The tax liability could be hundreds of dollars, depending on the state.\n\nI’m a current student. Am I eligible for forgiveness?\n\nYes, some current students are eligible. Eligibility for borrowers who filed the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, known as the FAFSA, as an independent will be based on the individual’s own household income.\n\nEligibility for borrowers who are enrolled as dependent students, generally those under the age of 24, will be based on parental income for either 2020 or 2021.\n\nI have student debt from graduate school. Am I eligible for forgiveness?\n\nYes, if your income meets the eligibility threshold.\n\nI’m a parent and took out a Parent PLUS loan. Am I eligible?\n\nYes, if your income meets the eligibility threshold. A parent borrower with federal Parent PLUS loans for multiple children is still only eligible for up to $20,000 of loan forgiveness.\n\nBut a parent is only eligible for up to $20,000 in debt relief if he or she received a Pell grant for his or her own education. If only the child received a Pell grant, the parent is eligible for up to $10,000 in forgiveness.\n\nHow do I know if I ever received a Pell grant?\n\nMost borrowers can log in to Studentaid.gov to see if they received a Pell grant while enrolled in college. Information about Pell grants received is displayed on the account dashboard and on the My Aid page. This is also where borrowers can find out how much they owe and what kind of loans they have.\n\nBorrowers who received a Pell grant before 1994 won’t see their Pell grant information online, but they are still eligible for the $20,000 in student loan forgiveness.\n\nAs long as borrowers received at least one Pell grant, they are eligible.\n\nThe Biden administration has said that eligible borrowers who have received Pell grants will automatically receive the additional debt relief.\n\nAm I eligible for forgiveness if my loans are in default?\n\nYes, defaulted federal student loans are eligible for debt relief.\n\nFor borrowers who have a remaining balance on their defaulted student loans after the cancellation is applied, there will be an opportunity to get out of default once payments resume in January 2023 as part of what the Department of Education is calling its “Fresh Start” initiative.\n\nWhat are the legal challenges to Biden’s forgiveness plan?\n\nThe Biden administration is facing several lawsuits over the student loan forgiveness program. Many of the plaintiffs argue that the Department of Education is overstepping its authority.\n\nIn one case, a federal judge in Texas struck down the program on November 10, declaring it illegal. The Department of Justice has appealed the ruling to the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals, but debt relief is on hold while that case plays out.\n\nPreviously, the 8th US Circuit Court of Appeals put a temporary, administrative hold on the program on October 21, barring the administration from canceling loans covered under the policy while the court considers a challenge brought by six Republican-led states.\n\nThe appeals court then granted an injunction on the program on November 14, which will remain in place until the appeals court, or the Supreme Court, issues a further order in the case. The Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to step in and vacate the 8th Circuit Court’s injunction on November 18.\n\nA lower court judge dismissed the lawsuit on October 20, ruling that the plaintiffs did not have the legal standing to bring the challenge.\n\nOn the same day as the lower court dismissal, Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett rejected a separate challenge to Biden’s student loan forgiveness program, declining to take up an appeal brought by a Wisconsin taxpayers group.\n\nThe Biden administration is also facing lawsuits from Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich and the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.\n\nLawyers for the government say that Congress gave the secretary of education “expansive authority to alleviate the hardship that federal student loan recipients may suffer as a result of national emergencies,” like the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a memo from the Department of Justice.\n\nHow will my payments change going forward?\n\nBorrowers who have debt remaining after either $10,000 or $20,000 is wiped away could see their monthly payment amounts recalculated if they are enrolled in a standard repayment plan. Under a standard repayment plan, borrowers pay a fixed amount that ensures loans are paid off within 10 years.\n\nBorrowers who are already enrolled in an income-driven repayment plan are not likely to see their monthly payment amounts change due to the forgiveness, because their payments are based on household income and family size.\n\nBorrowers have not been required to make payments on their federal student loans since March 2020 because of the government’s pandemic-related pause. Biden has extended the pause through the end of this year, and payments will resume in January 2023.\n\nWhat about Biden’s new income-driven repayment plan?\n\nAlong with Biden’s August announcement about canceling some federal student loan debt, he also said he would create a new plan that would make repayment more manageable for borrowers.\n\nThere are currently several repayment plans available for federal student loan borrowers that lower monthly payments by capping them at a portion of their income.\n\nThe new income-driven repayment plan that Biden is expected to propose would cap payments at 5% of a borrower’s discretionary income, down from 10% that is offered in most current plans, as well as reduce the amount of income that is considered discretionary. It would also forgive remaining balances after 10 years of repayment, instead of 20 years.\n\nBiden is also proposing that the new plan cover the borrower’s unpaid monthly interest. This could be very helpful for people whose monthly payments are so low that they don’t cover their monthly interest charge and end up seeing their balances explode, growing larger than what was originally borrowed.\n\nBut we don’t know when these changes will take effect. The Department of Education has not provided any sense of timing, but has said it will propose a new rule to create the repayment plan. The department’s formal rule-making process usually includes soliciting public comments and can take months, if not more than a year.\n\nCan I get a refund for what I paid during the pandemic pause?\n\nYes. Borrowers have not been required to make payments on their federal student loans since March 13, 2020, because of the pandemic-related pause. But if borrowers did make payments, they are allowed to contact their loan servicer to request a refund.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.", "authors": ["Katie Lobosco"], "publish_date": "2022/08/31"}, {"url": "https://studentaid.gov/"}]}

The companies own dozens of chains, including Safeway, Vons, Harris Teeter and Fred Meyer and reach a combined 85 million households.\n\nKroger (KR) and Albertsons, which both employ mostly union workforces, want to merge to be more competitive against non-union giants such as Walmart (WMT), Amazon (AMZN), and Costco (COST). The grocers are also facing increased pressure from Aldi, the fast-growing German discount supermarket chain.\n\nA Kroger-Albertsons merger could reshape the grocery industry. Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n\nThere’s no guarantee the deal will go through, however.\n\nThe merger will face intense scrutiny from the Federal Trade Commission and other regulators. Opponents, Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, have already called on regulators to block the deal. The companies say they will divest hundreds of stores in areas where they overlap to win regulatory approval.\n\nHere’s how the mega-merger could impact grocery shopping in America.\n\nLower prices…for now\n\nPrices at the grocery store are a major concern for shoppers right now.\n\nGrocery prices increased 13% in September over the last year, the fastest pace in decades.\n\nThe companies say that they will be able to use $500 million in cost savings from the deal to reduce prices for shoppers and tailor promotions and savings. They will also invest $1.3 billion in Albertsons, including on lowering prices.\n\n“Our expanded portfolio, along with more personalized promotions and benefits, will help customers save… and help to relieve the inflationary pressures facing shoppers across the country,” Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen said Friday.\n\nAlbertsons stores are concentrated more on the West Coast, while Kroger is dominant in the Midwest.\n\nAlbertsons has higher prices than Kroger and other grocers, analysts say, and they predict Kroger will try to reduce Albertsons prices to be more competitive against discount chains like Aldi.\n\n“This deal could provide some food pricing relief for consumers,” said Ken Fenyo, a retail analyst at Coresight Research. “With Aldi, Lidl and other discount grocers coming in, this positions Kroger to drive the market forward.”\n\nBut supermarket mergers can also lead to higher prices for shoppers.\n\nA 2012 study published in the Journal of Economics and Management Strategy found that “mergers in the supermarket industry can result in significant increases in consumer prices and thereby harm consumers” in highly concentrated markets.\n\nMergers in less concentrated markets are most often associated with price decreases, the study found.\n\nAntitrust advocates say the merger would force out competition and concentrate power among the largest chains, driving up prices.\n\n“A Kroger-Albertons deal would squeeze consumers already struggling to afford food,” said Sarah Miller, the executive director of the American Economic Liberties Project, a policy group against concentrated economic power.\n\nMore store brands\n\nKroger and Albertsons have each been building out their own exclusive food brands in recent years as alternatives to big-name brands.\n\nKroger, for example, offers its own brands such as Private Selection and Simple Truth, while Albertsons has O Organics, Open Nature and others.\n\nThe two companies’ brands generated a combined $43 billion in sales last year.\n\nThis is an important strategy for these stores because it’s more profitable to sell their own brands than national labels, and it helps keep big brands’ prices in check.\n\nBy merging, the companies plan to expand their own brand selection and lower production costs.\n\nStore closures and pain for mom-and-pops\n\nGrocery stores in the United States are on the decline.\n\nThe number of US grocers fell by roughly 30% from 1993 to 2019, according to a report last year by Food & Water Watch, a consumer advocacy group.\n\nAnalysts say that Kroger and Albertsons are likely to close some of their overlapping stores, particularly in some cities where they are heavily concentrated, such as Los Angeles and Chicago.\n\n“There will, no doubt, be some closures if a merger goes ahead,” said Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData Retail. “Over time, the rate of closures may be more pronounced as the combined chains seek to minimize duplication,” he said.\n\nAdvocates fear the merger would harm small grocery stores. Jason Armond/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images\n\nAnalysts and advocates also say that a merger would make it harder for smaller grocers and mom-and-pop stores to stay in business.\n\nThe National Grocers Association, which represents small retailers and wholesalers, said the merger would put smaller competitors at an “unfair disadvantage” and increase “anticompetitive buyer power over grocery suppliers.”\n\nThis would disproportionally hurt cities and rural areas, where independent stores are typically located.\n\n“This deal would almost certainly put more rural towns and Black and Latino neighborhoods in cities at risk of becoming ‘food deserts’ as more local grocers are driven out of business,” said Stacy Mitchell, the co-director at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a research and advocacy organization that challenges economic concentration.\n\nMerger frenzy\n\nThe food industry in America has consolidated in recent decades.\n\nThe top five grocers – Walmart, Kroger, Costco, Ahold Delhaize and Amazon – control about half the market, according to UBS.\n\nA Kroger-Albertsons merger would spark a fresh wave of mergers and acquisitions as companies seek to keep up, analysts predict.\n\nThe proposed deal “accelerates the ongoing consolidation of the sector,” said UBS retail analyst Michael Lasser.\n\nAmazon “has aspirations to be larger in the space,” he said. “The warehouse clubs, hard discounters, strong [regional grocers] and specialty players will look to fortify their positions.”", "authors": ["Nathaniel Meyersohn"], "publish_date": "2022/10/17"}]}
{"question_id": "20221021_4", "search_result": [{"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/17/tech/kanye-west-ye-parler", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nKanye West is acquiring Parler, the alternative social media platform favored by many conservatives.\n\nParler’s parent company announced the deal on Monday morning, saying West had made “a groundbreaking move into the free speech media space and will never have to fear being removed from social media again.”\n\nThe acquisition comes after West, who has legally changed his name to Ye, had his account temporarily locked by Twitter this month over an antisemitic tweet.\n\nExact terms of the Parler deal weren’t disclosed, though Parler said it must still enter into a definitive agreement with West and expects to close in the fourth quarter. Parler’s parent, Parlement Technologies, would remain involved by providing technical services and cloud support.\n\nBuying Parler could make West the latest celebrity owner of a social media platform after former President Donald Trump’s bid to win over conservatives with Truth Social and Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s proposed acquisition of Twitter. It also highlights how a small group of wealthy men, some of whom were banned or suspended themselves for incendiary remarks, are looking to own social media platforms in an effort to bolster what they call “free speech.”\n\n“In a world where conservative opinions are considered to be controversial we have to make sure we have the right to freely express ourselves,” West said in a release by Parler.\n\nAs part of the announcement, Parler linked to West’s account on the platform, which appeared to have launched simultaneously. As of early Monday, the account had roughly 500 followers.\n\nFor Ye, the deal comes during a particularly controversial period. West has made headlines in recent weeks for wearing a “White Lives Matter” T-shirt in public and defending his use of the slogan — a phrase the Anti-Defamation League has linked to white supremacy groups — as “funny” to Fox News host Tucker Carlson. After the shirt incident, the apparel company Adidas this month said it was reviewing its partnership with West. In September, West also said he was abandoning a two-year partnership with the clothing retailer Gap.\n\nSpeaking on CNN Monday, Jonathan Greenblatt, the ADL’s CEO, called Parler a “haven” of hate.\n\nParler was founded in 2018 and saw rapid growth surrounding the 2020 election. Billing itself as a loosely moderated free-speech haven, the app became popular with conservative politicians and media figures, peaking at an estimated 2.9 million daily users, according to the market research firm Apptopia. But since then, its fortunes have dimmed, with Parler’s estimated daily user count slipping to just 40,000, Apptopia told CNN on Monday. (Twitter, by comparison, has more than 237 million daily active users.)\n\nIn the weeks following the Jan. 6 riots, Parler was removed from both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store for what the companies said was a failure to adequately moderate violent rhetoric on the platform. Documents provided to the House committee investigating the Capitol riots have shown how the Secret Service was aware of posts on Parler that suggested the possibility of violence surrounding that day. Separately, Parler has written to Congress claiming that lawmakers’ interest in the app’s role in the riots has been intended to “scapegoat” the app.\n\nParler has since been restored to both app stores after making changes to its content moderation practices.\n\nParler has faced more competition in recent months as the burgeoning right-wing digital media ecosystem has expanded. Truth Social launched in February on Apple’s app store, and was approved for Google’s app store on Oct. 13. Truth Social saw a spike of downloads last week due to its appearance on the Google Play Store, Apptopia said, and before then had been hovering at 144,000 daily active users.\n\nMusk’s move to buy Twitter, if the deal goes through, also has the potential to upend Parler and similar services. Musk has repeatedly called for eliminating permanent bans and rethinking Twitter’s approach to content moderation, which could once again make the much larger platform a home for some of the users who jumped to small services like Parler.\n\nIt could also effectively mean that Musk and Ye, who are said to be friends, are now competing with each other. After Ye’s antisemitic tweet sparked an outcry, Musk tweeted: “Talked to ye today & expressed my concerns about his recent tweet, which I think he took to heart.”\n\nOne week later, Ye’s deal to buy Parler was announced.", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/10/17"}]}

I have therefore spoken to His Majesty The King to notify him that I am resigning as Leader of the Conservative Party,” Truss said while standing outside the famous black door of 10 Downing Street, the same spot in which she had promised to put the UK back onto the path to economic growth and stability just six weeks earlier.\n\nThe announcement brings to an ignominious end a catastrophic tenure in Downing Street, which appeared doomed ever since the announcement of Truss’s flagship economic agenda sent markets into panic. A record rise in UK government bond prices sent borrowing costs surging and forced the Bank of England to make three successive interventions to rescue overstretched pension funds. The pound at one point hit an all-time low against the US dollar.\n\nTruss said she would stay in Downing Street until her successor is named.\n\nGraham Brady, who chairs the 1922 Committee which represents rank-and-file Conservative Members of Parliament, said Thursday that the new party leader – and therefore prime minister – should be in place before the end of October.\n\nCandidates to replace Truss will need at least 100 nominations from British Conservative lawmakers, Brady said later on Thursday, a move that effectively narrows the field of potential candidates.\n\nThe threshold allows for the possibility of three candidates, maximum, he said. There would be an online vote for Conservative Party members if two candidates make it through the parliamentary stages, party chairman Jake Berry added.\n\nIf only one candidate emerges, there could be a new party leader and Prime Minister by Monday, Brady said.\n\nTruss had tried to save her position by admitting her plan was a mistake and replacing her chancellor and long-time ally Kwasi Kwarteng with Jeremy Hunt, a staunch supporter of former Chancellor Rishi Sunak in the leadership contest over the summer.\n\nIn the end, even that was not enough.\n\nOn Wednesday, Truss lost another top official when Home Secretary Suella Braverman dramatically quit just a few weeks into the job, using her letter of resignation to launch a blistering attack on the prime minister’s leadership.\n\n“The business of government relies upon people accepting responsibility for their mistakes. Pretending we haven’t made mistakes, carrying on as if everyone can’t see that we have made them, and hoping that things will magically come right is not serious politics,” Braverman wrote in a critique of Truss’s numerous U-turns on taxes and public spending.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Liz Truss announces her resignation outside Number 10 Downing Street on October 20, 2022. Henry Nicholls/Reuters\n\nMaking a bad day even worse, chaotic scenes unfolded in the UK Parliament on Wednesday evening during a vote on whether to ban controversial fracking for shale gas.\n\nLawmakers reported that aides for Truss had manhandled MPs into the voting lobby to force them to vote against the ban proposed by the opposition Labour Party. Politicians in the lobby tweeted eyewitness accounts alleging that MPs were being physically dragged to vote in the government lobby, amid angry scenes of shouting and altercation.\n\nHouse of Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle announced Thursday that he had ordered an investigation into the allegations.\n\nShortest tenure ever\n\nThe names of potential successors began floating around even before Truss announced she was going to resign.\n\nLeader of the House of Commons Penny Mordaunt, who stepped in for Truss during a difficult parliamentary debate earlier this week and also stood in the leadership contest over the summer, will likely be in the running. Sunak, who was Truss’ biggest rival in that contest, is another possible candidate.\n\nMeanwhile, allies of Boris Johnson, Truss’s predecessor in Number 10, made it clear on Thursday that they think the former prime minister will stand in the leadership contest, according to two sources who worked on Johnson’s 2019 leadership campaign.\n\nNewly appointed Home Secretary Grant Shapps and Kemi Badenoch, who came fourth in the last leadership contest, could also stand.\n\nTruss announced her decision to leave on day 45 of her tenure. George Canning previously held the record for the shortest term in Downing Street, having served for 119 days until his death in 1827.\n\nHer move ensures a fresh power struggle within the ruling Conservative Party, which has hemorrhaged public support for the past year and has now overthrown Boris Johnson and Truss in the space of a few months. The new prime minister will be the third since the last general election in December 2019 and the fifth since the Conservatives came into power in 2010.\n\nEarlier this year, Truss’s predecessor Johnson narrowly survived a confidence vote in his leadership. But he resigned weeks later when dozens of ministers and members of the government quit, citing a lack of confidence in his government.\n\nTruss was elected the Conservative Party leader in early September. The September 6 audience during which Queen Elizabeth II officially appointed Truss as the new prime minister, the 15th of her reign, was one of the last duties carried out by the monarch before her death on September 8.\n\nThe new prime minister, whoever that may be, will become the first to be appointed by King Charles III.\n\nKeir Starmer, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, which is enjoying a huge lead in opinion polls, on Thursday repeated his calls for an early general election.\n\n“After 12 years of Tory failure, the British people deserve so much better than this revolving door of chaos,” the opposition leader said in a statement posted on Twitter.\n\n“The Tories cannot respond to their latest shambles by yet again simply clicking their fingers and shuffling the people at the top without the consent of the British people,” he added.\n\nScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also called for an early vote.\n\n“The interests of the Tory party should concern no-one right now. A General Election is now a democratic imperative,” Sturgeon said on Twitter.\n\nThe next general election is due to take place no later than January 2025, but the prospect of Britain seeing its third prime minister since the last poll in 2019 would heap pressure on Truss’ successor to ask the public for a new mandate.\n\nThe British pound was trading 0.5% higher against the dollar after Truss announced her resignation, indicating that investors welcomed the decision.", "authors": ["Ivana Kottasová Rob Picheta", "Ivana Kottasová", "Rob Picheta"], "publish_date": "2022/10/20"}]}
{"question_id": "20221021_6", "search_result": [{"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/17/health/otc-hearing-aids-what-to-know/index.html", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe high cost of hearing aids has long been a barrier for many people who have hearing problems. Traditional prescription hearing aids cost on average $2,000 per ear, and many people need two of them.\n\nBut the US Food and Drug Administration’s rule change in August means that people with mild to moderate hearing loss will be able to buy these devices online or in stores without a prescription – and for a lower price – starting Monday.\n\nThat means people won’t have to visit a hearing health professional and have a custom fitting, a process that can also be cost-prohibitive.\n\nTens of millions of people have hearing loss, but only about 16% of them use a hearing aid, according to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders.\n\nAs FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said in the agency’s announcement August 16, “Today’s action will not only help adults who have perceived mild to moderate hearing loss gain access to more affordable an innovative production options, but we expect that it will unleash the power of American industry to improve the technology in a way that it will impact the enormous burden of disability from hearing loss affecting the world.”\n\nHere, Dr. Frank Lin, director of the Cochlear Center for Hearing and Public Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, and Dr. Lindsay Creed of the American Speech Hearing Association, offer their advice on what to keep in mind when buying hearing aids over the counter.\n\nTip 1: Get tested\n\nBoth Lin and Creed strongly recommend getting a hearing test before heading to the store. Hearing tests measure a person’s level of sensitivity to sound. Creed said that a hearing test might also determine whether your hearing loss is caused by a condition that may not require a hearing aid, such as wax buildup.\n\n“It would be helpful to know exactly what your hearing levels are, because the research really suggests that individuals aren’t great at accurately determining their hearing loss levels. Younger individuals tend to overestimate their degree of hearing loss, while older individuals tend to underestimate their hearing loss,” Creed said. Getting tested will give you the most accurate results when you shop.\n\nKnowing your hearing number is as important as any other health data, Lin said, such as blood pressure, blood sugar levels or cholesterol.\n\nThere are several options for free or low-cost hearing tests, including hearing centers in stores like Costco or Sam’s Club, and even audiologist-recommended online tests. Stores like Best Buy will offer online hearing screenings.\n\nMany hearing aid manufactures offer their own tests to help customers with ease of use and accuracy.\n\nCreed recommends looking for tests that are backed by research and data.\n\n“I always feel like knowledge is power. If you want to start out with the most information and then make the best-informed decision as far as the technology that’s most appropriate for you, still starting with those professionals is a good idea,” she said.\n\nGetting tested will help you choose the product that best fits your needs.\n\nTip 2: Know what you’re buying\n\nYou’ll be able to find hearing aids on the shelves of pharmacies and big box stores, online and even in tech stores. Walgreens, CVS, Walmart, Best Buy and Hy-Vee are some of the places where customers can expect to find these devices.\n\nBut there are a few things to keep in mind when shopping.\n\nCreed says a return policy is crucial and advises customers to make sure whatever product they purchase has one. The new FDA regulation says the return policy on over-the-counter hearing aids must be plainly stated on the packaging, but extended return policies are up to the stores.\n\nBest Buy plans to offer an extended return policy of 60 days, for example, while Walgreens gives people 45 days to try out the products.\n\nAdditionally, the FDA recommends checking a product’s warranty and whether it covers maintenance and repairs, as well as whether you can get a loaner pair to use during repairs.\n\nWhen shopping for hearing aids, Creed recommends looking for the words “OTC Hearing Aid” on the package. This is part of the FDA regulation to make sure people are getting an actual hearing aid, rather than another type of device such as a hearing amplifier, made for recreational use. Hearing amplifiers magnify all sound, but hearing aids are customized to suit a person’s hearing needs.\n\nHearing aids sold over the counter will be regulated on October 17, but hearing amplifiers are unregulated. The FDA considers hearing aids to be medical devices but hearing amplifiers to be consumer electronics. If the product doesn’t say “OTC or over-the-counter hearing aid” on the primary display, it is not an FDA-regulated hearing aid.\n\n“I think, fortunately, the way the FDA crafted the language, the regulation is really well thought-out,” Lin said. “To basically give consumers information they’ll need to make an informed decision while at the same time creating the performance characteristics to guarantee that a device on the market will actually be reasonably safe and effective.”\n\nCreed urges anyone with questions contact an audiologist for guidance.\n\nTip 3: Know the difference between over-the-counter and prescription\n\nOver-the-counter hearing aids will be a great option for thousands of people in the mild-to-moderate stage of their hearing journey, but for some with more severe hearing loss, prescription hearing aids are still the only option. People under the age of 18 will also need a prescription.\n\n“We do anticipate for there to be some differences in the devices because it would not be cost-effective for manufacturers to sell their high-level technology at these prices,” Creed said. “So they’re probably going to be comparable to entry-level hearing aids in the prescription market.”\n\nOver-the-counter hearing aids might not have the same maximum volume as a prescription model and might not have the same degrees of customization or personalization. OTC devices will probably also be softer in volume and have output levels established by the FDA.\n\n“Because of how the FDA came out with very well thought-out regulations, they are really the range where it benefits … 90-plus percent of people out there with hearing loss,” Lin said.\n\nFor those with severe hearing loss, Lin and Creed recommend seeing an audiologist, even if it’s only to get a personalized recommendation on which over-the-counter hearing aid to choose. But some will require a more customizable prescription option.\n\nThe future of OTC hearing aids\n\n“It’s going to be the wild, wild West for another one or two years, and that’s a good thing because I think a lot will be trying different types of technologies and for retail malls to see what sticks, what meets consumers where they are, which has never happened before,” Lin said.\n\nHe believes the FDA’s move to approve hearing aids will lead to increased innovation as big tech companies enter the market.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nLin says audiologists will also start to shift their models, perhaps taking a more hands-on route in guiding patients toward the right over-the-counter hearing aids and aiding them in customization.\n\nCreed notes that although over-the-counter hearing aids are much less expensive and more accessible than prescription versions, they’re still not cheap.\n\n“There’s a lot of research going on using community health workers and seeing if they can fit more amplifier-type devices using community health workers,” Creed said, “And so I think that there’s still a lot of work to be done in this space.”", "authors": ["Raenu Charles"], "publish_date": "2022/10/17"}]}

He was then told that if he engaged in any more “activism” he and his family would be hunted down and arrested, he said.\n\nWhat Arman claims happened to him and those allegedly detained alongside him isn’t an isolated incident. Instead, it’s part of a tried and tested playbook used by the Iranian government to stalk, torture and imprison protesters, in an ongoing campaign to squash political dissent.\n\nArman, whose name has been changed for his safety, says he was tasered before being detained. Arman\n\nIn the months following Iran’s nationwide demonstrations in 2019, which were sparked by the government’s abrupt decision to increase the price of gas by 50% but snowballed into calls for the fall of the Islamic Republic and its leaders, widespread accounts of torture and thousands of arrests were documented.\n\nAs Iranians from all walks of life unite to fight for their civil rights – in protests first sparked by the death of a young woman in religious police custody last month – it appears to be happening again.\n\n“We are now in the worst time of our life. Full of stress. Full of fear,” a 24-year-old female protester told CNN. She says several of her friends were tortured – and that one of them was also sexually violated – after being detained by the IRGC in Rasht last month.\n\n“Nothing has happened to me yet and I was able to escape. But it is possible at any moment,” she explained during a video call about the incident, her face covered to protect her identity.\n\nCNN has spoken to almost a dozen Iranians who have shared first-hand accounts of torture in either the 2019 and 2022 protests, or who have had loved ones die or disappear while in the custody of authorities.\n\nSome of those impacted shared photographs documenting their injuries as well as court records detailing the criminal charges they’re facing; others shared only their stories, which CNN cannot independently verify.\n\nCNN contacted the Iranian government as well as its permanent mission to the United Nations regarding the accounts of torture and arbitrary detention detailed by protesters but has yet to receive a response.\n\nA group of people look out from what appears to be a security van in Tehran, as an officer stands nearby. Twitter\n\n‘There were rapes, torture’\n\nFarhad, a 37-year-old father-of-two, intimately understands the personal cost of speaking out against the Iranian government, but it hasn’t stopped him from joining the demonstrations which have continued for more than a month now and seem to transcend Iran’s social and ethnic divisions.\n\nIn the November 2019 protests, he says he watched several of his friends die on the streets of Tehran after being gunned down by security forces, in what would be a four-day nationwide rampage to silence dissent that ultimately left more than 300 civilians dead, according to Amnesty International.\n\nIt wasn’t until December 2, in the aftermath of the bloodshed, that Farhad says plain-clothes officers kicked down his door in the middle of the night to arrest him for his involvement in the demonstrations.\n\nFarhad, whose name has also been changed for his security, says the IRGC used footage of the protests from the BBC – which he has since shared with CNN – to identify him, effectively weaponizing the media coverage of the rallies to hunt down participants.\n\nIranian police patrol in the capital Tehran on October 8, 2022. Stringer/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHe claims he was tortured for 16 days in total and like Arman, that he knew the Tehran detention center in which he was being held was run by the IRGC because of a sign on one of its walls displaying its distinctive insignia.\n\nIn Farhad’s telling, several hundred people were detained and tortured alongside him. He still hears their screams.\n\n“Hundreds of people were imprisoned with me. There was a bed, people were being tied to it and abused. There were rapes, torture with electric shocks and boiling water … they were hanging people from the ceiling to beat them,” he told CNN.\n\nFarhad’s last memory from his time in that dark room is when he was hung up and beaten senseless by plain-clothes officers before being thrown in the back of a car, driven to an undisclosed location and dumped on the side of the road.\n\nDays later he woke up in a medical clinic near his house in Tehran, he said. He doesn’t know how he got there but cites an extended family member with links to Iran’s government as a possible reason his life was spared.\n\n“My teeth were broken; my lip was completely torn off. Because my bleeding was so severe, I [think] they did not expect me to survive.”\n\nCNN has reviewed photographs of Farhad’s injuries and the scarring he lives with today.\n\nFarjad has since left Tehran with his immediate family for their safety, but says he still receives late-night phone calls from Iranian authorities threatening to rape his wife and kill his children, and that his bank account is periodically frozen.\n\nHe also claims that in the months following his torture, his national identity card – the primary document used to access essential services in Iran – was wiped from the system.\n\nDespite the ongoing risks to his life and livelihood, Farhad’s commitment to the current demonstrations is unwavering.\n\n“My country and my people are suffering. The government of the Islamic Republic oppresses in the name of religion, I can’t see people [being] killed for their beliefs anymore,” he said.\n\nState-sponsored hackers\n\nCNN spoke with four more protesters who were tortured while in detention and later imprisoned for taking part in anti-government demonstrations in 2019 – including a young single mother who says she has had to place her son in the care of her parents in order to serve prison time, and a 43-year-old father of two from Shiraz who says he suffers from acute post-traumatic stress disorder, after spending 48 days in solitary confinement.\n\nTheir accounts all share striking similarities, most notably the ongoing harassment they say their families face from Iranian authorities via fake social media accounts, late-night phone calls, and local informants whom they believe monitor them for the IRGC intelligence service.\n\nAmin Sabeti is an Iranian cyber security expert who has spent years studying hacking groups with ties to the Islamic Republic, including the IRGC-affiliated ‘Charming Kitten’ group, which was recently sanctioned by the US government for “malicious cyber-enabled activities, including ransomware and cyber-espionage.”\n\nAccording to Sabeti, who is based in the UK, state-sponsored hackers have a tried and tested method in place to “dox protesters” once they’ve infiltrated their online groups using fake accounts, which involves “sharing photos of them on Twitter, Instagram or Telegram and asking others to share information about them,” while pretending to be concerned for their safety.\n\n“They used the same tactics in the November 2019 uprising,” Sabeti explained, which has led to more tech-savvy demonstrators identifying suspicious accounts and distributing warnings among their networks.\n\nA history of torture\n\nAt Tehran’s Ebrat Museum – a repurposed former prison – dramatic displays on the atrocities carried out against Muslim clerics by Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi’s police during the revolution have long been used as a propaganda tool to celebrate the “freedoms” won in the Islamic Republic.\n\nAnd yet, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei – who was himself imprisoned in the 1970s during Pahlavi’s reign – and his security apparatus, have a decades-long legacy of also using mass arrests and torture to control and silence political dissidents – the hypocrisy of which is not lost on protesters today.\n\nThe current movement – led and inspired by women – has united Iranians across generations, in what is shaping up to be the biggest threat the regime has faced to date. Notably, it has also survived weeks of rolling internet outages and violent crackdowns.\n\nBut as chants of “woman, life, freedom” continue – a rallying cry that’s come to encompass the daily violence and control Iranian women are rising up against – more than 1,000 people have been arrested, according to state news IRNA.\n\nPeople gather next to a burning motorcycle in Tehran amid the protests on October 8.

Meanwhile, Iran’s Education Minister Yousef Nouri confirmed last week that student protesters are now being detained in what he termed “psychological institutions,” run by the state.\n\nNone of the Iranians CNN spoke with were naive to the fact that their lives – and the lives of their families – are on the line as the uprising rages on, with most going to extreme lengths to protect their personal information online and avoid unnecessary risks while taking to the streets.\n\nArman still receives threatening phone calls and messages for his activism, but he says he won’t be deterred.\n\n“They torture us, and they are lying to the world, to the international community … Iranians want freedom,” he said. “We don’t want dictatorship. We want to connect with the world.”", "authors": ["Hannah Ritchie Teele Rebane", "Hannah Ritchie", "Teele Rebane"], "publish_date": "2022/10/19"}]}

They’re two of the most popular costumes this October.\n\nFrom beloved characters Harley Quinn and the “Stranger Things” gang to tried-and-true favorites like witches and dinosaurs, the most popular costume searches run the gamut from generic spooky to instantly recognizable IP, per Google Trends’ Frightgeist, a tool that analyzes the most-searched costume ideas nationwide.\n\nAmericans are sticking to what they know this Halloween, it seems: Witches, pirates, Harley Quinn and Batman all appeared in the top 10 costumes back in 2015, as well. To be fair, Halloween festivities have been muted since 2020, when Covid-19 made even the concept of candy-collecting scary.\n\nThe trends also reflect the times, and this year “Stranger Things” dominated streaming (but will fans dress up as Eleven or Vecna?). Batman appeared in a new film in March, and the Sanderson sisters of “Hocus Pocus” made their grand return in a sequel to the original Halloween classic.\n\nThe top 100 most popular costumes become more macabre, with infamous horror villains like Michael Myers of “Halloween” and “Nightmare on Elm Street’s” Freddy Krueger making appearances, as well as more lovable, cuddly characters like the Minions and Baby Yoda.\n\nFrightgeist breaks down local trends, too: “Spider-Man” is the top search in both Atlanta and Los Angeles, while in New York, “fairy” is the most popular costume. Chicago is hooked on “Stranger Things,” and Dallas is choosing “dinosaur.”\n\nHere are the top 19 costumes of 2022 (minus the 20th, which Google Trends curiously omitted from its rankings.)", "authors": ["Scottie Andrew"], "publish_date": "2022/10/19"}]}
