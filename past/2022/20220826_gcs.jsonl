Now, they are struggling to find a place to live weeks before classes start, according to a survey from Realtor.com, a digital real estate site.\n\nThe survey was conducted from July 12 to July 17, with over 500 current and recent college graduates participating. Thirty-five percent said they cannot afford to rent an apartment in their college town and 19% are relying on parental help to pay rent, something they didn’t need to do last year.\n\nForty-four percent said the overall real estate market is to blame.\n\nKayla Krueger, 19, is a college student at the University of Oregon in Eugene and struggled to find housing for the upcoming school year.\n\n\"We wanted to try to find a house to live in,\" she said. \"Apartments are often expensive and offer a bunch of extra amenities we don't really need.\"\n\n► Retail help:Walmart, the country's largest private employer, to pay 100% of college tuition for employees\n\n► 'I quit': Workers change jobs at a record pace amid burnout, new openings with higher pay\n\nIn June this year, there's an 8.1% rent increase from last year, with median rent hitting $1,575 in the 50 largest metro areas. In 44 of the 50 largest markets, rent prices in June reached a record-breaking high and, on average, people are paying almost $150 more a month.\n\nWhat's COVID's impact on real estate?\n\nHousing prices increased during the pandemic, leaving many prospective homebuyers looking for rental properties instead, resulting in higher median rent, says Realtor.com economist George Ratiu. The pandemic has spurred retirees and remote workers to move to more attractive areas, he adds, making it even more challenging for college students.\n\n\"With Americans embracing a return toward a new normal, businesses reopening, and pandemic restrictions lifting, demand for rental properties is rising,\" Ratiu told USA TODAY. \"Many college towns have become highly attractive destinations to both retirees looking for quality of life, and young families looking for affordability and good schools, further adding to demand.\"\n\nThe rent increases are only one of the factors behind the inability of many students to secure a place for the fall.\n\nThirty percent of students delayed confirming fall housing due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many weren’t sure whether they would have in-person classes or spend another year at Zoom university. The long wait cost about 22% of students a slot in on-campus housing, and 30% said securing housing was harder this year than last year.\n\n\"It was a stressful process because people were already starting to look for housing back in January,\" Krueger said. \"I wanted a house from the beginning, and I always pictured myself living in one, but since I got a late start, I dismissed my desires.\"\n\nKreuger and her five roommates began searching at the beginning of February and by the end of the month, they were approved for a seven-bedroom house. Luckily, it is only a 15-minute walk from campus and the rent is around $700 a month per person.\n\nThey wanted to sign a lease as soon as possible to ensure fall housing and will be able to move on Aug. 1.\n\nRents expected to keep rising\n\nOther students are having to make adjustments for the upcoming school year because of financial challenges. Twenty-one percent will be moving back home to save money, while 13% will take on more roommates and 10% will lower their wants and needs to save money.\n\nWhile rents are expected to keep rising over the next few months, Ratiu says the rate is likely to moderate as new single and multi-family homes are built. But for right now, there are few options for college students and solutions depend on each student's situation.\n\n\"If they can take a part-time job to pay for housing, or if they can move in with family to save on housing costs, it may be worth pursuing those to avoid piling on debt,\" Ratiu said.\n\n► Homes hard to find:Home sales to foreign buyers drop to the lowest level in a decade amid COVID\n\n► Got a car lease?: Your vehicle could be worth thousands of dollars more than expected because of COVID", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/28/us/five-things-february-28-trnd/index", "title": "5 things to know for February 28: Ukraine, EPA, Covid-19, State of ..."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/23/us/five-things-august-23-trnd/index.html", "title": "5 things to know for August 23: Ukraine, Primaries, Student loans ...", "text": "If your day doesn't start until you're up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix.

Ukraine\n\nThe US government is urging Americans in Ukraine to leave the country immediately, warning that Russia is stepping up efforts to launch attacks on civilian infrastructure and government facilities in the coming days. The renewed US warning follows similar announcements from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and other officials that Moscow may carry out intense attacks, including missile strikes, to coincide with Ukraine's Independence Day on Wednesday. In some areas of Ukraine, officials have issued a ban on all large gatherings between Monday and Thursday. Meanwhile, discussions are ongoing to try to secure the release of Americans Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan from Russia, US State Department spokesperson Ned Price said Monday, adding that officials are working \"with the utmost urgency.\"\n\n2.

Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that legalized the procedure nationwide. For many of those women, employers' benefit packages may be the only way they can soon afford a legal abortion.\n\nAmazon became the latest corporation to cover employees' travel costs to seek abortion care. The company told staff it would pay up to $4,000 in travel expenses annually for medical treatments including abortions, according to a message seen by Reuters. An Amazon spokesperson confirmed the nature of the Reuters report to CNN Business.\n\nThe company's announcement echoes similar moves by Citigroup, Yelp, Uber and Lyft to help employees bypass Republican-led efforts in several states to effectively ban abortion. And it comes just hours after a bombshell report by Politico indicated the Supreme Court is prepared to overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\nCNN has not independently confirmed the Politico report, and a Supreme Court spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nIf Roe is overturned, legislatures in 26 states have pending laws indicating that they intend to ban abortions, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights. That could leave many women in need of abortion services hundreds or thousands of miles away from access to the procedure — unaffordable for many.\n\nCorporate America is increasingly being drawn from the political sidelines on the abortion issue in response to pressure from investors, customers and employees. Companies are also struggling to attract and retain talent and worry about the impact these states' anti-abortion laws could have on their workers.\n\nExecutives are also learning how difficult it can be to craft a political message without angering one side or the other. Disney, notably, is grappling with the political fallout of coming out against Florida's so-called Don't Say Gay law. CEO Bob Chapek initially failed to condemn the legislation before backtracking and apologizing to staff and fans who were outraged by the legislation. After Disney publicly opposed the law and vowed to help repeal it, lawmakers in the state passed legislation to dissolve the company's longstanding status as a self-governing special district.\n\nLast year, as several states pushed legislation that would make it harder for some citizens to vote, hundreds of leading executives from companies including Amazon, Google, BlackRock and Starbucks signed a statement opposing the bills.\n\nHere are some of the most prominent companies offering expanded assistance to staff in states curtailing abortion care.\n\nAmazon\n\nThe nation's second-largest private employer said it would cover up to $4,000 per year in travel expenses for staff members seeking non-life-threatening medical care, including abortions, if care isn't available within 100 miles of where they live.\n\nTesla\n\nThe electric vehicle maker said in its 2021 impact report that it will help provide travel and lodging \"for those who may need to seek healthcare services that are unavailable in their home state\" as part of its expanded Safety Net program and health insurance offering. Tesla's headquarters moved to Texas in 2021, a state that has banned abortions after six weeks.\n\nCitigroup\n\nCitigroup in March became one of the largest US companies to commit to covering employees' travel costs if they need to leave their state to seek an abortion.\n\n\"In response to changes in reproductive healthcare laws in certain states in the US, beginning in 2022 we provide travel benefits to facilitate access to adequate resources,\" Citi said in a letter to shareholders as part of its annual proxy statement.\n\nBumble\n\nThe dating app company, which is based in Austin, Texas, in September created a fund \"supporting the reproductive rights of women and people across the gender spectrum who seek abortions in Texas.\"\n\n\"Bumble is women-founded and women-led, and from day one we've stood up for the most vulnerable. We'll keep fighting against regressive laws like #SB8,\" the company said on Twitter the week the legislation, which amounts to a near total ban on abortions in the state , went into effect last fall.\n\nRelief funds will go to organizations that support women's reproductive rights, including Fund Texas Choice, according to Bumble.\n\nLevi Strauss\n\nThe clothing company called protecting access to reproductive care a critical business issue.\n\n\"Efforts to further restrict or criminalize that access would have far-reaching consequences for the American workforce,\" the company told CNN Business in a statement. \"Given what is at stake, business leaders need to make their voices heard and act to protect the health and well-being of our employees. That means protecting reproductive rights.\"\n\nUnder Levi's benefits plan, employees can be reimbursed for travel expenses for services not available in their home state, including abortion. Part-time staff and others who aren't included in the company's benefits plan are also eligible for reimbursement, it said.\n\nLyft & Uber\n\nThe ride-sharing rivals each announced in September that they would create legal defense funds to protect any drivers who might be sued under the Texas law for driving a person who receives an abortion.\n\nThe law's wording leaves open the possibility that a driver could be sued, possibly even if they didn't know an abortion was happening, according to Elizabeth Sepper, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nLyft also said it would donate $1 million to Planned Parenthood \"to ensure that transportation is never a barrier to healthcare access.\"\n\nMatch Group\n\nThe Dallas-based company that owns Match.com and several dating apps including Tinder, OkCupid and Hinge, also announced in September a fund to ensure its employees and their dependents would be able to seek reproductive care outside of Texas.\n\n\"The company generally does not take political stands unless it is relevant to our business,\" said CEO Shar Dubey in a memo at the time. \"But in this instance, I personally, as a woman in Texas, could not keep silent.\"\n\nSalesforce\n\nSalesforce announced in September that it would assist its employees and their families if they want to leave Texas after the state passed the nation's most restrictive abortion law.\n\nThe cloud computing company told its 56,000 employees that they \"stand with all of our women at Salesforce and everywhere.\"\n\nSalesforce CEO Marc Benioff tweeted at the time: \"Ohana if you want to move we'll help you exit TX. Your choice.\" (\"Ohana\" is the Hawaiian word for \"family.\")\n\nYelp\n\nA representative for the San Francisco-based company said its employee health insurance already covers abortion care, but starting in May, Yelp will cover travel expenses for any US employees and their dependents who need to travel out of state to access abortion care.\n\nThe benefit extends to staff and dependents affected by any current or future restrictions on reproductive rights.\n\nAs a remote-first company with a distributed workforce, \"it's a priority for us to offer our employees consistent healthcare coverage, regardless of where they live,\" a representative said.\n\nStarbucks\n\nStarbucks' healthcare plan is offering reimbursement for travel for abortion or gender-affirming procedures when those are not available within 100 miles of an employee's home. Dependents who use Starbucks' medical plan are also eligible for these benefits.\n\n\"Regardless of what the Supreme Court ends up deciding, we will always ensure our partners have access to quality healthcare,\" wrote Sara Kelly, acting EVP of Partner Resources at the company, in a May 16 letter.\n\nKelly added that the company's benefits team is working on details of the new benefit, including timing.\n\n— CNN Business' Catherine Thorbecke, Ramishah Maruf, Charles Riley and David Goldman contributed reporting.", "authors": ["Allison Morrow", "Cnn Business"], "publish_date": "2022/05/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/25/tech/instacart-shoppers-batches-pandemic/index.html", "title": "Instacart desperately needed them months ago. Now some workers ...", "text": "(CNN Business) In the early days of the pandemic, as households around the country went into lockdown, shoppers for Instacart had a seemingly limitless amount of grocery orders to fulfill. Their earnings were, at times, bolstered significantly by generous tips in recognition of the personal health risk workers were taking.\n\nBut in recent weeks, some shoppers in markets across the country said they have gone hours or even days at a time without seeing many — or any — \"batches,\" which can consist of one or a few orders from different customers, according to social media posts and conversations with five shoppers, each of whom joined the platform during the pandemic. The workers, who spoke with CNN Business on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, are now grappling with the sudden drop in orders surfaced to them and struggling to understand the reasons behind it without more information from the company.\n\n\"You're basically just wasting your time,\" said one worker, who shops in Atlanta. He said he recently sat for two hours outside the two major grocery stores he typically shops near his home without seeing a single order.\n\nThe shoppers CNN Business spoke to said they believed the timing of the slowdown corresponded with a recent company app update. Instacart notified workers late last month that it was rolling out a change over \"the next few weeks\" so that \"batches you see will be closer to your location\" and warned that this \"will result in you seeing less batches in the list view,\" according to an email viewed by CNN Business. The company said in the email that the goal of the change is to help shoppers \"choose batches that are more relevant to you without having to travel too far for a batch.\"\n\nBut the underlying cause appears to be more fundamental: a shift in demand. An Instacart spokesperson told CNN Business there isn't a technical issue but rather the marketplace is stabilizing following what the company said was the busiest holiday season in its history atop a surge in Covid cases from the Omicron variant, which is now easing in the United States.\n\nRead More", "authors": ["Sara Ashley O'Brien", "Cnn Business"], "publish_date": "2022/02/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/ozarks/2017/05/27/man-who-reinvented-meth/330877001/", "title": "The Man Who Reinvented Meth", "text": "Thomas Gounley\n\nNews-Leader\n\nJohn Cornille had been with the Drug Enforcement Administration for seven years. Yet he couldn't wrap his head around what his informant was describing.\n\nIt was November 1992, and the man was talking about a visit to a home in Reeds Spring, Missouri. He said he'd been forced at gunpoint to use methamphetamine manufactured there. But something was off. The informant didn't mention beakers, flasks, Bunsen burners — none of the complex glassware Cornille was taught were part of meth labs.\n\nInstead, the informant reported an unusual scene: Black trash bags stuffed with empty boxes of cold medicine. A mason jar full of kerosene, with something resembling a hockey puck settled at the bottom. Starter fluid. And a cookie sheet in the oven, with a yellowish cake on it.\n\nCornille, like other DEA agents, had made meth himself, under controlled circumstances, as part of his official duties. It was standard practice; the agency knew it meant he'd have more credibility when he asked a court for a search warrant or filled out a probable cause statement recommending criminal charges. It was important that prosecutors see him and other agents as experts on the manufacturing of illegal drugs.\n\nAs Cornille sat down to request a warrant for the Reeds Spring home, he couldn't be that authoritative. He needed another source, someone who could credibly link common household items with the production of meth, a highly-addictive substance known for its energy boost. He called a chemist working for the DEA in Chicago.\n\n“I still remember what he said, because I wrote it down word for word,\" Cornille recalled in a recent interview. \"He said, ‘There’s a basis for such a formula in literature, but it’s not been seen in the United States.\"\n\nIt's been nearly 25 years since the investigation, but that's not the only comment that remains lodged in Cornille's memory.\n\nAt some point, as the informant was describing the unusual lab in Reeds Spring, Cornille asked him if the meth was any good. If the answer was no, he figured, the situation might not be that big a deal. Low-quality stuff was unlikely to spread.\n\nThe informant, however, had five words for him:\n\n\"Best dope I ever had.\"\n\nThree months later, in Springfield, Cornille sat across from a recently-arrested 49-year-old man.\n\nWith a voice recorder rolling, Cornille introduced himself for the record, then moved on to his guest.\n\n“With me today is Mr. Bob Paillet,” Cornille said, according to a transcript. “Mr. Paillet has agreed to talk to me and explain to me different methods of manufacturing methamphetamine. One using the sodium metal and anhydrous ammonia and then a couple others.”\n\nCornille told Paillet — pronounced “Pie-ay” — that he wanted \"just to sit down and talk to you about those different methods.\"\n\n\"How you discovered them, and so forth,” Cornille said.\n\nPaillet began by saying he'd always been interested in chemistry and physics and that he'd \"just played around with my chemistry set.\" Then he got detailed. He talked about molecules, replacement reactions and acetic acid, about catalysts, synthesis and hydroxyl groups. Scientific terms flowed with minimal prompting.\n\nAbout halfway through the conversation, Paillet made a remark that fell somewhere between a suggestion and a prediction.\n\n“You’re gonna have to send all your agents back to school and learn chemistry … There’s people out there that are going to great lengths to avoid getting caught,” he said.\n\nCornille responded. “Well, see I went to school to learn how to manufacture methamphetamine and to …”\n\nPaillet cut him off.\n\n“All the old ways,” he said.\n\nCornille joined the DEA in 1985 after serving on the local police force in Washington D.C. He spent the remainder of the decade in the nation's capital, fighting the crack epidemic. In 1990, he was transferred to southwest Missouri. At that point, Cornille recalls now, meth ranked about third on the agency's local priority list. Cocaine and marijuana were much more prevalent.\n\nIn the mid-to-late 1990s, however, the number of meth labs seized by the authorities drastically increased, first in Missouri, and gradually in other communities around the country. Before the decade was out, as the public and the media sought answers as to how the drug shifted from a problem to a crisis — how it grew powerful enough to ravage entire communities — law enforcement would point to Paillet by name.\n\n\"He brought it to life for this area,\" Springfield police Cpl. Dan Schrader told the News-Leader in 1998.\n\nPaillet essentially converted the process of producing meth from a complex formula — one that required the so-called \"cook\" to have a chemistry background — to a simple recipe that could be followed by the masses. DEA and court records indicate Paillet taught his method to others, who in turn taught it within their own respective circles. The man behind the unusual meth lab in Reeds Spring learned the method from one of Paillet's friends, Cornille said.\n\nPaillet wasn't a drug lord; he didn't control a network of associates. In fact, he did the opposite, spawning a generation of cooks by unintentionally democratizing an illegal industry. One textbook released in 2014 called Paillet \"arguably the Johnny Appleseed for the spread of local meth production throughout the Midwest.\" Journalist Frank Owen, in his own book released in 2007, wrote that Paillet “effectively decentralized the local meth trade … broadening the appeal of the drug.\"\n\nIn other words, Bob Paillet reinvented meth.\n\nHow did he do it? The story he told law enforcement revolves around the Springfield campus of Missouri State University, which at the time was known as Southwest Missouri State.\n\n“Bob claims he went to SMS’ library, and in a research manual he found this method of converting pseudoephedrine to methamphetamine using sodium metal as one of the catalysts,\" Cornille said. \"He claimed that at the top of the page was a swastika.”\n\nThus the moniker: The new process was the \"Nazi method.\" The new stuff, \"Nazi dope.\"\n\n“I really believe that his method, here in Springfield, was the bounce to get meth spread throughout the rest of Missouri and the United States,\" said Nick Console, who ran the DEA's Springfield office from the mid-1990s through the early 2000s.\n\nDespite Paillet's pioneering role in an American drug epidemic, relatively little has been known about him. In the later years of his life, he appears to have avoided public scrutiny, as well as further trouble with the law. He died in Texas, age 72, on Jan. 1, 2016.\n\nPaillet's death and the passage of time have obscured some details. Other key elements — like his recipe's alleged connection to the Third Reich — have taken on the characteristics of urban legend.\n\nCourt documents obtained by the News-Leader shed light on his arrest and the early spread of the Nazi method. Interviews with family members and a key associate, none of whom have previously spoken publicly, paint a picture of a man with an obsession who left public officials scrambling to respond for years.\n\nThe probable cause statement used to charge Paillet, written by Cornille, traces his arrival on law enforcement's radar to Jan. 24, 1993 — just over a week before he was arrested.\n\nThat day, the Polk County Sheriff’s Office arrested two Springfield residents, Christopher Fricks and Kimberly Lee Duncan, for possession of a controlled substance and possession of a short-barreled shotgun.\n\nIt's not clear from court documents how or why Paillet's name came up as the two were taken into custody. What is clear is that they told deputies of two places where Paillet stored materials he used to make meth.\n\nThe first was a room in a house Fricks was renting in Joplin. Authorities searched it on Jan. 28. The second was a property near the small town of Morrisville, where Paillet previously lived. One of his ex-wives allowed law enforcement on the property on Feb. 1. Both tips were substantiated.\n\nThen, on Feb. 2, a Missouri State Highway Patrol trooper and Polk County deputies headed to Paillet's apartment on West 3rd Street in Battlefield. Paillet wasn't home, but his current wife was, and she began speaking to the men. She mentioned her husband would sometimes disappear for up to three weeks at a time, telling her he was working in Kansas City.\n\nMidway through the conversation, Paillet drove up in a tan 1983 Chevy Cavalier. He walked inside, and set an unzipped black duffel bag on the floor. The grip of a pistol stuck out from the top, and the trooper quickly moved to secure the gun. It was loaded: Nineteen rounds, one in the chamber. Paillet said he'd traded for it.\n\nThe trooper and the deputies asked Paillet to talk outside. He said sure.\n\nThey walked out and the officers read Paillet his Miranda rights. According to court documents, Paillet “stated he was glad to see them and glad that it was over.”\n\nThen he began to talk.\n\nStanding outside his Battlefield, Missouri, home with a state trooper and several sheriff's deputies, Bob Paillet gave the men consent to search his vehicle.\n\nHe knew why they were there. Before they could open the door of his Chevy Cavalier, he told them what they'd find: methamphetamine, inside a small white pill bottle in the trunk. Once the drugs were retrieved, Paillet led the officers back inside and pointed out the two sawed-off shotguns under a bed.\n\nThe same day — Feb. 2, 1993 — the trooper and the Polk County deputies drove Paillet to the Missouri State Highway Patrol's regional headquarters on Kearney Street. There they were joined by John Cornille, a Drug Enforcement Administration agent based in Springfield.\n\nAuthorities found a note in Paillet's pocket, with a chemical formula written out. They also found two receipts, from trips to Walmart.\n\nShortly before dusk, after speaking with investigators, Paillet led the men to Room 431 of the American Inn Hotel in northeast Springfield, where he showed them the meth-making materials he had stashed there. Then they all drove across town to a storage facility in Battlefield, where he kept a second stash.\n\nThe News-Leader reported the bust two days later, with the headline \"Police nail 'Nazi Dope' laboratory in Battlefield.\" The authorities said chemical disposal workers wearing special suits and protective gloves spent about three hours clearing the storage unit. They estimated disposing of the chemicals would cost the federal government $35,000.\n\nThe story noted that, nationwide, the number of meth lab busts had declined in recent years. But it also quoted the head of a local drug task force, with a premonition that would turn out to be spot on.\n\n“This Nazi dope is definitely new to this area, and it could be the first in the U.S.,” said Steve Whitney, also the sheriff in nearby Christian County. “I still think we may see this more and more.”\n\nAlthough credited with pioneering the so-called \"Nazi method\" of producing meth — and opening the door to an era of amateur meth labs across the Midwest — Paillet himself has remained something of a mystery.\n\nNews stories and a handful of books published in the decades since his 1993 arrest have presented scant detail: He moved from California to Missouri in the 1980s and, upon finding meth was more expensive than he was used to out west, set out to make it himself. He researched chemistry at the library at Southwest Missouri State University in Springfield. He was arrested. He moved to Texas.\n\nThat narrative covers just a portion of his life.\n\nBorn on March 4, 1943, Robert Paillet was 72 when he died Jan. 1, 2016.\n\nHe left behind two daughters. In an email to the News-Leader, the oldest offered a theme for his biography:\n\n\"My father is a classic case of what PTSD does to a brilliant mind.\"\n\nSpeed. Crank. Dope. Ice. Zip. The poor man's cocaine.\n\nWhatever you call it, meth is a stimulant that affects the central nervous system.\n\nIt's odorless, typically white and can be found in powder and crystal forms. In the United States, it has for decades been a schedule II substance, which means it has some very limited accepted medical uses — for conditions like attention deficit disorder and obesity, under the trade name Desoxyn — but also a high potential for abuse, as well as psychological or physical dependence.\n\nOne of the things that sets meth apart from other illegal substances is its means of production.\n\n\"Unlike other major drugs of abuse, methamphetamine is a synthetic drug, and as such, is manufactured in a laboratory,\" the DEA wrote in a 2016 report. \"Methamphetamine does not rely on a plant as its main source and is not affected by drought, flooding, growth cycles, or other natural elements that affect production. Instead, methamphetamine production relies on the ability of traffickers to obtain precursors and other essential chemicals.\"\n\nMeth is most commonly smoked, snorted or injected. Its use causes an increase in energy and alertness and a decrease in appetite. Meth also produces an intense euphoric rush, and can make users hypersexual. Cornille said the high from crack cocaine lasts for a matter for minutes. With meth, the high lasts for hours.\n\nMeth can cause increased heart rate and blood pressure, tremors and convulsions and — particularly with repeated use — depression and motor and cognitive failure. Users also tend to not sleep for extended periods, which leads to additional detrimental effects.\n\nBob Paillet's death certificate lists his birthplace as San Diego. His oldest daughter, now 48, said her father was actually born on Canada's Vancouver Island, although his parents had previously lived in California.\n\nLisa Paillet — who spoke to the News-Leader on the condition that her real first name not be used — said Bob's father, Francis \"Fred\" Paillet, was a Vermont native and worked as a carpenter and master gardener. His mother, Quebec native Louise Marie Paillet, was a maid and cook.\n\nThe family moved to Fort Smith, Arkansas, when Bob was in junior high, then to the small town of Exeter, Missouri, about 60 miles southwest of Springfield, several years later. After graduating from Exeter High School in 1961, Bob enlisted in the Navy and was sent to California's Bay Area. He was taking forestry classes at the University of California-Berkeley when, in 1964, he was deployed to Vietnam on the aircraft carrier USS Ranger.\n\nLisa said her father returned to the United States with \"debilitating migraines and a jaundiced view of the world,\" after a commanding officer \"rode one of his crew members so hard\" that he committed suicide. She believes Bob had post-traumatic stress disorder, although he was never formally diagnosed. For the most part, Lisa said, her father avoided talking about his time at war.\n\nUpon his return home in 1965, Bob Paillet married Lisa’s mother, whom he met in Berkeley prior to his deployment. They briefly lived in Oakland before embarking on a year-long trip around the United States, ultimately ending in Kansas City. Over the next five years, Bob and his wife bounced back and forth between there and the Bay Area. Bob never returned to college.\n\nLisa was born in California in 1968. She said her father had an assortment of jobs over the years. Sometimes he flipped houses, or built new ones. He liked to purchase and restore antique cars, a lifelong passion of his, for resale. He wasn't always self-employed, however. When Lisa was born, he worked as a lineman for the phone company.\n\nAround 1970, the family of three was living in Kansas City, where Bob worked for a fiberglass company. One day, he saw a friend and co-worker get electrocuted. It's a moment that \"damaged\" her father, Lisa said.\n\nThe family moved back to California, where Bob reconnected with a friend who was using meth. At some point, Lisa said, the friend got hold of a bad batch and became sick.\n\n\"So my father went to the Berkeley public library and the university library and started researching chemistry books,\" Lisa said.\n\nWhy chemistry books? Bob \"wanted him to have clean drugs.\"\n\n\"That’s my father’s logic,\" she said. \"Not get him off the drugs — but make them better.”\n\nWithin a few years, Lisa said, Bob became \"really flaky and moody.\" Around 1973, at Bob's request, Lisa's mother gave her husband a year to travel and find himself. He took two. When Bob came back, the couple divorced.\n\n\"After that, I saw him off and on for camping trips, hiking, or things like roller skating,\" Lisa said. \"It was a good compromise. I got to see him when he was in the mood to play. If he was not, he was not around. This basic relationship carried us through life.\"\n\nThe extent to which Bob used or produced meth in the ensuing years is unclear. Sometime during the two-year break, Lisa said, Bob met the woman who would become his second wife. His youngest daughter, Gena Paillet, was born in the Springfield area in 1978.\n\n\"I can remember I grew up terrified of him, because he would be one happy person one minute and literally in a second go to this terrifying person,\" Gena said.\n\nBy the time he was arrested with methamphetamine in the trunk of his car in 1993, Bob Paillet was on his third marriage.\n\nHe had fathered two children, born 10 years apart, in different states, to different women. The lives of his daughters, to this day, have had relatively little overlap.\n\nBoth women, however, have memories of living with their father on a plot of rural land along Highway JJ, not far from Morrisville, Missouri. The town of about 400 is 25 miles north of Springfield.\n\nThe remote venue in the anonymous rolling hills of the Ozarks appears to have been one place where Paillet refined the work that would later turn the meth trade on its head.\n\nGena Paillet, Bob's youngest daughter, lived there in the mid-1980s. She and her father had recently moved back to Missouri from California. Her mother, Bob's second wife, stayed behind in the Golden State for a year to work. Gena and her father lived in a modified school bus while Bob began building a house.\n\nIt was a simple setting. The bathroom for a time was an outhouse. But the property gave Gena, who says she grew up fearing her father, what she calls \"some of the best memories of my life.\" There were dense woods to explore, and the property abutted the Little Sac River.\n\n“We’d go swimming in that all the time and catch crawdads, things like that,\" Gena said. \"I’ve thought about going back to that property.\"\n\nWithin a couple years, however, Bob and his second wife separated. Gena said her father was unfaithful and verbally abusive. She and her mother went to live in Morrisville.\n\nNot long after, in 1987, Bob's oldest daughter, a product of his first marriage, arrived at the property.\n\nLisa Paillet — the first name is a pseudonym — grew up in California, where she was born in 1968. She saw her father only occasionally, but at times felt his presence even when he wasn't around. In high school, Lisa said, adults would sometimes show up and \"imply that they knew my father and were supposed to watch out for me.”\n\nLisa came to live with her father as she prepared to attend Southwest Missouri State University in Springfield. He was footing the bill.\n\nThree decades later, Lisa remembers the property as a place where her father experimented. Bob never said exactly what he was doing, and Lisa sensed it might be best if she didn't exactly know. She recalls helping her father hook together motors and going on shopping trips to Walmart to buy cold medicine.\n\n\"He would buy tons of that stuff, and he said it was easy for him to break down to get the chemicals he wanted,\" Lisa said.\n\nBob coached Lisa not to give her name to people. If somebody came looking for her father, she was supposed to deny that she knew him. Instead of guard dogs, the property near Morrisville had guard geese. The animals tend to raise a racket when they're disturbed.\n\n\"If you heard the geese and it was dark outside, you hit the lights and you hit the floor,” Lisa said.\n\nThere is some overlap in Lisa and Gena's memories. Both recall a room on the property where they weren't supposed to go. Gena distinctly remembers hiding behind a tree one day, on a weekend visit sometime after her parents separated, and watching her father go inside.\n\n\"I just remember seeing this one huge table ... with beakers and pots and things smoking and, you know, tubes going from one to the other,\" she said. \"I didn’t know what it was, but I knew he was up to something. And by his behavior becoming much more erratic, we knew something was wrong. We just didn’t know what.”\n\nBy the 1980s, the U.S. meth trade — both manufacturing and distribution — was largely run by outlaw motorcycle gangs. In some places, it was the Hell's Angels. In Texas, it was the Bandidos.\n\nNick Console, a Louisiana native now living in Ash Grove, joined the DEA in 1983, and was soon working out of the agency's Houston office.\n\nIn an interview, Console said that meth labs back then were primarily located in out-of-the-way, rural areas, so the rotten egg smell produced during a cook wouldn't give the operation away. They were full of glassware, not unlike a scene from the hit TV series \"Breaking Bad.\" The labs churned out batches of the drug measured in pounds.\n\nBusts by the authorities would sometimes lead to shoot-outs. At times, cleaning up a lab consisted of dumping the chemicals in the nearest ditch, Console said. The Environmental Protection Agency had yet to sound the alarm. Nobody thought to wear a respirator.\n\n“These labs, they were out in west Texas, they might be out in the boonies in an old mobile home, but everything in that mobile home was a lab,\" Console said.\n\nMeth was big business for the bikers, and it required a specialized workforce, he said. The gangs employed their own chemists, who generally used what is known as the P2P method, in reference to its incorporation of phenylacetone, a chemical often used for industrial cleaning or photo processing purposes.\n\nBack then, Console said, “you had to be a chemist to make meth.”\n\nThe meth trade's biker era bled into southwest Missouri. In 1987, Glennon Paul Sweet, a local member of the Hell's Angels-affiliated Galloping Goose motorcycle club, gunned down Highway Patrol Trooper Russell Harper during a routine traffic stop just outside Springfield. It was later determined Sweet, who was ultimately put to death, was transporting meth.\n\nThe wooded hollows of southern Missouri once attracted moonshiners. By the late 1980s, the region's rural nature and sparse law enforcement presence were seen as ideal for making meth. DEA officials reported that manufacturers were buying or leasing farmhouses and converting them into P2P labs. Still, they were few and far between; Cornille said agents typically came across a couple of labs per year.\n\nAfter being transferred from Houston, Console worked for the DEA overseas in Turkey, then in San Francisco. In the fall of 1994, about a year and a half after Paillet's arrest, he arrived in Springfield as the DEA's new resident agent in charge.\n\n“When I got here, it was the beginning of the spike in meth labs,\" he said.\n\nLisa Paillet doesn't believe her father was ever in a motorcycle gang. But Bob definitely associated with some shady types.\n\n\"I know that when I was in circles of people that I would consider very bad people, he was known in California,” she said.\n\nLisa also said her father \"would have hundreds of thousands of dollars of cash sometimes, and then he would have nothing.\"\n\nEither way, Paillet had no prior criminal record when, in January 1993, he became a person of interest to law enforcement agencies in southwest Missouri. The authorities had encountered a new type of meth lab — using what became known as the \"Nazi method\" — in the town of Reeds Spring just a couple months earlier.\n\nIn DEA records reviewed by the News-Leader, Paillet said he was the one who discovered the new process, but never specifically stated when that happened. Evidence suggests, however, that it was years before his arrest.\n\nThe Reeds Spring lab wasn't the first of its kind. A Nazi method-style lab was found in 1988 in a trailer park in Vacaville, California, according to a 1990 article in the Journal of Forensic Sciences. Authorities later came to believe Paillet was behind the lab — a conclusion that appears supported by his numerous connections to the state.\n\nThe Nazi method starts with the compound pseudoephedrine, which, chemically speaking, is one oxygen atom removed from methamphetamine. Pseudoephedrine is the active ingredient in cold medicines sold under brand names such as Sudafed.\n\nHere’s how a former DEA chemist described the ensuing process:\n\nTo make meth, the manufacturer pulverizes the pseudoephedrine pills in a coffee grinder, creating a fine powder that is placed in a coffee filter. Methyl alcohol, in the form of something like windshield washer fluid, is poured over it, and then evaporated out.\n\nThe cook then adds ether, anhydrous ammonia - a compound commonly used by farmers as fertilizer – and sodium metal or lithium metal, which can be stripped from commercial batteries. That produces a liquid called meth oil.\n\nMore ether is added, and the solution is put through another coffee filter. A bubbler is then used to convert rock salt and other material to hydrogen chloride gas, which converts the meth oil into a white powder. Meth.\n\nThe Nazi method is also sometimes referred to as the Birch method because it builds upon the Birch reduction, a reaction first reported in 1944 by the Australian chemist Arthur Birch.\n\nThe significance of the Nazi method was how simple it was. When DEA agent John Cornille gave talks to community members, he'd compare it to baking a cake.\n\n“Bob made meth a recipe anyone could follow,” he said.\n\nThe Nazi method produced small amounts of the drug, not the big batches typically cooked up in rural \"superlabs.\" But unlike previous manufacturing methods, Nazi dope didn't require an open heat source. It involved fewer steps, and took less time.\n\n\"From start to finish, you could probably do it in an hour,\" Cornille said.\n\nAdditionally, the chemicals involved were legal, and often easy to obtain. It takes hundreds of pseudoephedrine pills to make a half ounce of meth. But purchasing cold medicine in vast quantities didn't raise eyebrows in the early 1990s.\n\n\"At that time, if someone came in and bought 10 boxes of pseudoephedrine, Walgreens was happy,\" Cornille said.\n\nBob Paillet ordered a pecan waffle with extra butter and a glass of milk, then settled into the booth at a north Springfield Waffle House. He was wearing a wire.\n\nAfter being arrested on Feb. 2, 1993, the Springfield-area resident told the authorities that he'd taught his new recipe for methamphetamine — the so-called \"Nazi method\" — to a friend. Now, less than 24 hours later, Paillet, 49, was killing time reading the newspaper, waiting for that man to arrive. Drug Enforcement Administration agent John Cornille and a Missouri State Highway Patrol trooper were listening from a van parked nearby.\n\n\"Hey, late as usual,\" Paillet said as Mike Poplawski, 34, arrived.\n\nA transcript of the conversation that took place over breakfast — obtained from the DEA under the Freedom of Information Act — is heavily redacted, with Poplawski's comments completely blacked out.\n\nBy the time they parted ways, however, Poplawski had given Paillet 279 milligrams of meth, according to court documents. The wire caught everything.\n\nThe next day, Cornille and the trooper showed up at Poplawski's home on South Newton Street.\n\nPoplawski was cooperative. He invited the officers in, and, when told there was an ongoing investigation that involved him, admitted that he cooked meth, according to court documents. He showed the trooper a baggie of the drug inside his wallet, and then took them to another apartment where he stored lab equipment and precursor chemicals.\n\nLater, at the DEA office, Poplawski confirmed he'd been taught by Paillet how to make meth using the Nazi method.\n\nIn a recent interview, Poplawski, now 59, said he first met Paillet in 1979.\n\nRollerskating was the thing to do back then, and \"we were both hotdoggers,\" Poplawski said, using a term for those fond of showing off. The pair — 35 and 21 years old — met at a north Springfield rink. Poplawski said they were among the first in the city to purchase jogger skates, basically tennis shoes with big, brightly-colored wheels.\n\nPoplawski said he believes Paillet might've smoked a little pot back then, and he drank, but he didn't do anything harder. Then Paillet left for California. When he returned, he was into meth. And Poplawski was, too.\n\nHe attempted to describe his relationship with Paillet back then.\n\n\"Friend?\" he said. \"No. Associate. Close associate.\"\n\nIt's unclear from court records when Paillet taught Poplawski the Nazi method. Poplawski declined to clarify the timeline.\n\nPoplawski did state that, sometime in 1992, there'd been what might be called a misunderstanding between the pair. Paillet asked Poplawski to stop giving meth to a mutual friend of theirs. Poplawski complied. The friend complained to Paillet, who by that point had forgotten his earlier directive and became angry at Poplawski. The two stopped talking.\n\nThen six or eight months later, there was a phone call. And a request to meet at the Waffle House along North Kansas Expressway. From Poplawski's perspective, it seemed an effort to repair the rift.\n\nSitting in the living room of his east Springfield home, Poplawski briefly looked over the redacted transcript of the conversation that day. Some of it was small talk, he said. Mostly, Paillet was \"crying about hurting, wanting some speed.\"\n\nIt's been nearly a quarter century since the conversation, and Poplawski doesn't have a single positive thing to say about Paillet.\n\nThe man was chauvinistic, he said. A shorter guy with \"a big man's want for power,\" someone who walked around \"like a bantam rooster.\" A guy who \"hit on every woman that he come across, no matter what.\" And a man whose defining obsession — all speeders have one, Poplawski said — was \"his process,\" the way he made his dope.\n\n\"He experimented on people,\" Poplawski said. \"He’d change the formula a little bit and then give it to junkies he knew’d take it and ask no questions, and then watch their reactions. This is the guy that DEA worked with.\"\n\nAs Poplawski looked at the transcript, he wouldn't even agree with Paillet's remark that he showed up to the Waffle House late.\n\n“I’m more on time than anybody I know,” he said.\n\nThe authorities didn't stop with Poplawski.\n\nShortly after 9 p.m. on July 26, 1993, Cornille and three other law enforcement officers parked their vehicles in rural Webster County, with a barn in sight. They were investigating the latest appearance of Nazi dope. Cornille remembers hearing coyotes howl.\n\n\"Having moved from D.C. to here, it was a bit of a change for me,\" he said.\n\nEarlier in the day, an informant told a Springfield police detective that a man named Frank Wright was planning to cook meth at the barn, which was owned by an associate, Gary Davis. The men would start once the sun went down, the informant said, to take advantage of lower humidity levels. The informant indicated Wright drove a green Dodge van. It was parked by the barn.\n\nInvestigators would later learn that, earlier that afternoon, Davis heard that a friend with a similar vehicle was stopped by the DEA. Davis became nervous and told Wright to \"burn the barn\" if agents showed up.\n\nAround 10 p.m., the van started up. It drove off the property, headed west. Cornille and the others followed and initiated a traffic stop.\n\nWright agreed to a search. The van was clean. But the officers found a cigarette pack with a small amount of meth on Wright himself. They read him his rights.\n\nWright admitted to the authorities that he was planning to cook meth, and said he was placing supplies inside the barn. It was to have been something of a trade, court documents indicate. Davis, in exchange for providing the setting for the cook, was to receive two \"eight balls\" — the term for an eighth of an ounce — and be allowed to assist in production, so as to learn the new method himself.\n\nWright was arrested. The barn, by all accounts, escaped unharmed.\n\nDavis contacted the DEA a week later. He admitted to knowing about plans for the cook and said he'd participated in an earlier one.\n\nWright, in turn, contacted the DEA in mid-August. He said he'd been introduced to meth about 18 months prior when he was at Poplawski's home. Paillet showed up to deliver the drug. Wright said he started doing work on Paillet's vehicle, and his involvement gradually grew, until he was loading and unloading chemicals and driving Paillet around while he distributed meth.\n\nWright told the DEA that Poplawski taught him to make meth. He described it as a somewhat formal process that entailed assisting with three cooks. (Poplawski, in a recent interview, denied ever teaching anyone the Nazi method).\n\nThe hardest ingredient to obtain was sodium metal, Wright told the DEA, so he figured out a way to manufacture it himself, using lye, an electric stove, jumper cables and a 12-volt car battery.\n\nHow did Wright come up with the workaround? Perhaps his time with Paillet influenced him.\n\n\"In late June, 1993, or early July, 1993, Wright did research into the manufacture of sodium metal at Southwest Missouri State University,\" court documents say.\n\nPaillet, Poplawski, Wright and Davis were indicted by a federal grand jury on Oct. 8. 1993, along with two others, Kenneth and Sybil Allen. Court documents say Poplawski sold meth to, and purchased meth from, the couple. The charge against Sybil Allen was later dropped.\n\nNone of them were rich, at least as far as the court knew. Financial affidavits indicate that Poplawski was the only one employed in a traditional sense, bringing home $280 a week. Paillet and the others were listed as self-employed or unemployed, with minimal assets.\n\nThree of the men had a record. Poplawski had been convicted in 1978 of felony robbery in Phelps County. Two others had stealing and drug offenses.\n\nThe men all initially pleaded not guilty and bonded out of jail. Dates were set for jury trials. Behind the scenes, however, negotiations were being made for plea agreements.\n\nBetween mid-December and early January 1994, all five pleaded guilty to conspiring to manufacture and distribute meth. In exchange, additional charges against some of them, for physically manufacturing or possessing the drug, were dropped.\n\nWith Paillet and his co-conspirators rounded up, the authorities could have been excused for thinking they'd nipped the nascent meth-making boom in the bud. But they were soon disappointed. The recipe for Nazi dope was no longer a secret.\n\nThe inaugural class of those involved with \"Nazi dope\" was sentenced in Springfield in the spring of 1994.\n\nThere was Bob Paillet, who told authorities he was the pioneer behind the new meth labs popping up in southwest Missouri; Mike Poplawski, to whom Paillet taught his new method; Frank Wright, who said he learned it from Poplawski; Gary Davis, who arranged to learn it from Wright; and Kenneth Allen, who bought meth from, and sold meth to, Poplawski.\n\nAllen, who tested positive for using drugs while on bond, was sentenced to three years probation.\n\nDavis also used meth while on bond and traveled without permission out of the state. He was sentenced to five years in prison.\n\nPoplawski was sentenced to nearly six years in prison.\n\nIf the sentencing guidelines at the time were followed, Wright would've faced something similar — between six to seven years behind bars. Prosecutors, however, told the judge he provided \"substantial assistance\" in the prosecution of Poplawski. So he was sentenced to about three years in prison, followed by a similar amount of probation.\n\nThen there was Paillet, who received the best deal of them all.\n\nUsing the sentencing guidelines, prosecutors calculated Paillet's \"total offense level\" to be 31. That would correspond with nine to 11 years behind bars. The prosecutors, however, wrote that \"defendant agreed to fully cooperate with the government.\" He was credited with assisting in obtaining the guilty pleas of the others: Poplawski, Allen, Wright and Davis.\n\nAdditionally, the prosecutors wrote that Paillet \"provided significant information concerning the origin of this particular method of making methamphetamine.\"\n\n\"Defendant fully admitted that he first devised this method of making methamphetamine, and it was through him that the method was related to other 'cooks' in the southwest Missouri area,\" they wrote.\n\nPaillet was sentenced to five years of probation. He also attended a drug treatment program. While there, he received a letter from his oldest daughter, living in California.\n\n\"Surprise, Surprise,\" she wrote. \"If I would have known you could do things like that I would have asked for help with my chemistry homework.\"\n\nNearly a quarter century later, Poplawski doesn't understand how Paillet didn't spend a day in prison.\n\n“This was the man that experimented on people, and the DEA worked with him,\" Poplawski said. \"I’m a little burnt about that, still. It still rises my anger a bunch. Not that I was interested in working with them myself, don’t get me wrong, and not that I wasn’t involved, don’t get me wrong there. But I was not the man on top. I was not the man to hit for the heavy sentence.”\n\nPoplawski was implicated when Paillet wore a wire to their meeting at a north Springfield Waffle House. Poplawski told the News-Leader the pair never spoke after that day, except for one comment when they found themselves in the same courtroom.\n\n\"No hard feelings,\" Paillet told the man who had once been his friend. Poplawski, flabbergasted, didn't respond.\n\n\"If I could’ve shot lightning out of my eyes, he’d have been a pile of flesh, a pile of ash, in a heartbeat,\" Poplawski said. \"He just cost me five years. He cost me five years.”\n\nThere's something about calling a drug recipe the \"Nazi method\" that attracts attention.\n\nA few days after Paillet was arrested in February 1993, the News-Leader wrote about the bust. A spokeswoman for the Drug Enforcement Administration was quoted saying that \"people give their drugs all kind of names.\"\n\n\"Just because it was made by German soldiers during World War II and now is called 'Nazi drugs' has no meaning to us,\" the spokeswoman said. \"It's a nothingness. It only means that the producers don't have to use the usual ingredients, that they can make it without the regular methods. It's dangerous, no matter what you call it or how you make it.\"\n\nThere's a problem with the spokeswoman's response — one that's been replicated in many subsequent discussions of the Nazi method. It implied there's a direct link between Paillet's recipe and the Third Reich. But is there? After reviewing the available evidence, the News-Leader found the connection, while compelling, is tenuous.\n\nResearchers have delved into German use of meth during World War II. Temmler, a Berlin-based pharmaceutical company, introduced meth in pill form under the brand name Pervitin in 1938, according to a 2005 report in the news magazine Der Spiegel. By 1940, millions of pills were being shipped to the front lines, resulting \"in a Blitzkrieg fueled by speed.\"\n\nGermany wasn't alone in exploiting new substances with minimal consideration for side effects. The United States and British supplied service members with tablets of Benzedrine, an amphetamine, during the same period. Both were viewed as particularly valuable for pilots, who needed to remain alert on long bombing raids.\n\nThe large-scale manufacture of Pervitin pills in German factories, however, stands in stark contrast to Paillet's method, which resulted in small amounts of a powdered version of the drug. Which raises the question: If the method wasn't the same, how did meth produced in southwest Missouri end up referencing a fascist state?\n\nIn an interview, DEA agent John Cornille said that Paillet told him he learned the Nazi method by researching in the library at what was then Southwest Missouri State University. Cornille said Paillet indicated he came across a book or a document with a swastika on it.\n\nThose two particular claims aren't found in the hundreds of pages of federal court and DEA records reviewed for this story. The DEA records, which were heavily redacted, do include one conversation in which Cornille asked Paillet if he looked \"this stuff up in a book or something.\" The response, however, contradicts the notion that there was one all-important document.\n\n\"OK, I have a lot of books,\" Paillet said. \"I have gone through the library, many libraries and read lots of books, hundreds of 'em. Ah, involving many phrases of chemistry.\"\n\nCornille asked what books \"originally kinda gave you this idea that maybe this thing could work.\"\n\n\"I can’t say that it was any one in particular,\" Paillet responded.\n\nCornille told the News-Leader he believes most of the backstory Paillet gave regarding his discovery. However, he said the DEA tried to determine the exact book that contributed to Paillet's breakthrough, but came up empty-handed.\n\n“I believe he found it in a book at SMS,\" Cornille said. \"But the swastika thing — they looked far and wide.”\n\nThe man who did the searching says it's a little more complicated than that.\n\nTerry Dal Cason retired from a 40-year-career as a forensic chemist with the DEA in 2011. He told the News-Leader that, back in the mid-1990s, his colleagues in the world of meth lab analysis didn't talk vaguely about a cook in southwest Missouri coming across a book or document with a swastika on it, as Cornille does now.\n\nInstead, Dal Cason said, they specifically mentioned a \"Nazi patent.\" Some of his colleagues stated as fact that the cook came across a patent that contained the exact recipe for Nazi dope. But Dal Cason wanted proof.\n\n\"People kept talking about this patent, and I was trying to get a copy of it,\" he said.\n\nDal Cason ended up with two theories. In 1997, he laid them out in an article for a little-known DEA publication called Microgram.\n\nTheory one:\n\nDal Cason wrote that \"one of the earliest groups\" to make Nazi dope compiled packets of documents that included instructions for the method, and hid them away from their lab sites. If the lab was busted, the hidden packets insured they'd still have a written copy of the recipe somewhere, Dal Cason wrote.\n\nWhat does that have to do with the name? \"The top page of the synthesis 'packets' was a photocopy of a drawing from the cover of a video cassette case of the Third Reich propaganda film, 'Triumph des Willens,'\" Dal Cason wrote.\n\n\"Triumph of the Will,\" the English translation of the title, was commissioned by Hitler. The drawing Dal Cason referred to shows an eagle clutching a wreath containing a swastika.\n\nDal Cason wrote in 1997 that \"it is relatively easy to postulate how the seizure of these packets could present an opportunity to misinterpret a relationship between the most recognizable of NAZI symbols and the Li (or Na)/NH3 reduction procedure contained in the packets.\"\n\n\"From this point it is easy to imagine a 'word of mouth' genesis of the 'Nazi patent' myth,\" he wrote.\n\nThe documents and court records reviewed by the News-Leader do note materials seized in connection with the investigation of Paillet and his associates, but don't mention the German propaganda film. Dal Cason told the News-Leader he didn't recall the specific individuals who apparently hid the packets. The footnotes of his Microgram article reference cases filed in federal court in 1996, years after Paillet was arrested and the Nazi dope moniker was first used.\n\nTheory two:\n\nDal Cason also asked a colleague in the United Kingdom to search German patents. Those published from 1932 to 1945 were topped with the \"Imperial Eagle,\" a coat of arms depicting an eagle perched on wreath containing a swastika (similar, but not identical, to imagery on Triumph Des Willens).\n\nLeslie King, head of the Forensic Science Service's Drugs Intelligence Laboratory, wrote Dal Cason in October 1996, and said he failed to find a patent for the technique Paillet used.\n\nThere were, however, patents that were somewhat related. Dal Cason said the packets mentioned in his first theory contained not just a recipe for the Nazi method, but also instructions for another process using methcathinone.\n\nDal Cason said King found a German patent from 1936 which provided techniques for synthesizing pseudoephedrine and ephedrine using methcathinone.\n\n\"The chemical names 'Ephedrinen' and 'Pseudoephedrine' are easily recognized among the German wording of the patent,\" Dal Cason wrote. \"Misinterpretation of the patent's content, combined with a clandestine laboratory having chemicals appropriate for the Li(Na)/NH3 method, might easily lead to the assumption that this process was described in the patent.\"\n\nTo be clear, however, the patent wasn't describing the method Paillet used. And to Dal Cason's knowledge, no one ever found a copy of the German patent in connection with a lab bust — it's something for which Dal Cason had to search.\n\nThe audience for Microgram, where Dal Cason's article appeared, was largely limited to law enforcement. An editor's note attached to the piece read: \"If anyone has hard evidence that a 'NAZI' patent does exist, please contact the Microgram editor.\" Dal Cason never heard from anyone.\n\nPoplawski, for his part, offered a third theory.\n\nIn an interview, he said Paillet \"wasn't smart enough to invent\" the method, and that he must have gotten the recipe from someone else. Poplawski also said he never heard Paillet or any of his associates use the phrases 'Nazi method\" or \"Nazi dope.\"\n\n“The first time we heard it the DEA threw it out there, and we had no idea what they were talking about,” he said.\n\nWhy does all this matter? Words stir emotion. Dan Viets — a defense attorney based in Columbia, Missouri — told the News-Leader that, by the late 1990s, prosecutors were brandishing the Nazi method moniker \"as a weapon\" in front of juries, taking advantage of the average person's extreme dislike of Nazis.\n\nViets considers the term \"obviously prejudicial,\" particularly given the the lack of an established connection between Paillet's method and actual Nazis.\n\n\"The cops liked to say that as many times as they could in a courtroom,\" he said.\n\nThe sentencing of Paillet and his associates didn't stop use of the Nazi method.\n\nInstead, the opposite occurred. The small-scale labs began to proliferate.\n\nAt first, most state and local officials, such as the average rural county sheriff's office, didn't have the training to safely deal with meth labs. Instead, they'd call the DEA. As the 1990s progressed, Cornille says he began feeling like a firefighter, rushing from small blaze to small blaze without time to investigate their causes. Instead of fires, of course, it was meth labs — although the explosions the labs sometimes prompted could end up blurring the distinction.\n\nThe Missouri State Highway Patrol, contacted by the News-Leader this fall, could only find records regarding the number of meth lab incidents in the state annually dating back to 1996. That year, according to the patrol, there were 121 labs found.\n\nThat figure increased to 319 in 1997. Then 480 in 1998. Then 615 in 1999.\n\n\"Once everything got rolling, it spread like wildfire,\" said Nick Console, who led the DEA's Springfield office for about a decade starting in 1994.\n\n(A meth lab doesn't have to be operational when it is discovered to be counted in state or federal tallies of \"meth lab incidents.\" Those tallies generally also count situations when authorities seize materials used to make meth, or find sites where lab waste material has been discarded.)\n\nCornille said he recalls Paillet telling him that he taught five people his method for Nazi dope.\n\n“My initial thought was if we could get those five, we could make an impact,\" Cornille said. \"But it didn’t work. Maybe we didn’t get one or we didn’t get to them fast enough.”\n\nConsole said he spent the mid-to-late 1990s trying to warn DEA leadership in Washington D.C. that what was happening in southwest Missouri was a serious situation, one that could get worse if unchecked. He says the leaders didn't feel a sense of urgency.\n\n\"We’re trying to tell them — it’s not heroin, it’s not cocaine,\" Console said. \"It’s not a major organization, like a biker gang, that’s producing large amounts of methamphetamine. It’s Mr. Smith and Mrs. Smith down here, and the Johnsons over here, making a half ounce. In their eyes, that wasn’t a problem. That was a local problem. It wasn’t a national problem.\"\n\nThe spread of the Nazi method meant that a drug once manufactured in large quantities by \"superlabs\" situated away from populated areas was now being produced on a small scale within towns and cities.\n\nConsole said he can tell stories all day about unusual busts.\n\nThere was the time agents executed a search warrant and noticed bullet holes in the ceiling of a bedroom. When they asked the home's resident why, the man said he knew the agents were monitoring him from his attic, so he shot at them while he laid in bed. The agents hadn't been to the house previously.\n\n“Think about being up without sleep for seven days,\" Console says. \"Think about it. Where would your mind be, where would your body be? So they’d become very paranoid.”\n\nThere was the man in Joplin whose lab exploded, the force of it enough to embed sodium metal in his skin. Sodium metal reacts when it comes in contact with water. When someone went to clean the man's body with a saline solution at the hospital, the sodium metal exploded — the \"pops\" sounding like a miniature fireworks display.\n\nThen there were the deformed chickens. Agents responded to a farm in Christian County where large tanks of anhydrous ammonia were buried in the barn. The stuff wasn't being used as fertilizer.\n\n\"He had chickens with double beaks, he had chickens that were a foot growing out of another foot,\" Console said. \"All the chemicals they were using — they were making meth there for a long time — were being dumped all over the area where the chickens were being raised.\n\nIn 1998, the man credited with pioneering the so-called \"Nazi method\" of methamphetamine production was contacted by a News-Leader reporter.\n\nBob Paillet had moved to Texas from southwest Missouri several years prior, not long after being sentenced for conspiring to manufacture and distribute the drug. He was still on probation.\n\nIt appears to be Paillet's only published interview. He expressed regret to reporter Laura Bauer.\n\n\"I never thought it would spread like this,\" he said. \" ... I don't travel in those circles anymore.\"\n\nIn the years after his arrest, Paillet also wrote several letters to — and once spoke on the phone with — John Cornille, the Drug Enforcement Administration agent who investigated him.\n\n\"I can remember him expressing remorse that he had started 'this mess,' as he referred to it,\" Cornille said.\n\nBy the turn of the new millennium, Nazi dope was no longer a Missouri-specific phenomenon.\n\nIn north Texas, the commander of an 11-county narcotics task force told a magazine in 2001 that the unit came across its first Nazi lab three years prior. By the following summer, the task force was busting one every week.\n\n\"It has exploded on the scene so quick, it's so easy to do, and there are so many people involved in manufacturing it, that it has completely overtaxed our capabilities,\" the commander said.\n\nIn Illinois, a state police representative said in November 2000 that meth labs were \"getting to the epidemic stage.\" He cited the fact that the state was on track to have 400 lab busts by the end of the year. Within four years, Illinois would be logging more than 1,500 labs annually.\n\nIn California, the Modesto Bee reported in 2000 that officials in the Central Valley had encountered eight labs using the Nazi method, and that \"five of them were traced to a man from Missouri who had moved into a trailer park near Fresno and was teaching this method.\"\n\nOfficials in numerous other communities around the country reported a version of the same thing.\n\nNick Console, the former head of Springfield's DEA office, said top agency officials did little to respond to the growth in small-scale labs in the 1990s. By the early 2000s, he said, that began to change, as politicians representing affected communities began putting pressure on the agency.\n\n“It took ‘em a good eight to 10 years,\" Console said. \"And the damage was already done, it’d already spread.”\n\nThe Nazi method didn't just spread cook to cook. Its rise coincided with the early days of the modern internet and anonymous forums like The Hive, where users traded information about illegal substances.\n\n\"There were a number of really good dope sites,\" said Terry Dal Cason, a retired DEA forensic chemist who investigated the origins of the Nazi method moniker.\n\nSince 2002, the DEA has published an annual report called the \"National Drug Threat Assessment,\" which details the prevalence of illegal drugs in the United States.\n\nEach year, the agency asks various state and local law enforcement agencies what they consider the \"greatest drug threat\" in their community. In 2003, 33.1 percent of agencies selected cocaine. Methamphetamine was second, with 31 percent.\n\nThe report stated that meth was widely available in the western and central United States and gradually becoming more available in the eastern United States. It concluded, however, that “despite the rising threat, methamphetamine is not likely to surpass the overall threat posed to the United States by powder cocaine and crack in the near term.”\n\nTwo years later, it did.\n\nThe 2005 report read: \"According to state and local law enforcement agencies, the threat associated with methamphetamine trafficking and abuse has increased sharply since 2002 and now exceeds that of any other drug.\"\n\nTo be clear, the Nazi method wasn't the only way meth consumed in America was produced. In its annual reports, the DEA largely focused on other sources.\n\nFirst, there was the foreign supply; meth was smuggled into the United States from Mexico and, to a much lesser extent, southeast Asia.\n\nThen there were the domestic \"superlabs\" — those capable of producing 10 pounds of meth in a single day. In 2001, federal authorities seized 303 of them, two-thirds of which were located in California. The California labs alone likely produced more meth than all other domestic laboratories combined, the DEA wrote.\n\nThere was regional variation, however. In 2002, the agency wrote that \"local independents account for as much as 80 percent of retail methamphetamine distribution in some areas of the country,” specifically the central United States. The Nazi method was a key process used, but there were also other recipes, like the \"Red-P\" method named for the required red phosphorous.\n\nThe DEA struggled to accurately detail the problem. In 2004, the agency wrote that meth use and distribution in the Midwest was \"very high\" in rural and suburban areas, but \"less so in metropolitan areas, where most drug consequence data are collected.\"\n\n\"Therefore, available drug consequence data for methamphetamine use in the Central States likely under-represents the problem, perhaps significantly,\" the agency wrote.\n\nSmall labs accounted for much of the drug's impact on communities, which was felt in burn units and mental health clinics, courtrooms and cemeteries. While the Nazi method simplified meth production, it didn't make it foolproof. The more labs, and the more cooks, the more opportunities for something to go wrong, and the greater the cost of cleanup.\n\nIn 2003, there were 361 reported fires and explosions at meth lab sites, and 255 law enforcement officers were injured responding, according to the DEA. The agency spent $16.3 million on laboratory cleanup that fiscal year, eight times more than it spent less than a decade earlier.\n\nThat same year, the DEA reported that 893 children were present when meth labs were seized. About two-thirds tested positive for toxic levels of chemicals in their bodies. The agency said \"child neglect and abuse are common within families whose parents or caregivers produce or use methamphetamine.\"\n\n“The devastation and the damage to kids … I understand why Bob had regret,\" Cornille said.\n\nNationwide, meth lab busts peaked in 2004, when there were nearly 24,000 seizures.\n\nAlmost 3,000 of them were in Missouri. Two years earlier, the number of meth lab busts in the state passed those in California — the birthplace of the methamphetamine industry — for the first time. Since then, Missouri has led the nation most years, never dropping below third in annual busts. In some parts of the country, the area code for southwest Missouri, 417, is said to be slang for meth, or a particular type.\n\nCornille and Console both acknowledge that if Paillet hadn't introduced the Nazi method, someone else might have done so a short time later. Just like any legal industry, there is a steady pace of innovation in the world of illegal drugs, typically in response to some government crackdown.\n\nTo combat meth in the early 2000s, laws were implemented requiring medications containing pseudoephedrine to be sold from behind the counter. In 2007, fewer than 7,000 meth labs were seized across the country.\n\nBut makers and users adjusted, developing what became known as \"one-pot\" or \"shake-and-bake\" meth production, in which just a couple of pseudoephedrine pills are mixed in a 2-liter soda bottle for smaller batches. The new method led to another spike — 15,000 national meth lab busts in 2010.\n\nConsole said he views these newer methods as just continued innovation. The Nazi method was the truly critical shift, he said — the one that turned meth consumers into producers.\n\nAfter they were sentenced for conspiring to manufacture and distribute meth, those indicted alongside Paillet struggled to stay on the right side of the law.\n\nKenneth Allen, who was given three years probation, ended up behind bars after he repeatedly tested positive for meth; he was also arrested for driving with a revoked license and failing to support his dependents.\n\nMichael Poplawski, sentenced to nearly six years in prison, later completed community service for patronizing a prostitute in the early 2000s, according to online court records. He pleaded guilty to possession of marijuana, with intent to distribute, in 2012.\n\nGary Davis, sentenced to five years in prison, briefly escaped in August 1994 from the Kansas facility where he was incarcerated. His sentence was later reduced for aiding in the prosecution of two others, but he ultimately ended up back behind bars. Davis is currently serving time in a federal penitentiary in Texas for, among other things, stealing explosive materials and conspiring to use them to rob a bank, according to a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Prisons.\n\nCourt records indicate that Paillet never violated parole. There is no evidence he got in trouble with the law during the rest of his life.\n\nPaillet found work after he moved to Texas in the mid-1990s. His youngest daughter said he was a CNC programmer, developing the programs that run automated machining equipment. His oldest daughter, however, said Paillet did sales and technical installations for a company.\n\nBy the end of the decade, health problems prompted him to go on disability, and he talked about having dystonia, a neurological disorder characterized by uncontrollable and sometimes painful muscle spasms.\n\nCourt records indicate Paillet divorced his third wife in 2008. He spent the final years of his life living with another woman in a trailer park in Sherman, a city of about 40,000 an hour north of Dallas.\n\nIn 2014, Stephanie Denton, 37, moved into the unit next to Paillet. Within a few months, she and Paillet — now in his early 70s — were drinking coffee together every morning.\n\nDenton was having issues in her relationship, and her son was having legal troubles; Paillet encouraged her to be more positive, she said. From what Denton could tell, her neighbor didn't really have close friends.\n\nPaillet didn't talk about his past very much, Denton said. She knew he was a Vietnam vet — Paillet talked about the war being pointless — and that he'd been involved with drugs to a degree. She said he claimed he'd sold drugs to raise money for a school for disabled kids.\n\nPaillet was more inclined to talk about the government, with a bent more paranoid than partisan. Denton said he repeated a well-known conspiracy theory that claims the Federal Emergency Management Agency plans to imprison citizens in camps after the imposition of martial law. Paillet's minimal online presence included posts about a group advocating for the secession of the state of Texas.\n\nPaillet also had an extensive rock collection and talked and posted online about searching for gold on a claim in Colorado. He appears to have become obsessed with the process, not unlike his days of manufacturing meth.\n\n“He first really started talking about gold mining after he was arrested,\" his oldest daughter Lisa Paillet said. \"One of the things that he was really very interested in doing was separating gold from rock, so not mining in the river, but using chemistry to remove gold from rock without requiring massive amounts of water.\"\n\nLisa said her father's health issues worsened during the final years of his life, and that he appeared to be struggling with dementia at times. In what would end up being her last conversation with her father, he talked about his will.\n\nBob Paillet didn't leave a suicide note.\n\nEarly in the afternoon of Jan. 1, 2016, the 72-year-old drove his red Dodge truck from the mobile home park where he lived in Sherman, Texas, to a nearby hospital. It was a little over a mile. Then, he took a gun — \"he had a lot of guns,\" said his daughter Gena — walked to the front of the vehicle, and shot himself in the head. He died minutes later in the emergency room.\n\nPaillet's family held a memorial service after his death. To the outside world, however, the only acknowledgement of his passing can be found on the website of a Denison, Texas, funeral home. It's not really an obituary, just a name and a pair of dates.\n\nThere's a guest book option on the site. One person — Paillet's second wife, Gena's mother — has left a message: \"We had a lot of happy years together. You will be missed. Your pain is over, ours now begins.\"\n\nOtherwise, there was nothing in the public record acknowledging that the man credited with reinventing methamphetamine production in the U.S. was dead. All in all, it probably turned out about how Paillet would have wanted it.\n\nIn 1998, he spoke briefly with a News-Leader reporter, the only time he was ever quoted in the media. At the time, meth lab busts were drastically increasing across the central United States. Authorities were blaming the phenomenon on the ease of the \"Nazi method,\" and said Paillet pioneered it while living in the Springfield area.\n\nIn that interview, Paillet expressed regret, as well as a wish regarding his future.\n\n\"I hope my name is forgotten or it's put in the back of people's minds,\" he said.\n\nPerhaps Paillet found some measure of peace. In an interview, Gena said that, while growing up, she was not allowed to talk or ask about the concept of a God around her father. In his later years, however, Bob Paillet softened on that view.\n\nIn 2008, he wrote on online message boards that \"I was an atheist, then agnostic, and now I believe that there is a God.\" He also said that he believed in evolution, and expressed a degree of incredulity that there are individuals who do not.\n\n\"He was still a scientific man, but he found his version of God,” Gena said.\n\nGena, 38, came of age in a world that her father helped create.\n\nGrowing up in Morrisville, she \"never really fit in,\" she said, and started drinking at an early age. When Gena and her mother moved to Springfield, she \"immediately just fell in with the wrong crowd.\" She graduated from Springfield's Parkview High School in 1996.\n\n\"A lot of people believe that addiction is genetic,\" Gena said. \"I am my father's daughter, not just in that way, but every way that there is.\"\n\nGena said she used meth for the first time at age 15. Two years later, she met Steven Joseph Brown, the man who would become her husband.\n\n\"He used needles, and he shot me up for the first time with heroin, and it was pretty much over from there,\" she said. \"It was always either that or meth. There was like a two-year period where I probably never slept. It’s been a struggle for me ever since.\"\n\nBrown — who died in February 2016 — was 16 years older than Gena. Prior to meeting her, he gave Gena's father precursor chemicals in exchange for meth, she said. At one point, he was even arrested by John Cornille, the Drug Enforcement Administration agent who investigated Bob.\n\n“My husband kind of ended up learning my dad’s recipe,\" Gena said. \"Not anywhere near as good as my dad.”\n\nGena, who said she grew up fearing her father, first got in trouble for drugs when she was 17. She thought her father was going to kill her. Instead, she said, he \"became my best friend ever, because we understood each other.\"\n\n\"My mom — I love my mom — she’s never done a drug in her life,\" Gena said. \"She’s had maybe one speeding ticket, and I think she even got that dismissed. Really this connection grew between him and me that was just amazing. I could really do no wrong in his eyes.”\n\nGena said that between her late teens and late 2015, she was only \"clean\" for extended periods twice, when she became pregnant. \"But I always went pretty much right back.\"\n\nIn late December 2015, Gena said, she overdosed on heroin. Gena's mother, who she lived with at the time, kicked her out of her house. Gena called her father, who paid for a motel room for a week, and indicated she should come live with him in Texas.\n\n\"He said, 'I want you to go to your parole officer and start getting everything transferred down here and I want you to come back here,' and he said, 'I will get you through this,'\" Gena said.\n\nTwo days later, she got the call that her father was dead.\n\nGena said she traveled to Texas to attend her father's memorial service, but got in a dispute with the woman Bob was living with at the time of his death, and ended up leaving beforehand (Lisa Paillet described her half-sister as \"high as a kite\" at the time). Gena expressed regret that she didn't receive something her father wanted her to have — \"this metal container thing that his very first successful batch of stuff was made in.”\n\nIn August, Gena said she put herself through treatment after returning from Bob's memorial service. She said she had been clean since Jan. 25.\n\n\"It really hurts me that my dad never got to see me get my life together,\" she said.\n\nBy November, however, Gena was back in a three-week rehab program. She attributed the relapse to her depression, and said she \"wasn’t managing it with medication like I should have been.\" In early May, she said she had stayed clean since completing the program.\n\n\"It’s still hard a lot of days,\" Gena said. \"And it’s hard to stay away from the people that kind of want to push it on you.”\n\nLisa Paillet, who asked that her first name be changed for this story, graduated in 1991 from then-Southwest Missouri State University with a degree in theater — which she said her father \"paid for, I’m pretty sure, with drug money.\"\n\nShe returned to California, where she grew up, and gradually drifted away from theater-related work. When her father, then on probation in Texas, found a job that made machining equipment, he paid for her to go to school to get a machinist's certification. She was hired by a company she described as being in the military aerospace research sector, which paid for her to get a bachelor's degree in engineering.\n\n“That’s when our conversations about science really took off, and we would talk for long periods of time,” she said of her father.\n\nRegarding her sister, she said Gena's \"world is very, very different from mine.”\n\n“He and Gena had a very, very different relationship than he and I had ... I think he treated her far more like a child than he ever treated me,\" Lisa said. \"And because he didn’t really raise me, he didn’t have rules for me … I think even though I went down his road a little bit when I was very young, I think my upbringing with my mother definitely was not the same.”\n\nLisa said her father's decision to take his own life wasn't entirely unexpected. Suicide was something he mentioned casually over the years, she said.\n\n\"He knew he was going to commit suicide if he ever got too sick, and I knew it a long time ago,\" Lisa said.\n\nBob Paillet's parents died in the 1980s. They are buried in a cemetery in Exeter, Missouri, where they lived and where Bob spent his high school years.\n\nLisa said her father, who became obsessed with gold mining in the later years of his life, requested his ashes be scattered at his gold claim. However, she's has been unable to find it. When Lisa called Colorado, she was told he didn't have a claim in the state.\n\nThough Paillet appears to have avoided run-ins with the law late in life, the process he pioneered continued to occupy authorities.\n\nSome states responded to the rise in small-scale meth labs by requiring prescriptions for purchase of products containing pseudoephedrine.\n\nMissouri didn't, but over time dozens of communities within the state instituted their own prescription laws. City leaders in Springfield debated doing the same in 2013, but the effort wasn't without controversy.\n\nThat fall, Councilwoman Cindy Rushefsky — a former prosecutor who supported the measure — asked Springfield's police chief to provide monthly reports detailing meth lab activity in the city. She pitched it as a way for council to stay informed on the issue. Councilman Doug Burlison, a libertarian who opposed the prescription requirement, described it as \"an attempt to educate us to have different opinions.\"\n\nThen a funny thing happened. The police chief's monthly reports consistently described fewer and fewer meth labs being found in the city. In July 2014, the prescription bill was tabled indefinitely.\n\nThe situation wasn't unique to Springfield. The number of small meth labs seized in the United States has declined in recent years, from about 15,000 in 2010 to about 4,500 in 2016.\n\nIt's not that the drug has lost its presence in the United States. Last year, when state and local law enforcement agencies were asked to name the greatest drug threat in their area, heroin received the most votes. The agencies that selected it, however, were strongly concentrated in the Great Lakes and northeast regions of the United States. In the western part of the country, more agencies chose meth.\n\nMost of that meth is produced in Mexico and smuggled across the border.\n\nIn a 2016 report, the DEA attributed the decline in domestic labs to the wide availability of high-purity, high-potency meth from Mexico, as well as the passage of the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act, a federal law enacted in 2006 which placed restrictions on the meth precursors ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine.\n\nNick Console, who spent about a decade as the top DEA official in Springfield, said Paillet's Nazi method may have prompted the cartels to become more involved with production of meth.\n\n\"Why? Because you had a huge addiction problem here in the United States to methamphetamine,\" he said. \"Supply and demand.”\n\nConsole retired to a farm in Ash Grove. John Cornille, the DEA agent most involved with investigating Paillet, still works for the agency.\n\nMike Poplawski — who was taught the Nazi method by Paillet himself — has served his prison sentence. He understands how the statute of limitations works, double jeopardy and all that.\n\nAsk him about the early days of Nazi dope, however, and he chooses his words carefully. He's convinced that saying certain things could get the DEA interested in him again. He says he's been at the same job for 15 years, together with his wife for 25 years.\n\n\"I’ve got grandkids that love me, step-kids that love me, extended family that love me,\" he said. \"You look from the other side — the law enforcement side — I’m a bad man.”\n\nIn an interview in his Springfield home, Poplawski, 59, said the people he considers meth's Nazi dope generation are \"all in jail or dead,\" and that those currently involved with the drug aren't self-starters. He voiced frustration at seeing \"bangers shooting each other, shooting up neighborhoods, doing dope and falling asleep in their cars with the kids in the cars and s---- like that.\"\n\n\"I want to go around with a .22 starter pistol and start capping people,\" he said. \"I can still find the houses. They’re not the same houses. But a speeder can always recognize another speeder.\"\n\nAsked about his own actions, Poplawski said \"if I knew then what I knew now, I would’ve done things different.\"\n\n\"I like to think that I had the ability to make a change,\" he said.\n\nAt the same time, he said, \"there's always going to be an addiction.\"\n\n\"The hole’s always there,\" Poplawski said. \"And once it got filled by meth, we had the meth crisis ... Now you’ve got [a] prescription drug crisis and you’ve got [a] heroin crisis hard. Meth’s bad. I don’t think heroin’s an improvement.\"\n\nReached at a federal prison in Texas, Gary Davis — the only other individual indicted alongside Paillet still living — declined to be interviewed without compensation. In a brief email, he did include one comment.\n\n\"Meth is a scourge on society,\" Davis wrote. \"I wish I would have never messed with it.\"\n\nPaillet expressed similar sentiments years before his death.\n\n\"I wish I never started it,\" he told a News-Leader reporter in 1998. \"I would never do it again.\"\n\n\"I caused a lot of trouble with a lot of people.\"\n\nHow we reported this story\n\nReporter Thomas Gounley began working on this story in the wake of Bob Paillet’s death in January 2016.\n\nThe events leading to the arrest of Paillet and his co-conspirators are detailed in federal court records. Additional information regarding Paillet was obtained from the Drug Enforcement Administration through a Freedom of Information Act request.\n\nInterviews with Paillet’s family members and one-time associates, along with current and retired law enforcement personnel, were conducted between August 2016 and May 2017. One of Paillet’s daughters, citing concerns regarding how this story could affect future job prospects, agreed to be interviewed on the condition that her first name be replaced with a pseudonym. Editors agreed to that request.\n\nThe photos of Bob Paillet in this story were provided by his daughters. Booking photos of those indicted alongside Paillet were obtained from the Greene County Archives and Records Center. Center staff said they did not have a booking photo of Paillet himself.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/05/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/07/08/state-cheese-awol-animals-editor-jailed-news-around-states/117415210/", "title": "State cheese, AWOL animals: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Legislative leaders are continuing to discuss prison construction and renovation alternatives, including whether pandemic relief funds can be used to offset costs or renovating and building prisons. Key lawmakers say they expect to continue discussions this month in advance of a possible special session later in the year. “I think the House and Senate are pretty close to an agreement,” said Rep. Steve Clouse, who chairs the House General Fund budget committee. “The vast majority of legislators want to move forward with a bond proposal and for us to own the prisons.” Clouse and Sen. Greg Albritton, chairman of the Senate General Fund budget committee, said a topic under discussion is whether federal funds from the American Rescue Plan may be used to offset some of the costs or do renovations. States can use that money for a wide range of uses to contend with the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Albritton said the state is trying to get clarity on “what can we do with the recovery money.” Lawmakers are looking for more options after Gov. Kay Ivey’s plan to rent prisons, which would be run by the state but built and owned by private companies, fell apart because of financing concerns. However, federal officials have been clear that new facilities will not solve the state’s prison woes.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A wildfire burned close to a vacation destination Tuesday, but fire officials believed Chena Hot Springs Resort would be spared. “They’re pretty confident that they’re going to be able to defend the resort, based on the measures that we’ve set up and the personnel we have on scene,” said Tim Mowry, a spokesperson for the Alaska Division of Forestry. Firefighters were working to protect the resort, homes and recreational cabins in the area of interior Alaska about 60 miles northeast of Fairbanks. Flames were about 100 yards from the resort, where crews were spraying water on buildings, the agency said in a statement. Firefighters also conducted a back burn near a trail that leads to two yurts for viewing the northern lights in hopes it would help stop the fire from advancing toward the main buildings. Hoses and sprinklers also were set up at nearby homes and cabins. No structures in the Chena Hot Springs area had burned, fire officials said. Light showers that fell overnight weren’t enough to put out the fire, but the increased humidity was helping to slow its growth. The Fairbanks North Star Borough on Monday issued a voluntary evacuation order. Alaska State Troopers conducted a survey of homeowners and cabin users and found that about 30 people decided not to leave, along with resort owner Bernie Karl.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: Officials in the city plan to ignore Arizona’s new “Second Amendment sanctuary” law that bars state and local governments from enforcing certain federal gun regulations, possibly setting up a court fight as a growing number of cities and counties in the United States declare themselves similar firearm havens. The move by Democratic Mayor Regina Romero and the City Council again puts Tucson and the Republican-led state at odds over how to regulate gun sales and use. The southern Arizona city has long tried to enforce gun laws stricter than the state’s, including mandating background checks for guns purchased on city property and destroying seized firearms. Over the years, those measures have been challenged after the Republican-controlled Legislature enacted laws barring the actions. The new action came after GOP Gov. Doug Ducey signed a bill in April declaring that Arizona is a so-called Second Amendment sanctuary. It was partly a response to the election of President Joe Biden, who has vowed to enact tighter firearms regulations. In a growing movement, at least 1,200 local governments have declared themselves sanctuaries insulated from state and federal gun laws since 2018, when high-profile mass shootings prompted calls for stronger regulations. Many are symbolic, but some carry legal force.\n\nArkansas\n\nBeebe: The Rev. Al Sharpton and attorneys for George Floyd’s family on Tuesday mourned a white Arkansas teenager fatally shot by a sheriff’s deputy, as they urged support across racial lines for efforts to reform police practices. Sharpton eulogized 17-year-old Hunter Brittain, who was shot and killed by a white Lonoke County sheriff’s deputy, Sgt. Michael Davis, during a traffic stop June 23 near Cabot, about 30 miles northeast of Little Rock. The killing in the predominantly white community has drawn the attention of national civil rights activists such as Sharpton, who said concerns about police tactics aren’t just limited to the Black community. “The issue of policing is not about Black and white,” Sharpton told a packed auditorium at Beebe High School, where Brittain was a rising senior. “It’s about right and wrong.” Many attending the memorial wore jeans and shirts that read “Justice for Hunter.” Lonoke County Sheriff John Staley last week fired Davis for not turning on his body camera until after he had shot Brittain. Staley said the only footage police have is from the aftermath. Arkansas State Police are investigating Brittain’s death. Authorities have released few details about the shooting. Brittain’s family has said the teenager was unarmed and was holding a jug of antifreeze when he was shot.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: State lawmakers will wait until next year to continue considering a bill that would give opioid users a place to inject drugs in supervised settings, the bill’s author said Tuesday. State Sen. Scott Wiener, D-San Francisco, said he was told the Assembly Health Committee will delay a hearing on his bill until January. The measure would allow Los Angeles, Oakland, San Francisco and Los Angeles County to start programs giving people a place to inject drugs while trained staff are available to help if they suffer accidental overdoses. “Safe consumption sites are a proven strategy to save lives and help people into recovery,” Wiener said. Currently the sites are illegal in the United States but legal in Canada. Wiener’s bill barely cleared the Senate in April. The Senate Republican Caucus said in a statement at the time that the bill would “establish taxpayer-staffed and funded drug dens.” The proposal is opposed by some law enforcement groups, but Wiener said in a statement that it “is very much alive, albeit delayed.” Wiener noted he was disappointed in another delay at a time when he said San Francisco and other cities are experiencing record overdose deaths. His bill would require workers at the centers to try to get users into drug treatment programs or refer them to medical or mental health care or social services programs.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The Denver Zoo will begin vaccinating some of its animals against COVID-19 as early as next week. Zoologists say they have been working with the veterinary vaccine company Zoetis to receive doses for the animals, and primates and carnivores will be first on the list. The veterinary vaccine, which is formulated primarily for mammals, is being developed separate from the ones for human use. Transmission is rare between humans and other species, but there have been several documented cases of COVID-19 in large cats, monkeys and certain rodent populations. “We know some of those animals – like gorillas and tigers, mink, otters – can all be infected. But for a lot of these others, we don’t know what the susceptibility is,” Dr. Scott Larsen, the zoo’s vice president of animal health, told KMGH-TV. “For animals, we want to be able to protect them similar to (how) we’re trying to protect people.” Veterinary scientists do not think common house pets like cats or dogs are in significant danger of catching COVID-19. “There are 85 million dogs in the United States and 90 million cats,” said Dr. Kevin Fitzgerald, a veterinarian at VCA Alameda East Veterinary in Denver. “If we were going to see problems … I think we would be seeing it.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nGuilford: The state’s newest climate change legislation should put it in a good position to receive millions of dollars in anticipated federal funds to help foot the bill for expensive resiliency projects needed across Connecticut, Gov. Ned Lamont and other state officials said Tuesday. Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Commissioner Katie Dykes said the $30 million in bonding included in the new state budget to help municipalities identify and plan for such projects, including green infrastructure, will also give Connecticut a leg up on other states. “We’ll be shovel-ready. We’ll be at the front of the line,” Dykes said during a bill-signing event at a beach in Guilford. “It’s going to take a lot of dollars to help protect our communities from the impacts of climate change. And the best way to do that, dollars we really want to put to work, are federal dollars.” Curt Johnson, president of the environmental group Save the Sound, predicted Connecticut will receive $3 or $4 in federal funds for every $1 the state spends on these resiliency efforts. The new law gives all cities and towns, not just certain ones, the ability to establish stormwater authorities. Additionally, the law expands the duties of the 10-year-old Connecticut Green Bank, a first-in-the-nation entity.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Two deadly species of hemlock have been found in Delaware, and the state’s Department of Agriculture is warning people to avoid plants that look like wild carrots to prevent the possibility of being poisoned. Environmental scientists confirmed that poison hemlock and spotted water hemlock were located in Sussex County wetlands, according to a news release from the agency. Both plants have small white flowers and bloom between June and August. Poison hemlock also grows in meadows, pastures and ditches. The invasive plant can reach between 6 and 8 feet tall and has a hairless stem with purple blotches. The department said this type of hemlock releases an odor but shouldn’t be crushed to smell because toxic oils can be emitted. Spotted water hemlock is a native plant and can grow up to 6 feet tall. Its stems vary in color from solid green or purple to green with purple spots or stripes, and it has fern-like leaves. People who think they found either plant can email pictures to DDA.Marketing@delaware.gov for identification. The Agriculture Department said residents shouldn’t try to eradicate the hemlocks themselves and should instead find a licensed aquatic pest control company to treat them. It also advised against mowing the plants, which can release toxic particles into the air.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Parking in the nation’s capital is often a nightmare for residents and especially for their guests, but D.C. has launched an easier visitor parking pass program, WUSA-TV reports. When the visitor parking pass was launched in 2013, it was met with widespread opposition. With the new program, people can register for the annual pass allowing their guests to park for two hours in a residential permit parking zone in all eight wards. “The intent of the system is to make getting a visitor parking permit easier and also to reduce parking congestion in residential areas,” said Everett Lott, acting director for the District Department of Transportation. The new online parking portal now allows people to print out their own parking permits for visitors and can be accessed through the portal provided by D.C. online or through an app on Apple or Android phones. “This particular system, the automated system, is connected to the resident and to the license plate,” Lott said. “So it makes it a lot more user-friendly but also helps to eliminate any of the abuse that was possible in the past.” Parking permits, which must be displayed prominently on the windshield of vehicles, can be printed at home, at D.C. Public Library branches, or at kiosks at DDOT Headquarters, the DDOT Permit Office and Metropolitan Police Department precincts.\n\nFlorida\n\nTampa: A couple is suing a Catholic school and demanding the return of a large donation, saying it isn’t adhering to Catholic values because of the way it’s handling issues like race and accepting the LGBTQ community. Anthony and Barbara Scarpo filed their lawsuit against the Academy of the Holy Names last month after one of their daughters graduated and a second transferred to another school, the Tampa Bay Times reports. The lawsuit comes four years after the couple pledged $1.35 million to the school, which named its theater for the family. The couple claims the school has “lost its way” by distancing itself from mainstream Catholicism and embracing a “woke culture” in which priority is given to “gender identity, human sexuality and pregnancy termination among other hot button issues.” The suit also takes issue with a blackboard in a common area that explains how to be an ally to the LGBTQ community, as well as how the school takes on the issue of race, saying white students are made to feel guilty. The Scarpos had paid $240,000 toward the pledge as of 2018, the lawsuit said. The school didn’t discuss details of the suit, but spokeswoman Emily Wise told the Times in an email that the school’s curriculum is based on Catholic values.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A federal judge on Wednesday declined to block some challenged sections of Georgia’s new election law ahead of two runoff elections next week, but he didn’t rule out the possibility for future elections. Election integrity activists had asked U.S. District Judge J.P. Boulee to prohibit the state from enforcing sections of the new law that have to do with observation of elections, as well as a new deadline for requesting absentee ballots. Their request arose from one of eight federal lawsuits challenging the new law. The Republican-backed overhaul of election rules enacted this year has been blasted by Democrats and others who say it creates unnecessary obstacles to voting, particularly for people of color. Most of the lawsuits, including one filed last month by the U.S. Department of Justice, challenge the parts of law that critics say threaten voting rights. The targeted request that led to Wednesday’s ruling, though, focused on provisions mostly related to monitoring or photographing parts of the election process. The activists, led by the Coalition for Good Governance, said those sections criminalize normal election observation activities and could intimidate voters, election observers and members of the news media. A tighter absentee ballot request deadline makes it virtually impossible to get one for a runoff, they argue.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Lawmakers on Tuesday overrode Gov. David Ige’s veto of a bill that overhauls how the state funds the Hawaii Tourism Authority and allocates tourism tax revenue to the counties. The bill would stop funding the tourism agency with money raised by the transient accommodations tax on hotel stays and other short-term rentals. Instead, lawmakers intend to pay for the agency with money from the general fund, though for the current fiscal year they appropriated federal coronavirus relief funds. Further, instead of providing the state’s four major counties with a share of transient accommodations tax revenue, the legislation gives the counties the authority to levy their own surcharge to the tax. Currently, the state charges one uniform hotel tax rate across the islands. Sen. Bennette Misalucha, vice chair of the Senate’s Energy, Economic Development, and Tourism Committee, said special funds shouldn’t be protected for the benefit of one industry. She said the Legislature brought special funds like hotel tax revenue into the general fund to stop this practice. The Hawaii Tourism Authority will now be required to get support from lawmakers for its budget just like other state agencies, she said, which will require the agency to be more forthcoming with its strategic plans and force more communication between the agency and lawmakers.\n\nIdaho\n\nCoeur d’Alene: High housing prices in northern Idaho are making it difficult to attract police officers, law enforcement officials say. Coeur d’Alene Police Capt. Dave Hagar told the Coeur d’Alene Press that low crime rates and an outdoor lifestyle are big draws but that skyrocketing housing prices are turning people away. “Five years ago, the cost of living in Coeur d’Alene was much more reasonable,” Hagar said. “Now it’s gone above that.” The Coeur d’Alene Association of Realtors said the median residential home sale price was $476,000 in March. That’s a 47% increase from a year ago. Kootenai County Sheriff Bob Norris said his agency has recruited new hires only to have them decline the job after discovering they couldn’t afford housing. “It’s a significant barrier,” he said. “The housing situation is severe.” The agency is looking to hire deputies, dispatchers, control room operators, clerks and jail staff. “We’re going to have to attract local candidates,” Norris said. “We can’t do that when some of our pay is $14 or $15 an hour.” Kootenai County Commissioner Bill Brooks said other county agencies are also having a hard time finding and retaining workers. Wages once considered normal are now not enough.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The city’s schools will encourage student COVID-19 vaccinations ahead of the start of the school year with school-based vaccination sites and events, officials announced Wednesday. Officials with the nation’s third-largest school district plan to offer full in-person instruction in the fall and want to vaccinate as many students as possible before classes begin next month. District officials said they are “not in a position” to mandate COVID-19 shots but will ask families to submit COVID-19 vaccine documents, as is the practice with other immunizations. Starting next week, the district will offer vaccines at three school sites for students and their families. The sites will be able to administer 600 doses weekly. The district is also working with hospitals for events in areas with low inoculation rates and offering the shots at back-to-school events. “Schools are trusted pillars of our communities, and as a district we are uniquely suited to help expand vaccination opportunities, which helps create the safest possible learning environments at our schools,” said Jose M. Torres, interim schools CEO. More than 50,000 children under the age of 18 have already been vaccinated in Chicago, according to the city’s Department of Public Health. Roughly 350,000 students attend Chicago Public Schools.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: As federal officials debate pouring billions of dollars into broadband access, data suggests many of Indiana’s schoolchildren and adults who preferred to work from home spent the pandemic with subpar access to high-speed internet, particularly in the state’s least-wealthy counties. In about half of Indiana’s counties – 47 of 92 – measured by a Federal Communications Commission study, broadband access is available to at least 79% of residents. Yet in about half of the state measured by Microsoft – 47 of 92 counties – no more than 22% of households actually have high-speed access, a USA TODAY analysis shows. President Joe Biden and a bipartisan group of Senate moderates have reached a deal on a far-reaching infrastructure plan that would direct $65 billion to increase broadband connectivity from coast to coast. Despite the agreement, it’s unclear whether it would address the solutions some lawmakers want to see such as continued broadband subsidies for low-income families, greater competition among wireless providers, and continued buildout of high-speed networks in poorer, rural areas. In Indiana, 12.4% of residents don’t have adequate broadband infrastructure, and 48.4% live in areas with only one internet provider, according to the White House.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: A teenager injured in an accident on an amusement ride that killed his younger brother remained on life support Wednesday as he turned 16, his family pastor said. David Jaramillo has been in a medically induced coma at Blank Children’s Hospital since Saturday’s accident on the Raging River at Adventureland Park in Altoona, pastor Christian Shields said. David has some brain function and has woken up a couple times at the Des Moines hospital, opening his eyes and asking what happened, he said. He remains hooked up to breathing machines, but doctors are hoping to wean him off life support, Shields said. The pastor at Christian Life Church in Cedar Rapids said it’s a miracle that David is alive after being pinned underneath a boat in water for several minutes. The church, which planned a prayer vigil for the family Wednesday night, is sponsoring a GoFundMe page that has raised $30,000. Friends have brought balloons to the hospital for David’s birthday, but “there won’t be a lot of celebrating,” Shields said. The Jaramillo family, of Marion, Iowa, went to Adventureland on Saturday to celebrate David’s upcoming birthday. The junior at Linn-Mar High School had been excited about getting his driver’s license as a step toward freedom and adulthood, Shields said.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly has expanded the paid leave that state employees can take from their jobs when they become parents or act as caregivers. Kelly issued an executive order Tuesday that provides an extra two weeks of paid leave for state workers who are a child’s primary caregiver and an extra week for secondary caregivers. The order also makes foster parents eligible for the same paid leave. Primary caregivers will now receive up to eight weeks of paid leave, rather than six. Secondary caregivers will receive four weeks instead of three. The order directed the state Department of Administration to put the new policies into effect immediately. Kelly said the state is demonstrating a commitment to recruiting and keeping talented workers and creating a “supportive environment for our families.” “Supporting working parents in our workforce is not only the right thing to do,” Kelly said in a statement. “It’s good for our economy.” The order also says new state employees become eligible for paid leave after 180 days.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: After years of planning and public input, the construction phase of the Sherman Minton Bridge rehabilitation project will soon be underway. The Sherman Minton Renewal project team said Tuesday that it will begin working on ramp improvements next week. The improvements “are being made to prepare for the first phase of the rehabilitation, which will include the first half of eastbound construction on the lower deck and painting of the bridge trusses,” according to a news release. According to the team, ramp shoulders at the Interstates 65 and 265 interchange, as well as the Interstates 64 and 265 interchange, will be modified to accommodate additional traffic. The modification process will take one to two weeks, the team said, and “will require nighttime lane closures and/or ramp closures to construct.” After the ramp improvements are completed, traffic will be reduced to two lanes in each direction as the team works on painting and deck replacement preparations. When lanes are restricted, I-65 and I-265 will serve as a detour route, the team said. The Sherman Minton, which spans the Ohio River to connect the Bluegrass and Hoosier states, is 59 years old. The proposal to rehabilitate the double-decker bridge was announced in 2018. The price tag for the project is roughly $137 million.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Authorities say they’ve been searching for a 12-foot python that escaped from its enclosure inside the state’s largest shopping mall. Cara, a yellow and white Burmese python, slithered out of its enclosure at the Blue Zoo in the Mall of Louisiana in Baton Rouge on Tuesday, news outlets report. She was still on the loose early Wednesday morning, WBRZ-TV reports, after a search overnight, when such snakes are most active. “While we’ve created a very secure home for Cara, our Burmese Python, she has slithered out of her exhibit,” the Blue Zoo said in a statement. “Cara is a non-poisonous, friendly snake that enjoys her time interacting with guests during our Snake Education Shows.” Pythons slowly squeeze their prey to death before swallowing them. Cara was described as “very sweet” by her handlers, who released a photo of the animal. The Blue Zoo – which bills itself as “more than an aquarium, more than a zoo” – was closed Tuesday while search efforts continued, but the Mall of Louisiana remained open.\n\nMaine\n\nBangor: Enrollment in public schools across the state dropped by 4.4%, nearly 8,000 students, between the 2019-20 and 2020-21 school years, according to Maine Department of Education data. Most of those students transitioned to home schooling, which saw an increase of 5,000 students, according to department data. School systems expect many students to return for the 2021-22 school year, Bangor Daily News reports. According to an Education Week report, Maine had the fourth-highest decrease in the nation behind Vermont’s 5.3% decrease, Mississippi’s 5% drop and New Hampshire’s 4.7% decline. Steve Bailey, executive director at Maine School Management Association, said the change reflects concerns from parents about safety during the pandemic and child care challenges. The most significant decrease was in prekindergarten and kindergarten students, for whom the population decreased by 16%, compared to a 3% decrease in all other students.\n\nMaryland\n\nCollege Park: Teenagers will be entered to win $50,000 college scholarships if they get vaccinated against COVID-19 in the state’s latest incentive program offered to encourage as many people as possible to get the shots. Gov. Larry Hogan announced the new lottery program Wednesday at the University of Maryland, College Park. Twenty Marylanders between the ages of 12 and 17 will win scholarships worth $50,000 each between now and Labor Day. The program will give away a total of $1 million in scholarships or the equivalent of full tuition and fees at one of Maryland’s public universities. Winners who choose to attend college out of state can transfer the scholarship to the school of their choice, Hogan said. The program will begin Monday and continue through Labor Day. Teens who have been vaccinated in Maryland are eligible and will be automatically entered, the governor said. Winners will be chosen using the same process as “VaxCash,” a lottery for adults that recently ended. That program awarded a total of $2 million in prizes to Marylanders 18 and older who had received a COVID-19 vaccine at any time. The scholarship prizes will be deposited into college savings accounts with Maryland 529.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nTopsfield: A more than 200-year-old agricultural fair canceled last year because of the pandemic is scheduled to return this fall, organizers announced Wednesday. The 11-day Topsfield Fair, first held in 1818, will start Oct. 1, the Essex Agricultural Society said in a statement. “Having to cancel last year’s Topsfield Fair due to the COVID-19 pandemic was devastating,” General Manager James O’Brien said. “We are thrilled to announce that the fair will return this year with no restrictions, and we look forward to seeing everyone on the fairgrounds in October.” The fair was previously canceled for three years during World War II and in 1918 because of an influenza pandemic. Based on attendance in 1946 after the three-year shutdown, O’Brien said he expects high attendance this fall. In anticipation, fair personnel have installed extra sinks and hand-sanitizing stations around the fairgrounds north of Boston, he said. One of the fair’s most popular events is the giant pumpkin contest, but it also includes livestock exhibits, a midway, vendors, food stalls and live music. It typically draws up to 500,000 visitors per year. A schedule for concerts, which are free with fair admission, will be announced soon.\n\nMichigan\n\nRoseville: CARE of Southeastern Michigan is hosting a free, two-week day camp for kids whose family members struggle with addiction. Open for children in preschool through eighth grade, Camp CARE will address communicating effectively, managing emotions, dealing with change, choosing friends wisely, resisting peer pressure and more. The skills are taught through hands-on activities like arts, crafts and games, said CARE director of substance use prevention Kaitlin Maloziec. The Roseville fire and police departments will also visit the camp for a teaching segment in the city about 15 miles northeast of Detroit. “It’s just a spot where kids can be kids, make friendships and see that they’re not alone,” Maloziec said. The camp will be held at Fountain Elementary in Roseville from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. July 19-23 and July 26-30. Zoom sessions for parents and caregivers will teach adults some of the same skills as the youth, along with parenting tips and advice on how to talk about addiction and address kids’ questions. The camp, which Maloziec said has been around for more than two decades, is hosting up to 60 students this year. Most activities will be held outdoors, with mask-wearing required and lunch provided. Registration is available online and closes at 11:45 p.m. Friday.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: With COVID-19 limits fading away, tourists are returning to Minnesota resorts, many of them from neighboring states. But a lot of employees are not coming back. The worker shortage has been building for more than a year, said Ben Wogsland, a spokesman for Hospitality Minnesota, the trade association for the state’s hotels, restaurants, resorts and campgrounds. The industry is down about 50,000 workers from its normal summer level of 280,000 to 290,000 workers. Many of them found other jobs during the first COVID-19 shutdown, and others left when a second hospitality shutdown was ordered, the Star Tribune reports. “After last year, we were hopeful that things would get back to normal,” said Sue Dutcher, manager of the St. Croix River Resort in Hinckley. Instead, “we’re being run ragged.” In Detroit Lakes, Joanne Anderson faces a similar challenge at the Forest Hills Resort. Anderson manages Izzo’s, the resort’s bar and restaurant, and is running it with eight workers instead of the usual 20. Some operators have been fortunate enough to escape the labor shortage. The Trail Center Lodge on the Gunflint Trail is “100% staffed,” according to owner Sarah Hamilton. That’s partly due to a new program that brings young adults from the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota to work at businesses on the North Shore.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Farmers in the state are losing the catfish wars against their foreign competitors with the very weapon they saw as their salvation. The domestic catfish industry, along with lawmakers including the late U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran of Mississippi, lobbied to move oversight of catfish processing from the Food and Drug Administration to the U.S. Department of Agriculture five years ago with the expectation the USDA’s stricter eye would limit the foreign imports that had decimated domestic production throughout the Mississippi Delta. Instead, imports of siluriformes – the larger category of catfish and catfish-like fish sometimes referred to by their family name, “pangasius” – have only increased since the switch to the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service in 2016. Meanwhile, domestic prices and production, mainly in Mississippi and other Southern states, have continued to decline. Almost 65,000 additional tons of catfish were imported in 2019 compared to 2015 before the Food Safety and Inspection Service took over, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Marine Fisheries Service. The Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce lists recent processing volumes at 5 million pounds per month less than in 2015 during FDA oversight.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Seventeen more people in southwest Missouri died from COVID-19 in a two-week period ending Sunday as the coronavirus continues to surge in the region, officials said. The deaths were recorded in the two-week reporting period from June 21 to July 4 and were disclosed Tuesday by the Springfield-Greene County Health Department, the Kansas City Star reports. The dead ranged in age from their 40s to 90s, and none of those who died was fully vaccinated, health officials said. Republican Gov. Mike Parson on Wednesday told reporters that his administration has done “everything possible” to fend off outbreaks. Missouri has reported nearly 530,000 cases of the virus and 9,375 deaths since the pandemic began. The state has administered more than 5 million doses, with 44.9% of the population getting at least one. Parson said he’s focused on encouraging people to get inoculated and making the shots available to them. He said he’s still wary of incentivizing vaccinations with prizes. “Right now, the vaccine’s out there,” Parson said. “I mean, people walk past it every day, whether they’re in a pharmacy, whether they’re in a Walmart, whether they’re in a health center.” Parson also on Wednesday signed a bill into law to limit lawsuits against companies for wrongdoing related to the pandemic.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Wildlife officials were searching by ground and from the air Wednesday for a grizzly bear that killed a woman who was camping. A helicopter was flying over the area around the small town of Ovando, in western Montana, in pursuit of the bear, which will be killed if found, Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks spokesperson Greg Lemon said. Large traps made out of culverts were set around the area in hopes of capturing the bruin. Ovando, about 60 miles northwest of Helena, is a community of fewer than 100 people at the edge of the sprawling Bob Marshall wilderness. Long-distance bicyclists such as the victim often spend the night in the town. Powell County Sheriff Gavin Roselles said the bear wandered into the victim’s camping area a couple of times before Tuesday’s fatal mauling. Someone at the scene used bear spray, and other campers called 911, Roselles said. Roselles closed down any camping in Ovando as the search for the bear continued, following creeks leading away from the town. Further circumstances surrounding the attack were under investigation. Officials said their priority was to find and kill the bear to prevent another dangerous encounter.\n\nNebraska\n\nNiobrara: A tomahawk once owned by Chief Standing Bear, a pioneering Native American civil rights leader, is returning to his Nebraska tribe after decades in a museum at Harvard. The university’s Peabody Museum of Archaeology & Ethnology said it’s been working with members of the Ponca Tribe in Nebraska and Oklahoma to repatriate the artifact. Larry Wright Jr., chairman of the Ponca Tribe of Nebraska, said Tuesday that the return of the historic weapon is a powerful symbol of homecoming for the tribe, which was among many forcibly relocated from their homelands to other territories by the federal government in the 1800s. Standing Bear was arrested 1878 for leaving the tribe’s reservation in order to fulfill a promise he made to bury his eldest son back in their tribe’s homeland in the Niobrara River Valley. In his landmark federal trial, he successfully argued for the recognition of Native Americans as persons entitled to rights and protection under law. “That hand is not the color of yours. But if you pierce it, I shall feel pain,” Standing Bear famously said in court. “The blood that will flow from mine will be the same color as yours. I am a man. The same God made us both.” Wright said the tribe is preparing its own museum, located near Standing Bear’s grave, to properly display the tomahawk and other artifacts.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A 110-acre property at the south end of the Las Vegas Strip has been purchased to be the site for a terminal station for a planned new high-speed passenger rail line between Las Vegas and Southern California. Brightline Holdings announced the purchase Tuesday without announcing the price, but local news outlets report that Clark County records indicate the purchase by the holding company for Brightline West closed Thursday for $140 million. The site is on the west side of Las Vegas Boulevard across from Premium Outlets South mall and near McCarran International Airport. Company officials have said Brightline West trains would carry up to 500 passengers at speeds up to 200 mph on the planned route between Las Vegas and Victorville, California. The project has been delayed over the years, most recently because of the pandemic.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Plans to close the state’s youth detention center are quickly taking shape, with a consultant due to submit a preliminary report in the next two weeks. The two-year state budget Gov. Chris Sununu signed June 25 includes a mandate to close the Sununu Youth Services Center in Manchester by March 2023. But the state Department of Health and Human Services didn’t wait for lawmakers and the governor to act; it signed a $55,000 contract with Alvarez & Marsal Public Sector Services of Washington, D.C., on June 8. The contract, paid for with federal pandemic aid, requires the consultants to deliver a draft closure plan by mid-July and a final report by August. According to details submitted to the governor’s Executive Council last week, the department didn’t have time to solicit bids given the time-sensitive work but consulted with stakeholders before hiring the firm. Health and Human Services Commissioner Lori Shibinette told the council she met with advocates for juvenile justice, including the Disability Rights Center and the Office of the Child Advocate. “We have this opportunity to build the right-sized program on a clinical model instead of a detention model. So I brought the advocates together to say, ‘What is your ideal model?’ ” she said. “They said they weren’t qualified and that I should hire a consultant. So that is what I did.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nBridgewater: The pandemic that closed restaurant dining rooms last year also put a stop to food tours. But with eateries up and running again, food tours are starting back up, too, inviting food lovers to explore a town by enjoying its restaurants’ signature dishes and learning about local history. “For the first time in 15 months, we are opening public tours again, and it is really exciting,” said Alessia Aron, owner of Beyond the Plate Tours, which presents excursions in Jersey City, Red Bank and Somerville. Local restaurants “have been through hell and back, and we are just trying to support them as much as possible.” Her company, previously Jersey Girls Food Tours, is one of seven that comprise the NJ Food Tour Trail. “We thought that coming together and creating the New Jersey Food Tour Trail would help us come out of the pandemic better,” said Audrey Wiggins, owner of On the Town Food Tours, another participant. “July 1 is our official opening date for all tour companies; some have started a little earlier than that, but everyone is now officially open.” Other NJ Food Tour Trail companies include Asbury Park Food Tours, Cape May Food Tours, Sister Cities Food and Shop Tours, Savor and Stroll Culinary Tours and Have You Met Newark Tours.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A new podcast called Parks urges visitors to America’s national parks to educate themselves about and acknowledge the Indigenous tribes whose ties to these sacred spaces span millennia. The aim of the documentary podcast is to explore the history of tribes on these lands, the ways in which the lands were dispossessed, issues the Indigenous communities face today, and how they’ve kept their culture and traditions alive, the Santa Fe New Mexican reports. “There’s so much that was written, but when it was written, it was from the point of view of Eastern colonizers,” said Mary Mathis, 25, a former photo editor at National Public Radio and Outside magazine who serves as the host of Parks, co-created with fellow Santa Fe-based multimedia journalist Cody Nelson. “It wasn’t every story, it was just one story – the quote-unquote ‘winner’s’ story. We see that a lot in our education system, and I think that was where the idea (for Parks) kind of came from.” The first episode follows a format the Parks team plans to replicate throughout the project, one in which Indigenous guests are closely involved in each step of the editing process so as to maintain complete ownership of their stories.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A consortium of businesses and nonprofits will run Central Park’s Wollman ice rink, one of four recreational concessions that were operated by Donald Trump’s company until the city canceled its contracts with the former president, the city Department of Parks and Recreation announced Tuesday. A joint venture called Wollman Park Partners LLC is expected to be awarded a five-year contract to run the rink after submitting the winning bid for the project, city officials said. The joint venture, which includes Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment, Related Companies, Equinox, caterer Great Performances and local groups such as Ice Hockey in Harlem, will reinvest all profits into upgrading the rink, city officials said. “It’s the Summer of New York City, but we’re already preparing for an iconic winter, too,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a news release. “I’m thrilled that NYC Parks has found a quality operator for Wollman Rink that is committed to reinvesting in the community and creating a welcoming space for all New Yorkers.” The Democrat announced in January that the city would terminate business contracts with the Trump Organization over Trump’s role in the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. The cancellations affected a golf course in the Bronx and a carousel and two ice skating rinks in Central Park.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A Superior Court judge put a small-town newspaper editor behind bars last month after one of his reporters used an audio recorder for note-taking purposes at a murder trial – a punishment the paper and media rights groups consider excessive. Judge Stephan Futrell sentenced Gavin Stone, the news editor of the Richmond County Daily Journal, to five days in jail before having the editor hauled off to jail. Stone was released the next day but still faces the possibility of more time in lockup. Brian Bloom, the paper’s publisher, acknowledged that his reporter shouldn’t have had the recorder in court because it was not allowed but criticized the judge’s move to imprison an editor for a minor infraction committed by a colleague. “The penalty does not fit the crime,” he said. “Let’s put this in perspective: You stop a murder trial not once, but twice, because a guy had a tape recorder sitting next to him on a bench at a courtroom. Let’s put our priorities in place here.” Futrell did not respond to a request for comment. Superior Court rules allow electronic media and still photography coverage of public judicial proceedings but grant judges the authority to prohibit the technology.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMandan: The Mandan City Commission has agreed to equip the community’s police force with body cameras. The commission approved the cameras unanimously Tuesday with no discussion. The police department received a quote from Digital-Ally, which already has cameras inside the police vehicles. A memo from police to commissioners said that using the same company for the cameras will allow for better integration of the equipment, the Bismarck Tribune reports. The package of 28 body cameras, upgraded in-car cameras, accessories, set-up, training and cloud storage would cost about $165,000 for a five-year subscription. The police department also received approval to request funding from the U.S. Department of Justice to offset the cost of the cameras. It is asking for nearly $37,000 over five years, according to the memo. The Lincoln Police Department began using body cameras in early 2020. The Bismarck Police Department and the Burleigh County Sheriff’s Department do not use the technology.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: The top prosecutor in one of the state’s most populous counties has decided his office will no longer offer plea bargains in any cases involving gun violence or possession of illegal firearms. Hamilton County Prosecutor Joe Deters announced his decision Tuesday, saying it would take effect immediately. “It’s time for this nonsense to end,” Deters said. The directive comes in the wake of a violent holiday weekend in Cincinnati. Among the incidents was a Fourth of July shooting at a downtown park where authorities say a 19-year-old man and a 16-year-old boy opened fire on each other, leaving both of them dead and three innocent bystanders wounded. Hundreds of teens were gathered at Smale Park when the shooting occurred shortly before 11 p.m. Sunday, authorities say. At the time, police officers were working to clear out the riverfront park before its closing time. “People must be held accountable for their choices. As a community, we must stand together and say, ‘Enough is enough,’ ” Deters said. “No amount of money can fix the problems we are facing. Parents must parent their children. Communities must speak up.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nEdmond: U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe’s office announced Wednesday that he requested $4 million in federal funds to help combat illegal marijuana growing operations in the state. Inhofe’s chief of staff, Luke Holland, announced the request during an Oklahoma Sheriffs Association meeting, saying Inhofe requested a direct appropriation through the U.S. Justice Department to allow the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs to establish a unit to combat “transnational and national drug organizations.” The unit would work with sheriffs to combat illegal drug operations. Medical marijuana is a booming business in Oklahoma, where voters in 2018 approved one of the nation’s most liberal medical programs. As a result, out-of-state weed entrepreneurs have flocked to the state to get involved. But sheriffs and other law enforcement groups, which opposed the state question in 2018, have said illegal marijuana grow operations are setting up in rural parts of Oklahoma and funneling cannabis into the illegal drug trade in Oklahoma and other states.\n\nOregon\n\nEugene: The University of Oregon said Tuesday that it will start the second phase of building the Phil and Penny Knight Campus for Accelerating Scientific Impact after receiving another $500million donation for the project. Construction on the first phase of the new campus started in 2016 – after the first half-billion-dollar gift from the Nike co-founder and his wife – with a large science building including a pedestrian bridge over the street. A second building for “bioengineering and applied science research building to support expanded research programs and facilities” will be built next, according to a university news release. The building is planned to cover 175,000 square feet, with multiple stories, and be located north of the first building. The focus of the new campus is to translate scientific discoveries into advances in health care and other fields. The latest money will also pay for 14 to 16 additional faculty members and their teams. The new campus currently employs 13 tenure-related faculty members and their research teams, for a total of about 90 employees. “The aim of the new campus is to compress the timeline between discovery and “societal impact,” said Robert Guldberg, vice president and executive director of the new science operation.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Tolls on the Pennsylvania Turnpike will rise another 5% in January, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission decided Tuesday. The agency board voted to impose the higher rates as of Jan. 2. The most common E-ZPass fare for a passenger vehicle will rise by a dime, from $1.60 to $1.70. Those being charged through a scan of their license plate will see the most common fare go from $3.90 to $4.10. The most common truck fare will go from $13 to $13.70 for E-ZPass and from $26.60 to $28 for toll-by-plate. Officials say 2022 will be the first time in six years that fares will have jumped by less than 6%. The turnpike has pumped more than $7 billion in funding from tolls to the state Transportation Department since 2007.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Almost $54 million worth of fraudulent unemployment claims have been filed during the coronavirus pandemic, state officials say. The latest total is about $9 million more than in May, with even more victims coming forward in the past month, according to WJAR-TV. State Department of Labor and Training Director Matt Weldon said that doesn’t necessarily mean the claims were filed during that time span, just that they are coming to light now. The agency has managed to get back about $3.75 million so far with the help of federal agencies, but Weldon said he believes that will grow significantly in the coming months. The agency is also enforcing rules that require people to look for work while collecting benefits, he said. With 64,000 Rhode Islanders receiving unemployment benefits, that will be a slow process, with the agency only able to get through a few hundred claims per week to start, he said. “As you can imagine, trying to audit claims and go through information is difficult when there are more than a workable number, so we are going to begin with hundreds and see how that goes, and then that can grow in the future,” he said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The governor wants a new abortion law to take effect, arguing Wednesday that a judge’s decision to put the whole measure – and not just the parts being challenged in court – on hold during a lawsuit “oversteps the bounds of federal judicial power.” Gov. Henry McMaster’s brief with the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals asks appellate judges to lift a lower court’s injunction on the South Carolina Fetal Heartbeat and Protection from Abortion Act. The Republican signed the measure into law earlier this year that requires doctors to perform ultrasounds to check for a heartbeat in the fetus, which can typically be detected about six weeks after conception. If cardiac activity is detected, the abortion can only be performed if the pregnancy was caused by rape or incest or if the mother’s life is in danger. Planned Parenthood attorneys sued immediately, and the entire law has been blocked from going into effect during the litigation. In his brief, attorneys for McMaster argued that decision represents “overreaching federal power to interfere with state law.” McMaster, along with other defendants including state Attorney General Alan Wilson, also argue that the groups that sued don’t have proper standing to challenge the law.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nMadison: An increasing number of primarily social media complaints from residents in Madison and Lake County have brought to light a little-known county ordinance banning people from occupying their campers or recreational vehicles outside the confines of a campground. Lake County Planning and Zoning Officer Mandi Anderson said the ordinance has gone undetected for many years until a recent barrage of postings that have led to heated debate among residents. Some who are opposed to the rule say that it infringes on property rights and that there should be nothing wrong with letting visitors use a camper for a short time. “I didn’t realize it was this out of hand,” Anderson said. One theory for the ordinance, Anderson said, is that people who construct large lakeside homes on small lots do not want to be inundated with noise from adjoining property when three campers pull in for the weekend and 50 people take up temporary residence, The Madison Daily Leader reports. Anderson said citations are only issued if the matter is not addressed after the property owner has been notified about the ordinance and has been given an opportunity to comply. She emphasized she does not drive around looking for violators but only responds to complaints.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: City officials are inviting the public to celebrate and remember civil rights icon John Lewis in a dedication ceremony next week. Earlier this year, Nashville’s Metro Council renamed a large portion of Fifth Avenue North to Rep. John Lewis Way. Councilwoman Zulfat Suara submitted the request last year, focusing on Lewis’ work to desegregate Nashville’s lunch counters before becoming a long-serving congressman in Georgia. The city will host a dedication July 16-17. The event was originally scheduled for February but was delayed due to the coronavirus outbreak. As a college student at American Baptist College and then Fisk University, Lewis helped desegregate public spaces in Nashville and pushed for racial justice across the South. Lewis was a Freedom Rider, spoke at the March on Washington, and was beaten on the Edmund Pettus Bridge on Bloody Sunday in Selma, Alabama. Lewis died July 17, 2020. He was 80.\n\nTexas\n\nSan Antonio: A federal judge has ruled that the U.S. Air Force is mostly responsible for a former serviceman killing more than two dozen people at a church in 2017 because it failed to submit his criminal history into a database, which should have prevented him from purchasing firearms. U.S. District Judge Xavier Rodriguez in San Antonio wrote in a ruling signed Wednesday that the Air Force was “60% responsible” for the massacre at First Baptist Church in the small town of Sutherland Springs, where Devin Kelley opened fire during a Sunday service. Authorities put the official death toll at 26 because one of the 25 people killed was pregnant. The attack remains the worst mass shooting in Texas history. “The trial conclusively established that no other individual – not even Kelley’s own parents or partners – knew as much as the United States about the violence that Devin Kelley had threatened to commit and was capable of committing,” Rodriguez wrote. Kelley had served nearly five years in the Air Force before being discharged in 2014 for bad conduct, after he was convicted of assaulting a former wife and stepson, cracking the child’s skull. The Air Force has publicly acknowledged that the felony conviction for domestic violence, had it been put into the FBI database, could have prevented Kelley from buying guns from licensed firearms dealers and from possessing body armor.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Hospital leaders renewed their pleas for people to get vaccinated Wednesday as the state experiences another surge in new coronavirus cases from the faster-spreading delta variant. That strain has begun to surge in Utah over the past month and now represents about 80% of cases in the state, said Dr. Michelle Hofmann, deputy director of the state health department. Utah has averaged about 386 confirmed cases per day over the past week, nearly double the case rate the state was experiencing at its lowest point in early June. The surge is largely occurring in unvaccinated people who are being infected and hospitalized at six times the rate of vaccinated people, Hoffman said. “The frustrating part about all of this is that, unlike last year, we have all the tools to stop this pandemic in its tracks,” Hoffman told reporters during a virtual briefing. “The COVID-19 vaccines work.” Utah now ranks fourth in the nation for new cases per capita, and the rolling average number of daily new cases has increased by 31% over the past two weeks, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Utah met health officials’ goal of vaccinating 70% of adults and 25% of children ages 12 to 15 with at least one dose by the Fourth of July, but hospital leaders say more people need to be vaccinated to avoid hospitals from being overrun again.\n\nVermont\n\nKillington: The FIS Ski World Cup will be returning to the Killington Ski Resort this November. Over the years the event has drawn tens of thousands of people to the town on Thanksgiving weekend. It was canceled last year because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Mike Solimano, president and general manager of Killington Resort & Pico Mountain, said in a news release that in addition to skiing, there will be a full weekend of activities, including live music. Joshua Eckler, owner of Trailside Inn, told the Rutland Herald he thinks this will be a big year for the World Cup, given the past 14 months of travel restrictions. “We try to encourage a lot of guests to come for it even if they’re not ski racing fans because it’s more of an experience,” Eckler said. “You don’t have to be a die-hard racing fan to enjoy the event, just because of the music and the atmosphere and the excitement – everybody is screaming for everybody.”\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Workers removed a statue of Harry F. Byrd Sr., a former governor, U.S. senator and staunch segregationist, from the state’s Capitol Square on Wednesday morning. A crane hoisted the larger-than-life statue off its pedestal, and workers then strapped it to a truck to be hauled into storage until lawmakers determine its final disposition. Byrd, a Democrat, ran the state’s most powerful political machine for decades until his death in 1966 and was considered the architect of the state’s racist “massive resistance” policy to public school integration. Lawmakers voted to remove the statue earlier this year, a decision that came amid a years­long movement in history-rich Virginia to rethink who is honored in the state’s public spaces. The statue erected in 1976 was located a stone’s throw from the Capitol. A nearby plaque said the statue was dedicated in appreciation of Byrd’s “devotion throughout a long public career to governmental restraint and programs in the best interest of all the people of Virginia.” Byrd’s son, the late Harry Byrd Jr., a Democrat-turned-independent who began his career as a segregationist, succeeded his father in the Senate, serving until 1983.\n\nWashington\n\nRichland: A new state report finds that more than 57% of Hanford Nuclear Reservation workers reported exposure to hazardous material on the former nuclear weapons production site in south-central Washington state. The Hanford Healthy Energy Workers Board recently released its final report and recommendations on the unmet health care needs of Hanford workers. The report’s central recommendation calls for creation of a new, independent Hanford Healthy Energy Workers Center. It would provide a centralized clearinghouse for dissemination of accepted scientific literature. Important functions would also include evaluation and communication of newly available studies about Hanford-specific hazards. For incurable diseases such as chronic beryllium disease, information sharing could be key to finding cures. Additionally, the center would promote research to increase the body of knowledge for the Hanford workforce. Hanford for decades made plutonium for nuclear weapons, and thousands of workers are now tasked with cleaning up the nation’s largest volume of radioactive wastes. “The working families that make up the Hanford community represent a very unique population, with occupational risks not easily quantified or identified,” said Nickolas A. Bumpaous, Hanford Healthy Energy Workers Board co-chair.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Traffic on the West Virginia Turnpike around the Fourth of July weekend was the heaviest since 2010. The turnpike saw 668,000 vehicles pass through its toll booths between Thursday and Monday, the state Department of Transportation said in a news release Tuesday. That’s 28% higher than for the five-day period a year ago, when travel was affected by the coronavirus pandemic. “It was a huge Fourth of July period,” said West Virginia Parkways Authority executive director Jeff Miller. “People are just ready to get out and travel.” Miller said many travelers started trips the weekend before the Fourth of July and returned home the weekend after. Between June 27 and Monday, more than 1.12 million vehicles went through the turnpike’s toll booths, the statement said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: In a cheese-obsessed state that proudly touts itself as America’s Dairyland, the dairy cow is the official domestic animal, milk is the official state beverage, and cheese is the official dairy product. But even though Wisconsin produces more cheese than any other state at 3.4 billion pounds each year, there is no official state cheese. A bipartisan bill heard by a state Assembly committee on Wednesday would change that. The measure makes colby, which was created in Wisconsin more than 100 years ago, the official cheese. Colby may be as “gouda” choice as any, but the choice threatens to turn fans of cheddar, swiss, provolone and other varieties red, or perhaps blue, in the face with rage. Colby also holds a special place in Wisconsin cheese history. It was created in the central Wisconsin city of Colby in 1885 by Joseph Steinwand, who named it after the township where his father built northern Clark County’s first cheese factory, according to a state historical marker in the city, located about 40 miles west of Wausau. Colby isn’t the most-produced cheese in Wisconsin. Mozzarella is tops, followed by cheddar and some Italian varieties, according to the USDA. Still, more than 45 million pounds of colby are produced at Wisconsin’s 150 cheese plants each year.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The state’s first female federal district judge plans to semi-retire in 2022, opening the way for Democratic President Joe Biden to nominate a judge in the deeply Republican state. Going on senior status will give U.S. District Judge Nancy Freudenthal in Cheyenne more control over the number and type of cases she oversees. She plans to spend more of her free time with her husband, former Gov. Dave Freudenthal, and grandchildren, Freudenthal told the Casper Star-Tribune. She hasn’t decided yet how she will use her time as judge but might stop taking new criminal cases to provide freedom from speedy trial requirements, she said. Freudenthal had no experience with criminal cases before becoming a federal district judge in 2010. She has found those cases the most rewarding because they can be life-changing for convicts, Freudenthal said. “Yes, their lives going forward will still be very challenging, but they have the opportunity to rebuild that life, take advantage of resources, hopefully live a life of sobriety,” she said. Freudenthal, 67, holds undergraduate and law degrees from the University of Wyoming. She was an attorney in the offices of Govs. Ed Herschler and Mike Sullivan from 1980 to 1989.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/08"}]}

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\n(CNN) Research on ancient footprints has previously challenged what's known about when people arrived in North America, and a new discovery could shed more light on the story.\n\nScientists have found 88 fossilized prints belonging to adults and children, likely dating back 12,000 years, in shallow riverbeds on the US Air Force Utah Test and Training Range . This is only the second set of human tracks from the Ice Age to be identified in what is now the United States.\n\nFootprints record a specific type of evidence that most people cannot get from other types of archaeological or fossil records, said Kevin Hatala, paleoanthropologist at Chatham University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He was not involved in the discovery.\n\n\"You can understand how large these individuals were,\" Hatala said. \"You can understand how they were moving. When you see multiple trackways of footprints within the same site, you can start to understand how many people were likely there.\"\n\n\"Were they likely traveling together or were they moving in different ways?\" he added.\n\nDaron Duke shows visitors footprints discovered on the Air Force's Utah Test and Training Range.\n\nThe fossils can offer important insight on present-day populations as well, said Daron Duke, principal investigator for the research and archaeologist for the Nevada-based Far Western Anthropological Research Group.\n\n\"It also connects the people ancestral to the area to the finds,\" he said.\n\nAn inadvertent find\n\nThe discovery occurred somewhat by accident, according to Duke and Tommy Urban, a research scientist at Cornell University in New York.\n\nDuke and Urban were searching Utah Test and Training Range in early July for remnants of purposeful prehistoric campfires, which were used by ancient humans as a source of light and heat. As they were driving around the Air Force base and talking about what fossilized footprints look like, Urban noticed one and the men stopped to inspect the print. After further examination, they identified dozens more in the area.\n\nAt first, they were unsure the footprints had been made by humans. But after several days evaluating the tracks' size, shape and stride length, the researchers determined they were the work of barefoot human adults and children. While the archeologists are still working to confirm the age of the footprints via radiocarbon dating, they believe the tracks are 12,000 years old based on the previously dated sediment layer beneath them, and the fact that the prints were exposed to the surface around the same time as artifacts found to be 12,300 years old, Duke said.\n\nAdditionally, the freshwater wetlands needed to preserve the prints have not existed in the area for at least 10,000 years.\n\nIn 2021, scientists used radiocarbon dating to find that 61 footprints discovered in 2020 in White Sands National Park in New Mexico -- many belonging to teenagers and young children -- were 21,000 to 23,000 years old. This would mean that humans inhabited North America during the Pleistocene era, or Ice Age, around 7,500 years earlier than previously thought.\n\n\"Once I realized that (the Utah tracks) were barefoot human footprints, it was very exciting,\" said Urban via email. \"I had been working on footprints at White Sands for the previous five years, so it was astounding to think that we had just stumbled onto a second White Sands.\"\n\nGoing forward, the researchers need to preserve and protect the Utah prints and find out who the prints belonged to and when exactly they are from, Duke said.\n\nA distant human connection\n\nThe find is an exciting one for the field of archaeological research, said David Madsen, an archaeologist at the University of Nevada-Reno. He was not involved in the discovery.\n\nThe researchers are working to preserve and learn more about the prints.\n\n\"Now that we have this human element, the story of the very early people becomes more real. There's more funding available, there's more interest in it, there'll be more recovery,\" Madsen said.\n\nThe location of the latest footprint discovery is near a site in northwestern Utah where researchers found numerous human artifacts in 2015, including stone tools and the earliest evidence of human tobacco use in the world . The relics date back to around the same time the prints were made.\n\nThe proximity of the sites and the fact that the evidence is likely from the same time period tells archeologists a greater story about the people who may have inhabited the area during the Ice Age, Duke said.\n\nAdditionally, learning more about the prints may offer a better understanding of the Indigenous population in the western US.\n\nThere are 21 Indigenous communities in the region, and people from these communities are helping the researchers in the examination of the footprints.", "authors": ["Rachel Fadem"], "publish_date": "2022/08/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2021/09/10/prehistoric-native-american-arrowhead-artifact-found-alligator-mississippi/8271061002/", "title": "Prehistoric Native American artifact found in gator's stomach", "text": "JACKSON, Miss. – What does a 750-pound alligator eat? Well, just about anything it wants, but items found in this particular Mississippi alligator's stomach defy odds and date back thousands of years.\n\nShane Smith, owner of Red Antler Processing in Yazoo City, Mississippi, said he was examining contents of a 13-foot, 5-inch alligator that weighed 750 pounds and discovered two unusual objects. One he couldn't identify, but the other was clearly a broken stone arrowhead.\n\nThe find was so unexpected, he almost didn't let the news out.\n\n\"At first, I thought 'I'm not posting this on Facebook,' because no one will believe it,\" Smith said.\n\nThen, he had second thoughts.\n\n\"This is too cool not to post of Facebook,\" he said. \"This has probably never happened before. We gotta post this.\"\n\nAlligators in Mississippi:5 things you may not know about the South's apex predator\n\nDog tags in an alligator's stomach\n\nThe story first began to unfold in April when a wild game processor in South Carolina reported opening the stomach of an alligator and finding unusual items. Smith read it and was skeptical.\n\n\"The curiosity struck me when I saw a post online about someone finding dog tags in an alligator's stomach,\" Smith said.\n\nTo satisfy that curiosity, Smith decided to examine contents of the larger alligators he processed. The first was a 13-foot, 2-inch, 787-pound gator taken by Ty Powell of Columbia, Mississippi.\n\n\"We found a bullet in it, and it had not been fired from a gun,\" Smith said. \"I don't know how it got in there.\"\n\nThe second alligator he opened, which was harvested at Eagle Lake, located 15 miles northwest of Vicksburg on the Mississippi and Louisiana border, contained many of the things the first did, including bones, hair, feathers and stones. Then, something else caught his eye.\n\nA find like no other\n\n\"Everybody was standing around like I was opening a Christmas present,\" Smith said. \"We kind of put it all in a bin.\n\n\"I looked over and saw a rock with a different tint to it. It was the arrowhead.\"\n\nSmith said he was dumbfounded.\n\n\"It was just disbelief,\" Smith said. \"There's just no way he had an arrowhead. Your first thought is it ate (a Native American) or (a Native American) shot it in the stomach.\"\n\nSmith knew that wasn't the case, though.\n\n\"My best hypothesis is wherever he scooped up those other rocks, he got that (Native American) point,\" Smith said. \"We joked about it and said I'm probably the only person on Earth to pull an arrowhead out of an alligator's stomach.\"\n\nPoint dates back thousands of years\n\nJames Starnes, director of Surface Geology and Surface Mapping for the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality, examined a photograph of the point. He estimated it was made about 5000-6000 BC.\n\n'That is the latter part of the Early Archaic and early part of the Middle Archaic (periods),\" Starnes said. \"How the base is made is real tell-tale in estimating the time period.\"\n\nStarnes also noted the object is not an arrowhead. It's a point used on an early weapon that launches a spear using a second piece of wood with a cup on one end which acts as a lever to increase velocity.\n\n\"That's an atlatl dart point,\" Starnes said. \"People think all heads are arrowheads, but those (arrowheads) would be the little bitty points.\"\n\nAs bizarre as the find was, it was about to get even stranger. Smith found a heavy, tear-shaped object roughly 1½ inches in length. Both he and the hunter who was permitted to harvested the alligator thought it was something more modern — a lead weight used for fishing.\n\n\"It's heavy like lead,\" Hamilton said. \"It looks like it's got two holes in it, but they don't go through it.\n\n\"It's got a little hole and a bigger hole on top. I guess it goes in and comes back out.\"\n\nWhat's a plummet, and why would an alligator eat it?\n\nStarnes said it's known as a plummet and dates back to the Late Archaic Period, or about 1700 BC.\n\nThe weight is accounted for because it's made of hematite, an iron oxide traded between early groups and shines when polished. Starnes said what purpose plummets served is unknown.\n\n\"The plummets, we really have no idea what they were used for,\" Starnes said. \"These things had some significance, but we have no idea. We can only guess.\"\n\nSo, how did these ancient objects get into the alligator's belly? Ricky Flynt, Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks Alligator Program coordinator, explained very hard objects, typically stones, aid the reptiles in digestion.\n\n\"Alligators, like other animals such as birds and other reptiles, are known for ingesting grit and rocks to help with digestion,\" Flynt said. \"We know alligators and crocodiles do that.\"\n\nHowever, alligators differ from fowl such as chickens and ducks. Those animals have gizzards and the grit and sand is stored there to help grind seeds and grains they consume. Alligators don't have gizzards and the stones go into the stomach.\n\n\"Sticks, wood; things they can't digest get into their stomachs,\" Flynt said. \"I found a piece of cypress in an alligator's stomach that was 15 inches long.\"\n\nFollow Clarion Ledger Outdoors on Facebook and @BrianBroom on Twitter.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/business/2020/10/12/two-venice-businesses-turn-searching-for-fossils-and-sharks-teeth-into-lasting-memories/3581950001/", "title": "Venice businesses turn fossils and sharks' teeth into lasting memories", "text": "VENICE – When Visit Sarasota County wants to differentiate south Sarasota County beaches from the rest of the state, they quickly point to the Venice area and the pastime of searching sand near the surf for fossilized shark teeth.\n\n“It’s very important,” Visit Sarasota Vice President Erin Duggan said. Many beach communities have fine restaurants, she said, but, “talking about the shark's tooth draw and Venice being the shark’s tooth capital of the world, it’s always given us something to differentiate us from other beach locations.”\n\nOn its web site, Visit Sarasota County points to the beaches from Casey Key south to Manasota Key as wonderful places to search for shark’s teeth, but south Brohard Beach and Caspersen Beach stand out for the sheer quantity of teeth – though shark tooth and fossil aficionados are quick to point out that prized large fossilized megalodon teeth are most frequently found by divers offshore.\n\n“I personally have met plenty of people on the beach and you can tell when you see somebody on the beach looking for shark’s teeth,” Venice MainStreet CEO Kara Morgan said. “They come to Venice specifically for that, it certainty plays into the town’s identity and is something of importance in terms of our character and charm and our culture, so to speak.”\n\nTeeth from Lemon and Bull sharks are what people scouring the shoreline most frequently find.\n\nTwo stores on the island of Venice – Earth Treasures at 207 W. Miami Ave. and Shark Frenzy at 262 S. Tamiami Trail – specialize in fossilized shark teeth and sell a variety of fossils to enthusiasts.\n\nVacation led to the perfect sifter\n\nBrittanie Hervas and her parents Roy and Linda are exactly the type of people Visit Sarasota likes to see frequent Venice area beaches.\n\nFor years, they traveled from Schaumberg, Illinois, to the Gulf Coast of Florida for vacation.\n\nThey started in Captiva then moved north to Venice, where they became fascinated by shark’s teeth.\n\n“For about 15 years we’ve been coming down to Venice, just vacationing down here,” Roy Hervas said. “When we came down here to look for sharks’ teeth, we felt there’s got to be more than a sand flea rake, and there wasn’t.”\n\nThe Hervases used resources at their snow plow shop in Schaumburg to create the Shark Tooth Sifter. Enough people asked about the hybrid shovel/sifter that Hervas decided to ask his brother, an attorney, to help draw up a patent.\n\nAfter selling the sifter through other shops, they opted to open Shark Frenzy in Dec. 2019.\n\nThe interior color scheme of their shop is aqua and purple, with a plentiful supply of Shark Tooth Sifters, as well as other similar devices that allow families to sift for shark’s teeth together, along with the requisite tourist trinkets, hats and souvenirs.\n\n“We want people to have the experience that we had when we first found shark’s teeth,” said Brittanie Hervas, who’s the face of the shop on an active social media presence that includes Facebook groups and TikTok.\n\n“I post my finds to let others see what we're finding at the beaches, and it starts the conversation,” Hervas said.\n\n“We want it to be an amazing, amazing time for them, we certainly fell in love with collecting sharks teeth, we know that’s something that’s amazing to do here in Venice,” she added.\n\nBrittanie Hervas notes that her main demographic is young and female – just as she was a young girl captivated by sharks’ teeth.\n\nFrom flea markets to Miami Avenue\n\nDon and Draeanne Rivette know all about the joy of collecting sharks teeth and fossils.\n\n“I like the sense of discovery, like customers do,” Don Rivette said. “It’s a very thrilling experience to look down and pick something up and then to realize it’s a part of an animal that has not existed on this earth for millions of years.”\n\nThe New England transplants started collecting and selling through flea markets seven years ago in Port Charlotte. They went on to their first shop in Englewood, before settling into their current location on Miami Avenue almost five years ago.\n\nOf course it hasn’t been easy going since the relocation. First it was Hurricane Irma, then red tide, followed by the reconstruction of Tampa, Venice and Miami Avenues by the city of Venice, and this year the COVID-19 pandemic that cut short the season..\n\n“We’ve seen a lot of stores go and by the grace of God, we’re still here,” said Draeanne Rivette, who can craft unique jewelry from the treasured finds customers bring in.\n\n“Fossils shells, sea glass, she can wire wrap any object,” Don Rivette said. “People have brought in stones that are important to them, that they want to remember a loved one.”\n\nOne customer came in five straight days with different finds from a fossil hunt with Don that she wanted turned into jewelry.\n\nWith the requisite model of a jaw of a 45-foot-long Megalodon, alligator heads, sculptures, and walls decorated by art available on consignment from a local dealer, Earth Treasures has an old Florida charm that comes with time.\n\nThe shop was featured on the PBS Fossil Hunters Mammoth Special from 2018, which is available in its entirety on YouTube.\n\nTo take advantage of the late-September off-season lull, the Rivettes were doing a little shop remodeling, including a rearranging of shelves, with white sea-foam accents being painted on the blue floor.\n\nThey’re planning to augment their web presence with a Google 360 tour of the store, so people can get a better sense of what’s inside.\n\n“We’ve tried to diversify to respond to customers' needs,” Rivette said. “We’re competing with them down the street and we are competing online.”\n\nOver the years, Don Rivette has befriended local archaeologists and can talk for hours on fossils of all sorts. Shark’s teeth, for many enthusiasts, are a gateway fossil.\n\nHe proudly points to a necklace Dreanne made from a Glyptodont scute – an armored plate from a long-extinct relative of the armadillo.\n\n“It’s an example of an ice age creature that a lot of people don’t know ever lived here,” he said, then continued to explain how it came up from South America through the isthmus of Panama some 50 centuries ago. “When you start looking for shark teeth, you find other things.”\n\nHe loves when people bring in items that he can help identify.\n\n“It opens up a whole other universe of exploration for people who love looking for shark teeth,” Rivette said. “I enjoy finding the fossils just as much as the shark teeth.”\n\nFor some people, that can lead to snorkeling or diving for larger pieces, or just walking the beach eyeing the sand for a prize.\n\n“You can use your hands and eyes or get all kinds of fancy equipment,” Rivette said.\n\nFor young children, he said, a household colander can work as a great entry into searching for fossils or shark’s teeth.\n\nFruits of an offshore ancient riverbed\n\nMost of the teeth on Caspersen Beach are from Lemon sharks. One shark, be noted, can make 45,000 teeth. Multiply that by the generations of sharks offshore and the variety of species – though the next most plentiful are bull sharks – and it’s easy to see why the local shores seem to boast an endless population of shark teeth and fossils.\n\nAn ancient river channel off the coast is a fertile source of fossils, Rivette said. Divers will search for finds there, while storms loosen material that eventually moves onshore with the wave action.\n\nMost of the teeth, both Don Rivette and Brittanie Hervas note, aren’t perfect, since teeth get damaged when they eat.\n\nLarger megalodon teeth Rivette said, can have blunt tips because the fish had such a powerful bite force to cut through the cartilage and vertebrae of whales.\n\nThough each shop has different aesthetics and they’re clearly in competition, the proprietors all pride themselves on providing hands-on customer service and understand that they’re offering both novice vacationers and returning hobbyists memories.\n\n“We sell an experience,” Brittanie Hervas said. “They’re going home with bags of teeth and that’s what they came here for.”\n\nDon Rivette said that some of the most memorable gifts they’ve made have been the finds of children who “worked hard to find shark teeth but they wanted to give them to their friend in school or ship them up to grandmom up north.\n\n“It’s wonderful to see how people give shark teeth and love to family members or friends.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/10/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/history/2021/06/21/glen-rose-texas-things-to-do-history-dinosaurs/7679142002/", "title": "Dinosaurs, pristine water, books and history in Glen Rose, Texas", "text": "GLEN ROSE — This historic Texas town's first tourist attractions were formed about 100 million years ago.\n\nSeveral types of dinosaurs left their huge tracks in the limestone beneath the often pristine Paluxy River, another longtime tourist attraction in these parts. Discovered in 1908 by Ernest \"Bull\" Adams, they were considered novelties until decades later, when layers of excavated tracks were sent to the American Museum of Natural History and Texas universities for further study.\n\nAt one point, local citizens carved human footprints into the same layer of limestone to suggest that people lived in the time of dinosaurs. Experts say they were either fake or from another time period.\n\nMore:Texas History: The Texas State Cemetery shapes its identity for 21st century\n\nThe real dinosaur tracks became part of the area's identity as \"Dinosaur Capital of Texas.\" You can spot the shapes of dinos almost everywhere, including in Dinosaur Valley State Park and the fanciful Dinosaur World roadside attraction. These spots compete — or complement, depending on your beliefs — with the nearby Creation Evidence Museum.\n\nIn Glen Rose, which includes the remains of petrified forests that decorate area buildings, it is perfectly OK to be a tourist. Unlike its neighbor, Granbury, it has not sprawled out. It remains a small, mostly walkable town of 2,500 folded into the canyon of the Paluxy River, one watery reason tourists have been drawn here to escape the heat of bigger cities during the summer.\n\nHistorical, not prehistorical Glen Rose\n\nWhile the evidence of dinosaurs remains a magnet, this valley has been inhabited for thousands of years for a variety of reasons. Tonkawas, Comanches and Caddos, driven out of East Texas, camped by its many springs. Ranches and farms arrived in the 1860s, especially attached to the grist mill built by Charles and Juana Cavasos Barnard directly on the Paluxy. This mighty stone building still stands, along with the adjacent cotton gin and a later sanitarium. Barnard's Mill now serves as one of the town's two main museums.\n\nCultivating cotton, once the primary cash crop, lasted only so long as Somervell County's hardscrabble soil held out. As early as the 1870s, medical tourists arrived to imbibe the mineral waters from a multiplying number of artesian wells. For that reason, the town, whose slogan once was \"Glen Rose for Health and Pleasure,\" was home to hotels, sanitariums, parks and tourist camps, quite a few of them still alluring for tourists and locals.\n\n\"Folks could stay in cabins and relax under under massive oaks, elms and pecans,\" writes Gene Fowler in the pictorial paperback, \"Glen Rose.\" \"Visiting Glen Rose for 'health and pleasure' indeed became a substantial part of the local economy.\"\n\nDuring the 1920s and early '30s, moonshine joined the mix, thanks to Prohibition. The rugged hills around Glen Rose — and the distances from bigger places such as Waco and Forth Worth — translated into another sobriquet, \"Moonshine Capital of Texas.\" In 1923, Texas Gov. Pat Neff sent the Texas Rangers with undercover officers into town to break up the business and 50 people were arrested. The town fought back.\n\nMy time in historic Glen Rose\n\nI arrived in Glen Rose on an early June Saturday morning via scenic U.S. 67 from Stephenville. After the heavy spring rains, the bluffs, valleys and meadows of this region radiated green. I pulled off the highway briefly to photograph the first petrified wood structure I encountered along the way, what looked like a former gas station turned into a residence or studio.\n\nI hung around the courthouse square, where a dinosaur track is on public display, and chatted with a woman selling sprigs of peppermint and other heady herbs at a farmer's market. A nearby truck advertised \"Eggs\" and \"Ammo.\" A morning walk took me through neighborhoods and parks along the river, which despite the swift current, looked inviting.\n\nNext up: Not one, but two unrelated historical museums.\n\nThe Somervell County Museum on the courthouse square is run by the amiable, alert and genuinely amusing Dennis Moore. I don't think I've ever encountered a better docent at a Texas historical museum. He has even discovered his own dinosaur tracks! Oftentimes, small local museums are packed with assorted historical treasures, but no one is available to explain them effectively or efficiently.\n\nNevertheless, the clearly well-informed Moore passed along a shady legend — shared with several Texas and Oklahoma towns — that stage actor and presidential assassin John Wilkes Booth not only escaped a barn fire and fatal gunshot wound, he lived for years as the mysterious John St. Helen. The legend differs from town to town — he's a teacher in some versions — but I don't know a serious historian who backs it.\n\nStill, don't miss this place, located in the rebuilt newspaper offices of the Glen Rose Herald, destroyed by a terrible 1902 tornado, or Barnard's Mill, found not far away on the banks of the Paluxy. Part of this complex serves as a museum of mostly Southwestern art, another is a transitional space that will soon house an exhibit on Comanche leader Quanah Parker. Yet the heart of the old mill with its massive timbers and ancient building techniques remains the main attraction.\n\nMore:Take your time at Texas State Cemetery, where history is written in marble\n\nThe shaded grounds are worth a stroll. Ann Carver, president of the Somervell History Foundation, was my guide here. She helpfully explained how the riverbed lay 25 feet below the mill's floor and that grinding was done on the second floor. The walls are 36 inches thick and, when the attached building was used for a hospital from 1936 to 1972, patients were lowered down into the mill's waterhole.\n\nBooks and brunch in downtown Granbury\n\nWhat a rapture, as an inveterate reader, bibliophile and history buff, to find three operating bookstores on or near the courthouse square in Glen Rose.\n\nRhythm & Co. Books focuses on new books. Its smallish Texas section is amazingly well curated. I felt like buying out owner Janet Mills' whole stock of Texana.\n\nBone-anza Barn: Books and Antiques is, as the name indicates, about older objects, a good number of them vintage books. I found some rarities here and the well-informed clerk also warned me about the pricing of a book, which I hadn't double-checked and was way out of my range. I also picked up some local petrified wood for $3.\n\nStoriebook Cafe started out primarily as a bookstore, but the soups and sandwiches that they offered on a limited basis were so good, it now serves three dining rooms and a patio. Owner Storie Sharp is a former newspaper reporter and editor — she wrote features for the Glen Rose Reporter, part of our Gannett / USA Today chain — and she's a firecracker. My sandwich of honey-baked ham and cheddar with chips and iced tea hit the spot.\n\nI could totally see renting a cabin for a week in this sweet town. Plenty to do and plenty of peace to do nothing.\n\nGlen Rose's bookstores\n\nThis small Texas tourist town is home to three very different bookstores located in and around the courthouse square: Storiebook Cafe, Rhythm & Co.

Below, find links to the latest essays:\n\nHomeless children need a chance — LeBron James' program gives them one in his hometown\n\nAKRON, Ohio — LeBron James’ basketball career started in a place similar to this: huddled around a hoop on a tucked-away Akron street, with friends wiping their brows as beads of sweat, illuminated by a nearby porch light, dribbled down their faces.\n\nLondon Riley, 10, is determined to score on her much older rivals; she darts across the rain-slicked court, nimbly dodging the defense before sinking a basket through the hoop. Riley is one of 20 Akron students living in the LeBron James Family Foundation’s new transitional housing complex who didn’t always have a safe place to play outside, or even live.\n\nBut on this late-October evening, she can just focus on the game.\n\nIn Texas, environmental activists renew fight against fracking\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas. — The vast majority of rigs that dotted the landscape here more than a decade ago are long gone, along with the economic boom that natural gas drilling brought to North Texas.\n\nBut a regional resurgence in hydraulic fracturing this summer dredged up tensions between anti-fracking activists and local government leaders.\n\nOver the summer, French energy giant Total submitted at least 26 new gas well permit requests in Fort Worth-area cities, leading to renewed calls for action from local activists concerned about the environmental impact of drilling.\n\nIn California, people lived on the edge of homelessness before COVID-19. Now, it's worse.\n\nSILICON VALLEY, Calif. — Sarah Rivas was barely making rent since she’d move to Sunnyvale, in Silicon Valley, California. When, three months into the pandemic, she woke up to an email from her school announcing a nearly 7% cut in teachers’ pay, she gave up a three-year battle.\n\n“I moved into my parent’s house,” said Rivas, who’s been teaching her class of 12th graders from Sacramento, three hours from their high school. “Not what every 26 year old wants to do.”\n\nShould cops be in schools? Police reforms divide a community in California.\n\nFRESNO, Calif. — At 9 p.m. in late August the Fresno Police Reform Commission was four hours into its fourth general meeting when members began to debate whether school resource officers should wear polos instead of uniforms.\n\n“We would like them to be in street clothes or their police polos, shorts, jeans. We don't want them walking around in their combat uniform,” said Keshia Thomas, president of the Fresno Unified School District and one of the 37 members of the commission.\n\nVulnerable Kansas bird populations are a canary in a coal mine for climate change\n\nWICHITA — It has been five months since Virginia Soyez died on a Monday in March, but every morning her husband Frank keeps their tradition. He wakes up at 5:30 a.m. — a habit that hasn't left him since his days as a tank mechanic — and sits in a brown recliner across from its now-empty pair in the sun room. He sips weak coffee from a brown and tan ceramic Fort Scott mug decorated with a sprig of wheat and foregoes breakfast altogether, as there's no longer anyone to share it with.\n\nUndocumented in Pennsylvania: An immigration activist stays defiant despite Trump policies\n\nHARRISBURG, Pa. — Looking out onto the Susquehanna River earlier this month, Stephanie Nuñez sat under grey skies as the rain trickled. The riverfront is blocks away from the bustle of Harrisburg, the tightly packed brick homes of the city and the state Capitol.\n\nNuñez says this is where she sometimes comes to run and clear her mind.\n\nThe past couple of months have been a whirlwind as President Donald Trump flip-flopped between supporting people like Nuñez, who were brought to the United States as children without proper immigration documents, and threatening to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival program, the legal provision that’s protecting them from deportation.\n\nBut Nuñez, an organizer for the Movement of Immigrant Leaders in Pennsylvania (MILPA), says she is neither weary nor intimidated.\n\nWhen COVID-19 forced schools to close, child hunger surged in West Virginia\n\nCHARLESTON, W.Va. — Jessica Smith lives with her family in the small town of Belle, about six miles from a high school where nonprofits provide free meals to families in need.\n\nBut, like several other families who qualify for the program, Smith, a 39-year-old mother of two, does not own a car, making it difficult to leave her isolated home to get food.\n\n“We’re just stuck with no way to get lunches,” Smith said. “I’m having to scrape up stuff for my kids… My son seems like he’s never full.”\n\nIn Detroit, immigrants paint a rich tapestry of community and culture\n\nDETROIT — At the intersection of Dequindre Street and 8 Mile Road, the dividing line that separates the city from its predominantly white suburbs, a group of protesters recently marched against police brutality. They stretched to the horizon on the normally bustling street as neighbors stood on either side with their fists raised, chanting in support.\n\nEight Mile is a symbolic place in the minds of Detroit residents, who share a common past of housing disparities and redlining. The marchers joined the waves of civil unrest sweeping the nation, passing Motor City gas stations and auto repair shops along this historic stretch, home to more than 1,500 businesses.\n\nIn Chattanooga, faithful persevere as coronavirus, tornadoes hit\n\nCHATTANOOGA, Tennessee — Nothing moves in this city without the churches. This is a region run largely by preachers at the pulpit, not politicians who win the polls. Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee knows this, and his executive orders to stop the spread of COVID-19 reflect it: Churches are essential.\n\nIn any other time of crisis, there come the churches. They set up tents to care for the poor and comfort the sick. They are the ones leading marches. They mobilize recovery crews and organize community meals. But, as we all recognize, these are not normal times, and the institutions that hold together life in Chattanooga, and much of America, are searching for their footing during this pandemic.\n\nCoronavirus threatens people living in shelters. Here's how an agency rushed to save them.\n\nNEW HAVEN, Connecticut — Columbus House typically bustles with staff doing laundry and cleaning beds as volunteers prepare and plan meals for people who are homeless. When people in need arrived at the shelter in the late afternoon looking for dinner and a place to spend the night, they’d find food and a bed.\n\nNow, the shelter sits mostly empty. The lights are off and hallways are quiet as most of the staff work remotely during this pandemic. Their jobs now include racing to move an unprecedented number of people out of shelters and into alternate housing, including hotels, to avoid spreading the coronavirus among one of the most-at-risk populations.\n\nLife in Paradise: A deadly wildfire raged. Then the pandemic hit.\n\nCHICO, California — Business was finally picking up in Paradise, the Northern California town devastated 17 months ago by the deadliest, most destructive fire in the state's history. Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit.\n\nButte County has seen few hospitalizations and no deaths from the coronavirus. But the crisis highlights the area’s health, social and economic vulnerabilities. The county has more people older than 65 than the state average, according to the 2019 Community Health Assessment, as well as slightly higher percentages of hypertension, kidney disease, pulmonary disease and asthma. The only hospital in Paradise closed because of damage from the Camp Fire, which killed at least 85 people and destroyed about 14,000 homes.\n\nChanges brought by the pandemic to daily life in Paradise have tested residents' hard-earned lessons on survival and resilience.\n\nIn California farm country, growers struggle with labor shortage\n\nAcross the nation, there is a tendency to reduce California to its economic heavyweights, Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nBut in a state that extends more than 163,696 square miles, with a population pushing 40 million, there’s far more to life here than Hollywood or Silicon Valley. Each of California’s major regions — Southern California, the Inland Empire, the Central Valley, Bay Area, Northern California — carry their own identities, and their nuances are easily overlooked.\n\nIn rural Utah, local journalism shrinks as government controversies grow\n\nBLUFF, Utah — Drought maps of the southwestern United States looked like a target in 2018, dark red ringing a brown bulls eye. The center, indicating the most severely dry region, was on top of my home in San Juan County.\n\nSnow and rain that winter brought relief, but in May, the region began to slip back into drought. Where I live in Bluff, a tiny town along the northern edge of the Navajo Nation, there wasn’t a soaking rain all summer. Humidity was so low at times that when I pet my cat, we both got a static shock. My laying hens scratched around the yard, looking for insects that had long since disappeared.\n\nSan Juan is the largest county by geography in Utah and one of the largest in the nation. It fills in the entire southeast corner of the state, stretching from the Colorado River across tangles of canyons, bare mountain peaks and high farmland to the arid Navajo Nation and lands belonging to the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe.\n\nLife under a bridge: In California, children enduring homelessness face daily hardships\n\nMODESTO, Calif. — After a dip in the Tuolumne River, a 10-year-old girl who didn’t know how to swim but had no fear of the river chatted with her “street sister” in their invented language, crafted so they had something private in their otherwise exposed lives.\n\nThe July sun sizzled as the tent city approached 100 degrees, and with no breeze or electricity, a swim in the Tuolumne was their only relief. The two girls, who reverted to English when they wanted to discuss rap songs, school or surviving on the streets, were drenched from head to toe as they headed barefoot under the Ninth Street Bridge.\n\nFighting for health care: Rural America struggles with loss of doctors, clinics\n\nFAIRFIELD, Washington — Drive 20 minutes south of Spokane and pine trees give way to rolling hills, which in fall are golden with remnants of the wheat harvest and in winter dusted with snow. This part of eastern Washington state is the beginning of the Palouse region. Its small farm towns once thrived but now struggle to offer essential services such as health care.\n\nFor decades in Fairfield, residents received care from a doctor in a community clinic on Main Street. Alongside a post office, community center (which doubles as Town Hall), drug store, bank and library, a stucco building where the health clinic used to be sits vacant.\n\nLongtime Fairfield residents recall giving birth to their children at the clinic and visiting for regular checkups. But in 2019, after Kaiser Permanente acquired the health care group that operated the clinic, it closed and the doctor moved to Spokane, a 30-minute drive north.\n\nPoverty still plagues West Virginia, but signs of hope can be found\n\nCHARLESTON, West Virginia – Last June, I was dispatched home to West Virginia as a Report for America corps member to cover poverty for my hometown newspaper, the Charleston Gazette-Mail.\n\nOur corner of Appalachia is rooted in poverty — think black and white images of Lyndon B. Johnson’s “War on Poverty.\" Today, West Virginia remains one of the poorest states in the country, where one in five children struggle to access food. The history and policy failures here — our vulnerable children, cyclically disadvantaged — are complex in a place where despair lingers in the damp air between rolling hills and in people who can’t “just pick up and leave,” as outsiders advise, or who simply object to doing so.\n\nThe story of West Virginia’s entrenched poverty is told in data points, which land the state at or near the top of ominous national rankings: worst health, worst education levels, worst employment. But it is often more nuanced than that. A puzzling factor of the state’s ailing economy, for example, are our rolling mountains, which isolate towns from sorely needed industry and internet access, especially in \"coal country\" in the southern part of the state.\n\nTo fight health disparities, Native Hawaiians return to their agriculture, wellness roots\n\nHONOLULU — Up Highway 93, on the Hawaiian island of Oahu's west coast, the crisp air and crystalline water beckon from Makaha Beach. Urban Honolulu and touristy Waikiki fade into the distance. Here, one can imagine an ancient Hawaii, of shores pocked with salt ponds and deep valleys flushed with kalo loi, or taro fields.\n\nCenturies ago, before the golf resorts, fast-food strip malls, dialysis centers and waste landfills, Oahu was divided into land slivers, called ahupuaa, which still mark the land from summit to shore. Native Hawaiians used the ahupuaa system — a socioeconomic, geographic and climatic subdivision of land — to sustainably source food in tune with the seasons, never taking too much, sharing with neighbors and caring for the earth in return for the bounty it provided, a traditional practice today’s locals are trying to revive and maintain.\n\nIn the Afro-Caribbean heart of Puerto Rico, locals fight erosion, government indifference\n\nLOÍZA, Puerto Rico — The waves crashed loudly on the collapsed ruins of the Paseo del Atlántico, a walkway that once partially protected residents here from the volatile ocean. Erosion along this northernmost coast of Puerto Rico, nearly 20 miles east of San Juan, precipitated the promenade's destruction for more than a decade and, in 2012, it finally fell into the Atlantic, exposing the Parcelas Suárez neighborhood to the water's edge.\n\nIts 1,560 locals now fear daily for their homes and lives.\n\nConnecticut's 'monument' to tough-on-crime era sits almost empty as justice reforms shine\n\nSOMERS, Conn. — It’s not the rows of barbed wire along the building’s exterior, nor the locked metal door at the entrance. It’s not the buzzer for requesting entry, nor the distinct lack of windows; not the guard at the entrance and not the metal detector. It’s the thick, stale air inside Northern Correctional Institution that cuts you off from the outside world. The trapped oxygen between its silvery, worn floors and ceilings, caught between narrow hallways and cinder-block walls, lock you in.\n\nThe prison is a “monument” to another era, when officials locked up the “worst of the worst,” Dan Barrett, American Civil Liberties Union of Connecticut’s legal director told me during the course of my reporting on the facility. “I see Northern as the apex of a failed model.”\n\nI returned home to report on poverty in California. We're strained, but not broken.\n\nSAN JOSE, Calif. —The first thing locals mention are the homeless who line the streets of densely populated city blocks. They sleep restlessly in RVs; in vast encampments under the freeway; in tents in front of artisan coffee shops; on scraps of cardboard and discarded mattresses; on subway car seats that lurch from one end of town to another.\n\nThis is the Bay Area in 2020, infamous for its homelessness crisis and rising inequality, where the gulf between the rich and the poor can be seen every day on the street.

Now those trees have been ripped from the ground, leaving bare earth and dead stumps.\n\nGroundwater has been severely overpumped by farms in Morocco’s Souss-Massa region, and the water table has fallen dramatically. When the family’s well dried up, their farm was transformed into barren land.\n\nThe orange grove’s disappearance nearly five years ago eliminated the main source of income for Mbarek Belkadi, his three brothers, and their families. They’ve turned to whatever work they can find, often buying and selling fruit. Earning enough to survive has become a constant struggle.\n\n“All this land was irrigated with this well. Now it’s dead,” Mbarek said, standing beside piles of dry branches. “It’s finished here.”\n\nAs the family crowded around their old well, they pulled back the metal cover. A rusty cable lay in a heap next to it. This cable, they explained, was used to lower people into the hole to dig deeper. They dug down to more than 600 feet, and then gave up as the water level kept dropping. They could no longer afford a more powerful pump to lift the water from so far underground.\n\nAlongside farms that are still pumping from deep wells, many fields around the town of Sebt El Guerdane lie parched and abandoned. The faint patterns of ridges and furrows spread out across the soil, with only a stubble of weeds pushing through the hardened crust.\n\nThe overpumping of groundwater in this part of Morocco is symptomatic of a pervasive trend across North Africa and the Middle East. Much more water is being drained from the ground than is naturally recharged, and aquifers have been declining in countries from Tunisia to Iran to the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nNatural springs that once gushed into oases in the desert have dried up and disappeared in places across the region. As pumping has driven groundwater levels lower, some wells have been abandoned and farmlands have turned to dust.\n\n“In all these countries, groundwater is going down – no exception,” said Mohamed Aboufirass, a hydrogeologist who heads the Moroccan engineering consulting firm Resing. “We have to do something about it. And I think most of the governments in this region are aware of this. Morocco’s certainly is trying to.”\n\nIn fact, the Moroccan government has done more than most to combat its groundwater depletion problem. The government has invested in capturing more surface water and directing it to recharge aquifers. It’s promoting regional aquifer plans, charging many well owners based on how much they pump, and providing subsidies to encourage farmers to switch to water-saving irrigation systems.\n\nThe government helped back the construction of a water pipeline that carries water from dams to some of the citrus groves around Sebt El Guerdane. The distribution network from that pipeline, though, doesn’t reach Mbarek’s farm, so the family has been unable to buy the water.\n\nThey’ve managed to keep alive a couple rows of lemon trees using small amounts of water from the same municipal pipes that supply homes in the area. The lemon trees don’t produce nearly enough to support the family.\n\n“We are out hustling every day, trying to earn some money to bring it home,” Mbarek said. “But it’s always hard to find work because all the farmers around here have the same problem.”\n\nMorocco is a land of springs. Water that originates as rainfall and snow high in the Atlas Mountains filters down through fissures in the rocks and runs in streams, seeping into the aquifers of the lowlands.\n\nFarming towns have for generations depended on the streams gushing from the ground. But in the Souss-Massa plain, some springs have dwindled and stopped flowing. In farming villages near the town of Oulad Berhil, several water holes have vanished.\n\n“The springs were coming from there, where the palms are,” said a man who declined to give his name, motioning to date palms growing in a depression surrounded by plowed fields.\n\nDown a meandering dirt road, another dry spring has become a grassy pit filled with trash. It stopped flowing about 15 years ago.\n\nFor centuries, Moroccans dug underground irrigation tunnels called khettaras to capture and guide flows of groundwater to their fields. In many areas, the khettaras no longer flow and have been abandoned.\n\n“We used to get water from the spring on the mountain,” said Khadija Bouanek, a woman who was harvesting olives on the side of the road. “We used to go with mules to bring water for drinking.”\n\nSpeaking in Arabic through an interpreter, she explained that the spring went dry about a decade ago. That natural source of water was replaced with an artificial one when the government built a drinking water system that brings water from a well to people’s homes.\n\nIn parts of the Souss-Massa plain, groundwater levels have declined more than 200 feet, and that has had major consequences for farmers who have run out, said Nour-Eddine Laftouhi, a professor of hydrogeology at Cadi Ayyad University in Marrakech.\n\nMany rural people have been driven from their lands by the lack of water and have resettled in cities. Laftouhi said the entire country has seen “this phenomenon of migration from the rural areas to cities – because of water, because of drought, because of the depletion of water.” In places, he said, it’s because the springs that once sustained communities no longer exist.“In some areas of Morocco, it’s a very catastrophic situation,” Laftouhi said. “In some other regions, we have a rise up of the water level because of the introduction of irrigation systems, but this rise up of water level is not sufficient to balance, to counterbalance the depletion.”\n\nNear the western edge of the Sahara, the fertile alluvial plains at the base of the Atlas Mountains stretch out into some of the country’s most productive farmlands – greenhouses filled with tomatoes, fields of strings beans and olive trees.\n\nVast citrus groves produce navel and Valencia oranges, clementines and lemons. The fruit is sold in Russia, the Netherlands and other European countries, as well as the United States and Canada. Some of that fruit comes from the large groves around the towns of Sebt El Guerdane and Taroudant.\n\nAt one citrus grove, farmer Tarik Ait Hessi said he has access to water from the pipeline but prefers to pump water from wells because it’s less expensive.\n\n“We have to dig deep, like 250 meters underground, to find the water,” Ait Hessi said, standing beside the orange trees.\n\nOutside the walls of his orchard sits an abandoned farm. He said when the water level fell, the farm’s owners could not afford a new pump to draw water from such depths, so they left to look for work elsewhere.\n\n“Moving on is better than staying there and suffering,” Ait Hessi said.\n\nWhere the orchard used to stand, a lone tree remains in the field of barren furrows.\n\nAt Mbarek’s farm, the children used to help pick the oranges and lemons to sell. Now there’s relatively little work to do on the farm other than feeding the goats and three cows.\n\nHis 26-year-old nephew Mustafa found a job in construction. His 19-year-old nephew Khalid is working as an industrial electrician.\n\n“I want my kids to stay attached to the land and not sell it, to try to work the land even though it’s a hard time,” said Zahra Boulaich, Mbarek’s wife, whose youngest son is 14.\n\nMbarek explained that when the well first dried up, they dug deeper, about 30 feet at a time, until they reached more than 600 feet. Even then, they didn’t find water to pump.\n\n“I felt so sad when I had to take the trees from the ground, but I had to do it,” Mbarek said. After that, the brothers went to large farms to look for work. One of them started buying and selling fruit and vegetables.\n\nAs the family stood around the old well, Mustafa held up a broken piece of a mirror and reflected a shaft of sunlight down into the well. Other boys threw in rocks and listened to them ricochet off the walls until they hit the bottom with a faint thud.\n\n“There’s nothing to do here anymore,” said Abdel Kabir Belkadi, Mbarek’s brother.\n\nThe family owns another piece of farmland but has been renting it out because they don’t have enough money to invest. They tried to form a farming cooperative but couldn’t make it work.\n\nAcross the road, another farmer had just ripped out his orchard. The stumps has been sawed into pieces and lay in piles. Workers were loading the wood onto the back of a truck.\n\nThe dead trees are hauled out into the desert and left in mounds. Men shovel a layer of dirt atop the mounds and burn them, sending off smoke as the wood is turned into charcoal.\n\nAs groundwater has been depleted across the Middle East and North Africa, natural springs have gone dry in many places that were once desert oases. In a 2013 report published by the United Nations Development Program, researchers listed some of those lost springs – in Syria’s Palmyra oasis as well as springs in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Libya, western Egypt, southern Algeria and southern Tunisia.\n\nFarming consumes about 85 percent of the water that is used in Arab countries, and agricultural water use rose an estimated 32 percent in the region between 1995 and 2013, researcher Waleed Zubari of the Arabian Gulf University said in another report. He said much of the water that flows to farms is being wasted due to inefficient irrigation methods.\n\n“We have to practice agriculture wisely,” Zubari said. “We have to minimize the losses in agriculture.”\n\nHe and other scientists have warned that the region is vulnerable to climate change, which is increasing the pressures on water supplies in the same areas where aquifers are receding.\n\nAs water scarcity worsens, it threatens to limit countries’ development, shrink farming areas and contribute to the sorts of tensions that have already erupted into conflicts in Syria, Yemen and elsewhere.\n\n“I think the worst-case scenario is already playing out in the Middle East, in Syria,” said Jay Famiglietti, a professor at the University of California, Irvine, who studies groundwater depletion around the world using satellite measurements. Famiglietti, who is also the senior water scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, pointed out that while the war in Syria is about much more than water, the tensions that led up to it were aggravated by severe drought, declines in groundwater and the government’s failure to provide water for agriculture. Many farmers were forced to abandon their lands and move to cities, and resentment festered.\n\nUsing measurements from NASA’s GRACE satellites, a team including Katalyn Voss, Famiglietti and other scientists found that the north-central Middle East encompassing the Tigris-Euphrates region lost about 144 cubic kilometers of freshwater – an amount comparable to the Dead Sea – between 2003 and 2009.\n\nThey estimated that 60 percent of those water losses in Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran were due to groundwater depletion, largely water pumped from wells for farms. Turkey has also been holding back water in massive reservoirs, reducing the flows in rivers and contributing to falling groundwater levels downstream.\n\nThe satellite data also reveal enormous losses of groundwater beneath the Arabian Peninsula and across the Sahara, where Algeria, Libya and Tunisia are drawing down their aquifers.\n\nMany of the countries in North Africa and the Middle East rely on “fossil” aquifers that contain water deposited long ago when the climate was wetter. Scientists have estimated that water pumped from the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System in western Egypt has been underground for ages ranging from hundreds of thousands of years to more than a million years. As that water is drained from the ground, the aquifer is irreversibly diminished.\n\nIn places, those changes are visible aboveground as lakes recede. Lake Urmia in western Iran, for instance, has shrunk dramatically, mainly due to diversions of surface water but also due partly to groundwater depletion. In Ethiopia, Lake Haramaya has mostly dried up, and researchers say its decline was partly caused by groundwater pumping for the thirsty crop khat, a leafy plant that people chew as a stimulant in parts of East Africa and Yemen.\n\nTracing exactly how tensions over water contribute to larger conflicts can be difficult. But falling groundwater levels are a major problem in some of the same countries where conflicts are raging, including Yemen. There, khat farms have long been draining groundwater, and water tables have fallen to perilous lows.\n\n“We don’t see wars over water. But what we see is water is a contributing factor to conflicts that may start for another reason. They may be the straw that breaks the camel’s back,” said Peter Gleick, a water researcher who is president of the Pacific Institute and has studied how drought and mismanagement of water contributed to the conflict in Syria.\n\nHis organization keeps a detailed chronology of water-related conflicts around the world. In 2014, the incidents ranged from deadly protests over water shortages in South Africa to clashes over land and water sources pitting herders against farmers in Nigeria.\n\n“Conflicts over water turn violent when institutions fail,” Gleick said. “That’s one of the reasons in fact why more and more of the water conflicts we’ve seen in recent years have been sub-national conflicts and not between nations, because nations have diplomats, nations negotiate treaties, nations go to war only as a last resort. But ethnic groups, communities are much more likely to resort to violence if they feel they have no other recourse.”\n\nSome conflicts can simmer for years when groups of farmers or towns argue over water.\n\nIn Morocco, the village of Assads has a longstanding grievance with farmers who divert water from a spring upstream. The town’s mosque stands high above a dry riverbed in a valley where the mountains rise from the Souss-Massa plain. All around Assads, old irrigation canals are dry and strewn with rocks.\n\nTerraced fields have been abandoned, leaving them dotted with the dry stumps of dead date palm trees.\n\nYazid Nait, who grew up in the town, said he remembers there used to be plenty of water to grow grapes and other crops. Then a longstanding water-sharing agreement between the villages broke down.\n\n“They take all the water,” Nait said of the farmers upstream. He said that without water, his village has withered and many people have moved away.\n\nNait, who now lives in the United States and was back home for a visit, set out on foot for the spring, hiking through a deep canyon where seasonal downpours have sculpted the steep rock walls in smooth, undulating patterns. He passed citron farms on the hillsides where the canals were brimming with water and croaking frogs.\n\nAt the spring, the water gushed from a cavernous opening in the rocks into a dammed pool. Nait squatted down and splashed the cool water with a hand.\n\n“It’s pure water,” he said. “We need somebody to manage it well and give it to the other people. That’s it.”\n\nLarge-scale acquisitions of farmland are on the rise, and many land deals are occurring in Africa as agribusiness companies and other foreign investors move in to secure land with ample water supplies.\n\nThose deals are being tracked by researchers through an initiative called Land Matrix, a database that shows substantial and growing investments in Africa.\n\nSaudi Arabian, Indian and Chinese companies have acquired farmlands in Sudan. Companies from Portugal and the United Arab Emirates have started farming operations in Egypt. And companies from Israel, Austria, Turkey and other countries have signed deals for land in Ethiopia.\n\nSome researchers have labeled it “water grabbing” and have sought to quantify the amounts of water involved. Others have raised concerns about how rural communities will be affected as large companies move in and pump water to their fields.\n\nIn Ethiopia, the government has been promoting increased tapping of groundwater to boost food production. Seifu Kebede, a water scientist at Addis Ababa University, said less than 75,000 acres are irrigated with groundwater today and the government plans to increase that to nearly 5 million acres.\n\nIf the groundwater boom goes unregulated, Ethiopia will face some of the same pitfalls that other countries are grappling with, Kebede said. He cited severe depletion problems in India and parts of the United States such as California.\n\n“So there should be a balance, some level of regulation,” he said.\n\nIn a 2012 report published by the Rome-based International Land Coalition, a team of researchers concluded that Africa has become a prime target of investment in the land rush and that the “rights and livelihoods of rural communities are being put in jeopardy by the prevailing model of large-scale land acquisition.”\n\nThey called for governments and investors to not only recognize the land and water rights of small farmers but to also provide them with assistance and financing. They recommended “enforceable limits” on the extraction of water based on assessments of how much can be used sustainably.\n\nThat didn’t happen around Sebt El Guerdane, where small farmers were put out of business while big farms continued pumping.\n\nDown the road from Mbarek and Zahra’s farm, neighbor Ibrahim Akroud said that since his well ran dry, he has been hiring out his tractor for jobs on large farms.\n\n“Everybody is out of work in this area,” he said, sitting on his tractor. “And those who are left don’t have money and are hoping for better days.”\n\nElsewhere, near Taroudant, the government has helped small farmers by drilling deep wells that supply their fields. Mohamed Amine El Khesoini said he and his family used to struggle to find enough water to farm, but those problems went away when the government drilled the wells two years ago. A cooperative administers the wells and charges farmers for the water they use.\n\n“Everybody prefers to be on the government infrastructure,” El Khesoini said. His family sells their turnips and other vegetables at the weekly souk, where farmers spread out their produce on tables along with boxes of dates and bags of spices.\n\nAnother government program supports farmers with subsidies, paying those with small landholdings up to 100 percent of the cost of switching to drip irrigation or other efficient systems.\n\nSome large farms are also adopting more efficient irrigation systems out of necessity in order to control pumping costs and keep their wells running.\n\nAt one orange grove near Taroudant, manager Abdel Majid Etaouil said the farm already uses drip irrigation and is starting to experiment with underground tubing that sends water directly to the roots.\n\nStanding next to the farm’s irrigation pond, he said the groundwater has declined and the farm’s pump had to be lowered deeper into the well.\n\n“The big change was these last six months,” he said. If the water table keeps falling, they will soon have to drill deeper.\n\nMorocco has about 135 dams. Most of them were built during the rule of King Hassan II from 1961 to 1999, when the government’s water policies were focused largely on expanding the country’s water storage capacity and bringing drinking water to more Moroccans.\n\nIn the latter part of his rule, the government’s emphasis began to shift toward managing water supplies. A national water law passed in 1995 created river basin agencies and gave them responsibility for developing water management plans and monitoring groundwater use, among other tasks.\n\nBecause much more groundwater is being pumped than can naturally be recharged, the Souss-Massa river basin agency has a long-term plan to bring that deficit into balance, said Hamza El Himri, head of the agency’s sustainable water management division. “We’re trying to make up for this deficit and keep underground resources as strategic sources.”\n\nHe said the plan is based on halting the expansion of irrigated land, promoting conservation and moving toward the use of more treated wastewater and desalinated water.\n\nThe government is backing the construction of a desalination plant in Chtouka that will draw in seawater from the Atlantic and churn out water for agriculture – more than 100,000 cubic meters per day, or 26 million gallons. The aquifer has fallen nearly 100 feet beneath farms in Chtouka, and the area is in danger of losing its water supply due to saltwater intrusion. The desalination plant is intended to keep lucrative greenhouses in business and, at a cost, lessen the strains on the aquifer.\n\nThe Moroccan government, both under Hassan II and now under King Mohammed VI, has declared groundwater to be a strategic resource. In its national water strategy, the government lists the preservation of groundwater as a priority and calls for the reduction of pumping from overexploited aquifers. The document also emphasizes “participation, involvement and accountability” in managing groundwater.\n\nGovernment officials acknowledge that some of their efforts have failed and that a great deal more needs to be done. Abdeslam Ziyad, the national director of water research and planning, said most of the country’s aquifers are still being overexploited and attempts at controls have been ineffective. So the government is instead promoting an approach that involves engaging farmers and other water users and having them participate in deciding how to address the problem. They are working on regional plans called aquifer “contracts,” in which government officials and water users meet to diagnose the issues facing their aquifers and then agree collectively on actions to take.\n\n“There are solutions, but to succeed with this proposition, you cannot be too ambitious with the contracts,” Ziyad said. “We must be modest, and not have too many objectives.”\n\nIn the first attempts at contracts, it became clear that for farmers and others to meet the goals of reducing pumping, the bar couldn’t be set too high, Ziyad said. “The most important thing is to stop the hemorrhaging, not to continue with the same trend of overexploitation.”\n\nHe said the government is focusing on projects to artificially recharge aquifers by capturing surface water and directing it to areas where aquifers are depleted. But that has a relatively small impact and raising groundwater levels can take many years. So he said the government’s strategy emphasizes limiting pumping through the contracts, which are signed by participants once they are finalized.\n\nEven with those agreements, the challenges are monumental, especially because large farms have the ability to keep pumping while small farmers often don’t.\n\n“That is the big problem with groundwater resources: if we do not exploit this resource, there are neighbors who will exploit it,” Ziyad said. “And so it is a race for exploitation.”\n\nWhile trying to raise awareness, water regulators don’t plan to give up on enforcement. They are developing a monitoring system that uses satellite images to track any expansion of farmland. If an area that was previously brown turns green in the satellite images, they will be able to crack down on violators that are pumping more without permission.\n\nMuch of Morocco’s export crops are grown in the Souss-Massa region, where agriculture accounts for about 90 percent of the water consumption.\n\nThere are more than 25,000 wells in operation, and that’s only the number with permits, said Lhoussaine Bouchaou, a hydrogeologist at Ibn Zohr University in Agadir. He said many other wells have been drilled illegally and the groundwater has been so severely depleted that recharging the system would take a very long time.\n\nHe and other experts say the country has made significant progress. Aboufirass, whose consulting firm deals with water management, said the advantage of using aquifer contracts is that all parties are involved in the diagnosis and there is buy-in to work toward objectives.\n\nHe said government subsidies are also helping more farmers switch to drip irrigation.\n\n“If we save let’s say 10 percent by bringing drip irrigation, or 20 percent, that’s like building a dam,” Aboufirass said. “So we are in the learning curve, but I think we are getting somewhere.”\n\nMore still needs to be done to encourage farmers to install new irrigation systems and switch to crops that use less water, said Laila Mandi, director of the National Research Center on Water and Energy at Cadi Ayyad University. She said the river basin agencies also need more funding and staff to effectively enforce limits on pumping.\n\n“Everything must be changed to cope with this problem and to stop this,” Mandi said. “We have to preserve these resources for the future.”\n\nMorocco’s struggles mirror problems of declining aquifers around the world.\n\nMost aquifers are poorly monitored and poorly managed, so improving monitoring is one of the first steps that needs to be taken, Famiglietti said. He said there is tremendous potential for improving efficiency in agriculture.\n\n“We need to be thinking about more judicious crop choices, growing the right things in the right places,” Famiglietti said. “We need to be thinking about water pricing and charging the true value for water.”\n\nIf the world doesn’t take action to change course, he said, the results will be abysmal. More farmers are likely to be displaced. Depletion could lead to the collapse of farming regions. Water could become a source of greater conflict.\n\nIn many areas, the quantities of water that can be tapped haven’t been well studied. Famiglietti said that means people are “flying blind, and that is incredibly risky.”\n\nHe called for exploration of the world’s major aquifers and said the United States ought to have a coordinated national water plan.\n\n“I think one of the biggest things that has to happen is that people, the general population needs to really take ownership of this problem, really understand how heavily we rely on groundwater and really push for its sustainability over the long-term,” Famiglietti said. “It’s a very challenging problem because we’re basically addicted to groundwater and there is no one there to help. Globally, there’s no one there to help wean us off the groundwater.”\n\nFamiglietti said one of the biggest hurdles to addressing groundwater depletion problems on a global scale is the lack of a body where scientists and others can work on solutions.\n\nFamiglietti suggested creating a coordinated global conversation about water – a body that would parallel the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change or the equivalent of a Kyoto Protocol for water.\n\nIt may be just a matter of time, he said, until the world needs to hold its first global summit on groundwater.\n\nThis special report was produced with a grant from the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/12/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/experience/america/national-parks/2016/09/08/newest-national-park-service-sites/90066458/", "title": "Protected lands: The National Park Service's newest sites", "text": "Tracy L.

The rugged wilderness that inspired Henry David Thoreau, John James Audubon and Teddy Roosevelt offers spectacular vistas with views of Mount Katahdin, Maine’s highest peak. Paddlers revel on the whitewater streams and quiet lakes, while the dark night skies are ideal for stargazing, with occasional displays of the aurora borealis. The park is home to abundant wildlife including moose, black bear, white-tailed deer, snowshoe hare, American marten, bobcat and the federally threatened Canada lynx.\n\nKatahdin, which is already open to the public, offers a contrast to Acadia National Park, a two-hour drive to the east, said Christina Marts, community planner for the new monument. “Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument captures the unique culture and ecology of the north woods in Maine, a very different experience than the coastal environment and history of Acadia,” she said.

Highlights include monthly walking tours (the first Sunday of the month), and a new train service from downtown Chicago, with rangers meeting visitors on the platform. “They’ll be traveling on the same right-of-way that Abe Lincoln’s body came in on in the funeral train,” said Michael Shymanski of the Historic Pullman Foundation. “When it left for Springfield, it had a Pullman car attached.”\n\nValles Caldera National Preserve, N.M.: 150 years may seem like a long time until you contemplate the history of this ancient landscape in the Jemez Mountains. Formed by the collapse of a vast supervolcano more than a million years ago – hence the name “caldera,” or crater – Valles Caldera has been home to human beings for at least 11,000 years. The 89,000-acre former ranch, habitat for elk, cougar, deer, prairie dogs, and much more, is new in the administrative sense only; acquired by the federal government as a preserve and working ranch in 2000, access was limited until 2013. Now it has quickly become a favorite destination of cross-country skiers, hikers, anglers, equestrians, mountain bikers and nature-lovers of all kinds, and with the transfer to the National Park Service, will undoubtedly acquire an even larger following.\n\nWaco Mammoth National Monument, Waco, Texas: Sometime in the Ice Age, a cataclysmic event – perhaps a flash flood – trapped a nursery herd of Columbian mammoths grazing along the Bosque River. Fast-forward 70,000 years, when a couple of hikers were wandering along the riverbed and spied a large bone jutting out of a ravine. They dug it out and presented it to researchers at Baylor University. The four-decade paleontological project that ensued has revealed 24 of the massive beasts and a host of other Pleistocene-era creatures, and a dig shelter displaying the remains of six mammoths in-situ – that is, in the ground where they were found. So people get to see a real dig site, just with the benefit of air-conditioning.\n\nTule Springs Fossil Beds National Monument, Nev.: Another window onto the Paleolithic era can be found just a half-hour north of the neon lights of Las Vegas. Scattered about a 22,650-acre expanse of desert is a collection of fossilized remains spanning two Ice Ages – 250,000 years, unlike the Waco Mammoth site and other fossil beds. Here lie the remains of thousands of ancient mammoths, camelops (a larger relative of today’s camel), American lions (huge cats weighing up to 1,100 pounds) and sloths the size of grizzly bears. Paleontologists have found the remains of at least three species of wild horse, the dire wolf, saber tooth cats and even llamas, as well as mammoth tusks as tall as a man.\n\nIn 1962 and 1963, during what’s known as the “Big Dig,” giant equipment, funded in part by the Las Vegas casinos, dug a series of long trenches to break loose some of the fossils, looking for evidence of human remains. None were found, and the dig was abandoned – until years later, when the site was mapped and slated for development. A citizens group under the banner Protectors of Tule Springs realized what was at stake, got organized and lobbied to protect the site.\n\nHiking along the trenches can yield ancient discoveries – but take only photos, as all fossils must remain in place. Come prepared to “rough it” as there are no facilities and not much signage, but if you’re interested in paleontology, geology or even the peaceful desert landscape, you’ll enjoy a trip to this rare place. Hike early to avoid the brutal heat or come in the fall, when it cools down, and check the Facebook page to see what sorts of activities the park staff is organizing in other venues. A visitors center is in the works, but until then they are pushing the idea of “virtual visits” and taking the park to the community.\n\nNational Park Service: 10 hidden gems that deserve a visit\n\nBlackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor, Mass. and R.I.: Like the Pullman National Monument, this new park highlights a much more recent period in history, the dawning of the industrial age. Unlike Pullman, however, Blackstone was born out of an existing National Heritage Corridor. That corridor is a sprawling complex of 24 towns, a river and a canal that encompasses a variety of landscapes and a window into the natural and industrial history of the region. Blackstone is by far the most developed of the new national parks, with seven visitors centers to help travelers sort out their options.\n\nPlans foresee the National Historical Park being composed of six distinct nodes: the Slater Mill in Pawtucket, site of the first water-powered cotton spinning mill in North America; Blackstone River State Park; the mill villages of Ashton and Slatersville in Rhode Island; Whitinsville, once the nation’s largest manufacturer of textile machinery, and Hopedale in Massachusetts.\n\nIf it’s nature you’re looking for, you’ll find plenty of that, as well; the park also includes the Blackstone River and Canal and its tributaries. The Blackstone River is a playground for canoeists and kayakers, meandering 46 miles from Worcester, Mass., to Providence, R.I., flowing through cities, quaint villages, farmlands, and forests. The Blackstone River Bikeway will also eventually extend 48 miles from Worcester to Providence; currently, about 20 miles of trail are open. So don’t miss a chance to pedal – or paddle – your way through a fascinating slice of New England’s past. But you can begin exploring the history of the park and corridor without leaving your home, as the National Park Service has posted hours of interpretive videos to share some of the many stories of the region, from the underground railroad to the women’s rights movement to the Nipmuc people who originally inhabited these lands.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/09/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/05/01/droughts-human-caused-global-warming-have-worsened-dry-times/3643819002/", "title": "Droughts: Human-caused global warming have worsened dry times", "text": "Tree ring data can be used to find droughts as far back as 1400.\n\nGreenhouse gases caused by humans have been affecting global drought since the early 20th century.\n\nLead author Kate Marvel, a climate modeler at Goddard and Columbia, said, “It’s mind boggling.\"\n\nThe secret was in the trees.\n\nLooking at tree rings from ancient trees, scientists in a new study say they've finally found the fingerprint of human-caused global warming on drought and rainfall patterns worldwide from as far back as 1900.\n\nAmazingly, tree ring data is an accurate gauge to determine past climates: The rings are thinner in years when it's dry and may not grow at all in stressful conditions like drought.\n\nIn fact, researchers can use tree ring data to \"find\" droughts as far back as 1400, centuries before reliable weather data was available.\n\nAccording to NASA, \"we now know that greenhouse gases caused by humans have been affecting global drought since the early 20th century.\"\n\nClimate change, aka global warming, occurs because fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal are burned to power our world. This burning process releases carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases into our atmosphere.\n\n\"The big thing we learned is that climate change started affecting global patterns of drought in the early 20th century,\" said study co-author Benjamin Cook of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies and Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. \"We expect this pattern to keep emerging as climate change continues.\"\n\nThis is the first study to provide historical evidence connecting human-generated emissions and drought at near-global scales between 1900 and 2005.\n\nLead author Kate Marvel, a climate modeler at Goddard and Columbia University, said, “It’s mind boggling. There is a really clear signal of the effects of human greenhouse gases on the hydroclimate.”\n\nIt's also the first time researchers have identified long-term global effects on the water supplies for crops and cities around the Earth.\n\nIn a warming world, some regions are expected to get drier, while others will get wetter. The study suggests this pattern will continue:\n\n\"All the models are projecting that you should see unprecedented drying soon, in a lot of places,” Marvel said.\n\nMany of the areas expected to dry out are centers of farming, and could become permanently arid. “The human consequences of this, particularly drying over large parts of North America and Eurasia, will likely be severe,” the study said.\n\nThe study was published Wednesday in the peer-reviewed British journal Nature.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/desert-magazine/2019/08/20/california-desert-artists-offer-poetry-prose-essays-beauty/1842913001/", "title": "California desert artists offer poetry, prose, essays on beauty", "text": "There’s beauty to be found in the California desert.\n\nI’ve learned to predict the best sunsets by the number of clouds in the sky. The fewer there are, the less sorbet streaks across the horizon.\n\nSo, when dusk settles in amid myriad white puffs, I jump in my car with my camera to race the sun to the West.\n\nJagged peaks line the distance as I wind around bends and turn down the static that blares from the radio. Boulders stand stoic in spite of their imperfections. Sometimes, I pull over to capture the beams of light illuminating their crooked edges. And still the sun sets.\n\nHere’s the thing about this journey – there is no destination. When the golden moment comes, I pull into a ditch on the side of the road and venture out to find Joshua trees forming black silhouettes against the watercolors seeping upwards into the sky. My shutter flits to preserve the instant before it’s gone, but more often than not, I find myself kneeling down in the dirt to take in the sight without the lens. There’s something wild about reveling in the nip of wayward winds as the sun melts into the horizon.\n\nPoet Arthur Chapman once wrote, “Out where the world is in the making, where fewer hearts in despair are aching, that’s where the West begins.”\n\nWherever you are in the desert, you can watch dusk fade into dust.\n\nFor centuries, locals and visitors alike have searched these peaks and valleys. Those of us who come face to face with the elements emerge with a tale.\n\nThree years ago, I asked our community to share those stories. Since September 2016, DESERT magazine has published responses submitted by artists from Palm Springs to Joshua Tree and beyond.\n\nThese are “the ways in which we seek – and find – beauty in the desert.”\n\nHere’s to simply showing up.\n\nKristin Scharkey, Editor\n\nkscharkey@gannett.com\n\nIt’s 1980 and I’m 9 years old, walking down Palm Canyon at dusk with my grandfather. He’ll only live another five years. A heart attack will kill him – his fourth, or maybe his third, since I’m not sure if the story of him having a heart attack while catching a marlin is actually true – so this is borrowed time, which is probably why he’s smoking a cigar. “Don’t tell your nana,” he says, lighting up.\n\nIt’s fall and everything is reddish-gold: gaudy baubles in their jewelry store display cases. Brake lights from cruising Cadillacs refracting out from store windows, painting the sidewalk brilliant. Even Morrie Geyer – proprietor of Morrie Geyer Menswear, standing outside his shop in a scalloped shirt opened halfway to his belly-button, his tan chest exposed – seems to glow. Or maybe that’s the life-sized mannequin of Morrie. It’s hard to remember the difference all these years later. You ever saw a person standing next to a mannequin of themselves, well, it distorts reality.\n\n“Have you heard from your dad?” my grandfather asks. I tell him I haven’t. He takes a puff from his cigar, let’s it go from his mouth. “When was the last time?”\n\n“I don’t know,” I say. “My birthday?”\n\nWe linger in front of See’s Candies, across the street from Bullock’s. The sweet smell of chocolate and confection rises around us, but then it’s been like that the entire time we’ve been walking, Palm Canyon seemingly filled with candy stores, men in the front windows spreading out fudge, their aprons smeared. Teenage girls stepping out to give you a sample, and it’s like magic, candy from nowhere, and free.\n\n“Well,” my grandfather says, “I’m right here. If you want to talk about something, just talk about it with me.” He gazes down, forces a smile, which makes him look like my mom. They have the same lips. This morning they got into a screaming fight, she stormed out of the condo, spent the day by the pool, smoking, my grandfather’s last words hanging between them: If I gave you a dime, you’d spend a dollar. “You understand? Man-to-man, Man.” A pause, the street moving fast around us now, lights, snippets of conversations, the roar of a muscle car, a breeze that feels like winter ... or maybe none of these things, just a boy and an old man on the street. “We should get some lollipops,” he says, and we go into the store. “Get whatever you want and whatever your sister would want. Buy the whole store if you want.”\n\nHere’s the thing about beauty: It doesn’t need to be physical. It doesn’t even need to be emotional. It can be a moment of simple kindness that you forget about entirely, until one day you’re stopped on Palm Canyon, a street you hardly drive down anymore, because you live across town.\n\nYou know how that goes.\n\nYou hardly get west of Bob Hope during season.\n\nYou look at the people crowding the sidewalk, something to watch while you wait for the light to change. To get on with your life. Get off this street. All this traffic. All these tourists. But then you see a boy in front of See’s and you remember yourself, standing right there, so long ago that you’re closer in age today to your grandfather than your childhood self. And it’s all you can do not to run out into the street to find your grandfather, too. To tell him you heard him, that you still hear him, on beautiful fall days, at dusk, in the smoke of a stranger’s cigar, always when you least expect it, like driving through the city of your past or waiting for some distant golden future.\n\nTod Goldberg is the New York Times best-selling author of more than a dozen books, including the novels “The House of Secrets,” which he co-authored with New York Times best-selling author Brad Meltzer and “Gangsterland,” a Hammett Prize finalist.

Not the chosen solitude where it’s 78 degrees at the start of summer, the air is perfect, the sun a soft lemon. It’s the kind of solitude that leaves you stranded. The air is heavy and the rain hasn’t lifted for days. The streets, which in a different light run silver, today are rivers of mud and all is a murk of gray. A lingering rain has soaked the fire logs. They burn smoke. There are four cartons of eggs in the refrigerator, half expired, along with a bag of old apples.\n\nOn days like this I would drive. But I’ve been without my pickup truck, a winter heartbreak. The drive would lift the solitude, the unchosen kind. It’s a freedom unmeasured. And one unmeasured freedom I’ll share with you. There’s a lookout on the 15, high in the San Bernardino Forest. In the valley below, a freight train comes through, diverting and romantic. The first time I saw it I pulled over. The train was long and winding and rolled cautiously downward. I watched and thought of its countless journeys, each a tale. The moon shone bright on the valley and I, a speck in those mountains all around me, wanted to throw my hands up and be lifted like a child. The train vanished into cottoned layers of fog. It was time to go home. I took the backroads to Highway 247 and then through Johnson Valley.\n\nEach time I’d drive to the outlook to see the train in the valley, it would somehow be there faithfully, a familiar anticipation, the kind that fulfills a seeking heart. It made my heart remember an anticipation of a different kind. A time I put on a dress and a faux fur stole and went out to a concert hall to hear the strings, at the hopes a companion might be there, and he was, on the other side of the crowd waiting for me.\n\nAnd what else is beauty but an anticipation, a symphony in our hearts.\n\nOn this morning, the morning of expired apples and mud rivers, sometime around three o’clock in a dream, a train appeared at my door hovering in its own steam. I heard the gardenia branches thrashing against my window and saw the train waiting there. It was a lustrous black metal, with passenger benches of shining leather.\n\nI was tired and disoriented. I got out of bed, my feet cold on the winter floor. Putting on my hooded robe draped over the bedpost, I walked through the door and stepped onto the train. We glided past the creosote bushes through the desert down through Morongo Valley and up to Tahquitz Peak where I stepped off, and walked through the pines, kindling under my bare feet. I turned to see if the train was still there. And perhaps I awoke.\n\nRecovering from illness at her mother’s farmhouse in Pennsylvania in 2012, Mercy read the Hemingway letters.

With its kinks and curves it reaches out with divine secrets. It summons us with whisper and warning.\n\nIt makes us feel foolish and weak as it stands solid and reliable. It humbles us with its simplicity and complexity, with its beauty and Draconian texture.\n\nThe Joshua tree, it will outlive us all and never have to check its Instagram account…\n\nSerene to some, but others could not take the quiet, the calm, the dead air that the desert delivers. Can your ego survive the silent treatment? Because the desert has questions. Who are you? What is your purpose?\n\nSolitude and silence beckon and insist that you face the man in the mirror and peel back the layers.\n\nIf you do find yourself looking for some chatter, there is no shortage of prismatic personalities.\n\nThe cast of characters one has the propensity to stumble upon out here could turn Wonderbread into pumpernickel, enriching your soul or scaring you away with peculiar peril.\n\nWe’ve got shamans and shaman wanna-be’s, cowboys and cowboy wanna-be’s, hippies, hipsters, yuppies and tricksters.\n\nWe’ve got stoners, prophets, tourists and hermits, ex-movie stars, new movie stars, rock stars and rock climbers. Filmmakers, drug takers, Marines, witches, bikers and city slickers looking to invest in the latest desert trend; selling spirituality to the lost, the hungry, and the full.\n\nAnd then, there’s the hawk. Can we talk about the hawk with its wings majestic and wide, soaring over our petty chaos and inflamed importance? Its only worry but to find its next meal, it flies freely over sacred land, taking in miles of beauty each day. The coyote, the rattler, the scorpion, the rabbit, just to name a few others that inhabit this arid sand-land with us.\n\nAs creepy crawly as some of these creatures may be, I’ve learned to honor, respect and enjoy them in their natural environment.\n\nYou can’t talk about the desert without commenting on the cosmos… The vast and unexplainable speckled sky. Constellations so clear and the moon like a floating mystic kite. Its power surges and permeates your soul on a starry night. The swirly sunsets of port-wine cheese melt into the western hemisphere as we all grab our phones to capture and behold. The murky and moody shades of blue that don’t even exist in a box of Crayola display themselves in a sorrowful soliloquy. What better place to contemplate the universe and the meaning of life than under the Mojave moon?\n\nThere is one question I have consistently been asked by out-of-towners over the years with much bewilderment: “What do you do here?” And it’s funny because I have never been at a loss for something to do. It’s quality not quantity out here in these parts.\n\nWherever you are, there you are; and where is that exactly? In the middle of nowhere or the middle of somewhere?\n\nHome on the range or outer space?

It took 25 years of living in the Coachella Valley for me to be drawn into the mystic, spiritual beauty of the desert landscape.\n\nThe awakening was more than what my eyes could see. It was an out of body experience, a feeling that hit an emotional nerve, like a familiar song on the radio that brings back good childhood memories. I felt sensitive and emotional, and I silently cried.\n\nIt began in the summer of 2017, assigned to an investigative story in Joshua Tree. Missing hikers. The twists and turns, like a Law & Order episode, were constant. I was in the high desert for secret meetings and interviews, early mornings, and weekends. My seasoned reporter instincts kept me coming back for more. Or, was it the need to see the high desert sunrise? The calm across the desert? The individual Joshua trees backlit by the perfect light of the rising sun? Breathtaking, leaving a gulp in my throat every time. For me, the beauty of the desert includes the people. Their stories, their seemingly self-confidence to be themselves and find a home and life where others only see sand.\n\nThe hikers were found dead. A murder/suicide. An emotional ride for me as I got to know the father of the male hiker and the group of people who showed up every week to help him find his son. We now share a bond, brought together by tragedy.\n\nTragedy with a backdrop of truly amazing beauty, so heavenly, something more than who we are. My eyes have been open all along the way, but I only began to see the true beauty of the desert in the summer of 2017.\n\nKaren Devine is an award-winning television journalist and investigative reporter for KESQ News Channel 3, the ABC affiliate and Fox in the Coachella Valley.

I would spin the globe as fast as I could and stop it with my finger. Wherever my finger would land, I declared that I would travel there one day. My little game was the precursor to the bucket list concept. Since my finger mostly stopped in the middle of an ocean, I had to spin and spin until I hit some land. One time, I spun the globe so hard that it orbited out of its contraption onto the floor. I retrieved the globe like a basketball player readying to take a foul shot — one hand on the North Pole and the other on Antarctica. Antarctica subsequently went onto my bucket list.\n\nAfter becoming an adult, I no longer left my travel inspirations to chance. I informed myself the old-school way — by reading. I read adventure stories and pondered over travel magazines and maps.\n\nIn 1966, Francine, my best friend and I, were standing in front of Whisky A Go Go in Hollywood. Two guys drove up in a convertible. One of the guys asked if we wanted to go to Palm Springs for the weekend. I eagerly responded with a yes! There were no mothers around to tell us otherwise. I had never heard of Palm Springs, but I did wonder if it was some place magical since these guys were leaving the excitement of Hollywood even if just for a weekend. I presumed that this Palm Springs must be the place to be. Well, Francine put a damper on this notion. “We-are-not-going-anywhere-with-these-guys,” she said in a motherly tone. I recovered after a fleeting moment of disappointment when I soon realized that I could just add Palm Springs to my travel list.\n\nI finally made it to Palm Springs — the first time in 1974 just to see if it was really real, and the second time in 1992 when I came to stay. I have made a continent-full of scratch offs on my travel list. The desert surroundings mirror and even surpass some of the exotic destinations that I have traveled. If I want a little bit of the outback, I take to the Lykken Trail. If I want the Aegean Sea, I go to — you guessed it — the Salton Sea.\n\nThe desert provides a dramatic backdrop for which artists practicing all art forms can create and curate their craft.

Strong enough to hold my weight and the weight of another, their grayish-white trunks and branches lay barren of leaves all winter. Despite the harsh desert climate, they seem to still grow with little water.\n\nIt was last summer that it started. Laying in my hammock, I would feel water drop from the clear blue sky onto my warm skin.\n\nTiny droplets sprinkled my face and arms.\n\n“Do you feel it raining?” I’d ask a reclining hammock friend.\n\n“No. There are no clouds in the sky,” they’d reply.\n\nEvery time I felt a water droplet on my skin, I would rush to find it.\n\nBut it would cease to be there.\n\nAs the mysterious disappearing act continued in this way, I started to feel I was going mad.\n\nWeeks into spring this year, I went out to revisit the trees to discover they were bare. Despite having one of the wettest winters the desert has had in decades, the trees were not part of the super bloom. I hurried to water them immediately. Two days later, they sprouted their first leaves. Ecstatic, I lay in my hammock for the first time in a while.\n\nSoon, I felt a drop of water on my skin again. I gazed up at the sky, embraced by its radiating sunshine. Then, turning to look down at my arm, I saw it – a clear, tiny water droplet!\n\nI digested for just a moment that I had seen it with my own eyes. Admiring these two trees in wonderment, I asked myself how many lives have they lived before?\n\nThese magical raining trees – are they crying? If they are crying … is it from joy or sadness?\n\n“Which is it, oh magical trees?” I asked aloud.\n\n“What has happened to your spirits that have resulted you to communicate this way? As the wind rustles your branches and you sprout new leaves, is it growing pains? Is it the happiness of being alive?”\n\n“Will you tell me if I listen?”\n\nIn my blue striped hammock, I pray.\n\n“I will listen intently, and watch for your tears,\n\nFor you both have been my confidantes these past few years,\n\nYou saw me weep as well,\n\nBared witness to my struggle on a fateful day,\n\nThat it takes to heal and grow in the desert.\n\nYou saw me laugh ’til I couldn’t anymore,\n\nWhisked away as I read adventures through your branches.\n\nI will hear your story, just as I have told you mine.\n\nI will live inspired by your strength,\n\nLean into your supportive trunks,\n\nCherish it,\n\nFor there are so many stories your branches have to tell,\n\nAs they twist and turn throughout your life.\n\nAs you continue to thrive in the harshest of deserts.”\n\nLauren Bright resides in Morongo Valley. She considers her loves to be writing, dancing and painting. Also, she has a cat named Cat.\n\n“Desert time” was a concept I heard often before finally moving to the desert. I understand that it means things just take longer here. The plants and trees grow slower. People’s lives move slower. I heard it is hard to get things happening because, well, “desert time.” I thought, “I have been living in cities and working in fast-paced industries for 15 years. I am going to keep my usual pace.”\n\nLiving in the high desert for over one year now, I have lived through all the weather changes, the wildlife cycles. I have observed the subtleties of each season. I have experienced how the light changes throughout the year. I have been shocked at how the position of the sun varies so much from winter versus summer. In the winter, the light shines well into my living room on the south side of the house. In summer, the sun is so far north that it is on the other side of the house and doesn’t even shine into the living room at all.\n\nTime is funny here.\n\nIn the summer, it is easy to naturally wake up at or before sunrise. Get up and try to cram in as much as you can before the midday sun forces you indoors to a slow halt. The animals are out as well, to make the most of the morning. The roadrunners and gamble quails scurry around for snacks. Ground squirrels scramble from bush to bush to avoid becoming one. A nap in an air-conditioned space is the best way to avoid the afternoon heat. The hours from 1 to 6 p.m. are slow. Sluggish. The sun is relentless and I am convinced it will never drop below the mountains to the west. Five hours that last seemingly forever. As the sun is about to dip, but there is still light in the sky, turning on the stove or grill to cook dinner doesn’t seem so insane anymore. While cooking dinner, get some chores done before daylight is totally gone. Eat dinner al fresco. Take a walk around the neighborhood. The light on the plants then is magical. Saturated colors make everything look so rich. The bunnies come out to hop around and eat.\n\nIn the winter, days look beautiful from inside the house. The sun is shining, but finally not oppressive. Skies are clear and blue. But, go outside and the winds are maddening. They can last days, weeks. Everything around your house blows away unless it is heavy or bolted down. Our old aluminum windows rattle and shake all night. Will the Joshua tree finally uproot and fall over? Am I safe sleeping under a giant window of glass? Will the windows break and blow in? We pick up roof shingles around the yard after the big winds. Nature is slowly taking our house apart. The view is beautiful, but there are small opportunities of good working time. Then you race against daylight, because once the sun sets, it is pretty much time to be inside. Eat dinner and head to bed. Desert midnight is around 8 to 9 p.m.\n\nWe all know the desert is a place of extremes. Hot and cold. Dry weather and flash floods. Time is also an extreme here. There are days that fly by, when the sun time is short and you can never get enough done. Then there are those summer months that it seems will never end. You have cabin fever and wonder why the hell you moved to such an unsustainable environment.\n\nMy favorite days are the ones where I need to get to the studio to work, but I am so in awe of the beautiful landscape that I procrastinate by wandering around the land, checking on new blooms and plants. I know that I need to hurry up and get to work, but for some reason my instinct is to slow down and enjoy the scenery because, well, desert time.\n\nJanelle Pietrzak is a full-time weaver. After a lifetime of moving all around the country, she has settled in the high desert town of Yucca Valley where she owns a textile design studio and tiny shop called All Roads.\n\nAfter a long week of work, the last thing I wanted to do was get up from my couch. As I watched my Miami Dolphins squeeze out a last-second win, I could see the sun starting to cast a faint pink glow on the Little San Bernardino Mountains, and the weight of regret tugged at me.\n\nI’d told myself I would find a way to get outdoors that weekend, but with a bum ankle, a party Saturday night and the remnants of a hangover still lingering, I figured it might have to wait. The mountains and their hiking trails would still be there next Saturday.\n\nThen my gaze caught my Canon DSLR, almost forgotten in the corner of the room. It brought me back to the afternoon I first drove up the 10 freeway, and saw Mt. San Jacinto and its snow-covered tip two Februarys ago. My bookshelf, my TV, my kitchenware, my closet of clothes – once removed from a moving truck and carried into a room that felt so foreign then – now set the stage for a place that felt a little too much like a home I took for granted.\n\nI’d always promised my mom, who screeches for joy whenever she walks out of my apartment to see the mountains in the morning while visiting, that I’d never stop appreciating this indescribable place where I lucked into a job. So instead, I got up, quickly grabbed jeans and a long-sleeve shirt from my bedroom floor, snatched my Canon and my car keys, and hopped in my Ford Fusion to try and beat the sunset.\n\nDespite my heavy foot on the gas – screaming up Highway 62 as fast as other cars and traffic lights would allow – when the young woman at the gate to Joshua Tree National Park said, “Have a great day,” I worried I would leave disappointed.\n\nStill, I wove back and forth through the park and finally reached Keys View, taking the last parking spot as droves of people with their tripods had beaten me. Rather than try to shuffle between them, though, I struggled to find the unmarked rocky path up to Inspiration Point, nearly breaking into a dead sprint in my boots to cover the half-mile as quickly as my legs would move.\n\nAt the top, though the wind whipped and the couple sitting next to me snickered in between kisses and puffs of their blunt, it was the deepest quiet my ears had sensed in quite some time. As the big ball of light began to inch its way behind the towering mountains that create Palm Springs’ border, the click of my shutter broke the silence in the most pleasing way.\n\nTime was only defined by the dipping of the sun, the settling of the clouds, the ebbing and flowing of the reds, oranges and pinks of the sky, and the adjusting of the exposure on my camera. No Facebook notifications. No football scores. Just an unparalleled front seat to the greatest light show in Southern California.\n\nI was right. That trail, those mountains, the majestic sunset will be there tomorrow, next weekend, even next year, but I may not. And when I wake up in an urban high-rise apartment with towers of brick, metal and glass obstructing my view, I’ll regret those days and nights I put off adventure and beauty for another day.\n\nNathan Brown grew up in the freezing winters and humid summers of the Midwest, just north of Indianapolis in Indiana.

This piece originally appeared on her blog.\n\nThis winter, in the shimmer of morning, I was invited to stay on the west shore of the Salton Sea in a house hidden in the date palm plantations of the desert valley, a welcomed quelling of the loneliness and wind of desert mountains. The invitation appeared the way all things do in the desert, by secret prayer, answered. The house was small: one room with sand-plastered walls painted magnolia, one wooden bed, one cane-backed plantation chair, and a large arched window.\n\nI accepted the invitation and spent afternoons curled on soft cotton, piled high, white with warmed patina. Protected by the sacred fronds, I’d drift in and out of daydreams and look out onto the desert.\n\nAt the end of the rows of date palms and ranches was a sea, neglected and forgotten, with waters of murky lavender that lapped onto powdered fish bones. Spellbound, after sleep, I would visit and stand on the sacred bones as the spun gold of the heavens faded.\n\nOne duskfall, I noticed across the sea on another shore, inklings of splendor and echoed lullabies. I wanted to be nearer, so I pushed a paint-chipped boat into the water, climbed in and without oars, trusted the sea’s current.\n\nI drifted across the wakes until I arrived at a row of quiet dwellings. Upon stepping out of my boat, I noticed a girl sound asleep. Hovering above her bed, her black hair fell like a waterfall. She slept in the looming twilight as the ruffled gauze of her faded apricot gown whisked the air.\n\nShe had been there all along on the opposite shore and had slept all winter. I kept my distance so as not to wake her. I wondered who loved her. And couldn’t help but imagine love must have sent her into such a peaceful sleep that she floated above her own piled cotton. She glowed in the sea’s reflection of the arriving moon.\n\nI left her sleeping and continued on. The ghostly sands blew onto the streets past the lonesome shacks.\n\nI heard a melody in the distance. A chanteuse sang through an open window. Her porcelain fingers plucked notes from the strings of a well-traveled guitar. She sang of her heartbeat just as I could feel mine. Strangers gathered around to listen to her words of sweet loss and heard her long after the singing. I fell asleep under a grand tamarisk tree in her yard and in the morning as I opened my eyes, its branches swam in the air, still lullabied.\n\nI walked to the sand to find my boat. The sea was now a shade of mint tsavorite. A poem set softly alight by the sun read: “I still love you.”\n\nMercè Clay wrote this in homage to the Bombay Beach Biennale 2019, and was especially inspired by installations “Loving, Loving” by Vera Sola, “Levitation” by Josèphine Wister Faure featuring gown by Heidi Merrick and “I Still Love You” by Olivia Steel. Thanks to Lauren Brand, hostess, for an invitation to the evening.\n\nPulled over at a Vista Point to check the oil,\n\nI step out barefoot onto gravel\n\nWarmed by the sun.\n\nThere’s no cell reception and\n\nNo cars in either direction –\n\nJust clouds swept from the bottom by wind.\n\nI’ve been driving home all day into a breeze,\n\nThat has the baked earth smell I find so comforting,\n\nAs I pass from the Sonoran Desert into the Mojave.\n\nI look down the slope to a wash\n\nObscured by desert willow and\n\nPlants I don’t know the name of.\n\nI’m feeling thoughtful,\n\nSo I consider all the roots tapping into\n\nThe moisture from old rain,\n\nAnd beneath them an ancient aquifer,\n\nAnd beneath that, rocks that may never be exposed,\n\nHeated not from the sun, but from the core of the earth.\n\nI wonder what it’s like from underneath looking out:\n\nThe plant root hairs,\n\nThe tiniest dimples of my footprints,\n\nThe long rugburn of the highway,\n\nAnd the moon,\n\nA faded crescent today,\n\nLike an angel on the earth’s shoulder.\n\nKara Sajeske is an illustrator living and working in Joshua Tree.

So many people talking at me, the sound of dishes clanking and froth wands whistling at my regular coffee shop. Music playing at work. Class lectures. The sound of the dishwasher running. Somehow, even at the end of the day, when the lights are turned off and my phone’s across the room, I can still hear the electricity of the city humming through my walls and my pillow.\n\nAnd then it starts all over again.\n\nAlarm. Breakfast sizzling. Traffic honking. 8 hour lectures. People talking. Dishes clanking. Music playing. Washers going. Outlets humming. Alarm. Breakfast sizzling. Traffic honking. 8 hour lectures. People talking. Dishes clanking. Music playing. Washers going. Outlets humming.\n\nSilence.\n\nAnd I hold my breath, cause surely this is a dream.\n\nIt’s still...silent.\n\nAm I dreaming? I guess it’s not technically silent. But there’s no noise.\n\nI hear the wind whispering and the sand grinding beneath my feet. As if I were pinching salt between my fingers.\n\nI’m back to the infinite golden hills at sunset. No man or skyscraper in sight. The lands so empty, I feel my mind breathing just from the sight of it.\n\nStillness.\n\nAnd sadly it’s not a dream. But gladly it’s a memory. One from not too long ago.\n\nI know some people who feel abandoned in the desert. They feel alone and forgotten, forsaken and betrayed. Yet, how come I find rest in a stagnant, barren land.\n\nI once heard God sing a desert song.\n\nIt wasn’t what I expected.\n\nIt was one note. Held out for a long moment. And there were no instruments behind the one note.\n\nJust silence. And it put me right to sleep.\n\nI imagined him painting the hills. With as much intention as the boulders in Yosemite. That kind of intentionality in art puts my soul at ease and my mind to sleep.\n\nI don’t live in the desert anymore.\n\nI live in a busy city, within a busy life with a lot of noise. But I’ve found that my sobering moments, the ones that take place in my mind, take place in the desert where I use to reside.\n\nEmily Wall is a 23 year old full-time student studying acting, dance and film in Redding California, though her hometown is Palm Desert.

This woman meant well, I’m sure, but I didn’t plant the rosebushes.\n\nI did spend many hours in my rocking chair on my front porch, staring across the arroyo into the chaparral covering the neighboring mountain. I breathed in the air scented with pungent white sage, the spicy vanilla of the blooming redshank, and the patchouli-like stink of our tiny native wildflower whose name no one knows. I drew the desert air deep into my lungs and released it as slowly as I could. Seconds of breathing turned into hours which turned into days. Time passes slower in the desert, it seems. Time passes, but grief does not.\n\nEach loss carries its own means of navigation, but no promise that the next one – because one thing life can promise is that there will forever be a next loss until finally, restfully, we reach the ultimate one ourselves – but there is no promise that the next one will hurt any less. With each loss we learn to bear not only this one, but that one. That next one coming.\n\nWhen I was a little girl growing up in the Imperial Valley, 15 miles from the Mexican border, after every earthquake my family would drive into the desert and search for signs of damage. It was never hard to find.\n\nThere were rifts, fissures and ridges. There were fresh new cracks in the rocky sand whose soft edges crumbled into the tiny abyss when we stepped too near. The earth had changed. The face of the map had been re-drawn. One had to learn a new method of navigation, if, say, the road had shifted a few feet away. But the journey wasn’t over. The journey didn’t end because the road did.\n\nMy heart, my life, is a quake-damaged landscape with areas labeled ‘Here there be monsters,’ but I’ve learned not to avoid them. I explore those areas tentatively, offer a gentle stroke of recognition to the monsters I encounter, tell them they are welcomed to take up residence. My monsters are my battle scars, my mythological reminders that I fought and lost but yet live. I welcome them, each one, lovingly, because even the wildest beast may be tamed.\n\nThe desert sky is wide enough that I don’t need to plant a garden to reflect my losses. The dry wind bears it, each scent supports it. Ultimately, the space here may hold multitudes. Grief is a monster that never goes away. We carry him forever; but in time we learn to manage the weight of him. Just carrying him makes us stronger.\n\nSara Marchant received her Masters of Fine Arts in Creative Writing and Writing for the Performing Arts from the University of California, Riverside/Palm Desert.

I get up, change from my pajamas into a simple T-shirt, gym shorts and tiny tennis shoes. I’m 6 years old and I’m happy.\n\nMy mom, my sister and I drive to the entrance of the Sabas Nieves trail of the El Ávila Mountains in Caracas, Venezuela. I always get lazy at the start, but once we start going up the trail, the trees, the views of downtown Caracas and the promise of my favorite ice cream once we get back down keeps me going.\n\nHiking the Sabas Nieves trail was a weekend tradition back then. Years have passed, our family grew and traditions changed, but the memories of our hikes have always stayed in the back of my mind.\n\nIt’s been almost eight years since I left Venezuela and almost five years since I left my parents’ house in Texas for college. When I accepted an internship at The Desert Sun and relocated to Palm Springs almost two years ago, I knew nothing about the Coachella Valley. I had lived in the U.S. for six years and, having resided in Houston and Baton Rouge, I forgot that living in an area surrounded by mountains was a possibility.\n\nNow, Caracas and the Coachella Valley could not be more different. One’s a city within a valley in a tropical, humid area merely an hour from the Caribbean Sea, and the other is an arid, desert region with cactuses, intense heat in the summer and a whole lot of sand. But the first time I saw the San Jacinto Mountains along the desert cities, I remember feeling like I was back home.\n\nBut being far away from family and old friends, working hard and dealing with life’s ups and downs can be isolating. So, I hold on to old memories and make sure I create new ones by exploring the world I now found myself in.\n\nEvery Friday, I set my alarm for an early morning wake-up call, hit the snooze button about 10 times. I get up, change from my pajamas into a simple T-shirt, gym shorts and somewhat bigger tennis shoes. I pick up my friend at her house and we hike South Lykken Trail.\n\nWe talk about work, our lives, plans for future vacations and where we are going to have lunch when we’re done. Between admiring the recently revived plants (thank you rainy winter) and each other’s support, we make it to the top.\n\nAs I look at the valley from above, I think about my family and how they’re always with me even when we’re apart. I think about my friends and the many adventures we’ve gone on. I think about how lucky I am to have landed in a place like this and in that moment, even after the worst of weeks, I am happy.\n\nJose Bastidas is the food reporter and producer for The Desert Sun.

He first moved to the Coachella Valley when he accepted an internship at The Desert Sun in 2015.\n\nWhen I travel, I struggle to find time to sit back, enjoy, contemplate and observe my new surroundings sufficiently. Meticulously calibrated schedules sever my connection to my natural senses and leave me stressed out. It is no easier to find time to think and ponder at home.\n\nAs a recent resident of Palm Springs, I still enjoy some anonymity in public spaces where I can meditate uninterrupted (at least until a friend or neighbor greets me). Somehow I get energy from being in the presence of other people, especially those I don’t know. I can gather up their vibes, store them and feel revitalized enough to give them all back to others.\n\nI discovered this power in New York City, where I could walk among thousands of people, collecting energy like a squirrel collects acorns. In Florence, I would sit in the Piazza della Repubblica and absorb the history in every stone, monument and tower. At Leidseplein square in Amsterdam – filled with chairs and tables on a sunny, warm day – I imagined comedy and drama flowing from my fellow diners.\n\nOnce while sitting outside the Starbucks at the corner of Tahquitz and Palm Canyon, I realized I had found a similar space in Palm Springs. My local, public square is bounded by the Starbucks, the Welwood Murray Memorial Library, The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf and the empty space under construction where I hope the 22-foot-high statue of Marilyn Monroe will return. While the desert modernist grandeur of the library represents the sole architectural focal point, adding Marilyn across from the library could create the perfect architectural counterweight (as it once used to be).\n\nIn my square, like other European plazas, I can sit and enjoy a cup of coffee and a pastry while watching the downtown foot traffic. After finding the optimal seat for viewing, I savor the aroma and flavor of my brew, nosh a bit and enjoy the parade. If I am in a restless mood, my thoughts go to, “Oh, no! What is that he’s wearing?” But more often, I play games like “What country are they from?” or “Are they married or dating?”\n\nIf the passersby don’t grab my attention, there is sometimes a person at a nearby table whose life story I can fabricate. What to others may look like an ordinary tourist in my mind has become an international opera star trying to avoid the paparazzi, while the man behind her tries discreetly to take her photo with his phone. I might even play the role of a secret agent or slumming celebrity.\n\nThese moments alone are rarely guilt-free because there is always some other more productive use of my time. But for the small rental fee embodied in a purchased cup of coffee, a seat at my public square provides a welcome respite from my daily routine.\n\nDavid Kelly is a former banker, executive chef and lawyer who currently enjoys writing and performing his works at CONNECTED, Bohemian Café and The Desert Sun’s Coachella Valley Storytellers Project.

Benitez-Brown) is a Filipino-American artist, who splits his time between Quezon City and LA.\n\nHot weather is a regular part of life in the Coachella Valley.\n\nThis past summer, temperatures soared above 120 degrees; even during fall months, the heat often rises above 100, sometimes late into October. How can anyone live through this – months of triple-digit temperatures – let alone find beauty at this time of year, when, due to the understandable mass exodus of fair weather residents and tourists, it often feels like we’re living in a ghost town?\n\nLike many others, I hide behind dark curtains, holding a seemingly endless vigil of waiting for the sun to go down. When it does finally slide behind Mount San Jacinto and cover the valley with a long curtain of shade that begins in Palm Springs and slides across the desert floor to the Little San Bernardino Mountains, I venture outdoors to mostly empty roads.\n\nEven though temperatures often hover in the 90s or higher at this time of night, I emerge from my South Palm Desert condo to go on my daily walk. I wear my reflective, fluorescent green Nike tank top, the lightest shorts I have and a small backpack that holds my 2-liter CamelBak reservoir filled to the brim with water and a 1-liter water bottle, frozen solid.\n\nDuring my one-hour, 4-mile roundtrip walk, the water bottle will completely melt. As the sky darkens, I walk uphill along Highway 74, passing Silver Spur trailer park and Cahuilla Way. I steadily sip water and hold the frozen bottle alternately to the back of my neck, the front of my chest and under each arm, to help cool myself down.\n\nAs I begin to unwind, my senses tune in to the sound of raucous crickets hiding in the thick desert landscaping in front of Bighorn Golf Club. The rhythm of walking helps to ease the tension in my housebound muscles, and I start to breathe more easily. I get closer to the edge of the wild desert, to the curve in the road where Highway 74 begins to switchback up into the Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains National Monument, and I look up at the dark sky and am astonished by the beautiful view of warm stars and a toenail of new moon. I feel the sudden rush of a connection to the deep magic of the desert, with its infinite possibilities and ancient history, and I sense the rustling of the palm tree oases I know are tucked into the canyons just beyond where I stand. I imagine a family of thirsty bighorn sheep picking their way down rocky cliffs to drink, and I’m overwhelmed with the understanding that this is a wild desert that few people truly know, evoked only during times of intense weather such as this.\n\nAnd then, I hear the yips of a pack of coyotes cascade down from Cahuilla Hills. When their cries fade into the darkness, I savor the silence, which now feels like a warm balm rather than loneliness.\n\nRuth Nolan is professor of English at College of the Desert.

She spends most of her time taking photographs, writing poetry, or wandering around the desert.\n\nEvery desert trip began with a quick stop off Highway 10 for date shakes and chili at Hadley’s. We’d sit at the counter beneath black and white signed photos of old Hollywood stars I was too young to recognize. Giant tour busses parked alongside the green and yellow building while tourists took a bathroom break or browsed the aisles of mixed nuts and novelties. This was our desert ritual that meant we were almost there…\n\nTurquoise waters sparkled against the stucco and concrete of a generic condominium complex pool, which overlooked a brilliant green golf course in Palm Springs. This is where my dad taught me how to swim.\n\nOverwatered lawns and manicured sidewalks encircled a royal blue manmade lake in La Quinta, where in the mud between the grass and concrete path, my cousins and I played with army green toy soldiers and mini plastic farm animals while my grandparents made sandwiches or went out for a round of tennis.\n\nA few years later my sister and I took the 10 on our own, to dance across the emerald green polo fields of Indio. We moved to the sounds of Yeah Yeah Yeahs and TV On The Radio in little jean cut offs and big sunglasses under a cloudless sky.\n\nThe desert I seek now is not painted in such vivid greens and blues, after all my parents are divorced, my grandparents are long gone, and Coachella now costs half my paycheck to listen to bands I no longer know. So those desert memories are magic to me, as they capture the time when my family came together and actually shared meals. When adults and children spent just as much time playing as the other. The desert was our haven, where life was vivid and worries were none.\n\nToday I know how water is such a precious resource, how 330 acres of manicured lawns is unnatural, almost criminal, and how life’s worries will follow you wherever you go. But I still long for the desert, seeking the magic it carried for me before I knew magic was something to be sought after. I continue to come back here, not just to relive those memories that undoubtedly shaped who I am today, but to chase the desert’s brilliant sunsets, expansive horizons and magnificent super blooms. To look up at the sky and see stars I forgot were always there. To watch the sunrise because I want to – not because I have to on my way to an early work shift. To look out at a sea of dirt, dust and Joshua trees. To marvel at the blanket of yellow gold wildflowers across the desert floor. To sit in quiet, far from any reception or media, so that my mind can finally think for itself. To sip on a date shake while I recall the time I first learned to swim, or when I danced the night away beneath the desert sky, or when life was vivid and worries were none.\n\nNina Harada is a writer, actor and artist.

Nearly a year together means that we both know this. There is a certain irony then to the sun beating down on our exposed arms as we stand in a group of 20 or so listening to a woman as old as my grandmother explain the difference between alligator and Utah juniper. The average age of our cohort is not far off the age of our guide, and it’s becoming increasingly clear that this two-hour “nature hike” isn’t going to be leaving the parking lot. My Earth Day date idea, so good in theory, is rapidly seeming more like the opposite with each passing minute.\n\n“Want to go find a trail?” I ask under my breath so as not to offend our volunteer naturalist.\n\n“Yes please,” E. replies.\n\nJavelina Trail guides us deep into Red Rock State Park, following the path of an irrigation canal dug by the original homesteaders of this land. Along the way I spot a number of bushes and plants from our hour with the guide, making sure to repeat the names I’ve written down so that they don’t get lost like so many other things.\n\nSoaptree yucca. Wolfberry. Desert marigold.\n\nThe plants of a childhood spread out across the high deserts of Arizona and California, always present by never quite appreciated. Now I cling to their names like a free climber to a ledge, determined not to take for granted the landscape that dominates my life, waking and sleeping.\n\nI will admit I have an ulterior motive. Our early dates revolved around taking advantage of the natural beauty of Arizona. Somehow, despite living in a place renowned for its expansive landscape and access to nature, we seem to have lost the magic of those first explorations together. Our Sedona trip for me represents a lifeline back to that place where everything is new and each discovery together is a forking in the trail with no clear end in sight.\n\nWe pause at a rock wall on top of a ridge to take advantage of the shade provided by a ponderosa pine. It’s our first opportunity for conversation that doesn’t involve one of us having to stare at the back of the other. Our conversation, observed by the red and umber striped peaks of nearby Cathedral Rock, meanders in a way that is both pleasant and familiar. We talk about erosion and the nature of colors. We discuss how we would foster a sense of curiosity in our theoretical children by encouraging them to explore the natural world. We make plans for more hikes, more time away from our community, more intention in how we spend our time together.\n\nOn that lookout in the land of tourists and overpriced crystal shops, it becomes clear that this day was not a bad idea; it was exactly what we needed.\n\nA guitar plays.\n\nThe sound bounces off art-laden walls, filling the concert space.\n\nI sing an Indian folk song which wildly enters the sonic forest.\n\nOutside, the desert is quiet.\n\nJoshua Tree takes me as I am this cold night. Barren land makes space for me to croon in the language of my grandparents, “Kesariya Balam, padharo mhare des!” Oh my Beloved, come to my land!\n\nI drove into the desert in May of 2015, freshly divorced and hoping for the kind of redemption that breathing new air always seems to offer. As I passed a familiar, color-changing mountain, the cacophony of heartbreak rang in my ears, and I almost missed its message. The mountain’s message, that is. It came to me as two clear, sequential instructions:\n\n1. Write a poem, and\n\n2. Have courage\n\nI thought exactly what anyone would think: That’s a dumb, bossy mountain that clearly has no real-life experience. It’s never gone through a complex problem requiring a robust solution.\n\nI unloaded my car of the clothes and books I’d brought from Texas, and rested my head in my mother’s lap before doing the inevitable – Googling “local poetry reading.”\n\nThe next morning, I formulated a poem in my head while driving to an open mic. I ordered an organic brew and dribbled the words of the poem onto the back of the receipt.\n\nComing down from the creative high, I could smell the words. They reeked of having loved too much. They smacked of the sort of pining that remains popular in Bollywood films but is too buttery thick for my American sensibilities. Adding to its deficiencies, the poem had too many driving metaphors. I decided it couldn’t be released into the Universe, so I placed the whimpering piece in my back pocket. Without skipping a beat, the saucy mountain let out an “ahem!” for ignoring instruction No. 2.\n\nA couple of cloistered months later, I went to another open mic and did what I swore I wouldn’t do – I became that kind of poet and apotheosized both my lost relationship and my slowly fading identity. My ex-husband and I got the two-become-one-thing right, but in all the wrong ways. As he disappeared from my life, “I” disappeared from my life. Standing before several desert poets, I festered in the fury of all the avoidable mistakes we had made. They clapped for me. Smiled at me. Deflected from the smell of pity in the air by telling me they liked “this image” and “that simile.” They forgave me.\n\nThe barren desert wasn’t barren after all.\n\nMore than two years later, I’m under the balcony seats of a secluded concert venue, not far from the Joshua Forest.

A car was already marooned in the current, with its driver standing on the other side, waiting for some help.\n\nIf not for the harrowing possibility of being washed away, the day was as picturesque as they come. Migrating birds with white feathers and long legs wading through shimmering water, set against the backdrop of snow-topped mountains and a cobalt sky.\n\nI heard the water rushing over the hidden asphalt. The current carried rocks and vegetation, making a roar and muting the otherwise audible noise from people and engines. I was astounded by the force and speed of this impromptu river, crashing into civilization as residents were on their way to Target or the Post Office.\n\nI hear stories from people who were raised here, about a time when the whole valley would shut down while the wash crisscrossed every major artery of Palm Springs and the surrounding towns. I am learning the power of the Whitewater River and its distributaries, as well as its primary source, Mount San Gorgonio. Also known as Old Grayback, and part of the Transverse Ranges, its snowmelt feeds the river and its frenzied washes.\n\nIt’s not hard to be in awe of the dramatic changes we experience in the Coachella Valley. We live in this desert of opposites. Nature and technology. Cactus and rain cloud. Our senses are surrounded by beauty so raw, we are drawn to touch it. Engage with it. Immerse ourselves utterly and escape the digital rhythms of our lives. The harsh summers provide us with a Mother Nature so unforgiving, we are reminded of our tenuous hold on this planet. We witness the cycle of birth and death annually, as the rain and river give life, and the arid heat takes it away.\n\nI returned to the same spot today on Cathedral Canyon, hoping to see those white birds. The yellow grasses told me what I already suspected. Other than a rill no wider than three feet, the landscape was transformed back into a field.\n\nThat day by the wash will remain with me forever. Life was reinvigorated for a momentary season of excess and plenitude. Down here in the valley, the lizards, the saltbush and we humans are but passing through. Our inventions of conditioned air and roaming vehicles help us to survive, but I will always have respect for the power of wind, water and temperature.\n\nThey come for the winter, visitors from northern climes, and indeed it is sight to behold the nature that flourishes here. The mountain draws our eye to the sky. A netherworld of snow and cloud peers down on us as if from another time zone. Ancient and silent, the mountain’s silhouette is an elder. San Jacinto speaks to us in a language of memory, and we may listen freely, if we choose.\n\n“Remember this cycle of abundance and growth, of lack and conservation. Imprint it in your DNA.

I stood there numb to everything.\n\nNow, what? What about that loft we were going to get? Or the two children we imagined running in our backyard?\n\nSnapping out of my daze, I heard his voice shouting from downstairs, “Grab my bike off the mantle, will you?” The studio now looked like it did the day we arrived. Empty. Sunlight hit the wooden floors, and I closed the door before slipping the keys under. The smell of the panadería across the street whiffed into my nose as I took one more glance at the old man who waited to die on our street every day, smoking his last cigarette while notes of jazz filled the city. All of this ultimately became a part of me.\n\nBut this isn’t our story; it’s mine, and you’re just a part of it.\n\nI hauled everything I owned into my car, with my ex-lover’s bicycle attached to the roof. The fog eventually disappeared, the roads shifted from pavement to gravel and the heat seeped into my skin. Mountains on every corner replaced buildings, and we were back on 1-10 headed for the desert. The only noise you could hear was the clamoring of the wine glasses we bought together, the rattling of his bike and a loud, vast, open sound only the desert landscape can produce. Two summers ago, after a stint of city living and what seemed to be an enormous amount of young love, I found myself back at my childhood address. Seeing the windmills silhouetted against the mountainside, the comfort of home rushed into my body. The desert held a familiar scent – my grandmother’s Filipino cooking, soy sauce mixed in with vinegar, ginger and garlic simmering ever so slowly in a huge metal pot, along with the subtle smell of coconut bundled in banana leaves – and the feeling that everything was going to be alright. Or at least that was the sensation I craved.\n\nThere I was, unpacking everything in my parents’ garage. I’d left behind one of the best teaching jobs in Oakland and a life I thought I knew. On the evening of my return to the desert, the gradient of colors from the sunset melded into a fiery warmth that embraced my existence. Within that moment, I realized I needed to let all of it happen.\n\nExhausted from the drive, I went to the backyard and dug my feet into the earth. The damp grass felt good against my hot skin, and I wasn’t sure how to move forward or if I even could. As I looked up at the summer moon, my body knew this was the end of a relationship but the beginning of something new. Sometimes people, places and things happen because they help you arrive at your next destination. I never planned to move back here, but the desert chose me.\n\nMichelle Castillo is a writer, educator, community arts organizer and social activist based out of Palm Springs.

While the car is on. It’s 4:30 a.m. and I’m wondering if the McDonald’s in Baker is open 24 hours. I’m wondering if I’m up for whoever would be at a McDonald’s in Baker in 5 a.m. I’m gauging the drive to Tecopa and imagining, over and over, sinking into the hot mud of the spring. I lift my head into the cold air, hands still rubbing each other in the exhaust, and see the first light hit the white cross and then bleed out on the pink rocks. Mojave Desert Preserve, January.\n\nMy 9-year-old daughter scratches the ice on the inside of the SUV window, thrusting her hand out of the mass of her sleeping bag wrestled into a sitting position. Heart, she scratches. Smiley face. And then the dog’s name. We’re up.\n\nIn the next hour, she’ll watch the local college field trip cool older kids at White Cross Campground get up from their dozen tents and start packing for their day’s trek. She’ll get growled at by the dude in the remote back of the dispersed camping area who wants us to stay further than 200 yards from his motorhome. She’ll scramble through scree to find petroglyphs peeking through chia flowers. Until we are parked and drinking hot tea made on a burner in the back of the truck while the trains rush by, the conductor blasting the horn at her, at us, the only humans standing within a few miles, waving back at him, as he shoots past and sinks back into the desert.\n\nLater, after the dog barks at being left standing on the lava rocks as we crawl into a cave, after we carry the dog down the ladder into the lava tubes, stand in the cave a bit, and carry the fool dog back up, a guy says to her, watching the entire circus enterprise, “You should know, you have a really cool mom.” But I want to tell him, oh tell her anything at this age, she also thinks I’m a good singer and God knows that’s not true. But she also knows I just tossed her a cup in the back of the car and said pee here then. She knows there comes a moment in every night in every tent where I say enough, please stop talking. She is just now getting old enough to know all moms are not like me. If I get the balance just right, somewhere between tough love and gentle listener, that may in the end be said to be to my credit.\n\nIn the meantime, January in the cold desert still sounds good to her, so I haven’t broken her yet.\n\nLiving in the far southeastern end of the Coachella Valley was not always something I appreciated. Definitely not when I was a younger person. Growing up on the Torres Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indian Reservation in Thermal, the desolateness seemed to stunt my ability to dream. The vast open desert, agricultural fields and treacherous-looking mountains represented infinite emptiness at the time. I remember feeling so far away from anywhere, and believing that everything was happening someplace else.\n\nIn high school, my parents facilitated an interdistrict transfer for me to Palm Desert High. They believed I would receive a better education there. It was a different world from the community of Torres Martinez. Some of my fellow students had cars at ages 16 and 17 that were more fancy and expensive than those of our teachers. Life seemed privileged for a lot of my peers. But not for me and not for the young people I knew growing up. Our reservation and the surrounding rural community was, as it still remains, a place where many who live there work the hardest and also earn the least.\n\nExperiencing this proximity of poverty to extreme wealth in the desert was suffocating to me. Thus, as a teen, I could not wait to leave. Fortunately, my university education led me to schools in South Dakota, Humboldt County in Northern California and the Bay Area. All places of tremendous beauty. America’s vast great plains. The regal redwood forest. The state’s largest estuary. These journeys had the same origin and led me back to the same place, Torres Martinez. Each voyage away from home strengthened my appreciation for the reservation landscape. The distance from the rushing nature of city life now fosters my ability to think clearly.\n\nPeople often come to our area and see nothing but poverty and potential for expansion. But the reality is that Desert Cahuilla history, lifeways and culture have been there far longer than anything else. Those of us who were taught to can see the places relevant to our creation all around us. Everything, down to the natural colors of the earth, has meaning to us.\n\nIt’s clear that not everyone sees it this way. To some, our home area is a place where they can leave things they don’t want near them. Unwanted human waste, polluted water, old furniture and useless appliances are dumped in our homelands. Developers don’t see the wide open space as a sanctuary for free desert animals and plants to live, like my family does. Though the tribe has authority on what happens within our boundaries, there’s no regulating everything. Our quiet is encroached on weekends with the sound of bullets ringing out from sport hunters who are after the birds, as well as the incessant hum of cars from the nearby racetrack.\n\nThe proximity that once drove me away is coming even closer to my home. But now, it’s what keeps me around appreciating all that remains.\n\nTerria Smith is a tribal member of the Torres Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians.

The fickle gusts ripple, then smooth the surface of the ankle-deep water that has been sustained by a wet winter. The cottonwoods creak amid the steady flow of the river, a dulcet tone in the desert.\n\nWhere the river crosses the international border, the water passes between metal Normandy-style barriers, X-shaped metal barricades arranged on either side of the channel, connected by a horizontal steel bar that blocks vehicles from driving through the riverbed.\n\nPink ribbons tied around a dozen cottonwoods closest to the border flap in the breeze. Small wood posts inscribed with the words “remove trees” are placed in front of them.\n\nThe trees are marked for removal as part of President Donald Trump’s attempt to fulfill his campaign promise to build a wall along the southern border.\n\nAs construction moves forward in this rugged corner of conservative Cochise County, long-cultivated relationships among local ranchers, environmental groups and Border Patrol agents have begun to unravel, the mistrust fed by a lack of communication and reliable information. Agencies that worked together a decade ago are now on shaky ground.\n\nMany people are concerned that wildlife migration, sensitive habitats, undeveloped landscapes and limited water resources will be irreparably harmed because the government has waived dozens of federal environmental and cultural protection laws that would typically trigger thorough studies before construction took place.\n\nOn Friday, four conservation groups asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review lower court decisions that allowed the Trump administration to waive the environmental laws.\n\nIn Arizona, much of the construction is occurring on federal, rather than privately owned, lands, eliminating obstacles to the building process like purchasing land from private stakeholders or going through the eminent domain process.\n\nThe U.S. government controls a 60-foot-wide strip of land on the border that spans California, Arizona and New Mexico from the Pacific Ocean to where the Rio Grande becomes the international boundary. Known as the Roosevelt Reservation, the easement was established in 1907 by President Theodore Roosevelt to keep the border \"free from obstruction as a protection against the smuggling of goods” between the United States and Mexico, according to the original proclamation.\n\nThe Roosevelt easement runs along multiple protected areas across Arizona, including Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, which is part of the traditional homelands of the Tohono O’odham Nation.\n\nIn far southeast Arizona, the easement hems the San Pedro Riparian National Conservation Area and the San Bernardino National Wildlife Refuge, two of the most biodiverse and rare desert water systems in the Southwest. That leaves these areas in the crosshairs of a fast-tracked construction process.\n\nIn May, the federal government awarded a $646 million contract to Southwest Valley Constructors, a subsidiary of Omaha-based Kiewit Corporation, to replace approximately 63 miles of existing vehicle and pedestrian barriers along the border in Pima and Cochise counties.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection, the agency that oversees border security, proposed replacing about 43 miles of such barriers in Pima County and about 19 miles in Cochise County — including the approximately 0.3 miles of Normandy-style barrier that currently cuts through the San Pedro at the border — with 18- to 30-foot, concrete-filled steel bollards.\n\n“Bollard-style” fencing consists of steel posts spaced several inches apart, close enough together that the narrow openings could become clogged with debris from flowing water, effectively damming a river or wash. The proposal also described improving or constructing new roads, installing lights, and “other detection technology.”\n\nJust weeks after U.S. Rep. Raúl Grijalva sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees Customs and Border Protection, expressing concern about the lack of consultation with the Tohono O'odham nation, the contractor cleared the easement near Quitobaquito Springs, an important water resource in the area and sacred site to the Hia-Ced and Tohono O'odham.\n\n“They could break ground here tomorrow and nobody would know,” said Laiken Jordahl, borderlands campaigner for Tucson-based conservation group the Center for Biological Diversity, as he observed the marked cottonwood trees by the San Pedro recently.\n\n“It's such a shame that all this would be done with no inclusion of the public, no engagement of stakeholders, no assessment of how this could change the ecology of the river,\" Jordahl said. \"It’s our tax dollars being used and none of us have consented to this.”\n\nWhen a river meets a wall\n\nOf the former great Southwestern rivers, the San Pedro remains free-flowing and undammed.\n\nThe river begins just south of the border in Sonora, Mexico, then winds north into Arizona, a rare remnant of what was once a vast network of similar river systems throughout the Southwest that disappeared as a result of damming, drought and human use over the past several hundred years. The river snakes about 140 miles from its headwaters in Mexico to the Gila River, a green artery in a dry landscape.\n\nOn either side of the river corridor, fencing designed to prevent both vehicles and pedestrians from crossing into Arizona currently stretches about 40 miles between the Coronado National Memorial to the west and the border town of Douglas to the east.\n\nThe fencing on this stretch of border is made up of varying iterations of pedestrian blockades that have been installed over the decades, from 18-foot bollard-style barriers spanning several miles on each side of the river to shorter fencing made of a variety of metal designs.\n\nThe fencing between Coronado National Memorial and Douglas is broken only at the 0.3 miles of Normandy-style vehicle barrier across the San Pedro. Border Patrol agents are stationed at the river 24 hours a day.\n\nIn an emailed statement to The Arizona Republic on Jan. 16, Customs and Border Protection wrote that the agency will conduct hydraulic and hydrological analyses “to ensure the new barrier does not deflect water or obstruct flow” at the San Pedro. The statement described possible barrier designs such as “gates or grates to allow for the passage of flood waters and debris.”\n\nIf the proposed 30-foot metal posts are constructed at the river here, even with some floodgates, conservation groups, locals and agencies worry the river will effectively be dammed.\n\nOn Jan. 26, more than a thousand protesters, primarily locals, filled the Hereford bridge across the San Pedro River to protest the construction. They echoed many of the concerns that longtime activists and community leaders have voiced in recent years.\n\n“This place is so special,” said Tricia Gerrodette, a local who has fought to protect the San Pedro for more than 24 years. “There's nothing else like this in the Southwest. And we keep chipping away at it.”\n\nIn 2007, when the government proposed a similar bollard-style fence across the river, the Bureau of Land Management wrote in a memo to DHS: \"Regardless of the maintenance commitments by Border Patrol, the proposed fence could inadvertently act as a flood control structure altering natural flood characteristics.\"\n\nDuring the summer monsoon, the river swells, and debris, trees, trash and other objects would likely pile up against the fence, these groups say. Just a few weeks ago, debris and mud could be seen pushed up against some of the Normandy barriers in the floodplain. Currently, the Border Patrol removes these barriers during the monsoon to prevent flooding and debris buildup.\n\n\"These floods are critical to the health of the river,\" Jordahl said. \"If you put in structures that essentially dam it, you're really altering the ecosystem that we see here. This is already an extremely strained resource, and to wall it off and essentially dam it is just insult to injury.\"\n\nWhen the design plans are finalized, they will be implemented without the environmental and cultural studies usually required by federal law for construction projects.\n\nThe Trump administration has waived dozens of laws to expedite construction of the wall across Arizona and other border states. The controversial action was made possible in 2005, when Congress granted then-President George W. Bush the authority to bypass federal environmental and cultural protection laws to speed up border wall construction on the California-Mexico border. Because the waiver authority wasn’t limited to that specific time and place, the Trump administration has used it to accelerate the current border wall construction.\n\nIn a petition on Friday to the U.S. Supreme Court, four conservation groups argued that the waivers were unconstitutional and threatened natural resources along the border.\n\n“The Trump administration has turned our safe and beautiful borderlands and border communities into a place where our nation’s most important laws — the laws that protect the environment and ensure the health, safety and well-being of communities everywhere else in America — literally do not apply,” Kevin Bixby, executive director of the Southwest Environmental Center, said in a press release.\n\nThe 1970 National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, which is one of the 40-plus laws that have been waived, would require environmental analyses and impact statements prior to construction. The law would ensure that environmental concerns such as how bollard-style fencing might impact wildlife migration and the floodplain would be considered equally alongside other factors, such as the effectiveness of bollard fencing in the San Pedro in preventing illegal smuggling or border crossings.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection says that despite the waivers, it remains \"committed to responsible environmental stewardship and meeting the intent of these laws to the greatest extent possible while allowing the Government to meet its requirements to secure the southern border,\" the agency wrote in an email.\n\nThe agency spokesperson went on to write that they are \"actively engaged\" with the federal agencies that manage protected areas to identify wildlife passages and \"other design elements that support wildlife migration without compromising border security.\"\n\nSince the construction was announced in May, neither the Bureau of Land Management nor the Fish and Wildlife Service has received information about specific border wall design plans for the San Pedro River or the San Bernardino National Wildlife Refuge, managed by each respectively. Customs and Border Protection told The Republic in an email that the contractor was expected to finalize designs by the end of this month, but designs remain under consideration.\n\nDespite border security officials' assurances that the contractor is working closely to address environmental concerns with the agencies that oversee protected areas throughout the borderlands, the communication has been inadequate, officials and environmental groups say.\n\n\"Any of the public lands that are being potentially impacted by this, we're not receiving information on what's happening or what's going to happen, so it's really hard to respond in any way other than just monitor what's happening,\" said an agency official who was given anonymity because agencies overseeing protected areas impacted by construction have been directed not to speak with the media about the border wall construction without referring them to appropriate public information officers.\n\n“NEPA is not a law that stops projects, it's a law that requires people to talk about the best ways to do things to minimize impacts and achieve success,” the official said. “When that is wiped away, both of those objectives are pretty hard to meet.”\n\nHANGING IN THE BALANCE: Groundwater drilling could affect fragile springs\n\nA fragile place: The Sky Islands region\n\nSome 35 miles east from the San Pedro crossing into Arizona is the town of Douglas, “the premier southwestern border community” as it calls itself on its water tower.\n\nArizona and Sonora license plates are seen on the roads. Outside of town, the bollard-style border wall, built by the Bush administration during the mid-2000s, turns to vehicle barriers. Where the paved road turns to gravel, then dirt, structures that look like cell towers become visible. They are Border Patrol watchtowers, equipped with cameras so strong they can capture license plates on Mexico’s Highway 2 several miles away.\n\nOn the unpaved Geronimo Trail, named for the Apache leader who surrendered to U.S. troops nearby in the late 1800s, the wind breaks the quiet in bursts and whips, and only a sharp eye can see the line across the sloping valley that designates where Mexico ends and the United States begins. The land is open and vast. To the east, the Peloncillo Mountains rise up out of the desert, and the snow-dusted Chiricahua Mountains peer out from the north.\n\nAn 18-wheeler barrels down the road and another truck follows, spraying water for dust control. On this remote road, new signs have been erected every few yards with slogans like “Don’t let your journey end on a gurney” or “Safety is a way of life” to encourage construction workers to drive with caution.\n\nThe road climbs a small hill, and in the near distance, a few miles of new 30-foot bollard-style border fencing looks like a black snake crawling across the landscape, the upper reaches creating an unnaturally smooth line against the horizon.\n\nThe beeping and bustle of construction noise seems out of place. Big rig trucks circle a concrete-making facility, churning water and rocks. Beside it, a dirt lot has been cleared for parking. A large truck parks under a yellow tank to refill with several thousand gallons of water, while the sun peeks through the clouds and the shadows shift across the valley and mountains beyond.\n\nJust a mile or so beyond is the historic John Slaughter Ranch Museum, where former Cochise County Sheriff “Texas John” Slaughter made his life in the late 1800s.\n\nThe ranch is next to the San Bernardino National Wildlife Refuge, a 2,369-acre marsh that is all that remains of the once permanently flowing creeks, springs and wetlands, or cienegas, that stretched across the sacaton grasslands that characterized the San Bernardino Valley in Slaughter’s time and long before.\n\nToday, about two-thirds of the wetlands are in the Mexican state of Sonora. For centuries, the cienega was a sanctuary for humans and wildlife.\n\nFor centuries, too, this region has been under stress. As settlement in the region expanded in the late 19th century, farming, mining and livestock production competed for the same water. The valley sits on a vast aquifer, water that is likely as ancient as the Pleistocene, that feeds springs connected by volcanic tubes underground. It’s part of the Rio Yaqui River basin, the largest river in northwest Mexico.\n\nOver time, increased pressure from growing populations and cattle grazing on both sides of the border led to local extinctions of many species, and soon the wetlands were largely converted to individual ponds and artesian wells. Mesquite and thornscrub carpeted the valley instead of native grass.\n\nIn 1982, the remaining wetland was designated a refuge to protect native fish species that were on the verge of going extinct. Private landowners, conservation organizations and government agencies from the U.S. and Mexico decided to work together to maintain the “delicate balance that has been in place for centuries, providing quality habitat for fish, wildlife, and people dependent on the Rio Yaqui Basin,” the Fish and Wildlife Service writes in its brochure for the area.\n\nThe new border wall fencing is planned to be built across 19 miles in this area, which is about 14 miles east of Douglas. It will abut the 2.6 miles of the refuge along the border, as well as the Slaughter Ranch.\n\nFred and Vickie Dunn have managed the Slaughter Ranch for the past five years. Fred is a former cattle rancher and stuntman, and Vickie is an author. They laugh easily together and finish each other’s sentences, or Vickie finishes Fred’s before he says something he may regret. Now, instead of asking about the history of the ranch, tourists often ask them about the wall.\n\n“People either want to gripe about it or praise it,” Vickie said. “Border security is important for every country, but the wall is not going to be a solution to our problems. We have the virtual wall with the towers in the area and Border Patrol does an excellent job. Building a physical wall here is possibly going to be detrimental on many levels.”\n\n“It’s a conversation point up north and then they get here and they see it,” Fred said. \"I'll talk about the ranch, I'll talk about the wildlife, but I don't want to talk about the metal fence. I'm tired of looking at it.\"\n\nThe biggest concern is water. The Slaughter Ranch, until recently, has relied on artesian wells (wells that don’t require pumping because water comes to the surface of the ground by way of springs) for water. They worry that the water being pumped for construction may tap their pond dry, or worse. If the aquifer is drained, the area could become a sinkhole, they said a hydrologist told them.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection said in a Feb. 5 email to The Republic that the contractor is currently pumping approximately 180,000 gallons of water per day for this section of the project.\n\n“The information coming in is sporadic,\" Fred said. \"The panic over the water, the panic over the construction, the whole thing. We could wake up tomorrow morning with the pond going down like a toilet bowl and the house halfway to hell.”\n\n“We’re all on the same aquifer,” Vickie added. “They said if they drain us for our personal use we can get water from their well. But if they drain the aquifer, it doesn’t matter. We’re not gonna have it, they’re not gonna have it, nobody’s gonna have it.”\n\nThe Dunns recently drilled a 480-foot well to pump water for domestic use in case the border wall construction causes their pond to run dry.\n\n“The whole reason we spent the money for that well was if something happened, if the horror stories came true, we would hopefully be able to maintain domestic water, so at least we can keep basic livestock and us getting water,” Fred said. “We've already forfeited the grass.”\n\nCustoms and Border Protection is currently using five wells in the areas east of Douglas for border wall construction, including existing wells on privately owned properties near the refuge and Slaughter Ranch.\n\nA spokesperson for the agency wrote in an email to The Republic that they do not currently have plans to drill additional wells in or around the San Bernardino Wildlife Refuge.\n\nWORKING TOGETHER: Looking for common ground on the San Pedro River\n\n'An amazing part of the world'\n\nLike the San Pedro, this tiny protected area, administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service, is a rare reliable water resource in the desert. Even if additional groundwater pumping doesn’t deplete the aquifer, the area is a vital migratory pathway for wide-ranging species like jaguars, mountain lions, wolves and black bears.\n\nWith climate change increasing the severity of droughts and transforming habitats in the Southwest, migration pathways are even more essential for wildlife survival. The jaguar will likely go extinct in the U.S. if 30-foot bollard-style fencing seals the border in this region, conservationists say.\n\nEXTINCTION FEARS: A border wall could drive the jaguar extinct in America\n\nBorder protection officials told The Republic that the agency is \"actively engaged\" with the Fish and Wildlife Service \"to identify small wildlife passages and other design elements within the planned border wall that support wildlife migration without compromising border security,” and that some designs could include small animal gates that can be open “during migration season.”\n\n“It's the animals that you see every day out here, the deer, the javelina, the bobcats, the mountain lions, where I think we'll see a really dramatic effect on what's happening when those resources are fragmented,” said Myles Traphagen, borderlands program manager for the conservation group Wildlands Network.\n\n“And, of course, that's going to have a reverse cascade on the larger predators like mountain lions and jaguars,\" Traphagen said. \"It's not just all the big-ticket items, it’s the smaller ones that I think are going to have really large impacts.”\n\nThe San Pedro and the San Bernardino National Wildlife Refuge are in one of the most biodiverse regions of the world: the Sky Islands. The 57 isolated mountain “islands” are separated by desert and grassland “seas.”\n\nIn this region, the flora and fauna of the neotropical Sierra Madre Mountains come up from the south to meet the temperate north of the Colorado Plateau; the Chihuahan Desert stretches in from the east and the Sonoran Desert from the west.\n\n“There's several places just south of here where you'll see pine trees, oaks and saguaros all in the same location,” said Traphagen. “Black bears are here as well as jaguars. This is an amazing part of the world.”\n\nA 2011 study identified Sky Islands wildlife as at risk of experiencing some of the most detrimental impacts from the already existing border wall infrastructure in this area.\n\nFred Dunn has come across Mexican gray wolves and mountain lions and countless deer and javelina, animals with no knowledge of international boundaries that move back and forth across the border on a sometimes-daily basis. The wildlife is a big reason he and Vickie love their job managing the ranch.\n\n“The way I look at it, we’re collateral damage,” Fred said of the water situation and the impact on wildlife corridors. “We can’t do a thing about the wall. But there’s gotta be some compromise here somewhere.”\n\nA DIFFERENT BORDER STORY: Building a different kind of wall to revive a dying land\n\n'It pushed the traffic out here'\n\nAmid cries from environmentalists of \"no moo in '92\" and \"cattle-free in '93,\" Bill McDonald gathered some of his fellow ranchers in the San Bernardino Valley for a talk.\n\nThe fifth-generation rancher, whose great-great-grandfather arrived in this harsh but beautiful landscape in 1907, was a forward-thinker who knew he had to find some common ground with environmentalists who wanted grazing off public lands, but he also knew ranching was a way of life he and his neighbors weren’t going to quit anytime soon.\n\n“Everybody out here leases federal and state lands to graze on in addition to their private land. That's just the makeup of the state of Arizona and most of the Western states,” said McDonald, a towering man with a friendly voice.\n\nWhat eventually resulted from that first meeting was a surprising coalition — environmental and conservation organizations, multigenerational rancher families and federal agencies — working together. They called themselves the Malpai Borderlands Group, named for the volcanic malapai rock common in the area, derived from the Spanish word \"malpaís,\" or badlands, a term used by early Spanish explorers for the black landscapes of volcanic rock across the Southwest and Mexico.\n\nThe coalition remains a rare example of long-standing, strong partnerships between groups that often have conflicting interests.\n\n“Our focus was on conservation and protecting open space and trying to prevent development, because that was the threat at the time, and also trying to keep ranching viable,” McDonald said. “The border came along later, much later.”\n\nDrug smuggling from Mexico was a big problem in the region, primarily in developed areas like Douglas, which sits across the border from the larger Mexican city of Agua Prieta. In 1990, the first drug-smuggling tunnel was discovered between Agua Prieta and Douglas to funnel cocaine into the United States, authorities said at the time.\n\nDuring those years, Douglas was considered a hot spot for drug and human trafficking, with illegal activity peaking in the late 1990s and early 2000s. In response, the federal government spent billions of dollars to build more border infrastructure where there were cities on both sides of the border, such as El Paso, San Diego and Nogales, as well as Douglas.\n\nThe new pedestrian fencing helped deter the foot traffic in town, but as a result, illegal activities were funneled to more remote areas of the borderlands, including the area of the San Bernardino Refuge and the San Pedro River corridor.\n\n“Out here in the country, we weren’t getting any traffic,” McDonald said of the time. “The government decided to tighten up the border around the towns, and as it did, it pushed the traffic out here.”\n\nAfter 9/11, an attempt to seal the border\n\nTraphagen, the border conservation activist, started his career at the San Bernardino National Wildlife Refuge, working for the Fish and Wildlife Service as a biologist in the late 1990s. He remembers that he would encounter small groups of migrants from all over the world in the refuge. Once, he came across a group of 18 Vietnamese men.\n\n“They were coming looking for work. Mostly men, small groups of them,” Traphagen recalled.\n\nThere were drug smugglers too. Ranchers were subjected to vandalism and trash on their properties, as well as intimidation and threats from smugglers at times. Drug-smuggling vehicles cut new roads across the landscape.\n\nThe Malpai Group, concerned for both the degradation of the land and the safety of their communities, asked the Border Patrol to do more, to station more agents in the area and incorporate more surveillance technology.\n\n“They really weren't paying much attention to us for a long time,” said McDonald. “There were a few more agents running around out here, but there wasn’t a concerted effort in my opinion to do anything about what was happening out here on the ranches.”\n\nAfter the Sept. 11 attacks, the Bush administration began a frenzied effort to seal the border. The administration created the Department of Homeland Security, and relocated the Border Patrol to its oversight instead of the Department of Justice. They started hiring more agents; the Tucson sector, which spans 262 miles along the Arizona border, had employed about 1,500 agents before 9/11. Now, there are about 3,600.\n\nIn 2006, as part of the border security efforts, the Bush administration attempted to do almost exactly what the Trump administration is doing now. In 2008, the Department of Homeland Security invoked its Congress-mandated right to waive 37-plus environmental laws to expedite border wall construction, primarily new bollard-style fencing, along 700 miles of the border, including through the San Pedro River and the San Bernardino National Wildlife Refuge.\n\n“Without question, this action taken on behalf of DHS will be a new paradigm for all involved,” a Fish and Wildlife officer wrote in an email to his colleagues at the time, according to documents obtained by the Sierra Club through a Freedom of Information Act request and shared with The Republic.\n\nThe correspondence in these documents sheds some light on a process that is being repeated today with little transparency. Agency officials are being told to remain tight-lipped and to direct media queries to Customs and Border Protection. Despite persistent public records requests, local stakeholders, conservation groups and journalists receive little, if any, information on the plans and resource use happening with the ongoing construction.\n\nThe letters and assessments in the more than 260 pages of documents reviewed by The Republic paint a picture of agency personnel tasked with caring for these sensitive federally protected lands often scrambling to react to constantly changing construction plans, miscommunications and broken agreements with the Department of Homeland Security and its contractors. But as bad as the communication was then, it is worse this time around, officials and locals say.\n\n“The DHS strategy of achieving more security along the international border exemplified a general lack of respect for the mission of the Service, and showed an almost total disregard for the principles of basic collaboration and honest communication which have greatly damaged working relationships and trust,” the Fish and Wildlife Service wrote in its 2008 Narrative Report.\n\nThe documents also illustrate a level of persistence required by Fish and Wildlife field staff to negotiate compromises in the face of “train wreck scale” proposals from the border security agency, as San Bernardino Refuge manager Bill Radke described initial plans in a 2008 email.\n\nThose included building “pedestrian” fencing — bollard-style fencing — that would halt wildlife migration, building a base and surveillance towers as well as drilling wells on the refuge, and creating a road where there previously was nothing but impassable, steep and eroded terrain.\n\n\"An effective vehicle barrier already exists along much of the south refuge boundary, which has completely eliminated illegal vehicle incursions through the refuge,\" Radke wrote to a colleague in 2007. \"Construction of a human impenetrable fence through a wetland would harm more habitat than it would ultimately protect.\"\n\nIn the end, the agencies and their partners, including the Malpai Group, managed to negotiate some wins: They prevented bollard-style fencing from being built through the San Pedro River. The Department of Homeland Security listened to the Fish and Wildlife Service’s suggestion of placing Normandy-style barriers in the river corridor and stationing agents there full time. The Border Patrol removes the barriers during the monsoon, and the Bureau of Land Management has stated the method is working.\n\n\"Currently, seasonal removal of the 'Normandy' style vehicular barriers has allowed the San Pedro River to maintain natural processes,\" the agency wrote in 2019 comments about the current construction proposal.\n\nIn the San Bernardino Refuge, Customs and Border Protection built a vehicle barrier along the refuge that was up to security standards, but also allowed wildlife to pass through. Though more water was pumped from the aquifer that supplies the San Bernardino Refuge than ever had been historically, no new wells were drilled. No camera towers or forward operating bases were built there as originally proposed. The agency's contractors took steps to mitigate flooding caused by some of the new barriers. They didn’t tear down the wildlife-friendly vehicle barrier that the refuge had built with its own funds two years before the new construction began.\n\nIn a 2007 email to a colleague, Radke described how the number of migrants detained on and adjacent to the refuge had decreased by more than 70 percent between 2002, before the vehicle barrier, and 2006, a year after the barrier was completed, attributing the change to the barrier and an increased law enforcement presence in the area.\n\n“We continue to have a major problem along the border, but also have the ability to control that problem with an active and continuing law enforcement presence,” Radke wrote in that email. “If provided adequate support, we can provide protection to staff and visitors and protect cultural and natural resources on and adjacent to the refuges.\"\n\n'No respect' for damage to lands\n\nBut more conflicts were lost. Where thick chaparral, mesquite and cottonwood trees had overtaken the Roosevelt easement, making it impossible for vehicles to drive there and difficult for humans to navigate, Customs and Border Protection built a wide all-weather road across nearly the entire San Bernardino Valley to the New Mexico state line.\n\nIn 2009, migrants were caught on camera crossing over the new vehicle barriers into the U.S. and using the road at the refuge boundary — an impact the Fish and Wildlife Service had anticipated.\n\nOn one part of the easement along the refuge’s boundary, instead of vehicle barriers that wildlife could pass through easily, the Department of Homeland Security's contractor built eight-strand barbed wire fencing. A deer attempted to jump the fence, got its hind leg caught in the wires, and died there. The contractor eventually replaced the fence with a wildlife-friendly vehicle barrier.\n\nThey bulldozed soil into a stream channel, leaving refuge staff scrambling to remove hundreds of endangered Yaqui topminnow from the stream in the midst of construction. The contractor cleared a 300-foot by 300-foot staging area on the refuge with no warning, and narrowly avoided one of the Slaughter Ranch’s historic building foundations.\n\n“We are continually told one thing while they take action to do something else,” Radke angrily wrote in a 2008 email to colleagues, apparently having reached a limit, his writing style contrasting with his usual diplomatic tone.\n\n“There appears to be no respect whatsoever regarding damage to refuge lands,\" he wrote. \"Nobody made a simple phone call to the refuge to discuss this before they bulldozed. The contractor is blaming the Army Corps. Army Corps is remaining quiet. Border Patrol acts like they don’t know anything about the issue. Accountability and coordination regarding this border construction is absolutely sickening.”\n\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers oversaw the contractor on the project.\n\nAs construction was nearing its end in March 2010, Robert Krentz, a prominent rancher in the area and Malpai Group member, was killed on his ranch 20 miles north of the refuge. Authorities determined that the 58-year-old rancher was likely shot by drug smugglers. The community was shaken and the ranchers were angry. They felt their concerns had been ignored and now it was too late.\n\nAfter Krentz’s murder, McDonald traveled to Washington, D.C., to testify before two House committees about border issues. He urged the government to increase the number of agents stationed in the area and invest in technology that would allow for better surveillance and communication in the remote area.\n\n“It is our own government’s policy of forcing the illegal crossers into the most rural, most formidable terrain that is responsible for the traffic we are enduring,” he testified. “They are not deterred by high mountains, steep canyons, brush, or scarce water, and certainly not by high fences in the middle of nowhere.”\n\nCustoms and Border Protection listened.\n\nThey increased their agent presence in the region, built more vehicle barriers, and installed high-tech camera towers throughout the valley. The Malpai helped them identify a strategic location for a new forward operating base.\n\n“The result of all that is we felt like we finally got to a good partnership with them,” McDonald said. And the combined strategies of camera towers, increased law enforcement and vehicle barriers seemed to work.\n\n“There was no activity out here,” McDonald said. “(Border Patrol) were being very transparent about the fact that they weren’t catching anybody down here anymore, or catching very few, and that the integrated fixed towers were working very well.”\n\nAt the Slaughter Ranch, Border Patrol agents often stop to chat with the Dunns to pass the time, they said. “When Border Patrol starts referring to your area as Snoozeville, that kinda says something,” Fred said.\n\nThere's been a dramatic decline in cross-border activity in both Douglas and the areas surrounding it since the watchtowers were installed in 2016. The Cochise County Sheriff's Office currently has 700 additional cameras that monitor the area. \"There's been a huge decrease (in traffic),\" said Sheriff Mark Dannels in a phone interview. \"I don't think we've had a drug load in the past 24 months.\"\n\nThe new construction, which began in late September, was a shock to many; McDonald said they didn't hear about the current wall construction until it hit the papers, and by then, it was too late to do anything.\n\n\"Malpai was built on trust,\" he said. \"We worked really hard to establish trust between ranchers, environmental organizations, agency folks and everybody who cares about the area. We felt we had a good relationship with the Border Patrol here. It worked against us because we had too much confidence in the local leadership.\n\n\"I’m sure in Washington they looked down here and said here's a road running next to the border, here's Roosevelt easement, not a lot of private property concerns, let's put it there,\" he said. \"Because they're trying to get up as much wall as they can as fast as they can. It's not a border security thing, it's a political thing.”\n\nTrying to preserve a rugged country\n\nIn the San Bernardino Valley, when night falls, the earth is swallowed up, and the stars freckle the sky. The only lights are the distant stream of traffic on Highway 2 in Mexico to the south and the glow of Douglas to the west. The huge sky with its infinite speckles of light imbues a sense of smallness, a feeling of the Earth’s fragility.\n\nConserving an unfragmented landscape was one of the original goals of the Malpai Group, and it remains the core of its mission. They have protected some 80,000 acres of private land from development so far, and in doing so, helped protect the public lands throughout it. The openness of this place is why McDonald loves it, despite the difficulties of living in such a remote place.\n\n“It’s a tough life in many ways,” McDonald said. “Isolated compared to many people, though not as much as it used to be and there are things that you give up by living out here. But one of the great amenities of it is the beauty of the area and the wildlife. And those things are being compromised by the wall.”\n\nThe new border wall system, including the 19 miles in the San Bernardino Valley, will include lighting, Customs and Border Protection said, though the agency wouldn’t confirm whether the lights would be on throughout the night because the information is law enforcement-sensitive.\n\n“When you left Douglas, you used to look out there and it was open space,” McDonald said. “Of course, there’s some stuff going on in Mexico on the other side and you'll see a few lights where you never saw them before and that may increase over time, I don't know. But the fact of the matter is this shatters the whole open space thing and that hurts.”\n\nPlaces like the San Pedro River and the San Bernardino Valley and the limited water that makes these areas habitable will face continuing threats from climate change and groundwater use in the area. The border wall, critics say, will unnecessarily add to existing stresses. Amid the many concerns, construction continues quickly in the San Bernardino Valley; about 6 miles of noncontiguous fencing has been completed in the area on either side of the refuge. Construction appears imminent at the San Pedro.\n\nFor people like McDonald, the frustration is in the fact that those who will live with the wall are essentially powerless to stop it, or at the least have a way to make their two cents heard.\n\n“I wish we had the opportunity to talk about this before it was being built. Maybe one day they'll tear the damn thing down or at least not put on the lights,” McDonald said, a weariness in his voice. “There are a lot of beautiful places in this country, but they won't stay beautiful if we don’t try to take care of them.”\n\nErin Stone covers the environment for The Arizona Republic and azcentral.com.

Many eyes are on Georgia, where former Vice President Mike Pence has been rallying support for Gov. Brian Kemp, the Republican incumbent. Pence appeared at an event for Kemp yesterday -- and it was widely seen as an implicit rebuke of former President Donald Trump, who has endorsed Kemp's primary opponent, former GOP Sen. David Perdue. On the Democratic side, Stacey Abrams is running unopposed , setting up a potential rematch with Kemp following a previous loss to him in 2018. However, since her defeat, Abrams has soared to national prominence and is no longer an underdog with little following outside of Georgia. This comes as early voting has surged to record levels in the Georgia primary, with more than 800,000 ballots cast ahead of today's contests.\n\n2.

The committee's central mission has been to uncover the full scope of former President Donald Trump's unprecedented attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election and stop the transfer of power to President Joe Biden. These highly choreographed hearings will be the panel's first opportunity to show the public what it's learned from more than 1,000 witness interviews and 135,000 documents during its 10-month investigation. Today's hearing will also shine a spotlight on the nine-member committee , which features seven Democrats and two Republicans, and set the stage for subsequent hearings in the coming days.\n\n2. Gun violence\n\nVictims of the Uvalde elementary school massacre and other recent mass shootings gave first-hand descriptions of the horrors of gun violence at a House committee meeting on Wednesday. In a pre-recorded video, 11-year-old Miah Cerrillo, a fourth-grade student at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde , described trying to hide behind her teacher's desk and covering herself in blood in an attempt to survive. It marked a rare moment for Congress to hear testimony from someone as young as Cerrillo on a subject as sensitive and disturbing as gun violence. Family members of shooting victims also made passionate pleas for gun legislation. The hearing, however, clearly displayed the partisan divide in the debate on guns as Democrats urged stronger gun control, while Republicans pushed back on restrictions.\n\nJUST WATCHED 'She had blood everywhere': Uvalde pediatrician describes treating young girl Replay More Videos ...

Notably, however, the leaders of several countries that are crucial to addressing the influx of migrants at the border -- including Mexico, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala -- are boycotting the summit, dealing an embarrassing blow to the White House at a time when it is scrambling to handle the issue. At the US southern border, US Customs and Border Protection stopped more than 310,000 migrants from the Northern Triangle of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador from October through April, according to the latest agency data.\n\nJUST WATCHED Blinken: Immigration challenges beyond anything that anyone has seen before Replay More Videos ...

According to the measure, billions of dollars will be used to send military equipment and weapons from US stocks to Ukraine and to purchase weapons from contractors, among several other allocations. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the \"friends\" of his country for approving the bill.

The first few rounds of 2022 primaries have doubled as a proving ground for Trump's ability to bend the Republican Party to his will.

A Trump Organization spokesperson responded to the firm cutting ties, expressing disappointment at the split and also suggested Mazars performed their work \"in accordance with all applicable accounting standards and principles\" without any discrepancies.\n\nJUST WATCHED 'Super uncommon': Toobin on accounting firm cutting ties with Trump Organization Replay More Videos ...

US Postal Service\n\nThe sweeping bill to overhaul the US Postal Service's finances hit a snag yesterday in the Senate . Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, objected to a unanimous consent request to make a technical fix to the bipartisan bill. The measure seeks to overhaul the Postal Service's finances to help allow it to modernize its service. Scott, however, argued that the Senate should slow down and work to improve issues with the legislation. The Senate was not able vote to advance the bill yesterday, but despite the delay, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer vowed the Senate will eventually pass it soon.\n\n5.

The effort -- dubbed \"Operation Allies Welcome\" -- has been a heavy lift for the Biden administration, which has pushed to increase its resettlement capacity across agencies.\n\nJUST WATCHED Documents raise new questions about US military findings in Kabul Replay More Videos ...

Ukraine\n\nFinland's president and prime minister have announced their support for joining NATO , moving the Nordic nation -- which shares an 800-mile border with Russia -- one step closer to membership of the US-led military alliance. Since the end of World War II, Finland has been militarily non-aligned and neutral to avoid provoking Russia. The war in Ukraine, however, has sufficiently changed the calculation, so that joining NATO now seems the best way forward, regardless of what Russia's reaction might be . It is also expected that Sweden, Finland's neighbor to the west, will soon announce its intention to join the alliance. Russia has warned both countries against joining NATO, saying there would be consequences. Separately, prosecutors in Ukraine have launched a war crimes investigation after Russian soldiers were caught on surveillance video shooting unarmed civilians\n\n2. Abortion\n\nA key vote on a Democrat-led bill aimed at preserving access to abortion nationwide failed in the Senate yesterday. The bill's failure to advance comes as the Democratic Party faces enormous pressure to take action on abortion rights amid fears that the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling will soon be struck down. The final tally was 49 to 51, with Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia joining with Republicans to vote against the measure and stop it from advancing. President Joe Biden lashed out at Senate Republicans yesterday for blocking the passage of the Women's Health Protection Act. \"This failure to act comes at a time when women's constitutional rights are under unprecedented attack -- and it runs counter to the will of the majority of American people,\" Biden said.\n\nJUST WATCHED Abortion rights supporters chant outside Supreme Court Justices' homes Replay More Videos ...

Prices still increased, but at a slower pace than in previous months. The Consumer Price Index was up 8.3% in the 12 months ended in April, slightly higher than economists had predicted, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said yesterday . It was a decrease from the 8.5% recorded in March, which had been the highest level in more than 40 years. Yesterday's data suggests that the inflation peak is behind us, just as economists, the Federal Reserve, the White House and the American people hoped. But some economists say the war in Ukraine, bad weather, and renewed Covid-related lockdowns in China will likely keep prices elevated over the summer. The cost of food also continued to rise in the last 12 months, and the highest increases were seen among some grocery staples such as eggs, milk, citrus fruits and margarine.\n\nJUST WATCHED Inflation dips, but still high Replay More Videos ...

Nearly 108,000 people died of drug overdoses last year, and about two-thirds of those deaths involved fentanyl or another synthetic opioid. \"This is a devastating milestone in the history of the overdose epidemic in America,\" said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Overdose deaths have been on the rise for years in the US, but surged amid the Covid-19 pandemic, which accelerated trends that were already heading in the wrong direction.

In addition to extending the existing payment pause, borrowers who make less than $125,000 a year are eligible for up to $20,000 in student loan forgiveness if they received Pell Grants, which are given to students from low- and middle-income families. Individuals who make less than $125,000 a year but did not receive Pell Grants are eligible for $10,000 in loan forgiveness. So, what steps do eligible borrowers need to take ?

During the attack, the shooter remained in two adjoined classrooms for more than an hour before officers entered the rooms and killed him, authorities say. The delay contradicted widely taught protocol for active shooter situations that calls for police to immediately stop the threat. State officials identified Arredondo as the on-scene police commander, though he has said he did not consider himself in charge.\n\nJUST WATCHED 'Turn in your badge': Child demands Chief Arredondo be fired Replay More Videos ...

On Friday, North Dakota's trigger law that bans abortions in most circumstances is set to take effect.

Several Republican-controlled states have enacted new restrictions on such things as mail-in voting and early voting in the name of election security -- measures Democrats fear may affect turnout, especially in battleground states. In response, Democrats are considering measures to counter such restrictions, including making Election Day a federal holiday and setting minimum national standards for voting by mail.

She is now in New York City, where she has two rest days, and her next stop is North Carolina, where she will visit the Wright Brothers National Memorial in Kitty Hawk.\n\nThe teen aviator flies about five hours nearly every day; the longest solo flight she had ever done before her world record attempt was about 4½ hours. Rutherford said she avoids eating or drinking much before she boards her plane so she doesn't need to use the bathroom while she is in the air.\n\n\"I say that, but on my flight from (Goose Bay, Canada) to Montreal, I had to make an emergency stop,\" she said with a laugh.\n\nThe long hours in the plane can get lonely; Rutherford said she mostly listens to podcasts to pass the time. She said her favorite is 20-year-old YouTuber Emma Chamberlain's podcast \"Anything Goes.\"\n\n\"Especially like over Greenland, you lose radio almost immediately, so it's really quiet, she said. \"If you get a podcast that's just one person talking, then it feels like there's someone there with you.\"\n\nRutherford said her favorite stop has been Kulusuk, Greenland, because of the scenic landscape.\n\n\"I saw my very first whale, so that was amazing, and it's such a stunning sight,\" she said. \"You know the wallpapers that come with a computer of like beautiful scenery? If you take your phone out and snap literally any picture, it looks like that.\"\n\nFor Guinness World Records to consider the trip truly \"around the world,\" Rutherford has to cross points on opposite sides of the globe. On her route, those spots are just below the equator in Columbia and just above the equator in Indonesia. She added nearly 5,000 miles to the trip so she would be able to visit more places.\n\nWaiz said that while she did not directly help Rutherford plan her route, she did offer advice about weather and other challenges she might face during the journey.\n\n\"The weather can really turn on you at any time, so you really have to be just aware of what to expect in different parts of the world during the season,\" she said. \"I told her: 'Only you know if you should take off. Try not to let anything pressure you or commitments you've made around the world. People can wait. At the end of the day, it's you in that plane, so do whatever is best for you.'\"\n\nRutherford said her flights have been mostly smooth sailing, but she did have one stressful moment on her flight from Iceland to Greenland. Her plane cannot fly through clouds, and she hit an overcast system where the clouds forced her to drop to 600 feet. She said she considered turning back, but the clouds cleared up and she was able to continue to her next stop.\n\nWaiz believes Rutherford's humility and intelligence give her a good chance to succeed.\n\n\"If you have an ego going into it, it can really hurt you, so I think Zara being very humble is definitely going to help,\" she said. \"You just never know what Mother Nature's going to do. I feel like she's a pretty grounded person, and she has a really great intuition.\"\n\nWaiz is founder and president of a nonprofit called Dreams Soar, which educates girls around the world about aviation. Dreams Soar is one of Rutherford's charity partners on her flight, and the teen will meet up with Waiz and local Women of Aviation chapter on her stop in Jacksonville, Florida.\n\nRutherford is projected to complete her trip on Nov. 3, and though she said the three months remaining are daunting, she is taking things one day at a time.\n\n\"It sounds like a lifetime, but actually, I'm really enjoying it. I rarely think about it as a whole. It's always one flying leg at a time. That way you kind of forget about the bigger picture.\"\n\nContact Emily Adams at eaadams@gannett.com or on Twitter @eaadams6.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2022/01/20/woman-sets-record-flying-solo-around-world/6590115001/", "title": "Pilot sets record for youngest woman to fly solo around the world", "text": "Marta Fiorin and Raf Casert\n\nAssociated Press\n\nKORTRIJK, Belgium — The 19-year-old Belgian-British pilot Zara Rutherford set a world record as the youngest woman to fly solo around the world, touching her small airplane down in western Belgium on Thursday — 155 days after she departed.\n\nRutherford will find herself in the Guinness World Records book after setting the mark that had been held by 30-year-old American aviator Shaesta Waiz since 2017.\n\nThe overall record will remain out of Rutherford’s grasp, since Briton Travis Ludlow set that benchmark last year as an 18-year-old.\n\nHer global flight in her ultralight Shark plane was supposed to take three months, but relentless bad weather and visa issues kept her grounded sometimes for weeks on end, extending her adventure by about two months.\n\nZara Rutherford on her historic flight:'I always thought it would be too unrealistic' but 'wouldn't it be better to start when I'm younger?'\n\nOn Thursday, rain, drizzle, sunshine and even a rainbow over Kortrijk airport exemplified the changing, often bad weather she had been facing all too often.\n\nAfter she was escorted by a four-plane formation in a huge V across much of Belgium, she did a flyby of the airport before finally landing. After waving to the jubilant crowds, she embraced her parents and draped herself both in the Union Jack and Belgian tricolor flag.\n\n“Winter in Europe poses a lot of challenges,” she said as she was held back for days on the last few legs of the trip. Then again, she had had to deal with -31 F in Siberia and 90 F in Indonesia. Fog, smoke from wildfires and even typhoons also held her back.\n\nIn her trek of more than 28,000 nautical miles, she stopped over in five continents and visited 41 nations.\n\n“The people were incredible, everywhere,\" she said.\n\nRutherford’s flight saw her steer clear of wildfires in California, deal with biting cold over Russia and narrowly avoid North Korean airspace. She flew by Visual Flight Rules, basically going on sight only, often slowing down progress when more sophisticated systems could have led her through clouds and fog.\n\nSometimes she feared for her life, and at other times she simply yearned for the simple comforts of home. Flying runs in her blood since both her parents are pilots and she has been traveling in small planes since she was 6.

The cancellation would be limited to borrowers with household incomes of $125,000 or less, and would apply only to people with federal loans, not private ones. The action is also expected to include extending until January a moratorium on federal student loan payments – implemented during the coronavirus pandemic – set to expire at the end of this month. The White House would not confirm the upcoming announcement, first reported by the Associated Press. The president has said he would make a decision by Aug. 31. Biden faces increasing pressure from progressive Democrats to cancel an even larger share of debt for Americans who took federal loans to pay for college. But some Democratic economists worry about the risk of debt cancellation exacerbating 40-year-high inflation.\n\nPrefer to listen?

A special Texas House committee tasked with investigating the shooting determined that the embattled school district police chief failed to act quickly enough to shoot and kill the gunman. The report, released in July, also determined that Arredondo held the role of incident commander at the scene and was responsible for directing law enforcement officers.

Authorities in Kyiv banned large-scale gatherings until Thursday, fearing the national holiday might bring particularly heavy Russian missile attacks. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged the public to be vigilant. \"Russian provocations and brutal strikes are a possibility,\" he said in a statement. Wednesday's holiday commemorates Ukraine's 1991 declaration of independence from the Soviet Union. The U.S. State Department issued an alert Tuesday urging Americans to \"depart Ukraine now,\" citing concerns of possible Russian attacks.

Tuesday marked what would have been Kobe Bryant's 44th birthday and the first time an attorney put a dollar amount on what he wants the jury to award Vanessa Bryant and Chris Chester, her fellow plaintiff: $75 million for past and future distress. The jury will be tasked with making a series of decisions about the case: First, did these county first responders violate Bryant's and Chester's constitutional privacy rights under the Fourteenth Amendment by publicly disseminating crash-scene photos? If so, is the county liable for it as an organization?

I'm Taylor Wilson and this is 5 Things you need to know Wednesday, the 24th of August, 2022. Today, six months of war in Ukraine, plus student loan debt forgiveness, and more.\n\nHere are some of the top headlines:\n\nThe US military said earlier today that it carried out airstrikes in Eastern Syria. They targeted areas used by militias backed by Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard. No immediate casualty figures were available. An attorney for Vanessa Bryant urged a jury to award $75 million to her and fellow plaintiff, Chris Chester. They're suing Los Angeles County accusing officials of taking pictures of the crash scene where their loved ones, including NBA star, Kobe Bryant, were killed in a helicopter in 2020. And a new survey from the Harris poll found that 84% of parents learned more about their kids' education during the COVID pandemic. You can find the poll's full findings on USATODAY.com.\n\n♦\n\nToday marks six months since Russia invaded Ukraine. And it also happens to be the country's Independence Day. The holiday commemorates Ukraine's 1991 declaration of independence from the Soviet Union, though many across the country won't be celebrating much. Authorities in Kyiv have banned large scale gatherings until at least Thursday. There are fears the holiday might bring particularly heavy Russian missile attacks, and tensions are high after a car bomb killed a hard line Russian commentator outside Moscow this past weekend.\n\nGlobally, the US and EU are still throwing support behind Ukraine. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg reiterated the defense alliances, \"support for Ukraine for the long term so that Ukraine prevails as a sovereign independent nation.\" Former US ambassador to NATO, Ivo Daalder, told the AP that Ukrainians remain determined to push back on Russia's advances.\n\nIvo Daalder:\n\nFar from the cakewalk and greeting Russia as liberators that Moscow seemed to think would happen, the Ukrainians offered extraordinary resistance. There is war worry, and war wariness. At the same time, there's also determination. It is very clear that the Ukrainian people and overwhelming majorities are behind their government's determination to not only resist the Russian military advances, but ultimately, to regain full independence of every inch of Ukrainian territory, and are willing to fight to that end.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd in the US, the Biden administration is expected to announce today an additional $3 billion to the country to help train and equip Ukrainian forces. To date, the US has provided more than $10 billion in military aid to the country since the start of the Biden administration.\n\nMeanwhile, we're learning more about suspected war crimes committed during Russia's invasion. And international reporter Kim Hjelmgaard tells producer PJ Elliott that the pursuit of justice in war time is far from clear.\n\nKim Hjelmgaard:\n\nKind of six months into this war between Ukraine and Russia, there's almost 30,000, 26, 27,000 war crimes allegations by the Ukrainians against Russians. These include ordinary soldiers, military commanders, also high level officials, propagandists, judges, cabinet ministers, and of course Mr. Putin himself. And Ukrainians launched their investigations pretty much within the first week of this unprovoked invasion by Russia. And there's been a range of claims and allegations related to sexual violence, torture, kidnapping, much of which was conducted in the suburbs in and around Kyiv in March. Since then, in fact, since late February, all of Ukraine has been bombarded with missiles, shells, rockets, pretty much nonstop. And a lot of these munitions are falling into residential neighborhoods. They're hitting schools, they're hitting apartment buildings, they're hitting warehouses, they're hitting all sorts of things, and civilians are dying.\n\nA lot of these deaths don't necessarily all fall under war crimes because in order to meet a war crimes test, there has to be certain things in place. For example, there has to be an intention. The Russians have to have intended to hit say a school. There has to be... Military necessity is a factor, and a couple of other things.\n\nUkrainians want to try or hear the majority of these cases in their own courts, rather than waiting for a case say to kind of wend its way to an international court in the Hague or possibly even years from now connected to the UN or some other kind of venues where they could potentially bring some of these cases in an international setting.\n\nPJ Elliott:\n\nSo Kim, who could punish Russia in all of this and what kind of punishment could they face?\n\nKim Hjelmgaard:\n\nSo the clearest, most direct way to punishing Russia for a crime that has been heard and there's been a guilty conviction, is in Ukrainian court. And in fact, that's happened already. There's been eight cases, mostly kind of junior Russian military personnel who are prisoners of war, who've been accused of crimes, and they've convicted eight of these people already. And one of the ones that features in our story is a guy who shells an apartment building in Kharkiv. No one was killed, but nevertheless, under Ukrainian law, they charged him and gave him a 10 year sentence.\n\nNow, some of the more high level people, those people are inside Russia. And it's sort of an open question about whether they will ever be dragged into a courtroom in an international setting, because if they don't leave Russia, it's going to be hard to arrest them essentially years from now that is possible if there's a different government in Russia, and some of these officials travel abroad, and if there's an arrest warrant out for them, they could be detained somewhere. But essentially for the bigger cases and the big names, it's kind of a long term game.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nFor more, stay with our daily updates page from Ukraine on USATODAY.com. And you can find Kim's piece with a link in today's episode description.\n\n♦\n\nPresident Joe Biden is set to announce today that he'll forgive $10,000 in student loan debt for millions of borrowers who fall below an income cap. The cancellation would apply to borrowers from households that make $125,000 or less, and would apply only to federal loans, not private ones. The move will also likely include an extension until January on the moratorium of federal student loan payments. That was implemented during the pandemic, but set to expire this month. AP education reporter Collin Binkley has more.\n\nCollin Binkley:\n\nIt's a decision that's long awaited at a very politically polarized, but is expected to bring relief to millions of student loan borrowers across the country. At the same time, he also extended a student loan freeze that allows borrowers to put off their payments during the pandemic. Calls for student debt cancellation have been increasing for years as just the total amount of student debt in the country continues to balloon. Since 2007, the total amount of student debt has tripled. It's now one of the largest forms of personal debt, there are proponents who say that by canceling that it will bring relief to Americans who buy houses, cars, who haven't been able to make other important milestones in their lives because they're so burdened by this debt.\n\nPolitically, it was a really thorny issue for President Biden. There's so many factions with strong opinions around student debt and what to do about it. First from the right, Republicans are opposed to any form of student debt cancellation. They say that it's sort of an unfair handout, that it helps wealthier Americans at the expense of taxpayers who didn't go to college. They say that it's going to worsen inflation and be a big cost for the nation.\n\nOn the left, you get a variety of opinions. The most extreme, there are groups who say that 50,000 is the minimum that President Biden should cancel. There are some that say that all student debt should just be eliminated entirely. There are some that say that $10,000 is okay as a start. Yeah, no doubt, this will continue to be a political issue going into the midterms. And we could see even a lengthy legal challenge to it, which could delay the actual cancellation for some time. So whether the money actually gets erased before voters go to the polls is kind of up in the air.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nBook bans in schools have landed librarians in activists' cross hairs. Producer PJ Elliott spoke with Education reporter Alia Wong, who says the movement to band books from schools is bringing vitriol toward them.\n\nAlia Wong:\n\nLibraries are being entangled in debates over what type of content kids should have access to specifically content about sex and gender identity in many cases about race as well. So these debates have really centered libraries, including in what's in their collections. Many activists, some of them parents, have called on libraries to remove certain books from their collections on the grounds that they're inappropriate or too graphic. In some cases they've asked libraries to simply move certain books from children's shelves to adult shelves. In many cases, the controversies aren't even over books specifically, but rather about displays, such as what books library is promoting say during Pride month or what kind of signage it has surrounding certain books.\n\nLibrary programming has also come under scrutiny. Perhaps most notoriously earlier this summer, activists affiliated with the alt-right group, the Proud Boys stormed some library events known as Drag Queen Story Hour in which drag queens read story books to children. And these events have been stormed and disrupted by protestors. So we really see libraries - because of their books, because of their programming, because of their efforts at inclusivity - are really becoming prime targets for a lot of the outrage.\n\nPJ Elliott:\n\nSo this obviously makes the job of a librarian harder. Are we going to see a shortage of people in those positions or are we already starting to see that?\n\nAlia Wong:\n\nYeah. These challenges, the pressure, in many cases the harassment and intimidation, it really has taken a toll on librarians. There are many instances in which librarians have basically quit or at least considered quitting because of these circumstances. But the shortages of librarians, they've been a problem for at least the past decade. A pair of researchers has been studying the trends specifically in school librarians and have found that over the past decade, the country has seen a 20% reduction in the number of school librarians. And that pattern only became more entrenched during the pandemic in the 2021/2022 school year. So the most recent school year, 30% of all school districts - so not just even schools, but entire school districts, entire school systems - didn't have a single librarian.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nThe Uvalde School Board in Texas has called for a special meeting today to consider firing School District Police Chief Pete Arredondo. He led the disastrous police response to the elementary school massacre that killed 19 students and two teachers in May. A special Texas House committee investigating the shooting found that he failed to act quickly enough to shoot and kill the gunmen. Officers stormed a classroom more than an hour after entering the school. They waited outside in the hallway, even as students on the other side of the door called 911 for help multiple times. Parents and community members have been calling for Arredondo to be fired along with the other five district officers who responded to the shooting and other district leaders.\n\n♦\n\nA teenager today could become the youngest person to fly around the world in a small plane. Belgian British 17-year-old Mack Rutherford touched down yesterday near the city of Charleroi, Belgium, where he originally learned to fly. His journey began on March 23rd and took him through 52 countries over five continents, crossing the equator twice to meet Guinness World Record requirements. His sister Zara also already set the record for the youngest woman to fly solo around the world at the age of 19. Their father, Sam Rutherford was beaming with pride.\n\nSam Rutherford:\n\nI'm feeling really, really happy. Very, very proud. They've both done extremely well. They have gone around the world safely, effectively, professionally, and they've shown to other youngsters that you don't have to be 18 even, and certainly not 30 to make a difference and do something and follow your dreams. And I think that's really important. So I'm very, very proud of them.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nMack Rutherford is due to land in Bulgaria today.\n\nThanks for listening to 5 Things.

In addition to extending the existing payment pause, borrowers who make less than $125,000 a year are eligible for up to $20,000 in student loan forgiveness if they received Pell Grants, which are given to students from low- and middle-income families. Individuals who make less than $125,000 a year but did not receive Pell Grants are eligible for $10,000 in loan forgiveness. So, what steps do eligible borrowers need to take ? Nearly 8 million borrowers may be able to receive debt forgiveness automatically because the Department of Education already has their income information. For those who need to provide this data, the Biden administration said it will launch a new application in the coming weeks.\n\n2. Kobe Bryant\n\nA federal jury awarded $31 million in damages after finding the Los Angeles County Sheriff and Fire departments liable for infringing on the constitutional rights of Vanessa Bryant and co-plaintiff Christopher Chester, who each lost a spouse and daughter in the helicopter crash in January 2020 . Bryant was awarded $16 million in damages and Chris Chester was awarded $15 million. The lawsuit said LA County deputies and firefighters took photos of not just wreckage from the helicopter, but also the mangled bodies of those killed -- including NBA star Kobe Bryant, his daughter Gianna, Chester's wife Sarah, his daughter Payton and five others. Bryant and Chester testified they live in fear the photos may surface, despite LA County's assertion each picture had been destroyed.\n\nJUST WATCHED Kobe Bryant's widow leaves court in tears after moment in court Replay More Videos ...

Uvalde\n\nThe Uvalde school board voted unanimously Wednesday to immediately terminate the contract of district police chief Pete Arredondo , three months after a gunman killed 19 children and two teachers at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas. Arredondo has come under intense public scrutiny over the law enforcement response to the May 24 massacre , America's deadliest school shooting since 2012. During the attack, the shooter remained in two adjoined classrooms for more than an hour before officers entered the rooms and killed him, authorities say. The delay contradicted widely taught protocol for active shooter situations that calls for police to immediately stop the threat. State officials identified Arredondo as the on-scene police commander, though he has said he did not consider himself in charge.\n\nJUST WATCHED 'Turn in your badge': Child demands Chief Arredondo be fired Replay More Videos ...

But I've been double vaccinated, double boosted. Symptoms are mild and I really appreciate your inquires and concerns. But I'm doing well, getting a lot of work done. Going to continue to get it done and in the meantime, thanks for your concern and keep the faith. It's gonna be OK,\" Biden, who was unmasked while standing outside on the Truman Balcony, said in the 20-second video the White House says was filmed by a masked and socially distanced videographer.\n\nThe mild symptoms and diagnosis protocol for Biden -- a double-boosted 79-year-old at high risk for experiencing severe illness -- will mean isolating and \"working and resting\" at the White House residence for the rest of the day, according to a senior administration official. This is the first time Biden has tested positive for Covid-19, and he last tested negative on Tuesday, per White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.\n\nBiden has called several people in the hours since his diagnosis. He wrote on Twitter Thursday afternoon that he is \"doing great\" following the positive test and said he called Pennsylvania politicians to send his regrets about having to cancel a scheduled trip to the commonwealth. The tweet was accompanied by an image of the President smiling at a desk, without a mask, in the residence of the White House.\n\nUS President Joe Biden is seen in this photo shared to Twitter, after he tested positive for Covid-19 on Thursday, July 21.\n\nIn a memo that was sent to staff obtained by CNN, White House chief of staff Ron Klain said Biden will be working over the phone and on video conference for the next few days following the positive result.\n\n\"I've spoken to him several times this morning already about an array of matters, and he is focused on our pending business,\" Klain wrote on Thursday.\n\nDay Zero\n\nBiden tested positive for Covid-19 Thursday morning and has begun taking the antiviral drug Paxlovid, which is available via emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of mild to moderate Covid-19 in people 12 and older who are at high risk of severe illness. It requires a doctor's prescription.\n\n\"Consistent with (US Center for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines, he will isolate at the White House and will continue to carry out all of his duties fully during that time,\" Jean-Pierre said in a statement.\n\nThursday marks \"Day 0\" of the President's Covid-19 timeline -- meaning he will be in isolation until at least next Tuesday in accordance to the CDC's guidelines.\n\nThe President's symptoms include \"rhinorreha (or 'runny nose') and fatigue, with an occasional dry cough, which started yesterday evening,\" according to a letter from the President's physician, Dr. Kevin O'Connor. Biden did not have a fever Thursday morning, White House coronavirus coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha told CNN.\n\nJha later told reporters that Biden's oxygen levels were \"normal\" as of Thursday morning and that Biden's Covid-19 virus sample has been sent to a lab to identify the specific variant he is infected with. Results are expected in \"less than a week.\"\n\nBiden first tested positive for Covid-19 on an antigen test Thursday morning as part of routine screening, and the positive result was later was confirmed by a PCR test, his physician said.\n\nO'Connor also noted that the President met the FDA's criteria for use of the antiviral Paxlovid, adding, \"I anticipate that he will respond favorably, as most maximally protected patients do.\"\n\nDue to his age, Biden is at an increased risk for a more severe case of Covid-19, although the CDC says older adults being fully vaccinated and boosted significantly reduces their risk of hospitalization and death.\n\nJha said Thursday that Biden has the \"full set of protections\" to deal with Covid-19 at his advanced age.\n\n\"The bottom line is given how much immunity he has from vaccines, given that he was started on treatments right away ... I think all of those things very dramatically reduce his risk of serious illness,\" Jha told CNN's Jeff Zeleny during the White House press briefing. \"And that's really the goal here, is to prevent serious illness, to keep that risk as low as possible. I think he's gotten that full set of protections.\"\n\nBiden received his first two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine ahead of his inauguration in January 2021, his first booster shot in September and his second booster vaccination on March 30.\n\nStaff takes measures to adapt, Harris and first lady keep their previous schedules\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and first lady Jill Biden tested negative on Thursday.\n\nJean-Pierre indicated that the West Wing will continue to practice its current protocols but that the White House residential staff will be taking measures to create a \"very minimal footprint\" to avoid infecting others.\n\nThe number of aides who staff the White House residence will be reduced to the \"bare minimum\" in light of Biden's positive Covid-19 diagnosis, an official told CNN.\n\nAnd a mid-level West Wing aide who works in close proximity to Biden and was on his recent trip to the Middle East also tested positive for Covid-19, according to two sources familiar. The person is not considered a close contact of the President and tested positive earlier this week.\n\nHarris is expected to keep her normal schedule while Biden isolates. The senior administration official said there are no plans and no need to transfer executive powers to Harris -- as was done last November for 85 minutes, when Biden was under anesthesia for a routine colonoscopy.\n\nHarris has been identified as a close contact of Biden, a White House official told CNN. Harris last saw Biden on Tuesday and tested negative on Thursday. She is a close contact, an additional aide says, because they spent more than 15 minutes together while being briefed on the presidential daily brief. The White House official added that Harris will follow CDC guidelines for those who are vaccinated, including wearing a well-fitting mask while around people for 10 days from the date of the last close contact.\n\nThe first lady and the vice president said they had both spoken to the President on Thursday following the diagnosis.\n\nJill Biden told reporters in Detroit earlier Thursday that she had spoken to the President and that \"he's doing fine. He's feeling good.\"\n\nThe first lady, her spokesman Michael LaRosa told CNN, will keep her original schedule on Thursday, which includes a stop in Georgia before heading to Wilmington, Delaware. She is also double boosted, LaRosa said.\n\nAnd Thursday afternoon, Harris said at an event in North Carolina that the President \"is in good spirits.\"\n\n\"He is working from the White House residence and when he spoke he was very pleased that we are all together today,\" she told her audience, adding that Biden told her to \"tell everybody hello.\"\n\nUpcoming presidential travel canceled\n\nA White House official told CNN that Biden's scheduled travel to Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, later on Thursday for a speech on crime prevention has been canceled. A DNC fundraiser Biden was scheduled to headline Thursday night has been postponed, officials said.\n\nIt's yet to be determined whether the event will be rescheduled or if donors will be asked to make their pledged contributions.\n\nBiden was also scheduled to travel to Orlando and Tampa, Florida, on Monday, but now he's expected to be isolating.\n\nBiden has ramped up his engagement with the public over the past year as the White House has shifted its approach toward the pandemic. On Wednesday, Biden traveled to Somerset, Massachusetts, for an event on climate executive actions, where he was seen shaking hands and greeting attendees in the outdoor crowd.\n\nThe President's positive diagnosis comes less than a week after a swing through the Middle East, where he held meetings with world leaders in Israel and Saudi Arabia. While abroad, Biden was seen shaking hands, bumping fists and embracing other leaders.\n\nThe White House is currently working on contact tracing for those who may have been close contacts of Biden, per an official, since his positive Covid test. They plan to inform any close contacts on Thursday, including members of Congress and the press.\n\nAt least one member of Congress who was a close contact after seeing Biden in Massachusetts received a contact tracing call from the White House on Thursday.\n\nThe White House reached out to the lawmaker's office Thursday afternoon, according to a source familiar, and advised the member of Congress to follow the CDC recommendations for what an individual should do when they're determined to be a close contact.\n\nOne of the recommendations, for example, for someone who is fully vaccinated and was a close contact is to wear a well-fitting mask while around other people for 10 days from the date of last close contact.\n\nWhite House prepared for this moment\n\nWhite House officials have been preparing for months for what many viewed as the inevitability that Biden would come down with Covid.\n\nA wave of cases -- including among Harris , White House staffers and members of Congress -- has swept Washington through the spring and summer. And as more and more of his top officials and members of his family contracted Covid, officials came to believe it was possible the President himself would get sick, even as they took steps to shield him from the virus.\n\nKlain, in his Thursday memo to staff, wrote that White House officials \"have said for some time that there was a substantial possibility that the President -- like anyone else -- could get Covid, and we have prepared for this possibility. We are now executing on our plan so that the President can continue to work seamlessly from the Residence.\"\n\nBiden last underwent an annual physical in November at Walter Reed National Medical Center. O'Connor wrote in a memo at the time that the President remained \"fit for duty, and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations.\"\n\nOfficials had a loose plan in place for the day Biden tested positive, including informing the public when the tests were confirmed and releasing a letter from Biden's physician -- which both took place on Thursday.\n\nThen-President Donald Trump issued a 1 a.m. ET tweet on October, 2, 2020, announcing that both he and then-first lady Melania Trump had tested positive for Covid-19. And Biden officials have been mindful of how the previous administration handled Trump's diagnosis and have been intent on being more forthcoming about Biden's condition.\n\nNow, more than two years into the pandemic, Biden has become the second sitting US president to test positive for Covid-19. His mild symptoms so far stand in stark contrast to Trump's diagnosis before a vaccine was available in 2020 -- a Covid infection that led to a multi-day hospitalization at Walter Reed.\n\nCovid emergency continues\n\nThe President's infection comes as Covid cases are once again on the rise in the US, driven by the most contagious strain of the virus yet -- BA.5. More than 1 million people have died of Covid-19 across the country since the pandemic began.\n\nThe Biden administration is continuing the Covid-19 public health emergency as it seeks new funding from Congress for treatments and vaccines. The public health emergency declaration allows many Americans to obtain free Covid-19 testing, therapeutic treatment and vaccines. Medicare has also relaxed the rules governing telehealth so that many more seniors can access such services during the declaration. And states are not involuntarily disenrolling residents from Medicaid during the declaration, in exchange for receiving more generous federal matching funds.\n\nThis story has been updated with further developments on Thursday.", "authors": ["Maegan Vazquez", "Betsy Klein", "Kate Sullivan"], "publish_date": "2022/07/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/05/health/covid-reinfection-risk/index.html", "title": "Covid-19 reinfections may increase the likelihood of new health ...", "text": "(CNN) Repeatedly catching Covid-19 appears to increase the chances that a person will face new and sometimes lasting health problems after their infection, according to the first study on the health risks of reinfection.\n\nThe study, which is based on the health records of more than 5.6 million people treated in the VA Health System, found that, compared with those with just one Covid-19 infection, those with two or more documented infections had more than twice the risk of dying and three times the risk of being hospitalized within six months of their last infection. They also had higher risks for lung and heart problems, fatigue, digestive and kidney disorders, diabetes and neurologic problems.\n\nThe findings come as a fresh wave of coronavirus variants, notably Omicron's BA.5, have become dominant in the United States and Europe, causing cases and hospitalizations to rise once again. BA.5 caused about 54% of cases nationwide last week, doubling its share of Covid-19 transmission over the past two weeks, according to data posted Tuesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nBA.5 carries key mutations that help it escape antibodies generated by both vaccines and prior infection, leaving many people vulnerable to reinfection.\n\nDr. Ziyad Al-Aly, a clinical epidemiologist at Washington University in St. Louis, led the research, which was posted as a preprint ahead of peer review. He said he decided to do it after watching reinfections become more and more common among his own patients.\n\n\"If you asked me about reinfection maybe a year and a half ago, I would tell you that maybe I have a patient here or there, but it's really, really rare,\" Al-Aly said. That's not true anymore, though.\n\n\"So we asked a simple question that if you got Covid before and now you're on your second infection, does this really add risk? And the simple answer is that it does.\"\n\nTallying the risks of reinfections\n\nAl-Aly and his team compared the health records of more than 250,000 people who had tested positive for Covid-19 one time with records from 38,000 others who had two or more Covid-19 infections documented in their medical records. More than 5.3 million people with no record of a Covid-19 infection were used as the control group.\n\nAmong those with reinfections, 36,000 people had two Covid-19 infections, roughly 2,200 had caught Covid-19 three times, and 246 had been infected four times.\n\nCommon new diagnoses after reinfections included chest pain, abnormal heart rhythms, heart attacks, inflammation of the heart muscle or the sac around the heart, heart failure and blood clots. Common lung issues included shortness of breath, low blood oxygen, lung disease, and accumulation of fluid around the lungs, Al-Aly said.\n\nThe study found that the risk of a new health problem was highest around the time of a Covid-19 reinfection, but it also persisted for at least six months. The increased risk was present whether or not someone had been vaccinated, and it was graded -- meaning it increased with each subsequent infection.\n\nAl-Aly said that's not what people really think will happen when they get Covid a second or third time.\n\n\"There is this idea that if you had Covid before, your immune system is trained to recognize it and is more equipped to fight it, and if you're getting it again, maybe it doesn't affect you that much, but that's not really true,\" he said.\n\nAl-Aly said that doesn't mean there aren't people who have had Covid and done just fine; there are lots of them. Rather, what his study shows is that each infection brings new risk, and that risk adds up over time, he said.\n\nEven if a person has half the risk of developing lasting health problems during a second infection than they did during their first infection, he said, they still wind up with 50% more risk of problems than someone who didn't get Covid-19 a second time.\n\nThe study has some important caveats. Al-Aly says it was more common to see reinfections among people who had existing risks because of their age or underlying health. That shows that reinfection may not be random, and it could be that the health risks linked to reinfections aren't, either.\n\n\"It is possible that sicker individuals or people with immune dysfunction are at higher risk of reinfection and adverse health outcomes after reinfection,\" Al-Aly said.\n\nHe wasn't interested in trying to isolate the pure effects of reinfection but wanted to understand how repeated infections are affecting the people who get them.\n\n\"The most relevant question to people's lives is, if you get reinfected, does it add to your risk of acute complications and long Covid, and the answer is a clear yes and yes,\" he said.\n\nThe study is observational, which means it can't determine cause and effect.\n\nAl-Aly says the researchers saw these increased risks even after they weighted the data to account for the effects of age, sex, medication use and the person's underlying health before they got Covid-19.\n\nCovid-19 continues to surprise\n\nExperts who were not involved in the research say it is compelling.\n\n\"There is this idea that I think a lot of people have that 'if I survived my first infection, that I'm really going to be just fine the second time. There really shouldn't be any problem,' \" said Dr. Daniel Griffin, an instructor in clinical medicine at Columbia University.\n\n\"The popular wisdom, right, is that reinfections are mild, nothing to worry about, nothing to see here,\" Griffin said of the study on the podcast \"This Week in Virology.\" But that's not really being borne out, he said.\n\nThis is not how it's supposed to work. Even when viruses shape-shift -- as influenza does -- our immune system generally retains its memory of how to recognize and fight off some part of them. They may still make us ill, but the idea is that our prior immunity is there to mount some of kind of defense and keep us from serious harm.\n\nWith coronaviruses, and especially SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses, the hits just keep on coming.\n\n\"A year later, you can get reinfected with the same coronavirus the second time. It is not clear that that second infection can be more mild, because coronaviruses intrinsically have the ability to interfere with long-lasting lifetime immunity,\" Griffin told CNN.\n\nGriffin says he's seen Covid-19 reinfections go both ways. Sometimes, the second or third is milder for his patients, but sometimes it's not.\n\nHow does that compare with other respiratory infections?\n\nEarly in the pandemic, people would get Covid, and three months would go by when they were pretty well protected, he said. But now, those reinfections are happening more frequently, no doubt because of the rapid changes to the virus. He says he's seen some people infected four times in the past two years.\n\n\"We don't really see much of that with the flu,\" Griffin said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAs for what people should be doing now with regard to this risk, Dr. Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, says Americans are really done with the pandemic. That doesn't mean that the pandemic is done with us, though.\n\nOsterholm said he has three close friends who recently went to a restaurant for the first time since the pandemic started. All of them tested positive within 72 hours of that restaurant visit.\n\nIf you're at higher risk of serious illness or you just want to avoid getting sick, it's a good time to be wearing an N95 mask in public places, he says.\n\n\"People don't want to hear it, but that's the reality. We're seeing this resurgence, and we're seeing increasing numbers of vaccine failures. Clearly, that's a major concern,\" he said.", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/07/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/16/health/biden-administration-covid-19-vaccines-tests-treatments/index.html", "title": "Biden administration will stop buying Covid-19 vaccines, treatments ...", "text": "(CNN) The Biden administration has been planning for how to get past the crisis phase of the Covid-19 pandemic and will stop buying vaccines, treatments and tests as early as this fall, White House Covid-19 Response Coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha said on Tuesday.\n\n\"One of the things we've spent a lot of time thinking about in the last many months -- and we're going to continue this work, and you'll hear more from the administration on this -- is getting us out of that acute emergency phase where the US government is buying the vaccines, buying the treatments, buying the diagnostic tests,\" Jha said at an event sponsored by the US Chamber of Commerce Foundation.\n\n\"My hope is that in 2023, you're going to see the commercialization of almost all of these products. Some of that is actually going to begin this fall, in the days and weeks ahead. You're going to see commercialization of some of these things,\" he said.\n\nAvailability of those products would transition to the regular health-care system, Jha said, so if you need a vaccine or an antiviral treatment, you'd get it from your doctor or from a hospital.\n\nUpdated boosters available next month\n\nRead More", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/08/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/13/health/under-50-second-boosters/index.html", "title": "Officials urge Americans over 50 to get Covid-19 booster right away ...", "text": "(CNN) The White House's Covid-19 response team sent a clear message to the nation this week on the spread of the Omicron subvariant BA.5 and the importance of second vaccine booster doses for adults over the age of 50.\n\n\"If you have not gotten a vaccine shot in the year 2022, if you have not gotten one this year, please go get another vaccine shot,\" response coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha said Tuesday. \"It could save your life.\"\n\nSecond boosters have been authorized for US adults 50 and up, as well as certain people with weakened immune systems, since March . But for anyone under the age of 50, only one booster is authorized.\n\nThe officials had less to offer younger adults at the briefing, other than to say that the US Food and Drug Administration is considering second boosters for this age group.\n\nAs of the end of June, adults under age 50 had the highest rates of Covid-19 cases compared to other age groups, according to preliminary data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\"I know that the FDA is considering this, looking at it,\" Jha said Tuesday of second boosters for younger adults. \"And I know CDC scientists are thinking about this and looking at the data, as well. The decision is purely up to them.\"\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, stressed Wednesday in an appearance on CNN that the idea was being \"actively considered.\" But beyond that, he made no promises, saying the OK on expanding eligibility had to come from the FDA.\n\nIn the meantime, Americans under 50 are watching the lightning spread of the BA.5 subvariant and wondering about their own protection.\n\n'Frustrating and scary'\n\n\"It's frustrating and, frankly, scary,\" said Jennifer O'Neill, 42, who lives in Boston with her 74-year-old mother. O'Neill says she's been waiting on the government to expand eligibility for boosters to younger adults and doesn't understand why it hasn't happened yet.\n\nBoth O'Neill and her mom have had all the boosters they're eligible for, but O'Neilll's last shot was around Thanksgiving. She believes that booster protected her during their first family dinner in two years. Four of the 10 guests at Thanksgiving dinner caught Covid-19, but O'Neill and her mom didn't get sick.\n\n\"I know it's not the same variant. I know in my head it won't prevent transmission entirely, but I am just so concerned with her not getting sick that I'll do whatever I can,\" O'Neill said of her mother, whose age puts her at high risk of more severe illness. \"And it frustrates me that I can't because of eight years.\"\n\nAbout 139 million adults in the US are between 18 and 50, according to Census data. Many of them followed public health guidance and got boosters as soon as they became eligible last fall, when the original Omicron strain was tearing across the country.\n\nData from the UK shows that the effectiveness of booster shots against symptomatic disease caused by the Omicron variant is higher than 60% starting about four weeks after a third dose. After eight weeks, though, it starts to decline, and by five months post-booster, people have almost no protection against symptomatic infections.\n\nSo whatever protection young adults had against infection from last fall's booster is probably long gone.\n\nThat may be disheartening, but it's also not really what the vaccines were designed to do, says Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nOther ways to protect yourself\n\nIf protection against Covid-19 is your goal, you may be better served by using a combination of other tools, like wearing high-quality masks, making sure you're spending time in well-ventilated spaces with clean air and, if you have the luxury, being choosy about your social contact.\n\n\"These vaccines don't prevent mild infection,\" Shaffner said, and they don't keep you from infecting others. \"These are personal protection vaccines, rather than vaccines that prevent transmission in any substantial way.\"\n\nThe vaccines and boosters continue to offer stronger protection against Covid-19 infections that are severe enough to need hospital or ICU care, or that might be fatal.\n\nHowever, this protection is also slipping over time.\n\nFor adults ages 18 to 64, the effectiveness of a booster against Covid-19 hospitalization peaks around 82.4%, but it drops to about 53.6% about four months after the third shot, according to UK data. For adults over the age of 65, boosters are initially about 86% effective at keeping people out of the hospital, but that protection drops to 77% after roughly four months.\n\nProtection against death from Covid-19 falls to about 48% roughly six months after a second vaccine dose in adults 50 and older. Boosters initially restore that protection to about 94%, but that falls to 88% after 10 weeks or so, according to UK data. There was comparable data available for younger adults.\n\nIn the US, CDC data presented at the White House Covid-19 briefing on Tuesday shows that adults over the age of 50 who've had one booster dose had four times the risk of dying from Covid-19 compared with those who've had at least two booster doses.\n\nSchaffner says people who are under 50 and generally healthy are still in good shape when it comes to severe outcomes from Covid-19.\n\nBut, he says, if you are under 50 and have an underlying health condition like heart disease, lung disease or diabetes, you should ask for a second booster even if you're not officially eligible.\n\n\"People are not usually quizzed too thoroughly,\" Shaffner said. \"I would just come up and say 'Hi, I've got bad diabetes' or 'I have underlying heart disease' and stuff like that, and at least in our neck of the woods, you'll be able to get a vaccine.\"\n\nHow to feel safe?\n\nthat qualify people for additional doses if they're under 50. O'Neill tried to get a fourth shot. She didn't lie; she has asthma and pleaded her case at two pharmacies, but they pointed her to a narrow list of conditions that qualify people for additional doses if they're under 50.\n\n\"I'm in Massachusetts, but the two pharmacists were very adamant, like I could get in trouble if I don't follow guidelines,\" she said.\n\nHer friends have told her to lie, but she doesn't feel comfortable doing that. \"I want to follow protocol,\" she said.\n\nShe's frustrated by what she sees as mixed messaging from the Biden administration on Covid-19.\n\n\"It's like 'Get out! Get back to normal!' OK. But I'm only comfortable actually getting out if I feel like I'm fully protected, and I know that the booster won't prevent transmission, it would just make me feel much more safe,\" she said. So she'll continue to limit her activities until she can get a booster.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWith or without vaccines, Jha said, there are things people can do to protect themselves if they do fall ill, including seeking treatment.\n\n\"We have highly effective treatments that work against BA.5, including Paxlovid. This is an oral antiviral that reduces the risk of hospitalizations and death by 90%,\" he said.\n\nnationwide. He added that the US has bought more of these pills than any other country, and they are now available at 41,000 locations nationwide.\n\n\"If you test positive in the days and weeks ahead, please consult your health care provider about your eligibility for treatment,\" Jha said.", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/07/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/29/health/covid-second-booster/index.html", "title": "Second booster shots authorized for adults 50 and older | CNN", "text": "(CNN) The US Food and Drug Administration has expanded the emergency use authorization of the Pfizer and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines to allow adults 50 and older to get a second booster as early as four months after their first booster dose of any Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nThe move extends the availability of additional boosters to healthy older adults. The FDA had previously allowed additional shots for anyone 12 or older who was severely immune-deficient. This group of people can now receive a three-dose primary series and two boosters for a total of five doses.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention followed suit, saying it is updating its vaccine pages to reflect the FDA's expanded eligibility.\n\n\"Current evidence suggests some waning of protection over time against serious outcomes from COVID-19 in older and immunocompromised individuals. Based on an analysis of emerging data, a second booster dose of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine could help increase protection levels for these higher-risk individuals,\" said Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, in a news release.\n\n\"Additionally, the data show that an initial booster dose is critical in helping to protect all adults from the potentially severe outcomes of COVID-19. So, those who have not received their initial booster dose are strongly encouraged to do so.\"\n\nThe FDA said that in making its decision, it had determined that the known and potential benefits of second boosters outweigh the known and potential risks for these populations.\n\nThe CDC also said in its statement that adults who got Johnson & Johnson's vaccine as their primary and first booster shots at least four months prior may now get an additional booster of Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna's vaccines.\n\n\"Boosters are safe, and people over the age of 50 can now get an additional booster 4 months after their prior dose to increase their protection further,\" CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said in the statement. \"This is especially important for those 65 and older and those 50 and older with underlying medical conditions that increase their risk for severe disease from COVID-19 as they are the most likely to benefit from receiving an additional booster dose at this time.\"\n\nShe said that both the CDC and the FDA \"continue to evaluate the need for additional booster doses for all Americans.\"\n\nThe CDC's update is what's known as a permissive recommendation, a statement that the shots may be used in this age group for those who want them, reflecting a degree of uncertainty in the science. But it's not an official recommendation.\n\nThe lack of a clear endorsement for second boosters punts the work of weighing the risks and benefits of another vaccine dose to individuals, and it has caused no small amount of consternation for some vaccine advocates who say the marginal extra protection some may get won't be worth the confusion fourth doses create.\n\nDr. Megan Ranney, an emergency medicine physician who is the academic dean of Brown University's School of Public Health, says that throughout the pandemic, officials have been faced with making policy before they've had enough evidence to back it. Ranney sees this as another example.\n\nShe says it's not clear whether everybody needs a fourth dose right now, but having these approvals in place will provide flexibility to roll more boosters out quickly if they're needed.\n\n\"I see this approval from the Biden administration as being an insurance policy on their part,\" Ranney says. \"It's a way to allow people to get the vaccine or the additional booster. But it also provides them with the flexibility so that should BA.2 be worse than we're expecting, they can then quickly roll it out. or God forbid, should there be another variant in the next couple of months that requires another booster they can quickly roll it out. So I'm reading it that way,\" Ranney said.\n\nThere is general scientific agreement that third doses help strengthen immunity against severe illness from the virus that causes Covid-19. But the science is far from settled on when, or even if, fourth doses might be needed since the vaccines continue to offer a high degree of protection against Covid-19 hospitalization and death, even as protection against illness wanes.\n\nMuch of the evidence examining the safety and effectiveness of a second booster shot comes from Israel, which has been recommending a fourth dose of coronavirus vaccine to adults 18 and older since the end of January.\n\nThe FDA said that in making its decision, it had reviewed data from Israel's Ministry of Health on more than 700,000 people 18 and up who had received second boosters of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine at least four months after their first booster. More than 600,000 of those people were over 60. The agency said that data had revealed no new safety problems tied to a fourth dose.\n\nThe FDA said data on the safety of the Moderna boosters, when used as a fourth dose, comes from a study of 120 people ages 18 and older who got a fourth dose of the vaccine at least four months after their third shot of the Pfizer vaccine. No new safety concerns were identified in the three weeks following the last dose.\n\nSome of the data the FDA relied on to make its decision comes from previously published studies.\n\nIn a large study of more than half a million adults over the age of 60, those who received a second booster, or fourth dose, of a Covid-19 vaccine had 78% lower odds of death during the Omicron wave compared to those who had a third shot at least four months earlier. But the numbers of deaths were relatively low in both groups. After 40 days of follow up, there were 232 total deaths out of nearly 234,000 people who'd only had three doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, compared with 92 deaths out of 328,000 people.\n\nsmaller study of health care workers, which included younger adults, found that fourth boosters were safe and restored antibodies to the same levels reached after third doses. But fourth doses were only moderately effective -- about 30 to 40% -- at preventing illness. And most of the workers who got sick still had high viral loads, suggested that they were capable of transmitting the infection to others.\n\nAdditional studies from the UK show that the antibody boost from a booster dose wanes very quickly, within a matter of weeks. So some experts feel that considering available resources and the diminishing appetite to continue to get more and more boosters, that the United States should wait until there's a clear danger from a new wave of infections to roll out fourth doses. Some see the likely timing of that to be next fall.\n\n\"If you have only one bullet in your gun to shoot, I would prefer to hold fire until the fall, because that's when cases may really start to increase,\" said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nSince January, Americans 12 and older have been eligible for a third vaccine dose, but only 46% of that demographic group has had a third shot.\n\nSchaffner says he's worried that fourth doses will just confuse people who haven't decided to get a third dose.\n\n\"I'm very concerned about dividing and not being able to conquer because the messaging will get very, very confusing,\" he said, \"And so I think public health officials and clinicians ought to be continuing to focus on getting the third dose into people who are eligible.\"", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/03/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/06/politics/merrick-garland-covid-19/index.html", "title": "Two Biden Cabinet members among dozens of positive Covid-19 ...", "text": "(CNN) Two members of President Joe Biden's Cabinet tested positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday, becoming some of the latest high-profile Washington figures to contract the virus in recent days.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo announced their positive diagnoses after having attended the elite Gridiron Club Dinner in Washington on Saturday.

Joaquin Castro; California Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff; Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins; and the President's sister, Valerie Biden Owens, have also announced positive tests.\n\nThe string of positive cases has turned attention in Washington to the Gridiron dinner, an event that brings together some of the city's most prominent journalists, including from CNN, and the government officials they cover. Attendees had their vaccination status checked, but negative Covid-19 tests were not required to enter.\n\nAs of Thursday evening, 37 positive Covid-19 cases had been reported following Saturday's dinner, according to a letter from the club to its members.\n\nTom DeFrank, the president of the Gridiron Club, said in a statement Wednesday that \"there is no way of being certain about when they first contracted Covid,\" DeFrank said.\n\n\"But they did interact with other guests during the night and we have to be realistic and expect some more cases,\" he continued. \"Except in cases of public officials who have on their own disclosed their status, we will protect the privacy of guests who test positive.\"\n\nGarland is not experiencing symptoms but asked to be tested after learning he may have been exposed to the virus, the Justice Department said.

Schiff said in a Tuesday tweet that he was \"feeling fine,\" and Castro reported in his own of \"experiencing mild symptoms.\" Owens did not have close contact with Biden or the first lady prior to her test, according to a statement from Celadon Books.\n\nLaRosa, who had tested negative earlier this week after attending the Gridiron dinner, confirmed to CNN on Thursday that he was experiencing mild symptoms and isolating at home.\n\nThough typically in close contact with the first lady, LaRosa only saw her briefly Thursday at the White House. He told CNN his interaction with Jill Biden had lasted less than 15 minutes and that they were several feet apart, which under CDC guidance means the first lady was not considered a close contact.\n\nVice president a close contact\n\nHarris had been in close contact with Simmons, who tested positive on Wednesday, press secretary Kirsten Allen said.\n\n\"The Vice President will follow CDC guidance for those that have been in close contact with a positive individual and will continue to consult with her physician.

The investigation , based on multiple interviews with high-level Sudanese and US officials and troves of documents reviewed by CNN, painted a picture of an elaborate Russian scheme to take Sudan's riches in a bid to fortify Russia against robust Western sanctions. Evidence seen by CNN also suggests that Russia colluded with Sudan's military, enabling billions of dollars in gold to bypass the Sudanese state and deprive the poverty-stricken country of hundreds of millions in state revenue.\n\nJUST WATCHED CNN reporter confronts staff at alleged Russian operation in Sudan Replay More Videos ...

Kyrsten Sinema says she will \"move forward\" with Democrats' sweeping economic package , signaling key support that could give the party enough votes to push the bill through the Senate and on to the House for final approval. The Inflation Reduction Act is much slimmer than President Joe Biden's initial Build Back Better bill, but it would still represent the largest investment in energy and climate programs in US history. It would also extend expiring health care subsidies for three years and give Medicare the power to negotiate prescription drug prices. New taxes would help pay for it all. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer says the final version of the bill will be introduced on Saturday. It will also have to be reviewed by the Senate parliamentarian, who will decide whether the bill is eligible for the filibuster-proof budget process that will allow Democrats to pass it along party lines.\n\n2. Brittney Griner\n\nWNBA star Brittney Griner was sentenced to nine years of jail time by a Russian court after being convicted on Thursday of deliberately smuggling drugs into the country. The case has raised concerns that Griner is being used as a pawn in Russia's war with Ukraine. President Biden called the sentence \"unacceptable\" and said his administration would work to secure Griner's release. Now, Russia has indicated it is ready to discuss a prisoner swap for Griner and another American, Paul Whelan, who has been wrongfully detained in Russia since 2018. There has already been movement in the negotiation process, but that could accelerate in the coming days now that Griner has been sentenced. Griner was arrested at a Moscow airport six months ago and accused by Russian prosecutors of trying to smuggle less than 1 gram of cannabis oil in her luggage.\n\nJUST WATCHED See Brittney Griner's reaction as sentence is read Replay More Videos ...

Kyle Meany are accused of submitting a false affidavit to search Taylor's home, and conspiring to cover up their actions afterward by creating more false information. Ex-detective Brett Hankison also faces charges. Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency room technician, was shot and killed in her apartment during a flawed forced-entry raid in March of 2020. Her death, along with the deaths of several other Black citizens at the time, sparked a summer of protests calling for justice reform.\n\nJUST WATCHED Police officers federally charged in Breonna Taylor's death Replay More Videos ...

However, locals say the peacekeepers have overstayed their welcome, and have failed to rein in the rebel groups or prevent their attacks against civilians. Since the latest wave of unrest, UN peacekeepers in the country have been accused of using violent force against citizens.

Other rumors point to new TV OS features, which could tie into the smart home; an upgrade to Apple Watch OS that would boost the battery life; and a new MacBook Air.\n\nSome analysts arealso holding out hope thatcould offer an early look at a platform thought to be called RealityOS.The system could power the mixed reality headset — a wearable device that's said to be capable of both virtual and augmented reality — which Apple has been rumored to be working on for years.\n\nDaniel Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities, has taken to calling the rumored hardware product \"Apple Glasses,\" in an apparent nod to Google's early and failed foray into smart glasses. In an investor note this week, Ives said he expects Apple to \"hit on a number of AR/VR technologies to developers that the company plans to introduce.\"\n\n\"Ultimately this strategy is laying the breadcrumbs to the highly anticipated AR headset Apple Glasses set to make its debut likely before holiday season or latest early 2023,\" he said.\n\nCook has long been vocal about Apple's vision to dive deeper into AR, calling it \"the next big thing\" and \"a critically important part of Apple's future.\" Whether this is the year Apple finally shows its cards for that future, however, is anyone's guess.\n\nApple's event will be livestreamed on its website, YouTube and other social media platforms. It is set to start at 10:00 a.m. PT/1:00 p.m. ET. Here's a closer look at what to expect:\n\nThe iPhone lock screen gets a refresh\n\niOS 16 features aren't expected to be game changers, but a few additions could breathe new life into the user experience. Similar to last year iOS 16 features aren't expected to be game changers, but a few additions could breathe new life into the userexperience.\n\nApple is expected to make messages more social and interactive and to rework the notification system and lock screen with a greater focus on widgets, according to Bloomberg\n\nRamon Llamas, research director at IDC Research, said Apple could create a valuable opportunity for developers by rethinking the real estate on the lockscreen to move away from static notifications of texts and emails and toward interactive experiences like schedules, weather and news.\n\n\"Think of all the things and widgets you could see just at a glance without having to open your iPhone,\" Llamas said. \"Now tie them to your homescreen. It's a part of the iPhone experience that has been mostly the same and would benefit from a refresh.\"\n\nUpdates to iPad and Mac software\n\nmore like a laptop and less like a phone. With iPadOS, meanwhile, Apple is expected to double down on multitasking features to play up its powerful in-house M1 processor. According to Bloomberg , the update could make the iPad feelmore like a laptopand less like a phone.\n\nApple is also expected to unveil its latest Mac OS, with the rumored name Mac Mammoth. It could offer refreshes to apps such as Mail, Notes and Safari, and similar social functionality in Messages to what's rumored to be coming to iPhones.\n\nApple may add home automation improvements to both its HomePod speaker and Apple TV, as well as its broader HomeKit ecosystem. It's also possible Apple could announce a refresh to Apple Watch OS, with the promise of new health features, workouts and watch faces.\n\nHardware improvements\n\nIf Apple's prior developer conferences are any indication, it's unlikely the company will unveil any major new hardware products at the event this year. But it's possible Apple could shine a spotlight on its next-generation M2 chip and discuss some developer opportunities around it. For example, Apple could unveil a new MacBook Air by showing what the system would be capable of with its latest in-house processor.\n\n\"Usually, new hardware comes out later in the year, so don't be disappointed if you don't see something,\" Llamas said. \"But even if Apple does, I think the bigger news is not the hardware itself, but Apple's own silicon that powers them.\"\n\nA look at the future of AR/VR\n\nThe big wild card at WWDC is whether Apple makes a splashy announcement around augmented reality or focuses on more incremental updates.\n\nRather than unveiling a mixed reality headset now, Apple may outline how developers could use its existing ARKit platform and its programming language, Swift, to create content for AR and VR broadly. (Apple's tagline for the event is \"Swiftly approaching.\" The company often hides clues in images and taglines of its events' invites.)\n\n\"It's quite possible the company will tease new AR/VR features without outright revealing a new device,\" said Eric Abbruzzese, research director at ABI Research. But, as he notes, it would be unusual for Apple to reveal a new software system for a hardware line it has yet to unveil.\n\n\"It'd be like revealing iOS before the iPhone was revealed,\" Abbruzzese added.\n\nWhile it's unclear if Apple will be laying the framework for a bigger push around AR/VR hardware in the pipeline, it's quite likely Apple executives will dedicate a good portion of its keynote presentation to software around those technologies.\n\n\"Apple's been building ARKit on the mobile device side for years,\" Abbruzzese said. \"Much of that will absolutely translate to their headsets.\"", "authors": ["Samantha Murphy Kelly", "Cnn Business"], "publish_date": "2022/06/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/06/tech/apple-wwdc-2022/index.html", "title": "Apple unveils iOS 16 with revamped lock screen and big changes to ...", "text": "(CNN) Apple kicked off its annual developer conference by unveiling its next-generation mobile software, iOS 16, with new features that will let users personalize their iPhone lock screens, change how they text friends through iMessage and deepen how its smartphones integrate with cars.\n\nThese and other updates, which were unveiled at its Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday, show how Apple continues to push to ensure its devices -- the iPhone in particular -- remain central to our daily lives and the many products we interact with. But while these updates will likely appeal to many Apple device users, the event was also notable for what was not announced: a new product.\n\nIn recent days, some industry watchers had held out hope that Apple could offer an early look at a platform thought to be called RealityOS. The system, according to rumors, could power a mixed reality headset -- a wearable device that's said to be capable of both VR and AR -- which Apple has been rumored to be working on for years.\n\nInstead, the focus was on a number of functional, if not sexy, product updates: more multi-tasking features on Mac software, the introduction of Apple's Weather app on iPad and the unveiling of the company's next-generation M2 chip.\n\n\"While some may be disappointed at the lack of radical new hardware in areas such as AR, Apple's investment in silicon will play a defining role in future product categories, such as a head-worn device, where power and performance must be finely balanced,\" said Ben Wood, chief analyst at market research firm CCS Insight.\n\nRead More", "authors": ["Samantha Murphy Kelly", "Cnn Business"], "publish_date": "2022/06/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2022/03/08/apple-event-iphone-se-ipad-updates/9424414002/", "title": "Apple event recap: New iPhone SE for $429, iPad Air 2022 unveiled", "text": "Spring has arrived early for fans of Apple products.\n\nApple hosted its spring event Tuesday and announced an updated iPhone SE, a budget version of the tech giant's popular smartphone. It starts at $429 and is available for preorder on Friday. The new phone launches March 18.\n\nThe new iPhone SE includes a 4.7-inch display and support for 5G. It will also use the same processing chip as the iPhone 13, launched last fall. The phone will come in three colors: midnight, starlight and red.\n\n“iPhone SE has been an incredibly popular choice with our existing users and for new iPhone customers, thanks to its iconic design, exceptional performance, and affordable price, Kaiann Drance, Apple’s vice president of worldwide iPhone product marketing, said in a statement.\n\nAs wireless companies continue the rollout of their 5G networks and begin shutting down access to 3G, Apple's new phone could play a big role in 5G adoption, said Anisha Bhatia, senior technology analyst with research firm GlobalData.\n\nAT&T shut down its 3G network:Does it impact your car's navigation system?\n\nWhen to buy:To time your purchases wisely, shop to the rhythm of Apple’s events\n\n\"iPhone users lack any affordable 5G phones compared with the varied choices available for Android users, so a mid-range 5G iPhone will be a welcome boost for both operators and users,\" Bhatia said.\n\nApple also introduced a new iPad Air, starting at $599.

The new iPad also launches March 18.\n\nAfter dark: Can the S22 Ultra beat Apple’s iPhone at night photography?\n\nApple said the tablet will feature an ultrawide camera and support for Center Stage, a feature allowing the camera to automatically recenter itself on its subjects.

If you want one with the M1 Ultra chip, expect to pay a lot more. It costs $3,999. The Mac Studio Display starts at $1,599.\n\nMac Studio computer unveiled\n\nThe Mac Studio is a new Mac computer powered by Apple's M1 Ultra chip. Apple said the computer is targeted toward power users who want the optimal performance. The computer itself is small, at 3.7 inches tall and 7.7 inches wide.\n\nIt features four Thunderbolt ports, HDMI, a 10 GB ethernet port, a Pro audio jack, and USB ports. On the front of the computer is two USB-C ports that double as Thunderbolt ports and an SD card slot.\n\nAlso unveiled by Apple: a separate 27-inch Mac Studio Display, which will work with the Mac Studio as well as other MacBooks and the Mac Mini. It features a 12-megapixel camera, six speakers and spatial audio support.\n\nMore powerful M1 Ultra chip revealed\n\nIf the M1, M1 Pro, and M1 Max processing chips for Macs just aren't enough, Apple announced it has developed a fourth option called M1 Ultra. Apple says it's eight times faster than the standard M1 chip.\n\nSo what does that mean for Macs? Computers with the Ultra chip will likely run beefier software like video editing programs with greater speed and efficiency. Meanwhile, other apps and tools will run even faster, according to Apple.\n\niPad Air: New model for $599 unveiled\n\nIt's iPad's turn. Cook just unveiled a revamped iPad Air, which is the company's thinner, lighter version of its popular tablet.\n\nThe iPad Air will add the M1 chip, which will give the iPad Air a big bump in graphics and processing performance, said Apple.\n\nThe iPad Air will also feature a 12-megapixel ultrawide camera, and will add the Center Stage feature, a cool tool used to help keep users centered on the screen during video calls. The new Air will also support 5G.\n\nThe tablet will be compatible with accessories like Apple's magic keyboard and the second generation of Apple Pencil.\n\nThe iPad will launch March 18 starting at $599. It will be available in multiple colors, including space gray, starlight and blue.\n\nNew iPhone SE starts at $429\n\nApple confirmed the new iPhone SE, which will include a 4.7-inch screen and support for Touch ID, will launch on March 18 at $429.\n\niPhone SE with 5G announced\n\nCook introduced what we all expected: a new iPhone SE. The big takeaway thus far is it will use the A15 processing chip, which is the same as in the iPhone 13. It's twice as fast as an iPhone 7 and nearly twice as fast as iPhone 8, according to Apple. It also appears the home button will remain on the SE model.\n\nThe phone will be available in three colors: midnight, starlight, and red. It will also support 5G.\n\nGreen iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro\n\nThe iPhone 13 is now available in two new shades of green.

The tech giant dominated headlines in a week that also included smartphone announcements from HTC, and new ideas from PayPal about how to improve retail spaces. Here's what you need to know about the week in Tech:\n\n1) Apple introduces new iPhones\n\nApple showed off its long-awaited new smartphones, the colorful iPhone 5c and the next-generation iPhone 5s, at a press event on Wednesday.\n\nHere's what you need to know about both phones:\n\niPhone 5s: The iPhone 5s has an upgraded camera, a faster processor and a fingerprint ID sensor. It has up to 64 GB of storage and about 10 hours of battery life. The phone comes in a new gold tone in addition to silver and \"space gray\" — no more black and white iPhones. The iPhone 5s starts at $199 and will go on sale Sept. 20.\n\niPhone 5c: This is Apple's \"budget phone,\" with a starting price of $99. The phone is available in five colors — white, pink, yellow, blue and green. The iPhone 5c has up to 10 hours of battery life on the 3G network. Apple started pre-orders today for the phone, with an expected delivery date of Sept. 20.\n\n2) New iPhone 5s will read your fingerprints\n\nThe fingerprint sensor on the iPhone 5s was one of the most talked-about features to come out of Apple's press event.\n\nUSA TODAY's Brett Molina answered 10 questions about how it works. Here are a few highlights:\n\n--Setup: An iPhone user would place and hold their finger on the home button several times. Apple's Touch ID then takes an image of the user's fingerprint.\n\n--How it works: You can use the fingerprint sensor to make purchases in iTunes and the App Store, or to unlock your phone.\n\n--Security: No, Apple isn't going to sell your fingerprint to the NSA. Your fingerprint would be stored in a \"Secure Enclave\" on the smartphone, not on Apple's servers or the iCloud. Apple will also keep third-party app developers from using your fingerprint.\n\n3) With iPhones confirmed, what's next for Apple?\n\nIt might be an understatement to say that expectations are high for Apple right now, in the wake of their latest iPhone release. So what's next? USA TODAY's Ed Baig took a look at a few impending product releases for the next few months.\n\nYou can expect to see a new operating system for Macs sometime in October. The company previewed OS X Mavericks at a developer's conference in June. Baig says we might also get an updated iPad and iPad Mini next month.\n\nAs for new products, Baig says he doesn't expect Apple to come out with its long-rumored Apple TV anytime soon. But we might get a refresh on the Apple TV set-top box. Baig also said he wonders what will happen with the rumored iWatch: \"There's no telling when an iWatch might appear, and Apple — despite the emerging competition — isn't likely to deliver a watch just because others have beaten them to the space. But the clock is ticking.\"\n\n4) Blue HTC One coming to Best Buy; Amazon says it won't launch a free phone\n\nElsewhere in the tech world, HTC released a new version of their HTC One phone and Amazon squashed rumors about a possible Amazon smartphone.\n\nHTC will launch the blue version of their HTC One phone exclusively at Best Buy stores and on BestBuy.com this Sunday, through the end of the year. HTC will offer special pricing for the phone with a two-year contract for most major carriers, except T-Mobile.\n\nAmazon announced it will not be joining the smartphone market, for now. Rumors swirled that the company would offer a smartphone for free, but Amazon quickly shot down the rumors on Monday. Amazon spokesman Drew Herdener said that if the company \"were to launch a phone in the future, it would not be free.\"\n\n5) PayPal unveils new gadget to help stores ID shoppers\n\nHow great would it be if your favorite store recognized you as you walked in?

The Korean electronics giant is expected to unveil a new Galaxy smartphone on Sept. 4 in Berlin. The source was not authorized to disclose the event prematurely.\n\nSamsung had no comment.\n\nSince its first iPhone made its debut in 2007, Apple has faced an endless parade of smartphones running Google's Android software intended for consumers. Wall Street and Apple enthusiasts have been waiting for the company to wow them with a completely new gizmo such as a rumored iWatch smartwatch or iPhones in different sizes and colors.\n\nAll Things D first reported on the Apple event. USA TODAY confirmed the report.\n\n\"We don't comment on rumors,\" Apple spokeswoman Natalie Kerris said.\n\nApple's next iPhone release is expected to touch off a wave of buying that could serve as a catalyst for the stock ahead of the holiday season. That's something Apple could use to improve its stature after store sales came in flat in Apple's most recent earnings period.\n\n\"With a new iPhone and revamped iOS coming out later this year, Apple is well-positioned to recapture market share,\" IDC analyst Ramon Llamas says.\n\nStill, Samsung's attack of smartphones in varying sizes and features is hard to keep pace with, and Samsung is expected to steal Apple's iPhone thunder by beating it to the punch with a new Galaxy smartphone in early September, said a source familiar with its plans.\n\nSamsung took 30.4% of the worldwide smartphone market compared with Apple's 13.1% position in the second quarter, according to researcher IDC. Apple held 16.6% of the market a year ago.\n\nAt the same time, smartphones from LG, Lenovo and ZTE have made market inroads, especially in the Asia Pacific region, where Apple is seen as less price competitive. Apple CEO Tim Cook has made repeated visits to China Mobile's headquarters in a bid for that market.\n\nGoogle, meanwhile, stepped up its smartphone attack with the Moto X this month.\n\nApple will likely come out with processor and camera advances for its next iPhone. Numerous unconfirmed press reports say it may come up with a fingerprint sensor. That latter move would put to work its acquisition of biometric specialist AuthenTec and allow a one-touch log-in by way of fingerprint-scanning technology.\n\nWhat remains to be seen is whether Apple will move to a larger screen size and offer a cheaper version of the iPhone.\n\nThe radical changes underscore what lengths Apple will go to in order to head off a pack of competitors.\n\nBrett Molina contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/08/11"}]}

The burden is so heavy that even if you graduate you may not have access to the middle-class life that the college degree once provided.\"\n\nThe President's sweeping plan on student loans follows extended, down-to-the-wire negotiations at the White House among stakeholders and lawmakers ahead of when payments were set to resume at the end of this month. The decision is already disappointing many, with those on the left arguing that the President should have provided even more loan forgiveness and those on the right asserting that Biden is punishing Americans who avoided going into debt. But it fulfills one of Biden's campaign promises, issuing major reforms to America's student loan system and providing relief to millions of current and future borrowers.\n\nBorrowers who hold loans with the Department of Education and make less than $125,000 a year are eligible for up to $20,000 in student loan forgiveness if they received Pell Grants, which are given to students from low- and middle-income families. Individuals who make less than $125,000 a year but did not receive Pell Grants are eligible for $10,000 in loan forgiveness.\n\nBiden said that the administration's \"targeted actions are for families that need it the most: working and middle class people hit especially hard during the pandemic making under $125,000 a year,\" emphasizing that \"about 90% of the eligible beneficiaries make under $75,000.\"\n\n\"I understand not everything I'm announcing is going to make everybody happy,\" Biden said. \"Some think it's too much -- I find it interesting how some of my Republican friends who voted for those tax cuts think we shouldn't be helping these folks. Some think it's too little, but I believe my plan is responsible and fair. It focuses the benefit of middle-class and working families, it helps both current and future borrowers and it'll fix a badly broken system.\"\n\nThe Department of Education will announce details on how borrowers can claim this relief through an application in the coming weeks. Millions of borrowers will be able to receive relief automatically based on existing income data.\n\nAdditionally, the department is proposing a federal rule aimed at making the student loan system more manageable for current and future borrowers.\n\nThe proposed rule would change income-based repayment for student loans, cutting in half the amount borrowers would have to pay each month on their undergraduate loans, \"while borrowers with both undergraduate and graduate loans will pay a weighted average rate.\"\n\nThe proposal would also \"raise the amount of income that is considered non-discretionary income and therefore protected from repayment.\" And it would forgive loan balances after 10 years of payments rather than 20 years under many income-driven repayment plans for borrowers with original loan balances of $12,000 or less, the department said.\n\nThe proposed rule includes other changes, like simplifying borrowers' choices among loan repayment plans.\n\nUnintended consequences\n\nBiden on Wednesday argued that \"the whole economy is better off\" as a result of his new plan.\n\n\"By resuming student loan payments at the same time we provide targeted relief, we're taking an economically responsible course. As a consequence, $50 billion dollars a year will start coming back into the Treasury because of the resumption of debt,\" he said, later adding, \"There is plenty of deficit reduction to pay for the programs ... many times over.\"\n\nAlthough student debt cancellation will deliver financial relief to millions of Americans, it would shift the cost to Uncle Sam.\n\nA one-time cancellation of $10,000 for each borrower earning up to $125,000 a year could cost the government nearly $300 billion, according to an estimate from the Penn Wharton Budget Model. Additional forgiveness for Pell grant recipients was not included in the estimate.\n\nPlus, loan cancellation won't address the root of the problem: college affordability. There is currently $1.6 trillion of outstanding federal student loan debt. The amount of outstanding debt would return to that level in just four years after $10,000 per borrower was canceled, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\n\nWhite House officials on Wednesday could not provide a topline price estimate for the plan, saying too many unknowns exist to calculate how much the plan might eventually cost.\n\nSusan Rice, the White House's domestic policy adviser, said it would depend on how many eligible borrowers sign up through the Department of Education to have their loans relieved.\n\n\"If 43 million borrowers take it up, that'll be different than if 50% of those 43 million take it up,\" Rice said.\n\nStudent loan cancellation also could increase inflation -- though many experts say the effect would be modest, because borrowers generally pay back their student loans over time. They wouldn't receive a lump sum of money if some of their debt is canceled. They would instead be required to pay less money each month toward their student loan payments.\n\n\"The inflationary impact its certainly positive, but I don't think it would be much. We're talking about a pretty small impact,\" said Kent Smetters, faculty director of the Penn Wharton Budget Model.\n\nJUST WATCHED Rampell: This does very little to address the underlying problems Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Rampell: This does very little to address the underlying problems 02:21\n\nWarnings over inflation\n\nLarry Summers, a former Treasury Secretary who served as the director of the National Economic Council under President Barack Obama, argued ahead of the announced plan that relief would contribute to inflation.\n\n\"I hope the Administration does not contribute to inflation macro economically by offering unreasonably generous student loan relief or micro economically by encouraging college tuition increases,\" Summers tweeted on Tuesday, later adding, \"Student loan debt relief is spending that raises demand and increases inflation. It consumes resources that could be better used helping those who did not, for whatever reason, have the chance to attend college. It will also tend to be inflationary by raising tuitions.\"\n\nJason Furman, the chairman of former President Barack Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, added , \"Pouring roughly half trillion dollars of gasoline on the inflationary fire that is already burning is reckless. Doing it while going well beyond one campaign promise ($10K of student loan relief) and breaking another (all proposals paid for) is even worse.\"\n\nMarc Goldwein, the senior vice president and senior policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget -- a nonpartisan group that tracks federal spending -- argued against the plan in an interview with CNN's Poppy Harlow on \"Newsroom\" Tuesday morning.\n\nHe believes that canceling $10,000 of debt for each borrower will likely increase inflation, undermine the stated goal of Democrats' Inflation Reduction Act and will not significantly decrease the racial wealth gap.\n\n\"The Inflation Reduction Act saves maybe $300 billion dollars in the first 10 years. If we cancel $10,000 of debt and just extend the pause a few months, we're going to be at about that much in terms of new cost,\" he said. \"All the deficit reduction will be wiped out. At the same time, we're probably going to do more to increase inflation from debt cancellation than any inflation reduction from the Inflation Reduction Act.\"\n\nIt's also not easy to target loan forgiveness to those who need it the most and exclude borrowers with higher salaries. An income threshold that cuts off borrowers who earn more than $125,000 a year could help make sure a bigger proportion of the relief goes to low-income borrowers. But some doctors and lawyers, who will eventually be making high incomes, may also reap the benefits.\n\nThe Penn Wharton Budget Model also breaks down the share of forgiven debt by income group assuming that $10,000 is canceled for borrowers earning less than $125,000 per year and households earning less than $250,000.\n\nIt found that one-third of the canceled dollars would go to households who earn less than $50,795 a year. A little more than half of the debt relief would go to those earning between $50,795 and $141,096.\n\nRoughly 14% of the canceled dollars would go to households earning more than $141,096 a year.\n\nPolitical pressure\n\nBiden has been facing political pressure from the left to broadly cancel student loan debt since taking office.\n\nKey Democratic lawmakers, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, had called on Biden to cancel $50,000 per borrower. The President spoke with Schumer, Warren and Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia on Tuesday ahead of the expected announcement.\n\nSchumer and Warren said in a joint statement that the decision is \"a giant step forward in addressing the student debt crisis.\"\n\n\"The positive impacts of this move will be felt by families across the country, particularly in minority communities, and is the single most effective action that the President can take on his own to help working families and the economy,\" they added.\n\nEarlier this week amid reports of Biden's plan, NAACP President Derrick Johnson called the reported provisions insufficient and \"not how you treat Black voters.\"\n\nA senior administration official on Wednesday suggested that the relief it will help \"narrow the racial wealth gap.\"\n\nAnd Biden, in his remarks, acknowledged that the burden of student debt \"is especially heavy on Black and Hispanic borrowers, who on average have less family wealth to pay for it. \"\n\nBiden has consistently pushed back on canceling that much, suggesting he would support wiping away $10,000 for borrowers below a certain income threshold. On the campaign trail, Biden called for immediately canceling a minimum of $10,000 in student debt per person as a response to the pandemic, as well as forgiving all undergraduate tuition-related federal student debt from two- and four-year public colleges and universities for those borrowers earning up to $125,000 a year. But he had also said he preferred Congress to take action rather than using executive power to do so.\n\nAnd on the right, Republican lawmakers blasted Biden's new relief plan.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said the plan is \"yet another way to make inflation even worse\" and \"reward far-left activists.\"\n\n\"President Biden's student loan socialism is a slap in the face to every family who sacrificed to save for college, every graduate who paid their debt, and every American who chose a certain career path or volunteered to serve in our Armed Forces in order to avoid taking on debt,\" he continued. \"This policy is astonishingly unfair.\"\n\nAppearing to counter his critics -- particularly Republicans who voted for the Trump tax plan -- the President said on Wednesday he would \"never apologize for helping ... working Americans and the middle class -- especially not to the same folks who voted for a $2 trillion tax cut that mainly benefited the wealthiest Americans and the biggest corporations.\"\n\nBiden said no one complained that the $700 billion in forgiven small business loans as a part of former President Donald Trump's Covid-19 relief would make inflation worse.\n\nAsked if the debt cancellation was fair to those who had already paid their loans or never took them out in the first place, Biden responded: \"Is it fair to the people who, in fact, do not own multi-million businesses and see these guys getting all the tax breaks?\"\n\nBiden has already canceled billions of dollars in student loan debt\n\nIn the meantime, Biden has taken a more targeted approach to student debt relief. Most of his efforts have been meant to expand and streamline existing federal student loan forgiveness programs.\n\nHe has also temporarily expanded the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program that forgives the debt of government and nonprofit workers after 10 years of payments, and made changes to the income-driven repayment plans, bringing millions of borrowers closer to forgiveness.\n\nBut the programs are complicated and don't always work the way they should. A recent Government Accountability Office report found that few people have qualified for forgiveness under an income-driven repayment plan, for example. The Department of Education had approved forgiveness for a total of 157 loans as of June 1, 2021. Meanwhile about 7,700 loans in repayment may have already been eligible for forgiveness.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Department of Education said in its statement that the administration is \"proposing long-term changes\" to the PSLF program.\n\n\"Specifically, the Department proposed allowing more payments to qualify for PSLF including partial, lump sum, and late payments, and allowing certain kinds of deferments and forbearances -- such as those for Peace Corps and AmeriCorps service, National Guard duty, and military service -- to count toward PSLF,\" the release states.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Phil Mattingly", "Katie Lobosco", "Maegan Vazquez"], "publish_date": "2022/08/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/08/24/biden-student-loan-debt-forgiveness-updates/7867780001/", "title": "'Debt and no degree': Biden cancels $20K in student loan debt: recap", "text": "WASHINGTON – Millions of Americans saddled by student loan debt breathed a sigh of relief Wednesday.\n\nDelivering on a key campaign promise, President Joe Biden announced he would cancel at least $10,000 in student loan debt for millions of borrowers, as well as $20,000 to Pell Grant recipients. The move comes months before the midterm elections, where Democrats are hoping to energize young voters.\n\nBiden, who made the move using executive authority, said the cost of a college education has become exorbitant.\n\n“That ticket has become too expensive for too many Americans,\" Biden said during remarks from the White House’s Roosevelt Room. \"The burden is so heavy that even if you graduate, you might not have the ticket that graduating college once offered.\"\n\nBiden held off making a final decision for months amid pressure from fellow Democrats, unions and other liberal groups pushing him to cancel at least $50,000 in student loan debt. His move to target $10,000 as a baseline mostly won praise from the left but also pushback from activists seeking more.\n\nBut questions remain about how the relief will impact the economy — a point that has drawn GOP attacks. Many Republicans have slammed the debt cancellation plan as an elitist ploy to help the rich and punish hard-working Americans who paid off their student loan debts.\n\nHere's what we know:\n\nHow much will be forgiven? Up to $20,000 in debt relief for people who have been low-income Pell Grant recipients; $10,000 for all other borrowers with incomes less than $125,000 or from households earning $250,000 or less.\n\nUp to $20,000 in debt relief for people who have been low-income Pell Grant recipients; $10,000 for all other borrowers with incomes less than $125,000 or from households earning $250,000 or less.

Click here to share.\n\nWhy the White House won’t say how much loan forgiveness will cost\n\nWhite House officials said they could not put a price tag on the loan forgiveness program in part because they don’t know how many eligible borrowers will apply for relief.\n\n“Realistically, we're not going to get to 100%. But the question is, how far short of 100% are we going to be?” said Bharat Ramamurti, deputy director of the National Economic Council.\n\nVoices:Biden's student loan forgiveness is a good start, but it falls short for borrowers like me\n\nIn addition, the amount of money the government expects to collect on outstanding debt in the future fluctuates based on economic conditions and other factors. If a borrower was never going to repay the $10,000 that will now be forgiven, Ramamurti said, then “it's not reasonable to say that the cost of that is $10,000, because we were not realistically going to collect anywhere close to $10,000 from it.”\n\nThe administration also wants to factor in the economic benefits it says will flow from relieving debt burdens. If more people will be able to start businesses or buy a home, that creates new tax revenue which offsets the front-end costs of the program, Ramamurti said.\n\n“The bottom line here is that there's all these different factors that go into the cost,” he said. “Standing here today, I can't tell you how all of those are going to shake out.”\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nPreventing future tuition increases?\n\nThe Education Department will keep an eye on whether schools raise their tuition in expectation that changes to the loan program will make it easier for students to take on more debt, White House officials said.\n\n“This is something the Department of Education is aware of,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters. “This is something that we’re monitoring.”\n\nSusan Rice, Biden’s domestic policy adviser, said too many colleges have jacked up prices while making wild promises about how much students can earn after getting a degree. She said the Education Department will publish annually a list of institutions that are “the worst actors.”\n\nRice also emphasized that the 2021 coronavirus relief package included both state and local funding, as well as money targeted to higher education, that she said should be used “to make sure that public institutions don't increase their tuition and expenses greater than the rate of inflation.”\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nWhite House 'happy' to debate fairness of policy\n\nRice said the administration is eager to take on criticisms that loan forgiveness is unfair to some, including people who paid off their loans without help or found other ways – such as military service – to finance their education.\n\n“This is a debate we are happy to have,” she said.\n\nRice said everyone in the nation benefits when the middle and working class do well. This relief will be targeted to those who need it most, she said.\n\nPeople who paid off their loans deserve credit for doing so, she added.\n\n“That’s fantastic,” she said. “But that doesn’t mean that because some were able to do so, nobody should help those who weren’t.”\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren lauds Biden's action\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and other progressive Democrats had been pushing Biden for months to cancel up to $50,000 in debt per borrower. If she was disappointed with Biden's announcement, however, she didn’t show it.\n\n“The cancellation the president is offering is historic,” Warren said. “It will be life changing for tens of millions of people. I will keep pushing to raise the numbers, but we need to pause for a minute to recognize just how powerful the president’s announcement today is.”\n\nWarren also gave credit to Biden for limiting how much borrowers will have to pay on their loans through income-driven repayment plans. Ultimately, she said the debt cancellation is a bet on the country’s future.\n\n“This is America saying that our people, even people who don’t have a lot of money, are our best investment,” she said. “And we’re just going to keep right on investing. I love it.”\n\n– Chris Quintana\n\nRepublicans attack Biden’s plan\n\nCongressional Republicans attacked President Joe Biden’s decision to forgive up to $20,000 in student loans as a giveaway to the left wing of the Democratic party.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy called Biden’s plan a “debt transfer scam,” charging that Americans who have already paid their debts will be forced to foot the bill for the forgiven loans.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell described the move as a “slap in the face” to Americans who chose not to go to college or already paid their debt.\n\n“This is the one consistent thread that connects Democrats’ policies: Taking money and purchasing power away from working families and redistributing it to their favored friends.”\n\nSenator John Barrasso of Wyoming, chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, called the move “an insult to every American who played by the rules and worked hard to responsibly pay off their own debt.”\n\n“Once again, the Biden administration is selling out working families to appease the far-left wing of the Democrat party,” Barrasso said in a statement.\n\nThe Republican National Committee said the decision will immediately increase inflation while costing taxpayers $300 billion.\n\n– Maureen Groppe and Ella Lee\n\nBiden to fight to double Pell Grant, says relief is about 'possibilities'\n\nBiden said he is going to continue to fight to double the Pell Grant. “I didn't get that done this time,” he said.\n\nHe added that his announcement on relief is “about opportunities.”\n\n“It's about giving people a fair shot,” he said. “It's about the one word America can be defined by, possibilities. It's all about providing possibilities.”\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nIncome-based loan repayment\n\nBiden also introduced a plan for paying back loans based on discretionary income.\n\nDiscretionary money is what's left after paying taxes and necessary cost-of-living expenses. It's different from disposable income, which is simply the amount left after paying taxes.\n\nKnowing what discretionary income is important because many federal student loan repayment plans are income-driven and have payments that are based on discretionary income.\n\n“It’s a game changer,” Biden said.\n\n– Ella Lee and Medora Lee\n\nBiden said debt relief is 'economically responsible'\n\nBiden said the relief to some student loan borrowers is “an economically responsible course.”\n\n“As we provide targeted relief, we’re taking an economically responsible course,” Biden said, pushing back on concerns of how the relief will impact inflation.\n\n“Independent experts agree that these actions taken together will provide real benefits for families without meaningful effect on inflation,” Biden said.\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nBiden: ‘It’s time for the payments to resume.’\n\nBiden said the moratorium on student loan payments will be extended one last time to Dec. 31.\n\n“We’ve wound down pandemic relief programs like the ones, unemployment insurance and small businesses. It’s time we do the same thing for student loans,” Biden said. “It’s time for the payments to resume.”\n\n– Kenneth Tran\n\n'Three key factors' to Biden's student loan response\n\nBiden announced three key components of his student loan relief plan: an extension on the student loan moratorium to Dec. 31, the cancellation of $20,000 in debt for Pell Grant recipients and $10,000 for other borrowers and “fixing the student loan system itself.”\n\n“All this means people can finally crawl out from under that mountain of debt, to get on top of their rent and utilities, to finally think about buying a home or starting a family or starting a business” Biden said. “When this happens, the whole economy is better off.”\n\n– Ella Lee\n\nCanceling debt is a ‘Band-Aid;' advocates want college to be more affordable\n\nSome education advocates are saying they want to see more from the Biden administration to address future student loan debt.\n\nWhile the National Parents Union, an education policy advocacy group, praised the Biden administration for taking steps to cancel student loan debt, “there is still much work to be done.”\n\n\"Canceling $10,000 in student loan debt merely puts a Band-Aid on the real problem of reforming the system that has landed us in this mess — and within years we will be right back at the same point,” they said.\n\nThe group noted that the average debt is $12,000 for a borrower who is white. However, Black women on average have more than $52,000 in debt.\n\n“While this will take some of the immediate burden away from many families, addressing those inequitable conditions, including the lack of generational wealth and additional support resources that many are forced to make up for through additional borrowing, we have not seen enough to address the underlying inequity of these systems that perpetuate economic inequality,” the group said.\n\nThe group said they want to see lawmakers make college more affordable and accessible.\n\nBraxton Brewington, spokesperson for the Debt Collective, a group that has organized demonstrations calling for total student loan debt cancellation, said today’s action was a first step worth celebrating but it fell “short of what economic and racial justice demands.”\n\n“The even better news is that Biden’s authority to cancel student debt doesn’t disappear after one executive use — he can and should simply cancel more student debt, which would boost the economy, narrow the racial wealth gap and grant real financial freedom to communities across the country for whom $20,000 or $10,000 of cancelation offers little relief,” Braxton said.\"\n\n– Rebecca Morin and Chris Quintana\n\nA tough decision:How soaring inflation is complicating Biden's decision whether to forgive student loan debt\n\nPell Grants at 50: Loss of buying power has Congress rethinking ways of paying for college\n\nWho will be affected?\n\nAccording to the Education Department, about 90% of those receiving relief, and who aren’t in school, make less than $75,000 a year.\n\nAmong eligible borrowers, 21% are 25 or younger and nearly half are between the ages of 26 and 39. More than a third are over 40, including 5% of whom are senior citizens.\n\n– Chris Quintana\n\nMarket and corporate America eye Biden plan with caution, as inflation specter looms\n\nCorporations and the wider market have had mixed reactions to Biden's student loan forgiveness plan. Backers of the move see it as a smart way to give consumers more money to buy homes and goods. Other market watchers are concerned that investors would see negative stock portfolios if the economy shrinks in response to wiped out loan debt.\n\nIf forgiveness sparks more inflation, it could also pressure the value of the dollar. The Brookings Institution has calculated that a $10,000 reprieve would add up to a wipeout of debt larger than many social safety nets combined, including WIC, SNAP and federal school lunch plans.\n\n– Riley Gutiérrez McDermid\n\nFuture payments for lower- and middle-income borrowers could be cut in half\n\nThe Education Department is proposing to halve the monthly payments for some borrowers from 10% to 5% of discretionary income — the amount that borrowers have to pay each month on their undergraduate loans. The proposal also would raise the amount of income considered \"nondiscretionary\" — which means it's protected from being used for repaying loans.\n\nFor some types of loan repayment plans, balances would be forgiven after 10 years of payment instead of 20. And, the rule would fully cover the borrower’s unpaid monthly interest, so a borrower’s loan balance wouldn't grow if they are making required payments.\n\nThe department said the proposal will be published in the near future in the Federal Register and open for comments for 30 days.\n\n– Nirvi Shah\n\nEducation Department: Millions of borrowers' student loans will be forgiven automatically\n\nThe Education Department said nearly 8 million borrowers are likely to get their loan forgiven automatically because the agency already has information about their income.\n\nMore details will be coming in the next few weeks.\n\nOther borrowers will have to apply for loan forgiveness, and the applications will be available “no later” than when the freeze on student loan payments ends later this year.\n\n– Chris Quintana\n\nAn unprecedented move\n\nThe mass cancellation of student loans is unprecedented in the nation's history of student borrowing — but there has been little precedent in the student loan landscape for more than two and a half years.\n\nAt the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, then-President Donald Trump paused student loan payments, set interest rates at zero percent and stopped collection attempts on overdue debts. Both Trump and Biden extended the moratorium multiple times. The most recent extension was April 6, less than 30 days before payments had been scheduled to start in May. It was set to expire Aug. 31, with some borrowers getting notices that were later retracted about payments resuming Sep. 1.\n\nThe administration already has erased roughly $32 billion in student debt for 1.6 million borrowers by widening the eligibility requirements for pre-existing relief programs.

A federal Pell grant is only given to undergraduate students who \"display exceptional financial need and have not earned a bachelor's, graduate, or professional degree\" and \"does not have to be repaid, except under certain circumstances,\" according to the Department of Education's Federal Student Aid office. Per data cited by the White House , Pell grants currently only cover a third of the cost of a four-year public college degree, which has led to increased borrowing.\n\nIndividual borrowers who make less than $125,000 yearly and married couples or heads of households who make less than $250,000 yearly will have up $10,000 of their federal student loan debt forgiven if they did not receive a Pell grant as an undergraduate student, per the FSA website\n\nIndividual borrowers who make less than $125,000 yearly and married couples or heads of households who make less than $250,000 yearly but did receive a Pell grant as an undergraduate student will have up $20,000 of their student loan debt forgiven.\n\nWhat steps do eligible borrowers have to take?\n\nNearly 8 million borrowers may be able to receive debt forgiveness automatically because the Department of Education already has their income information, FSA says.\n\nThe Biden administration will launch an application in the coming weeks for borrowers to provide their income information or if borrowers are unsure if the department has their income information already. The application will be available by early October, a senior administration official told CNN. After a borrower completes the application, the individual can expect the student loan relief within four to six weeks, the official also said.\n\nTo be notified when the application is open, borrowers can sign up at studentaid.gov.\n\nFSA says the application will be available before the federal student loan repayment pause ends on December 31. Borrowers are advised to apply before November 15 in order to receive relief before the repayment pause expires, but the Department of Education will continue to process applications even after the pause expires, the official noted.\n\nBorrowers can sign up for updates on when the application is open at the Department of Education's subscriptions page\n\nHow will future repayments for remaining debt work?\n\nStudent loan repayment will be paused again until December 31, 2022, with repayments starting in January 2023.\n\nThe Biden administration is also proposing a rule to create a new income-driven repayment plan in which borrowers pay no more than 5% of their monthly income on undergraduate loans, a decrease from the current 10% threshold.\n\nThe rule would also increase the amount of income that is considered \"non-discretionary income\" so no borrower earning below 225% of the federal poverty level will have to make a monthly payment.\n\nFor borrowers with loan balances of $12,000 or less, loan balances would be forgiven after 10 years of payments instead of the current 20-year mark, under the proposed new income-driven repayment plan.\n\nAnd to help prevent a borrower's loan balance from growing while the individual makes monthly payments, under the proposed rule the Biden administration would cover unpaid monthly interest, even if the monthly payment is $0 due to the borrower's income level.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.", "authors": ["Chandelis Duster"], "publish_date": "2022/08/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2021/10/06/public-service-student-loan-forgiveness-biden/6011023001/", "title": "Public Service Loan Forgiveness: Biden changes student loans ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – The promise of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program was supposed to be simple.\n\nIf college graduates were willing to forgo the private sector’s lucrative pay and work instead as a teacher, police officer or government worker, any federal student debt they had after 10 years of payments would be forgiven.\n\nThe program has proved anything but forgiving. More than a decade after its inception in 2007, thousands upon thousands of borrowers have applied for forgiveness. The federal government has rejected nearly all of them.\n\nThat's supposed to change, starting this fall.\n\nQuestions about loan relief?Who is eligible and how to apply under Biden’s new program\n\nThe Education Department on Wednesday announced a sweeping overhaul to the loan forgiveness program that will immediately erase the debt of 22,000 borrowers to the tune of $1.7 billion. The government estimated another 27,000 borrowers could see about $2.8 billion in debts forgiven if they prove they were employed in an eligible job.\n\nThe changes are designed to let borrowers correct errors and count payments they were trying to make toward the program. That should shorten the amount of time more than 550,000 borrowers – those who have already consolidated their loans – are required to make payments to qualify for forgiveness, the government said.\n\nThe redesign of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program is President Joe Biden's latest effort to address the nation’s growing $1.7 trillion in student loan debt and ease the burden of struggling borrowers.\n\nProgressives have called on Biden to forgive up to $50,000 in loans per borrower, but the executive branch has instead rolled out targeted relief, such as for those who have been defrauded by their college or those who are permanently disabled. With the changes from the public service program, the federal government will have forgiven roughly $11.5 billion in student loan debt.\n\n\"Borrowers who devote a decade of their lives to public service should be able to rely on the promise of Public Service Loan Forgiveness,\" Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said. \"The system has not delivered on that promise to date, but that is about to change for many borrowers who have served their communities and their country.\"\n\nThe changes come after a string of critical reports about Public Service Loan Forgiveness' inaccessibility. CBS' \"60 Minutes\" recently reported on military veterans who tried and failed to obtain forgiveness.\n\nAnd the Student Borrower Protection Center, an advocacy group, found that the loan servicer FedLoan had denied thousands of borrowers forgiveness because of minor errors or paperwork issues.\n\nSeth Frotman, the group's executive director, is a frequent critic of the Education Department's handling of student loans, especially the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. But he said he's encouraged by the changes the department put forward.\n\n\"This is a good day for teachers, nurses, servicemembers and millions of workers serving on the front lines of the pandemic,\" Frotman said. \"For too long, those who give the most to our communities and our country have been given the runaround and forced to shoulder debts that should have been canceled.\"\n\nAnd two of the nation's largest teachers unions, the American Federation of Teachers and the National Education Association, in separate statements lauded the changes and said they would benefit educators and other employees in the public sector. Both had long pushed the Education Department to fix what they described as a broken program.\n\nStringent requirements hamper relief\n\nThe trouble with Public Service Loan Forgiveness stems from the requirements for relief.\n\nBorrowers seeking forgiveness must work in a job the government deems public service, and they have to make 120 payments through the appropriate income-based repayment plan. And only borrowers with loans made by the federal government, known as direct loans, qualify for relief.\n\nTens of thousands of people thought they qualified but messed up one of those criteria – by paying on the wrong type of loan, by not enrolling in an income-based repayment plan before making payments, or by working in a job they later discovered didn't qualify for forgiveness – and found themselves out of luck.\n\nBefore the announcement, only 16,000 borrowers had seen their debt forgiven via the program, according to the Education Department. About 1.3 million people are trying to have their debts discharged through the program.\n\nChanges to the loan forgiveness program will take place in two parts. The agency will first loosen some of the rules that had prevented eligible borrowers from discharging their loans, via a limited waiver. The government, for example, will allow payments on any of a person's loans to count toward the total number required for forgiveness.\n\nThe department said it would automatically credit borrowers who already have direct loans and have proved they work in an eligible field. Others who haven't enrolled in the program or have ineligible federal loans will have to apply for forgiveness, which may require them to consolidate their loans. Borrowers will have until October 2022 to apply.\n\nThe Education Department also plans to review all Public Service Loan Forgiveness applications that had been denied and to give federal employees automatic credit toward forgiveness.\n\nOther changes will come about more slowly via regulations made by \"rule-making,\" a lengthy and complicated bureaucratic back-and-forth between the government and other stakeholders.\n\nOnly some loans qualify for forgiveness\n\nOne of the most problematic pieces of Public Service Loan Forgiveness: Many borrowers had the wrong type of loan and didn't realize they weren't eligible for relief.\n\nWhen the loan forgiveness program was first introduced, many of the loans offered from the federal government were Family Federal Education Loans, or loans made through private entities but insured by the federal government. The government stopped offering those loans in 2010, and now relies on direct loans – the kind eligible for forgiveness. The Education Department said about 60% of borrowers with an approved employer hold FFEL loans.\n\n“To a layperson, it wouldn't be very obvious that you had the wrong loan type,” said Betsy Mayotte, president of the Institute of Student Loan Advisors.\n\nAnd borrowers didn't have a choice which type of loan they received, she said. Mayotte’s nonprofit has helped thousands of borrowers with their student loan payments, and she helps moderate a subreddit focused on Public Service Loan Forgiveness. She said many of the issues she handles these days are tied to borrowers with ineligible loans.\n\nMayotte said the short-term waiver will help people, but she questioned whether borrowers who miss the waiver period might be in the same boat come Nov. 1, 2022.\n\nShe said concerned borrowers may want to consider consolidating their loans into a single direct loan if they haven't done so already.\n\nIf borrowers are unsure about what type of loan they have, Mayotte said, they can request that information from their loan servicer or they can check on the federal government's website for financial aid.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/19/politics/student-loan-debt-forgiveness-repayment/index.html", "title": "Biden's latest student debt move will bring 3.6 million borrowers ...", "text": "Washington (CNN) The Department of Education is making more changes to the federal student loan system that will help bring millions of borrowers -- some of whom may have previously been in forbearance -- closer to receiving debt forgiveness.\n\nThese new actions, announced Tuesday, are the latest moves by the Biden administration to make it easier for federal student loan borrowers to receive forgiveness that they may already be entitled to under existing programs.\n\nBy the end of March, more than 700,000 of the 43 million federal student loan borrowers had seen their outstanding debt discharged under President Joe Biden, totaling more than $17 billion in relief. He recently extended a pandemic-related payment pause for federal student loans until August 31.\n\nTuesday's actions will bring more than 3.6 million borrowers at least three years closer to receiving forgiveness through what's known as the income-driven repayment program, or IDR. The program, which offers four types of repayment plans, allows borrowers to avoid loan default by lowering their monthly payments based on their income and family size.\n\nIDR also promises loan forgiveness after 20-25 years of payments are made. Several thousands of borrowers will immediately see forgiveness through the IDR program after Tuesday's actions are fully implemented, according to the Department of Education.\n\nAnother 40,000 borrowers will receive immediate forgiveness through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program because they will get credit for more of their payments.\n\n\"Student loans were never meant to be a life sentence, but it's certainly felt that way for borrowers locked out of debt relief they're eligible for,\" said US Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona in a statement.\n\n\"Today, the Department of Education will begin to remedy years of administrative failures that effectively denied the promise of loan forgiveness to certain borrowers enrolled in IDR plans,\" he added.\n\nIDR program and to provide borrowers with debt relief. The lawmakers' Democratic senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Dick Durbin of Illinois called on the Department of Education last week to investigate mismanagement of theIDR program and to provide borrowers with debt relief. The lawmakers' letter cited a recent report from NPR that found that very few borrowers were able to get the loan forgiveness they were promised by the IDR program.\n\nFixing past errors\n\nThe changes announced Tuesday will help federal student loan borrowers who did not get accurate information from their loan servicers about their repayment options and were steered into forbearance -- which allows for a temporary stop in payments -- when they could have been enrolled in an IDR plan.\n\nForbearance can be a quick and easy solution to help borrowers struggling to make their monthly loan payments to stay out of default. But sometimes it's better for borrowers to enroll in an IDR program instead. That way they can make a lower monthly payment while also getting credit toward forgiveness.\n\nA Department of Education review suggests that loan servicers placed borrowers into forbearance in violation of department rules, even when a borrower's monthly payment under an IDR plan could have been as low as $0.\n\nThe Department of Education will be conducting a one-time account adjustment that will count time spent in forbearances of more than 12 consecutive months or for more than 36 months cumulative toward forgiveness under IDR and the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. PSLF cancels debt after 10 years for eligible public sector workers who make qualifying monthly payments.\n\nThe agency will also increase oversight of loan servicers' use of forbearance going forward.\n\nThe Department of Education has also found flaws in the way payments are tracked by both loan servicers and its own office of Federal Student Aid, suggesting borrowers are missing out on progress toward IDR forgiveness. To address past inaccuracies, the agency will conduct a one-time revision of IDR payments and reform the Federal Student Aid's tracking system.\n\nBiden's piecemeal approach to loan forgiveness\n\nBiden has resisted pressure from other Democrats to grant broad student loan forgiveness. Instead, his administration has taken several actions to make loan cancellation easier under existing programs.\n\nLast year, the administration temporarily expanded eligibility for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program until October 31, 2022. So far, the Department of Education has identified more than 113,000 borrowers with about $6.8 billion in loans who are eligible for student debt cancellation due to the waiver.\n\nThe department has also been chipping away at a backlog of forgiveness claims filed under a policy known as borrower defense to repayment that allows former students who were defrauded by their colleges to seek federal debt relief. Under that policy, the Biden administration has canceled about $2 billion in debt held by more than 105,000 individuals who attended for-profit colleges and another $1.2 billion for borrowers who attended ITT Technical Institutes before it closed.\n\nThe department also improved efforts to reach borrowers eligible for debt relief because of permanent disabilities, canceling $7.8 billion for more than 400,000 borrowers.", "authors": ["Katie Lobosco"], "publish_date": "2022/04/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/08/23/biden-near-decision-10-000-student-loan-cancellation/7868363001/", "title": "Biden to announce $10,000 student loan cancellation", "text": "WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden is set to announce Wednesday that he will forgive $10,000 in student loan debt for millions of borrowers who fall below an income cap, according to sources familiar with the plan.\n\nAfter weighing executive action for months, the president is expected to reveal his long-awaited decision after he returns to the White House from vacation in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. The action is also expected to include extending until January a pause on federal student loan payments – implemented during the coronavirus pandemic – set to expire at the end of this month.\n\nThe latest on student loan forgiveness:Updates from Wednesday on Biden's official announcement\n\nThe president has said he would make a decision by Aug. 31. Biden faces increasing pressure from progressive Democrats to cancel an even larger share of debt for Americans who took federal loans to pay for college. But some Democratic economists, including former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, worry about the risk of debt cancelation exacerbating 40-year-high inflation.\n\nMore:Biden taking 'hard look' at student loan debt forgiveness, but less than $50,000\n\nWhat the president is considering\n\nThe White House has zeroed in on a plan that would cancel $10,000 in student loan debt per eligible borrower, according to sources, matching a figure Biden campaigned on. The White House has also discussed expanding relief beyond $10,000 for borrowers who meet certain criteria and Pell Grant recipients, according to one source.\n\nThe debt cancellation would be limited to borrowers with incomes of $125,000 or less and household earnings of less than $250,000, and would apply only to people with federal loans, not private ones.\n\nMore than 43 million people have federal student loan debt in the U.S., and the average borrower has about $37,000, according to data compiled by the Education Data Initiative. The outstanding federal loan balance is about $1.6 trillion.\n\nMore:Biden aides 'talking daily' about student loans, expect decision soon: Education Secretary Cardona\n\nProgressive Democrats have pushed for more\n\nCanceling $10,000 in student loan debt could receive mixed reviews from progressives groups – including the NAACP, Congressional Black Caucus and unions – that have sought greater debt forgiveness. Some liberals have urged Biden to cancel all student loan debt. Top Democrats, including Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., lobbied Biden to cancel at least $50,000 in student loan debt.\n\n\"If the rumors are true, we've got a problem. And tragically, we’ve experienced this so many times before,\" said Derrick Johnson, president and CEO of the NAACP, which has pushed for a minimum student debt cancelation of $50,000.\n\n\n\nThe income cap for eligibility – designed to prevent wealthy Americans from benefiting – is another area of contention for progressive activists, who say it would create a bureaucratic mess and prevent millions of borrowers from getting relief.\n\n\"The hoops of means testing means that millions and millions of borrowers won’t get help,\" said Melissa Bryne, executive director of We The 45 Million, which represents student loan borrowers advocating for student debt cancelation. She called it \"an outrageous violation\" of Biden's campaign pledge to cancel student loan debt to all borrowers.\n\nInflation risk hangs over decision\n\nBiden said in April that he was taking a \"hard look\" at executive action to forgive federal student loan debt. Chief among the White House's considerations in the months that followed: the possible impact on inflation that has soared throughout the year.\n\nCanceling potentially up to $10,000 in student loan debt would mean billions more collectively staying in the pockets of Americans. Some critics argue the extra money for consumers to spend risks stoking demand and further accelerating historic inflation.\n\nMore:How soaring inflation is complicating Biden's decision whether to forgive student loan debt\n\nSummers, former Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration and economic adviser to Barack Obama, has led the warnings about the impact on inflation and said canceling student debt would disproportionately help higher-earning Americans. Jason Furman, Obama's chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, has raised similar concerns.\n\n\"Student loan debt relief is spending that raises demand and increases inflation,\" Summers said in a tweet Monday. \"It consumes resources that could be better used helping those who did not, for whatever reason, have the chance to attend college. It will also tend to be inflationary by raising tuitions.\"\n\nThe impact for borrowers\n\nA study from Liberty Street Economics found forgiving $10,000 per borrower would wipe $321 billion in student loan debt, and it would completely erase the debt for about a third of borrowers, or roughly 12 million people.\n\nA separate study this week from the The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania found that forgiving $10,000 in federal college student loan debt will cost the federal government between $300 billion and $980 billion over 10 years.\n\nThe Biden administration has already has erased roughly $32 billion in student debt for 1.6 million borrowers by widening the eligibility requirements for pre-existing relief programs, such as the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.\n\nMore:Young people want student debt relief. But not all want it totally canceled, poll finds\n\nA boost for Democrats in the midterms?\n\nCanceling some student loan debt – an idea wildly popular among young voters who lean to the left – could energize a key voting bloc that has shown signs of being unenthused in the November midterm elections.\n\nA USA TODAY/Public Agenda poll in July found that nearly 60% of Americans support “forgiving a significant portion of government student loans for college graduates who have excessive debt.” That rate of support dropped when Americans were asked about forgiving debt for all graduates, regardless of income.\n\nOpinion:'Forgiving' student loans isn't motivated by kindness. It's all about cold, hard politics.\n\nPreviewing their line of attack, Republicans have slammed student debt cancelation as a ploy to reward the liberal, college-going elite and punish those who couldn't afford college or had to save to pay off their debt. They also said it would spike inflation.\n\n\"Joe Biden has had a lot of bad ideas,\" Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., said Tuesday. \"But transferring billions in student loan debt to taxpayers – especially at a time of high inflation – might be his worst idea yet.\"\n\nMore:'Windfall for the rich': Republicans warm up attacks as Biden weighs forgiving student debt\n\nReach Joey Garrison on Twitter @joeygarrison.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/08/24/student-loan-debt-forgiveness-ukraine-mack-rutherford-climate-change-its-wednesdays-news/7880063001/", "title": "Biden's big student loan relief plan", "text": "President Joe Biden announced new plans for student loan forgiveness.

Now, the government is trying to make it right.\n\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. Department of Education announced sweeping changes to its Public Service Loan Forgiveness program after thousands of borrowers applied for forgiveness, with nearly all of them being rejected by the federal government.\n\nAfter making a decade of payments, many found out that they had the wrong type of federal loan or repayment plan to be eligible for the program.

The government estimated another 27,000 borrowers could see about $2.8 billion in debts forgiven if they prove they were employed in an eligible job.\n\nIf you have these loans, here are the steps you can take to get relief:\n\nWhat is Public Service Loan Forgiveness? How did it originate?\n\nThe Public Service Loan Forgiveness is a program that was launched in 2007 in an effort to steer more college graduates into public service. As long as they made 10 years of payments on their federal student loans, the program promised to erase the remainder.\n\nThe program, however, has proved anything but forgiving. Before Wednesday’s announcement, only 16,000 borrowers had seen their debt forgiven via the program, according to the Education Department. About 1.3 million people are trying to have their debts discharged through the program.\n\nOne of the most problematic pieces of Public Service Loan Forgiveness: Many borrowers had the wrong type of loan and didn't realize they weren't eligible for relief.\n\nWhen the loan forgiveness program was first introduced, many of the loans offered from the federal government were Family Federal Education Loans (FFEL), or loans made through private entities but insured by the federal government.\n\nThe government stopped offering those loans in 2010 and now relies on direct loans – the kind eligible for forgiveness. The Education Department said about 60% of borrowers with an approved employer hold FFEL loans.\n\nWho is eligible for student loan forgiveness?\n\nThe government previously restricted eligibility for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program to only certain types of federal student loans and specific repayment plans.\n\nHowever, through October 2022, borrowers who have made 10 years worth of payments while in a qualifying job – such as positions in federal, state or local governments, a nonprofit organization or the U.S. military – will now be eligible for loan relief no matter what kind of federal loan or repayment plan they have.\n\nPast loan payments that were previously ineligible will now count, moving some borrowers closer to forgiveness. That is expected to especially help those borrowers with Federal Family Education Loans.\n\nAmong other changes, the department will allow military members to count time on active duty toward the 10 years, even if they put a pause on making their payments during that time.\n\nHow do I figure out if my past or current employer qualifies for PSLF?\n\nUse this help tool of the Federal Student Aid website to check if you work for a qualifying employer: https://studentaid.gov/pslf/\n\nIt provides information on which employers meet requirements for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.\n\nHow do I check which federal loans I have?\n\nIf borrowers are unsure about what type of loan they have, they can request that information from their loan servicer or they can check on the federal government's website for financial aid, according to Betsy Mayotte, president of the Institute of Student Loan Advisors.\n\nIf you don't know what kind of federal loans you have, you can see which loans by logging into your account on StudentAid.gov, going to the My Aid page and scrolling down to the Loan Breakdown section.\n\nIf I qualify, what steps do I need to take?\n\nChanges to the loan forgiveness program will take place in two parts.\n\nThe agency will first loosen some of the rules that had prevented eligible borrowers from discharging their loans, via a limited waiver. The government, for example, will allow payments on any of a person's loans to count toward the total number required for forgiveness.\n\nThe Public Service Loan Forgiveness waiver will be available to borrowers who have direct loans, Federal Family Education Loans and Perkins Loans.\n\nParent PLUS loans are not eligible under the limited waiver.\n\nThe department said it would automatically credit borrowers who already have direct loans and have proved they work in an eligible field. Others who haven't enrolled in the program or have ineligible federal loans will have to apply for forgiveness, which may require them to consolidate their loans. Borrowers will have until October 2022 to apply.\n\nTo find out more about loan consolidation, visit StudentAid.gov/Manage-Loans/Consolidation.\n\nThe Education Department also plans to review all Public Service Loan Forgiveness applications that had been denied and to give federal employees automatic credit toward forgiveness.\n\nOther changes will come about more slowly via regulations made by \"rule-making,\" a lengthy and complicated bureaucratic back-and-forth between the government and other stakeholders.\n\nFor more information, visit StudentAid.gov/PSLFWaiver.\n\nHow do you receive credit for past payments under the new rules?\n\nFor a limited time, borrowers may get credit for past payments made on loans that would otherwise not qualify for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.\n\nThere are two requirements to receive additional qualifying payments: Full-time employment and loan consolidation.\n\nFor instance, you must have worked full-time for a qualifying employer when prior payments were made, according to Federal Student Aid.\n\nSome part-time workers may qualify under certain circumstances. Say you were employed in more than one qualifying part-time job at the same time. You would be considered full-time if you worked a combined average of at least 30 hours per week.\n\nIt may take several months for a borrower's account information to reflect the new payment count, according to Federal Student Aid.\n\nHow far back can I get credit for payments?\n\nTo be sure, you can only receive credit for payments made after Oct. 1, 2007, since that is when the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program began.\n\nFor any period you may receive additional qualifying payments, you must file an application.\n\nWho may need to consolidate their loans?\n\nIf you have Federal Family Education Loan Program loans, Federal Perkins Loans or other types of federal student loans that aren’t direct loans, you must consolidate them into the direct loan program by Oct. 31, 2022, according to Federal Student Aid.\n\nThis is important for borrowers because you can't receive credit for payments if you consolidate after that date. Once the consolidation process is complete, you must then submit a PSLF form to your loan servicer.\n\nThe help tool on the Federal Student Aid website will be updated in the coming months to process applications for borrowers in the Federal Family Education Loan Program and those with Perkins loans.\n\nRight now, employment can still be verified for them in Step 1 of the help tool, and loan consolidation can still be requested, Federal Student Aid said on its website. But an application for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program through the tool may not be available in the near term for those borrowers.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2022/08/24/bidens-student-debt-forgiveness-what-to-know/7876380001/", "title": "Qualify for student loan forgiveness? Explaining Biden's new debt plan", "text": "President Joe Biden confirmed Wednesday what many have anticipated for months – a plan to forgive or reduce student loan debt for millions of debt-saddled borrowers.\n\nIf you earn less than $125,000 annually, he said, you're eligible to receive cancellation of up to $10,000 in federal student loans. If you received a Pell Grant, you can get up to $20,000 forgiven.\n\nIf you're not eligible for any student debt forgiveness, your pause on repayments continues to be paused until year end. The Department of Education is also working on a proposal introducing a new repayment plan to ease the burden on borrowers.\n\nSince the start of the pandemic in 2020, borrowers haven't had to pay a cent on their federal student loans. During this time, the pressure grew for the president to cancel the debt. It was one of the platforms Biden ran on for president in 2020.\n\nThough the plan was welcomed by many, it still garnered criticism. Many had sought higher forgiveness amounts – $50,000 or even all amounts, no matter how large. The total outstanding balance for federally owned (including defaulted) student loans in December 2021 was $1.38 trillion, the New York Federal Reserve said in April.\n\nBIDEN PLAN RECAP:$20K in student debt to be forgiven, extend payment pause\n\nSTUDENT LOANS:Why are some people angry about Biden loan program?\n\nHow do I apply?\n\nThe application will be available mid-October, officials said. Borrowers who provide an email address at studentaid.gov are to receive an email notification when the application is available. Applications can take four to six weeks to process. The pause on federal student loan repayments terminates Dec. 31.\n\nNearly 8 million borrowers may be automatically eligible to receive relief because relevant income data is already available to the Department of Education.\n\nWhat’s Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan?\n\nIndividuals with an annual income of less than $125,000 (or under $250,000 for married couples or heads of households) are entitled to have up to $10,000 in federal student loans canceled. No private loans will be forgiven.\n\nThose who received a Pell Grant in college will be eligible for up to $20,000 in debt cancellation.\n\nFor those who still have student debt, the repayment pause since March 2020 will be extended to the end of the year. Borrowers will resume payments in January.\n\nBIDEN COLLEGE CAREER:Biden mentions own education in loan relief speech\n\nLIFE OFF PAUSE:How the student loan payment pause changed people’s lives\n\nWhat is a Pell Grant?\n\nFederal funding that’s usually awarded only to students who display exceptional financial need and have not earned a bachelor's, graduate or professional degree. Sometimes, a student enrolled in a post-baccalaureate teacher certification program might receive a Pell Grant.\n\nUnlike a loan, a Pell Grant does not have to be repaid, except under certain circumstances. Those include a change in enrollment status or if you received outside scholarships or grants that reduced your need for federal student aid.\n\nPELL GRANTS:Who qualifies? What to know from Biden student loan plan\n\nAre current students eligible for loan forgiveness?\n\nLoans awarded to current students and graduates with undergraduate, graduate and Parent PLUS loans are eligible, so long as the loans were awarded by June 30, 2022.\n\nWhat's the cost of student loan forgiveness?\n\nA one-time maximum debt forgiveness of $10,000 per borrower will cost the U.S. government around $300 billion for borrowers with incomes less than $125,000, according to analysis published on Tuesday by Junlei Chen and Kent Smetters at the Penn Wharton Budget Model, based at the University of Pennsylvania. This cost increases to $330 billion if the program continues over the standard 10-year budget window.\n\nBefore the announcement, the Government Accountability Office estimated that alone, the payment pause since the start of the pandemic cost the government $102 billion. That amount included suspending all payments due, interest accrual and involuntary collections for loans in default from March 13, 2020, to Aug. 31, 2022.\n\nWho benefits most from the student debt forgiveness plan?\n\nMostly higher-income households. Between 69% and 73% of the debt forgiven accrues to households in the top 60% of the income distribution, Chen and Smetters said.\n\nA New York Federal Reserve study in April, though, said that the income cap to the forgiveness \"substantially reduces the cost of student loan forgiveness and increases the share of benefit going to borrowers who are more likely to struggle repaying their debts.\"\n\nFor example, an income cap of $75,000 for a $10,000 cancellation raises the share of forgiven loan dollars going to borrowers in low-income neighborhoods to 35% from 25% and the share going to lower credit score borrowers to 42% from 37%, it said.\n\nIncome caps also increase the share of loans forgiven that were delinquent before the pandemic to 60% from 34%.\n\nLIFE'S NOT FAIR:Is student loan forgiveness fair to those without college degrees? Americans remain divided over costs\n\nAVOIDING STUDENT DEBT:Middle class, minus debt: Apprenticeships, certificates offer low-cost option to college\n\nHow many Americans have student loans outstanding?\n\nAbout 45 million Americans hold federal student loan debt, according to federal data. The loan forgiveness plan should provide relief to about 43 million borrowers and cancel the full remaining balance for nearly 45% of those borrowers.\n\nThe total outstanding balance for federally owned (including defaulted) student loans in December 2021 was $1.38 trillion, the New York Federal Reserve said in April.\n\nMost (67%) student loan borrowers are under 40 years old, but 57% of all balances are owed by those under 40. That means those with larger balances are more likely to be older or to have taken out loans for graduate school, it said.\n\nThe White House estimates that its initiative will cancel the full remaining balance for roughly 20 million borrowers.\n\nWhat’s the average outstanding student loan debt amount?\n\nThe average federal student loan debt balance is $37,667 while the total average balance (including private loan debt) may be as high as $40,274, according to Education Data Initiative, which collects data and statistics about the U.S. education system.\n\nDISSECTING STUDENT LOANS:Free college or federal student loans? These alternatives could help solve student debt crisis\n\nPOLITICAL FORGIVENESS:'Forgiving' student loans isn't motivated by kindness. It's all about cold, hard politics.\n\nIs student loan forgiveness taxable?\n\nThe debt relief isn’t counted as taxable income for federal income tax purposes, the White House says.\n\nWould canceling student loan debt increase inflation?\n\nSome prominent economists, including former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and Jason Furman, who was chairman of President Barack Obama’s Council of Economic Advisors, have been vocal critics, saying student debt forgiveness would stoke 40-year high inflation and may be unfair.\n\n“Student loan relief is not free,” Furman tweeted on Aug. 19. “Part of it would be paid for by the 87% of Americans who do not benefit but lose out from inflation. Part of it would be paid for by future spending cuts & tax increases—with uncertainty about who will bear those costs.”\n\nThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates Biden’s plan “would more than undo the deflationary pressures from the Inflation Reduction Act and add 0.15 percentage points of additional inflation in the near-term,” noted Sarah Foster, Bankrate analyst.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has been on an aggressive rate-raising cycle to cool demand, but giving people spending money could stymie that effort.\n\nAnd those economists aren't the only ones worried. Hit already by hefty inflation, 59% of Americans are concerned student loan forgiveness will make inflation worse, according to a CNBC survey, conducted online by Momentive among a national sample of 5,142 adults from Aug. 4 to 15.\n\nEVERYDAY GETS EXPENSIVE:These everyday items saw the biggest price increases from inflation in July, CPI report shows\n\nJOB WORRIES:With 80% of workers afraid of losing jobs during a recession, business owners trim costs\n\nWhat is discretionary income?\n\nThe money you have left after paying taxes and necessary cost-of-living expenses. It's different from disposable income, which is simply the amount of money you have left after paying taxes.\n\nKnowing what discretionary income is is important because many federal student loan repayment plans are income-driven and have payments that are based on your discretionary income.\n\nDISCRETIONARY INCOME:What is it? Why it matters in student loan repayment.\n\nIf you qualify for student debt forgiveness, what should you do with any extra money?\n\n“Student loan forgiveness will likely decrease your monthly payment or get rid of it entirely,” said Dan Casey of Bridgeriver Advisors in Bloomfield Hills, Mich.\n\nTake that freed up money to pay off high-interest debt like credit cards, build up your emergency fund, or invest it in your retirement. Even though today looks brighter, the economy is still on shaky footing.\n\nSHAKY GROUND:Are we in a recession? America's economy stinks no matter what you call it.\n\nINFLATION HELP?:President Biden signs Inflation Reduction Act into law to address climate and health care\n\nDoes Congress need to approve Biden's loan forgiveness plan?\n\nThe White House says it is using the authority Congress granted the Department of Education to forgive the outstanding federal student loans.\n\nShould I stop paying my student loans now?\n\nThe Biden administration has extended the Student Loan Payment Pause through Dec. 31, which allows borrowers to suspend their loan payments with a 0% interest rate. The White House has warned that this will be the final extension.\n\n\"It’s time for the payments to resume,\" Biden said Wednesday.\n\nBorrowers who qualify for the payment pause and loan forgiveness should stop paying off loans if they owe less than the $10,000 cap (or $20,000 cap, for Pell Grant recipients) to take full advantage of the loan forgiveness program.\n\nOthers who earn more than $125,000 (or $250,000, for married couples) or have more than $10,000 in loans (or $20,000, for Pell Grant recipients) should be ready to start making loan payments again.\n\n\"We recommend to continue making payments for now if you can afford to because these payments go 100% toward principal until January,\" said Isabel Barrow, director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. \"While it’s impossible to know what will happen in the future, such as another forgiveness program, we would not recommend delaying or stopping loan payments in anticipation of future changes.\"\n\nThere is also subset of borrowers who did not have their loans paused. These borrowers should continue to make loan payments \"to keep the loan in good standing,\" according to Ameriprise financial private wealth advisor Rebecca Hall.\n\nLoans not eligible for the COVID-19 payment pause include:\n\nNondefaulted Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program loans not held by the Department of Education\n\nDefaulted and Nondefaulted federal Perkins loans not held by the Department of Education\n\nNondefaulted Health Education Assistance Loan (HEAL) loans\n\nPrivate student loans\n\nThe Department of Education administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether any of these loans would be eligible for the loan forgiveness program.\n\nCAN'T AFFORD IT:Is college worth it? Americans say they value higher education, but it's too expensive for many\n\nI paid off student loans recently. Am I eligible for a refund?\n\nThe federal government first announced the student loan payment pause on March 13, 2020. The U.S. Department of Education says borrowers who made payments during the pause – including auto-debit payments – can request a refund with their loan servicer.\n\nBorrowers can look up their loan servicer on the agency’s website.\n\nIf you don’t qualify, should you start repaying in January?\n\n“If you haven’t made a student loan payment since the pause began, it’s important to understand how much you’ll owe each month,” Daniel Milan, advisor at Cornerstone Financial Services, said.\n\nThen, review the interest rates on your loans and start paying off the highest interest ones first, enrolling in autopay so you don’t miss any payments while you get back into the habit of paying regularly and consider refinancing if it lowers your payments.\n\n“Moving multiple loans into one loan can also help you keep better track of how much you actually owe,” he said.\n\nSTOKING INFLATION?:How soaring inflation is complicating Biden's decision whether to forgive student loan debt\n\nWhat’s ahead for future borrowers?\n\nTo “substantially” reduce future monthly payments for lower- and middle-income borrowers and protect more income from loan payments, the Department of Education is proposing a new income-driven repayment plan.\n\nHere are some things being proposed:\n\nCutting the amount borrowers have to repay each month and curbing interest so a balance won't grow so long as borrowers make their required monthly payments.​​​\n\n\n\nLoan balance forgiveness after 10 years, instead of 20, under many income-driven repayment plans for borrowers with original loan balances of $12,000 or less. This will allow nearly all community college borrowers to be debt-free within 10 years, the White House said.\n\n\n\nStarting next summer, the Department of Education can automatically pull borrower’s income information each year, avoiding the hassle of needing to recertify their income annually and make it easier for borrowers to stay enrolled.\n\n\n\nPublic servants will also have an easier time claiming credits for time of service to go toward debt relief under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. The Department of Education has already made some temporary changes toward that end. To apply for forgiveness or payments to count toward forgiveness under the temporary changes, visit the PSLF Help Tool.\n\nA full list of proposed regulations will be published in the coming days on the Federal Register, and the public is invited to comment on the draft rule for 30 days.\n\nTRUE COST OF COLLEGE:It's not just tuition and fees: College students are facing increasingly high rent prices, too\n\nLIFE OFF PAUSE:How the student loan payment pause changed people’s lives\n\nWould Parents PLUS loans be forgiven?\n\nParent PLUS loans are federal student loans issued directly to parents with dependents in school, meant to supplement school, state and other federal financial aid offered for a dependent undergraduate student enrolled at least half-time.\n\nParent PLUS loans held by the Department of Education are included in the cancellation policy, along with federal graduate and undergraduate loans.\n\nWhat’s being done to keep the cost of college from spiraling?\n\nThe Department of Education will publish an annual watch list of programs with the worst debt levels in the country, so students registering for the next academic year can steer clear of programs with poor outcomes. It will also request plans from colleges with the most concerning debt outcomes on how they intend to lower debt levels.\n\nMedora Lee is a money, markets and personal finance reporter at USA TODAY.

During this time, interest stopped accumulating and collections on defaulted debt have been on hold.\n\nNow, as borrowers' fates hang in the balance, the President is set to spend several days on a long-awaited vacation. And the Biden administration has not sent any public signals to suggest they'll announce a student loan decision while he's away.\n\nStudent loan activists and advocates participated in a virtual meeting with White House officials earlier Thursday, according to a White House official, who said the session was held at the request of the groups.\n\nOfficials from the White House Domestic Policy Council, National Economic Council, Office of Public Engagement and Office of Political Strategy and Outreach were slated to attend. And Biden, who traveled to South Carolina to begin his vacation on Wednesday, did not participate in the meeting.\n\nPolitico was the first to report on the meeting.\n\nAs the payment pause deadline nears, Natalia Abrams, the president and founder of the Student Debt Crisis Center, called on the President to meet with borrowers.\n\n\"We've seen the same reports. ... The meeting states that it was with White House officials, organizations and advocates, but what we feel was missing is that we have yet to see the administration and President Biden have a meeting with borrowers themselves,\" Abrams said.\n\nBiden has already extended the pause four times and has repeatedly argued that it was necessary to allow borrowers to get back on their feet. In April -- when he last extended the repayment pause -- he said that though the economy had gained strength, the country was \"still recovering from the pandemic and the unprecedented economic disruption it caused.\"\n\nDemocratic lawmakers and advocates have been calling on Biden to broadly cancel up to $50,000 in student loan debt per borrower , but the President has said he would not consider that number.\n\nAlong with potentially extending the pause, the White House has suggested Biden is considering canceling $10,000 per borrower, excluding those who earn more than $125,000 a year.\n\n\"We haven't made a decision yet. ... The Department of Education will communicate directly with borrowers about the end of the payment pause when a decision is made,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Tuesday. \"When it comes to the cancellation ... the President understands firsthand the burden that a student loan has on families ... and so we're just going to continue to assess our options for cancellation.\"\n\nJean-Pierre emphasized that Biden will have something to announce \"before August 31.\"\n\nWith only three weeks until student loan servicers are scheduled to resume collecting federal student loan payments, Biden and his team are cutting it close. Normally, loan servicers send out billing statements at least 21 days before a payment is due, but those haven't gone out yet since Biden is still making up his mind.\n\n\"For many weeks, there's been no change in the guidance from the Department of Education. Servicers have been told to hold off on sending out any communication about the resumption of payments,\" said Scott Buchanan, executive director of the Student Loan Servicing Alliance, a nonprofit trade group whose members are responsible for servicing over 95% of all federal student loans.\n\nWhile Biden didn't announce a decision on student loans announced before he ditched Washington for the beaches of South Carolina on Wednesday, he's riding into his vacation on the headwinds of a few successful and chaotic weeks at the White House.\n\nOver the course of the last three weeks, Biden has dealt with a case of Covid-19 and a subsequent rebound, he signed into law two major bipartisan pieces of legislation, he gave the green light on the targeted killing of the man who succeeded Osama bin Laden as leader of al Qaeda, and the Senate managed to pass a slimmed down version of his landmark climate and health care bill.\n\nMeanwhile, despite concerns last month about the prospect of a recession, national unemployment numbers defied economists' expectations, gas prices have continued to go down in the last several weeks and heightened inflation eased in July . However, Americans are still paying more for everyday items like food, gas and vehicles than they're used to, leaving less room in their budgets.\n\nThe midterm elections are less than 100 days away, and CNN's latest data shows Biden's approval rating remains low.\n\nAmericans' attitudes toward student debt relief are sharply divided along partisan and generational lines.\n\nA majority of Democrats in a May CNN poll (56%) -- and an even wider majority of self-described liberals (69%) -- say the government is doing too little on student loan debt, according to the CNN poll, while only a third of Republicans and self-described conservatives alike say the same. Seventy percent of adults younger than 35 say the government is doing too little, a figure that drops to 50% among those in the 35-49 age bracket, and 35% among those age 50 or older.\n\nContinuing the forbearance or canceling debt could deliver financial relief to borrowers. But broad student loan forgiveness would also shift the cost -- likely hundreds of billions of dollars -- to taxpayers, including those who chose not to go to college or already paid for their education. Loan cancellation could also add to inflation while doing nothing to address the root of the problem: college affordability.\n\nAnd the President, so far, has failed to get most of his college affordability proposals approved by Congress. The latest iteration of his proposed social safety net bill, called the Inflation Reduction Act, was approved by the Senate this month and now heads to the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives for a vote. But the bill does not contain previously proposed provisions that would have lowered the cost of college.\n\nOutside of the payment pause and an executive action to broadly cancel student loan debt, there are several other ways many of the 43 million federal student loan borrowers may qualify for some student loan forgiveness. Targeted debt forgiveness programs already exist that help public sector workers and borrowers who were defrauded by their for-profit college, for example.", "authors": ["Maegan Vazquez", "Katie Lobosco"], "publish_date": "2022/08/11"}]}

But they rebounded after shutdowns lifted, and have roared back to set monthly records for much of the year.\n\nLast month, sales in both the Central Texas region and within Austin's city limits hit an all-time high for a November, indicating no sign of a typical season slowdown heading into the new year, according to new data from the Austin Board of Realtors.\n\nThroughout Central Texas, the supply of housing dropped to an all-time low, dipping below a one-month supply, meaning it would take just a month to deplete the supply of available homes at the current sales pace.

Our main challenge in this market is navigating the critically low levels of inventory. This near-zero level of housing inventory throughout the region is staggering, and it will put enormous pressure on home prices and the rental market,\" Romeo Manzanilla, president of the Austin Board of Realtors, said in a written statement.\n\nSales across the region were up 23.8% over November 2019, with 3,397 homes changing hands, the board said. Half of those homes sold for less than $365,000 and half sold for more, for a 19.7% increase in the median price. In November 2019, the median sales price was $305,000.\n\nWithin Austin's city limits, 1,105 homes were sold, a 28.2% increase over November 2019. The median sales price was $433,493, 10.1% higher than November 2019.\n\nLast year was the ninth year in a row in which both the number of home sales and the median price exceeded the previous year's highs, according to the board's figures.

This growth is not sustainable. The one variable that will hold the market back is the lack of inventory.”\n\nGrowth in the tech sector is a primary driver of jobs in the region.

Tesla is building a $1.1 billion plant off Texas 130 in East Austin that will manufacture And on Friday, Oracle, which is expanding its existing Lady Bird Lake waterfront campus just east of downtown Austin, announced it is moving its headquarters to Austin from California.\n\nWendi Slaton Anderson, principal broker with Roots Residential Group at Compass, said Austin attracts a diverse demographic.\n\n\"I am currently working with buyers from New York Chicago, California and Seattle,\" she said. \"I expect an additional influx of California buyers relocating to Austin with the recent announcement that the Oracle headquarters are heading our way.\"\n\nAnderson said the imbalance between the available inventory \"and the inordinate demand continues to put upward pressure on housing prices.\"\n\n\"Sheltering in place has likely created a lasting shift in buyers preferences, making it more challenging to meet their needs in the coming months,\" she said.\n\nAustin real estate broker Brad Pauly said the coronavirus pandemic \"has created the urgency of people who have been living in condos and apartments that more space is essential.\"\n\n\" A home office, a backyard, a private pool, these have been the most crucial needs for buyers,\" said Pauly, owner of Pauly Presley Realty.\n\nPauly, who has been working in the Austin real estate market for 21 years, said he's \"never seen the market this hot.\"\n\n\"Many new home builders don't have inventory to sell to buyers right now,\" Pauly said. \"Some buyers have started a lottery system just to give people the opportunity to buy.\"\n\nIn a recent report, Zillow said that nationwide, \"high demand continues to power the housing market into winter, and year-over-year list price growth is reaching new heights. Although the pace of houses going under contract is slowing, homes are selling much faster than last year at this time, and inventory continued its long contraction.\"\n\nZillow said the pandemic caused an \"unprecedented shift\" in the housing market. The rise of remote work opened up new housing options, sky-high demand drove the for-sale market to record highs, and technology changed the way people shopped for, bought, sold, rented and financed homes.\n\nIn the Austin region, list prices – after cooling in 2019 – soared in 2020, rising by more than $90,000 over the course of the year, Zillow said. Austin leads the nation in median list price growth, up 23.1% year over year to $446,642 in the week ending Dec. 5.\n\nDemand was still strong late in the year, with the median time on market dropping down to six or seven days every week from early October into November.\n\nAvailable housing inventory dropped compared to 2019 every week starting in early June, ending up falling 40.9% below last year’s figures the week ending Dec. 5.\n\nManzanilla said that, despite the local housing market's rapid recovery, \"last month's numbers should give us all pause.\"\n\n“Central Texans who could not find a property within Austin’s city limits have historically been able to expand their searches outward to find a home,\" Manzanilla said. \"But, when the entire region has virtually zero inventory, its leaders must think about how such a broad lack of housing will ultimately impact Austin’s suitability as a destination for businesses and economic growth.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/12/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/07/homes/mortgage-rates-july-7/index.html", "title": "Mortgage rates see largest decline since 2008 | CNN Business", "text": "Mortgage rates dropped for the second week in a row, notching the largest decline since December, 2008.\n\nThe 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 5.30% in the week ending July 7, down from 5.70% the week before, according to Freddie Mac.

The price on the Cedar Rapids land may have been boosted because it lies in the path of potential development, brokers have said.\n\nThe remaining 220 acres in the Sioux County sale drew $20,100 to $24,300 an acre.\n\n\"Northwest Iowa has been hitting $20,000 an acre-plus for several weeks in a row,\" said Jim Rothermich, vice president of Iowa Appraisal and Research Corp. in Des Moines. \"Today blew past all those auctions. Incredible market conditions.\"\n\nThe strong increases are due to good commodity prices, higher exports, better-than- expected crop yields and low interest rates, Zhang said. Corn prices for Iowa are 60% higher than a year ago, he said, and soybean prices are 32% higher.\n\nU.S. farm income is expected to grow to $116.8 billion by the end of 2021, the highest level since 2013. The higher crop and livestock receipts are expected to offset a decrease in government payments that helped farmers weather trade wars and COVID-19 supply-chain disruptions.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture said this month that it expects direct farm payments this year to total $27.2 billion, down 40% from a record $45.7 billion in 2020.\n\nZhang said all 99 Iowa counties showed a record nominal value. In 20 counties, the prices were all-time highs even after adjusting for inflation, he said.\n\nMORE: Competition is fierce for Iowa's used farm equipment, attracting bidders from across the world\n\nWhile lucrative for sellers, spiking farmland prices mean farmers who rent cropland can expect to see at least a 10% hike in costs in 2022, Zhang said.\n\nFarmers have been slammed with across-the-board price increases. A Purdue University survey in November shows 43% of farmers expect input prices to rise by more than 16% in the coming year.\n\nFarmers can expect just about everything they need to grow next year's crop — from fertilizer to seed to chemicals — to cost more, said Chad Hart, an ISU agricultural economist.\n\n\"My expectation is that we’ll see much higher costs in 2022,\" Hart said.\n\nLand values also are likely to continue to rise, Zhang said. Farmland brokers, appraisers and other professionals surveyed by ISU concurred.\n\nRoughly 70% of this year's buyers were new or existing farmers, with investors making up nearly 30% of the market.\n\nZellmer said the state has had a record number of farmland sales this year, with land owners trying to cash in on high prices as well as being concerned about possible changes in tax laws that would leave them with a big bill.\n\nSales could be slimmer in the first half of 2022, Zellmer said, but the reduced supplies would support continued higher prices.\n\nWhile farmers might be concerned about a return of the 1980s farm crisis, which followed rapidly increasing land prices, Hart said history shows that's unlikely.\n\nAfter the farmland spike that occurred from 2011 to 2013, Iowa's values declined very little in the years that followed, though farm income dropped. The largest decline happened in 2014, when values fell nearly 9% from their peak.\n\n\"When you think back to the late '70s and early '80s, land values were increasing, but farm income was actually declining,\" Hart said. \"This time, we have land values and farm income moving in the same direction.\"\n\nISU said Scott County, home of Davenport, reported the highest average value for the ninth consecutive year, rising 30% to $13,852 an acre. Decatur County, on the Missouri border, had the lowest value — though it was up sharply, rising 31.5% to $5,062 an acre.\n\nClayton and Allamakee counties in Iowa's northeast corner reported the largest percentage increase, 36.4%, while Scott County saw the largest dollar increase at $3,193 per acre, ISU reported.\n\nThe smallest percentage increase, 23.2%, was in Keokuk County, in southeast Iowa, while Taylor County, in southwest Iowa, saw the smallest dollar increase, $1,199 per acre.\n\nDonnelle Eller covers agriculture, the environment and energy for the Register.

This included residential and commercial uses, from small installations on private rooftops to large solar farms, the group said.\n\nFor companies in the renewable energy industry, that has created a major rush in sales — and an additional strain on supply chains.\n\nDemand for solar power was already on the rise in Europe's biggest economy, as energy prices surged, policy incentives were introduced and adoption of the technology became more mainstream. But more recently, consumers have also faced ever higher utility bills scorching temperatures , and renewed anxiety over whether they'll be able to keep the heat on this winter.\n\nSince it invaded Ukraine six months ago, Russia has sharply reduced its supply of gas to Germany and other EU countries. Just last week it announced an unscheduled closure of its Nord Stream 1 pipeline later this month for maintenance, sending spot natural gas prices to a new record high\n\nFor many households, the biggest fear is that Russia will turn off the tap completely this winter. The German government has already set in motion a crisis management plan that could see rationing to businesses if that happens.\n\n\"This [demand] has only gotten stronger with the war against Ukraine, which is happening on our doorstep,\" David Wedepohl, managing director of the German Solar Association told CNN Business.\n\n\"This is something that's very much on people's minds.\"\n\nGerman officials have responded to the crisis by calling on consumers to save energy. Some municipalities have already reacted by pulling back on basic needs such as lights, showers and heating\n\nJim Gordon, the CEO of Smartflower, said the geopolitical turmoil had also pushed more people to make the switch to solar. The company provides sunflower-shaped solar power devices to corporate campuses, universities and homes.\n\n\"Our business is booming because there's a perfect storm of elements converging that are really lifting solar energy,\" Gordon told CNN Business.\n\n\"People are concerned about energy security,\" he said. \"An autocratic dictator can turn the valve on a gas pipeline and shut off energy, but nobody can control the sun.\"\n\nSoaring sales\n\nSchneider Electric SBGSF , a European industrial and energy giant, says demand for its solar-powered heating systems in Germany have \"almost doubled\" so far this year compared to the same period in 2021.\n\nThe company's sustainability arm, which advises businesses on clean energy procurement, has also reached \"an all-time peak\" in consultancy requests, according to Konstantin Elstermann, the firm's vice president of home and distribution.\n\nSimilarly, Sonnen, a German solar battery provider, has seen its orders \"more than double in comparison to last year,\" because of an \"increased desire for [people] running their homes with renewable energy,\" said CEO Oliver Koch.\n\nIn a statement to CNN Business, Koch said his team had noted \"an additional uptick in demand since the end of February,\" when the war began, and was \"continuously expanding our production capacity to keep pace with demand.\"\n\nDemand is so high, Smartflower is now expecting to quadruple its sales in Germany this year, according to managing director Robert Sawyer.\n\n\"We've done more business in the first six months of 2022 in Germany than we did in all of 2021,\" Sawyer said, adding that sales in the country had doubled so far this year.\n\nA Smartflower installation. The maker of the solar power system says it has doubled its business in Germany so far this year, citing higher demand after the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nSupply chain hurdles\n\nSuch booms don't come without challenges, however.\n\nThe industry is currently facing severe labor shortages, said Elstermann from Schneider Electric.\n\n\"Some electricians are booked up three to six months in advance,\" he told CNN Business.\n\nAn autocratic dictator can turn the valve on a gas pipeline and shut off energy, but nobody can control the sun. Smartflower CEO Jim Gordon\n\n\"This bottleneck almost surpasses the current shortage of raw materials and production capacity. We know that the supply problems due to the pandemic are temporary, but the shortage of skilled workers remains,\" Elstermann said.\n\nWedepohl said the industry was racing to address the problem. Many electricians who left their jobs over the past decade have been \"reentering\" the market, while roofers are also being called on to help with installations, he added.\n\n\"A lot of installers are out there putting out extra shifts, training people, bringing new people on,\" he said. \"It is a challenge, but it is definitely a moment that we hope we can rise to.\"\n\nThe sustainability question\n\nFor now, Germany has resorted to firing up its coal power plants to reduce its gas consumption — and ensure the country keeps the lights on.\n\nBut Chancellor Olaf Scholz has made it clear the government isn't happy about it.\n\n\"It is bitter that we now have to temporarily use some power plants that we had already shut down because of Russia's brutal attack on Ukraine. But it's only for a little while,\" he said in a message last month.\n\nSimilar conversations are taking place across Europe.\n\nThis year, the United Kingdom also announced a push for other power sources, including wind and nuclear energy. And for some consumers, alternatives to gas heating, such as wood-burning fireplaces, have become more popular.\n\nThis month, Austrian climate minister Leonore Gewessler called for more green energy projects to help the country wean itself off Russian gas.\n\n\"We need to get ourselves off this dependence — cubic meter per cubic meter, windmill per windmill, PV installation per PV installation,\" she told CNN's Sara Sidner , referring to the units used in building solar and wind energy capacity.\n\n\"Because we see that our dependency on fossil fuels is used as a weapon in a war,\" Gewessler said.\n\n\"Winter is coming,\" said Wedepohl, noting that most homes in Germany were heated with gas. \"Europeans ... are also in this pretty collectively.\"\n\n— CNN's Chris Liakos and AJ Davis contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Michelle Toh", "Cnn Business", "Smartflower Ceo Jim Gordon"], "publish_date": "2022/08/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/20/business/nightcap-housing-market-europe-gas/index.html", "title": "The US housing market just entered an awkward phase - CNN", "text": "This story is part of CNN Business' Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free, here.\n\nAll right, Jay Powell, part of your plan seems to be working: Fewer people are buying homes. But that's not translating to lower prices — at least not yet.\n\nHere's the deal: Once again, for the gazillionth month in a row, home prices in America hit an all-time high. The median price was $416,000 in June, up 13.4% the same month last year, my colleague Anna Bahney reports . That's ... bananas.\n\nAt the same time, sales fell for the fifth month in a row, down some 14% from a year ago.\n\nNow, in simple economics (the only kind I know), when prices get too high, that should soften demand — which should in turn force prices down. But that takes time, especially when the market is as white-hot as it's been for the past two years.\n\nRight now, it's an awkward moment when neither buyers nor sellers are all that happy.\n\nThere are a few reasons for that:\n\nMortgage rates are double what they were a year ago. The standard 30-year fixed-rate mortgage stood at 5.5% this week, up from 2.8% a year ago. Naturally, that's spurring potential buyers to hold off and hope for a better deal.\n\nInventory has improved slightly but remains historically tight. Home builders are slowing construction on new homes, understandably wary of getting caught with a glut if a recession comes along and craters demand.\n\nSellers, meanwhile, may have gotten too greedy. Think about it: How many neighbors or acquaintances do you know who've sold their house for twice what they paid for it, within days of listing? That's the sellers' market everyone's come to expect.\n\nKey quote: \"Buyers can't figure out what is the right price,\" Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, told the Wall Street Journal. \"Sellers are very reluctant to give up\" on the price they expected to sell for a few months ago.\n\nSales are likely to keep falling as buyers get priced out by mortgage rates, which are influenced by the Federal Reserve's key interest rate policies. And the Fed is all but guaranteed to keep raising rates aggressively until this historically high inflation reverses course. (Tune in next Wednesday when we see what Jay Powell and his merry band of nerds has in store for us this time...)\n\nDespite that overall sales decline, certain markets are still bumpin'. Miami, for example, saw median home prices rise 40% from a year ago. (Orlando and Nashville homes were up nearly 31%.)\n\nBOTTOM LINE\n\n\"A combination of higher prices and higher mortgage rates clearly has shifted the dynamics in the housing market,\" said Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist. \"Even people who want to buy are simply priced out.\"\n\nEven though home sales have slowed back to a 2019 pace, the market remains head-scratchingly brisk. The number of days a property is on the market before going into contract is the swiftest ever, at 14 days. (A year ago it was 17 days, and a more typical market would see properties on the market for close to 30 days.)\n\n\"Maybe buyers are trying to take advantage of a lower locked-in rate...They want to sign the contract and close the deal quickly,\" Yun said.\n\nBut sellers should take note: This brisk time on the market is not likely to last, Yun said.\n\nNUMBER OF THE DAY: 98%\n\nMacao's casinos are hemorrhaging cash under China's strict Covid-19 lockdown orders. The former Portuguese colony-turned-gambling mecca was already hamstrung by the drop in travel during the pandemic, and now analysts are predicting things are about to go from bad to worse. Gross gambling revenue is expected to fall 98% this month compared with July 2019 — and that's assuming casinos reopen next week.\n\nRATIONING BEGINS\n\nTemperatures are scorching across Europe, but leaders are already planning for what may be a long, painful winter.\n\nHere's the deal: The European Union unveiled its emergency gas rationing plan on Wednesday, urging its 27 member states to curb gas demand by 15% and push manufacturers to adopt alternative energy sources.\n\nThis is the rationing moment many Europeans feared would result from Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February.\n\nWhy now?\n\nA key natural gas pipeline linking Russia to Germany has been shut down for the past 10 days for routine maintenance. And there's a decent chance, according to European officials, the Russian state-owned gas company will simply refuse to resume deliveries tomorrow when the maintenance is supposed to wrap up.\n\n\"Russia is blackmailing us. Russia is using energy as a weapon,\" said EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.\n\nThat pipeline, called Nord Stream 1, is a vital artery linking Russia's gas reserves to Europe via Germany. It delivers nearly 40% of the bloc's total pipeline imports from Russia, my colleague Anna Cooban writes\n\nAlready, Russia has shown it is willing to weaponize its energy supplies, cutting off some countries because they refused to pay their bills in rubles (which would violate European sanctions). And last month, Russia cut flows through the pipeline by 60%, blaming the West's sanctions.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin said this week that Russia would \"fulfill all of its obligations\" in supplying gas to Europe. But, like, it's Putin — no one knows what to actually expect.\n\nThat uncertainty is a big part of the problem for Europe's economy.\n\nSee here:\n\nFears of energy supply disruptions have pushed benchmark gas prices up by about 85% since the invasion of Ukraine, according to the Intercontinental Exchange.\n\nOn Wednesday, prices rose 5% to as the deadline for the pipeline's reopening inched closer.\n\nLike the United States and other developed economies, Europe is dealing with soaring inflation. And political upheaval. And climate change. And a discernible shift in the direction of the economic rebound.\n\nA European recession isn't a given. But \"a sharp downturn in growth is 100% sure,\" my colleague Julia Horowitz writes.\n\n\n\nBOTTOM LINE\n\nEnergy officials say Europe must find ways to save 12 billion cubic meters of gas — equal to about 3% of its annual consumption — over the next 12 weeks to avert disaster.\n\n\"This is a big ask, but it does not exaggerate the scale of what is needed,\" said Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, earlier this week.\n\n\"It is categorically not enough to just rely on gas from non-Russian sources — these supplies are simply not available in the volumes required to substitute for missing deliveries from Russia,\" he added.", "authors": ["Analysis Allison Morrow"], "publish_date": "2022/07/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2021/05/29/fact-check-online-post-misses-mark-gas-prices-jobs-inflation/7466921002/", "title": "Fact check: Online post misses the mark on gas prices, job growth ...", "text": "The claim: Gas prices are the highest in 10 years, job growth is the worst in 20 years, inflation is the highest in 30 years and illegal immigration is at its highest level in 40 years\n\nThe U.S. continues to crawl out from under the COVID-19 pandemic, but a widely shared Facebook post misses the mark on several indicators about the state of the country.\n\n“Gas prices highest in a decade. Worst jobs report in 2 decades. Highest inflation in 3 decades. Highest increase in illegal immigration in 4 decades,” according to the May 17 post that has been shared more than 1,400 times. “Y’all killed it with your emotional voting skills!”\n\nA picture of a tuxedo-clad Bugs Bunny stares, unamused, at the reader.\n\nGas prices and inflation indeed are rising, and the April jobs report missed economists' expectations. More migrants have tried to enter the United States in the last several months as well.\n\nBut the post is wrong at almost every turn. Gas prices are not their highest of the decade. Job gains in April were far from the worst of the last 20 years, too; the U.S. lost more than 20 million jobs in April 2020 alone. Inflation was higher at the start of the Great Recession.\n\nIllegal immigration is more complicated to track, but apprehensions along the southwest border haven’t yet reached a 40-year record.\n\nFact check:Meme miscaptions image from Beirut port explosion as part of conflict in Middle East\n\nThe Facebook user who shared the post did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nGas prices\n\nThe national average price for a gallon of regular gas was about $3.03 on May 26, according to GasBuddy and the AAA auto club.\n\nGas prices haven’t been that high since 2014, but they aren’t the highest in a decade – making this part of the claim FALSE.\n\nThe last time the national average gas price was that high was Oct. 28, 2014, according to daily price data provided by AAA to USA TODAY. Prices were above $3 a gallon every day for nearly 2.5 years beginning on May 26, 2012.\n\nSince the end of October 2014, the price of a gallon of gas hadn’t hit $3 until May 12, but it already was on the rise after sinking during the COVID-19 pandemic as fewer people commuted to work and school and scrapped travel plans.\n\nAAA and Gasbuddy both expected $3 gas in 2021, but AAA spokeswoman Jeannette Casselano said it arrived earlier than anticipated because of the Colonial Pipeline’s temporary shutdown following a ransomware attack.\n\nFact check:Colonial Pipeline gas shortage was result of cyberattack by hackers\n\nPart of the reason for the increase is higher demand. AAA expects the number of travelers driving for the Memorial Day weekend to approach pre-pandemic levels, Casselano said. The price of oil also factors into the cost of gas.\n\nJobs report\n\nThe jobs report was not the worst of the last two decades– so this part of the claim is FALSE.\n\nIn May, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released an April jobs report that showed non-farm employment had increased from the previous month by 266,000 to about 144.3 million jobs.\n\nIt wasn’t the worst jobs report of the last 12 months, let alone the last 20 years. The U.S. lost more than 20 million jobs in April 2020 as the economy cratered under the weight of lockdowns at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFact check:Unemployment rate hit historic high, not low, during pandemic\n\nSince 2000, the economy has added fewer than 266,000 jobs 15 times in April. It hasn’t posted a better jobs report in April since 2015, according to a USA TODAY analysis of BLS data.\n\nThe April jobs report missed some economists' expectations for about 1 million jobs to be added in April. Oxford Economics called the miss “one of the largest on record.”\n\nInflation\n\nInflation is not the highest in three decades, as the post claims.\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics measures inflation in day-to-day living expenses using the Consumer Price Index, which calculates the prices urban consumers pay for a basket of goods and services. It collects prices in 75 urban areas from about 6,000 housing units and 22,000 retail establishments.\n\nIn April, the index rose 4.2% over the previous year, meaning the cost of living expenses increased by 4.2% over the last 12 months.\n\nThe increase in April was the highest inflation since September 2008, though, not the last 30 years– making this part of the claim FALSE.\n\nInflation in September 2008 was 4.9%, according to BLS.\n\nInflation was 4.2% or higher in 11 different months since April 2001, the earliest data available from BLS.\n\nImmigration\n\nMigrant encounters have increased since the start of 2021 along the U.S.-Mexico border. However, assessing whether it is the “highest increase in illegal immigration in four decades” is difficult. We conclude, therefore, that this part of the claim is MISSING CONTEXT, because without additional information it could be misleading.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection reported encountering about 178,000 people attempting to enter the country on the southwest border in April, up from about 173,000 in March and 101,000 in February.\n\nThe surge followed a steady uptick since the start of the pandemic. In April 2020, migrant encounters on the southwest border dropped to about 17,000, according to the agency, but have increased every month.\n\nIn March 2020, the Trump administration began using a policy called Title 42, which allows expulsion of undocumented migrants to prevent COVID-19 from spreading in holding facilities. While President Joe Biden has sought to unwind Trump-era immigration policies, his administration has continued to use Title 42.\n\nMore:Joe Biden’s immigration agenda overshadowed by migrant challenges in first 100 days\n\nThat policy accounts for most of the recent encounters Customs and Border Patrol has reported. In April, about 63% of the agency’s encounters on the southwest border were logged under Title 42.\n\nThe addition of Title 42 expulsions makes comparing historical data about southern border crossings difficult.\n\nCustoms and Border Patrol historical data on southwest border apprehensions, done under a separate legal authority called Title 8, show a peak of more than 1.6 million from October 1999 to September 2000, the agency’s fiscal year.\n\nSince October 2020, the start of the current fiscal year, the agency has reported 749,613 total encounters, which includes Title 8 apprehensions and inadmissible individuals and Title 42 expulsions. Apprehensions accounted for 188,191 of that total.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security estimates about 11.4 million unauthorized immigrants lived in the U.S. in 2018, the most recent year for which its data are available. The unauthorized immigrant population hovered between 10.5 million and 12 million from 2005 to 2018, according to the department’s January 2021 report.\n\nOur rating: False\n\nOverall, the claim that gas prices are the highest in 10 years, job growth is the worst in 20 years, inflation is at its highest level in 30 years and illegal immigration has increased to it highest level in 40 years is FALSE. Gas prices were higher in 2014. The U.S. lost more than 20 million jobs in April 2020. Inflation was higher in 2008 than it is now. Encounters along the southern border have been increasing over the last year, but data for the full fiscal year are not yet available. The addition of Title 42 expulsions also complicates historical comparisons of apprehensions on the southwest border.\n\nOur fact-check sources:\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

More than 4,000 flights were delayed or canceled Christmas Day as days of scheduling nightmares left holiday travelers scrambling.\n\nDelta, United and JetBlue have blamed the omicron variant for staffing problems that led to flight cancellations. “This was unexpected,” United spokesperson Maddie King said of omicron’s impact on staffing.\n\nFlight delays and cancellations have been a recurring theme this year as airlines have ramped up schedules. Thousands of workers were driven from the industry last year when air travel collapsed, and staffing has not kept up with the resurgence in demand.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease doctor, said Sunday on ABC's \"This Week\" he supports a vaccine mandate for domestic air travel. But, he said, wearing a mask with proper filtration should keep air travelers reasonably safe.\n\nSuch a mandate would be another \"mechanism that would spur them to get vaccinated,\" he said. \"Anything that could get people more vaccinated would be welcome.\"\n\nMany U.S. airlines require their employees to be fully vaccinated, sparking controversy among some staff, but it's not yet required of most domestic passengers. International travelers entering the United States must show proof of a negative COVID-19 test within a day of their departure.\n\nAlso in the news:\n\n► Even with testing and reporting interrupted by the Christmas holiday, the United States' case counts grew – 1.29 million in a week, or an average of about 184,000 per day, Johns Hopkins University data shows. Hospitalizations were up and deaths rose slightly, to an average of over 1,300 per day.\n\n► Vice President Kamala Harris declined to blame the unvaccinated for the latest surge. \"But it is clear that everyone has the ability to make a choice to save their lives and to prevent hospitalization if they get vaccinated and if they get the booster,\" she said on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\"\n\n► Mastercard SpendingPulse reported Sunday that U.S. holiday sales rose 8.5% from a year earlier, the biggest annual gain in 17 years. The results cover Nov. 1 through Dec. 24.\n\n► Vermont Everyone Eats, a food assistance program helping state residents, restaurants and farmers get through the pandemic, has been extended through April 1.\n\n► France has recorded more than 100,000 virus infections in a single day for the first time since the pandemic struck. COVID-19 hospitalizations have doubled over the past month.\n\n► More than 160 nonprofits in Rhode Island are sharing $5.4 million in federal coronavirus relief funding for housing, behavioral health services, health care, job training, food pantries and child care for those hardest hit by the pandemic.\n\n📈Today's numbers: The U.S. has recorded more than 52 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and more than 816,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data. Global totals: More than 279.9 million cases and 5.3 million deaths. More than 204 million Americans – 61.7% – are fully vaccinated, according to the CDC.\n\n📘 What we're reading: The omicron variant has thrown America's great return to the office into disarray, perhaps for months. Many companies who had notified employees they would need to come back to the office at least part-time early next year have pushed back those plans or are considering doing so.

Hawaii's are up 44%.\n\nAnd in Louisiana, COVID-19 hospitalizations doubled in the last week. The Louisiana Department of Health said 449 people are hospitalized with COVID-19 as of Sunday. That's the highest since mid-October, which at the time was the state's worst surge.\n\nStatewide, 80% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are not fully vaccinated, the health department reported.\n\nBut the wave is moving unevenly across the country. Nearly half of the states report lower COVID-19 admissions and fewer people in ICU beds.\n\nFauci expects daily infections to rise 'much higher'\n\nThe \"extraordinarily contagious\" omicron variant will continue to drive daily coronavirus infections higher across the nation, Dr. Anthony Fauci said Sunday.\n\n\"Every day it goes up and up. The last weekly average was about 150,000 (per day) and it likely will go much higher,\" Fauci said on ABC's \"This Week.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden's chief medical adviser warned that while studies show omicron is less severe in terms of hospitalizations, more cases still could overwhelm hospitals. He defended the administration's efforts to provide more tests amid a shortage, and said he wished he had thought about ordering 500 million at-home tests two months ago.\n\n\"I think things will improve greatly as we get into January,\" he said. \"But that doesn't help us today and tomorrow.\"\n\nFenway Bowl, Military Bowl shelved as surge cripples college football\n\nThe Fenway Bowl and the Military Bowl were canceled due to the pandemic on Sunday as coronavirus outbreaks at the University of Virginia and Boston College forced the schools to call off postseason plans. The game, scheduled Wednesday at Fenway Park in Boston, was to pit the Cavaliers against Southern Methodist University. The Military Bowl, scheduled Monday in Annapolis, Maryland, between Boston College and East Carolina University, was canceled because of positive COVID-19 tests at BC.\n\n“This is not the way we wanted to see this season come to an end,” BC coach Jeff Hafley said. “We just do not have enough players to safely play a game.\"\n\nThe Hawaii Bowl was canceled last week after Hawaii withdrew from the game against the University of Memphis. And Rutgers will replace Texas A&M in the Gator Bowl against Wake Forest on New Year’s Eve after the Aggies pulled out because of a lack of available players.\n\nFlorida sets infection records two days in a row\n\nFlorida hit a record in the pandemic for the second day in a row, with 32,850 new cases reported Saturday. The 31,758 cases reported Friday had broken the state's previous record of more than 27,000, set in August during the height of the delta wave. The current surge is driven by the highly contagious omicron variant, public health experts say.\n\nThe swelling number of cases increased demand for COVID-19 tests, even on Christmas Day. Hours before a testing site opened at Tropical Park in Miami, dozens of cars lined up outside the entrance. The testing site was open from mid-morning to mid-afternoon; two other sites in Miami-Dade County were open on Christmas Day.\n\nNBA urges booster shots for players\n\nThe NBA’s Christmas message to its teams was a refrain it has been using for weeks: Get boosted.\n\nWith the number of players on the league’s health and safety protocols list hovering around 100 – and with Chicago coach Billy Donovan now dealing with those protocols as well, calling into question his availability for the next few Bulls games – the league and the National Basketball Players Association continue to hammer home the importance of booster shots.\n\nBy Dec. 31, every NBA team must arrange a booster-shot event for players, staff and family members, the latest mandate from the league in its quest to get its skyrocketing infections under control. The NBA has told teams its data shows that boosters substantially reduce a person’s risk of being infected, but one out of every three players hasn't gotten a booster shot. About 97% of the league is vaccinated.\n\nThat comes as the league’s Jan. 5 booster mandate looms for all eligible scorer’s table personnel, team attendants and other staff who interact in person with players or referees. In almost all cases, if people in those positions don’t have boosters by Jan. 5, they won’t be allowed to continue in those jobs.\n\nPositive COVID test? Here’s what to do.\n\nTesting positive for COVID-19 starts a confusing, disruptive and at times frightening process – one that millions of Americans will likely go through in the coming weeks as the omicron variant rapidly spreads this holiday season.\n\nFirst, you need to isolate. That’s a more intense version of quarantining – it means cutting off contact with other people as much as possible so you reduce the chance of infecting them. This also means forgoing travel, not going to work and even limiting contact with people in your own household who aren't infected.\n\nThe CDC says isolating is a necessary step whether you’re vaccinated or unvaccinated, and whether you have symptoms or feel fine.\n\nEveryone who tests positive for COVID-19 should monitor their symptoms. And people who are unvaccinated or at high risk for severe disease should be extra vigilant for symptoms that might require emergency care. Call your doctor for early treatment options.\n\nHow long should you isolate? How long will I be contagious? What if you are a close contact with someone who tested positive? Here’s what you should know about omicron and COVID this holiday season.\n\nContributing: Mike Stucka, USA TODAY; Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/12/26"}]}

This increases the risk of fire while the vehicles are being driven or are parked.\n\nAffected are certain Kia Sportage SUVs from 2014 through 2016, and the 2016 through 2018 K900 sedan.

At the time, NHTSA had received 161 complaints of engine fires, some of which occurred in vehicles that had already been recalled.\n\nThe first recall from the companies related to engine failures and fires reaches to September 2015. Since then they have issued at least eight more recalls for a host of engine problems, according to NHTSA documents.\n\nThe agency said it’s evaluating whether previous recalls covered enough vehicles. It also will monitor the effectiveness of previous recalls “as well as the long-term viability of related programs and non-safety field actions being conducted by Hyundai and Kia.\"\n\nAt the time, the automakers said they have undertaken numerous recalls to address engine issues, including recalls, new engine monitoring technology and providing extended warranties.\n\nMichael Brooks, chief counsel for the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety, said the recalls Tuesday are different from the engine failure problem that caused most of the previous Hyundai-Kia fire recalls. “Although NHTSA has the authority to order a recall and potentially a buyback of all affected vehicles, the separate fire defects that have plagued millions of Hyundai vehicles across multiple model years makes this a very difficult task,\" he said.\n\nIn November of 2020, NHTSA announced that Kia and Hyundai must pay $137 million in fines and for safety improvements because they moved too slowly to recall more than 1 million vehicles with engines that can fail. The fines resolved a previous probe into the companies’ behavior involving recalls of multiple models dating to the 2011 model year.\n\nKia was to pay $27 million and invest $16 million in safety performance measures. Another $27 million payment will be deferred as long as Kia meets safety conditions, NHTSA said.\n\nKia denied the U.S. allegations but said it wanted to avoid a protracted legal fight.\n\nData collected by the Center for Auto Safety show more than 30 U.S. fire and engine-related recalls from Hyundai and Kia since 2015. The recalls involve more than 20 models from the 2006 through 2021 model years totaling over 8.4 million vehicles.\n\nMany of the recalls involved manufacturing defects that stopped oil from flowing through the engine block. Many involved expensive engine replacements.\n\nHyundai and Kia also did a U.S. “product improvement campaign” covering 3.7 million vehicles to install software that will alert drivers of possible engine failures.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/02/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2022/05/26/jeep-ford-hyundai-mercedes-kia-recalls/65357593007/", "title": "Ford, Jeep, Hyundai among vehicle recalls this week", "text": "National Highway Traffic & Safety Administration\n\nThe U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has listed recalls for May 19-26, including a Ford recall involving 310,203 F Series trucks and a Hyundai recall involving 239,000 cars.

The financial fallout of playing a season during the COVID-19 pandemic was expected to be steep and the variables were seemingly endless.\n\nWould fans be able to attend games? And at what capacity could Michigan Stadium be filled? The answer to each question, and several others, would have a corresponding impact on how much money the department bled. At worst, the Wolverines' share of Big Ten Network's media rights deal — a whopping $55 million in 2019 — could help keep the department stable.\n\nSo, as Michigan athletic director Warde Manuel presented in June his annual budget to the university's board of regents for the 2021 fiscal year, he did it preparing for something short of the worst: a $26.1 million deficit for the department.\n\nAnd that was before the Big Ten postponed the cash cow that is college football.\n\nThree months later, Michigan is in fact bracing for the unknown in the wake of the conference's decision to indefinitely delay fall sports because of the novel coronavirus.\n\n\"The reality is that our immediate decrease in resources threatens the support we are able to offer our student-athletes for the foreseeable future,\" Manuel wrote in a letter to season-ticket holders Aug. 6.\n\nA Michigan football operation that generated a $74.8 million surplus during the 2019 fiscal year — the most recent year of NCAA records available — has been dammed by a financial situation shrouded in historic uncertainty. A department-wide revenue stream approaching $200 million is now expected to be slashed in half in what easily could be the most significant financial fallout in the department's history, according to information compiled by USA TODAY Sports in partnership with Syracuse University’s S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications.\n\n\"The impact is upwards of almost half our budget,\" Manuel estimated recently, during an appearance on Jon Jansen's \"Conqu'ring Heroes\" podcast. \"About $100 million.\"\n\nAnd the Wolverines aren't alone. Without college football, the state of Michigan's five FBS athletic departments will swallow millions of dollars — with the two Big Ten programs, Michigan and Michigan State, slated to lose the most.\n\n'A lot of turbulence'\n\nAthletic departments nationwide experienced spikes in football revenue in the years before the pandemic, and Michigan was no exception. The Wolverines topped $100 million during the 2017 fiscal year, and the number jumped to more than $120 million in 2018 and 2019.\n\nTo provide a sense of how important football is to the financial health of the department, Michigan generated $122.3 million in total football revenue during the 2019 fiscal year, or nearly 62% of the $197.8 million the athletic department raked in for games played from the fall of 2018 through the spring of 2019. With expenses approaching $191 million, the department operated at a surplus of nearly $6.9 million after the football team played a 12-game regular season and reached the Peach Bowl.\n\nWhen Manuel presented his budget June 25, he was forced to guess what football might look like in the fall. At the time, the COVID-19 outbreak was stabilizing in Michigan, and there was hope that not only would a season be played, but a reduced number of fans could attend games at Michigan Stadium, the largest college venue in the nation.\n\nManuel figured the department would lose 50% of ticket sales among all sports, with football delivering the brunt of the hit. He figured the department would also lose $17 million in preferred seat contributions — the donor gifts that go to the department when season tickets are purchased. And he factored in the uncertainty of conference contributions and TV revenue, among other things.\n\n“There is still a lot of turbulence about what is going to happen,\" Manuel said as he presented his budget. \"We don’t really know. We have multiple models, although I am presenting one to you. But we will adjust accordingly and move forward.”\n\nMoney to be made\n\nThe Big Ten, as of now, isn't expected to play football this fall. But even if it does and the conference implements a 10-game conference-only schedule — as it had planned to do beginning Sept. 5 — there are any number of other factors that could impact the deficit Manuel outlined.\n\nIf no games are played this fiscal year, the fallout could be catastrophic. But with college football already being played in other sections of the country — particularly the ACC, Big 12 and SEC — and with the Big Ten's medical subcommittee set to present options for a a safe return this fall, according to ESPN, the better bet is for competition to resume in some capacity.\n\nWhich means there's money to be made.\n\nMichigan and Michigan State each earned just north of $34.9 million in media rights for football during the 2019 fiscal year, which covers the 2018 season.\n\nThe payout in large part is based on the number of total home games played in the conference in a given year.\n\nWhile the formula for payouts could be altered based on how TV networks value the addition of a 10th conference game (the Big Ten traditionally has played nine) and the timing of the games in general, it's reasonable to assume most of the media rights money can be salvaged.\n\nIn fact, a conservative estimate conducted by USA TODAY Sports and shown to the Chicago-based analytics firm, Navigate, shows the potential for conference schools to earn nearly $30 million in football media rights during a 10-game conference-only schedule this season — a 15% monetary decline that would correspond directly with fewer home games being played this season (70) than in 2018 (82).\n\n\"If they play in spring, there are reasons there could be a dip in ratings,\" Matt Balvanz, Navigate’s Senior Vice President of Analytics, told the Free Press. \"But there are reasons to be optimistic for college football after a long layoff.\n\n\"We've seen both sides since sports have come back. When NASCAR returned, ratings were initially high, but now they’ve dipped. In the NBA, we've seen the same thing. It’s really a mixed bag.\"\n\nNeither the NBA, NHL nor Major League Baseball has allowed fans to attend games since resuming competition. And while the NFL season opened Thursday with a limited number of fans (15,895) in Kansas City, the Detroit Lions aren't planning for fans until at least November.\n\nStill, while it's hard to say how much TV advertisers will value a spring Big Ten season, the NFL's fan experiment could be a beta test for Michigan and Michigan State hosting fans whenever Big Ten football finally does kick off.\n\nMichigan raked in $46.3 million in football ticket revenue during a seven-game home slate in the 2019 fiscal year. If Michigan were to fill Michigan Stadium to 20% capacity — as Kansas City did with Arrowhead Stadium on Thursday night — then it's conceivable U-M could recoup $6.6 million or more in ticket sales, assuming ticket prices from the 2019 fiscal year stay relatively the same.\n\nIn either case, when considering the uncertainty of TV revenue, ticket sales and other factors, it's easy to understand how Manuel was able to project the first deficit for Michigan in the history of USA Today's financial database, which lists expenses and revenues dating to 2005.\n\n\"There remain many unknowns in the event of a canceled 2020-21 athletic season (all sports),\" said associate athletic director Kurt Svoboda. \"In our last fiscal year, 2020, spectator admissions to athletic events totaled $56.6 million. That figure could theoretically go to zero without our hosting any events.\n\n\"That figure could also be more or less, depending on what ticket holders and donors choose to do with their existing tickets and personal seat contributions (we have several options for people to consider).\"\n\nMoney to be saved\n\nManuel's deficit accounted for significant losses, but it didn't account for the millions Michigan would spend in COVID-19 testing.\n\nAlready, U-M has administered nearly 4,600 tests to athletes and staff members, at a cost of about $75 per test. And the frequency isn't expected to slow down as teams on campus continue working out and eventually return to competition.\n\nIn addition, the NCAA has extended the eligibility for fall and spring athletes, meaning those who were unable to compete because of COVID-19-related cancellations can return for another season. The fallout could force Michigan — and Michigan State, for that matter — to shell out significantly more in scholarship dollars in the coming years.\n\nTo offset the rising costs, Michigan already has begun looking for ways to save.\n\nMichigan football coach Jim Harbaugh — along with basketball coach Juwan Howard and other head coaches employed by the school — accepted 10% salary reductions through the end of the fiscal year. U-M also announced Sept. 1 that it had laid off 21 employees within the department, and more cost-saving measures are likely to come as the conference determines the fate of the football season.\n\nIn addition, Manuel has implored football season-ticket holders to either convert their preferred seat contribution or season-ticket payment to a tax-deductible gift or to roll the payments forward to another year. Michigan is offering benefits to those who donate.\n\nIn the letter he sent to season-ticket holders Aug. 6, he said he was budgeting for a $61 million decrease in revenue for 2021 and said the number could double if no sports are played.\n\n\"Given the anticipated loss of revenue due to limited or no fans at our games,\" Manuel wrote, \"our department faces an unparalleled level of financial uncertainty.\n\n\"Without additional resources, the level of investment in our programs will have to be reduced even further.\"\n\nMore:Jim Harbaugh's Michigan football pay cut restores balance after 10% raise\n\nThe road ahead\n\nMichigan is not alone in its budget tightrope.\n\nThe fallout is expected to be nearly as significant for Michigan State after its football program generated $80 million in revenue for 2019 — or 57% of all athletic department revenue.\n\n“At this point, we have modeled some fairly severe budget reductions, that probably if we don’t play football, we would not be playing most other, maybe all other, sports,” MSU athletic director Bill Beekman told the Economic Club of the Lansing Regional Chamber of Commerce in August.\n\nLike Michigan, MSU has cut salaries for coaches and athletic department personnel. And so have Mid-American Conference programs such as Central Michigan, Eastern Michigan and Western Michigan.\n\nThose three schools already are dealing with the loss of millions in game guarantee payments — the money schools receive from playing nonconference matchups on the road — after programs around the country shifted to mostly conference-only football schedules or canceled their seasons.\n\nAnd CMU has cut its track and field programs during the pandemic, a move that forced it to ask the NCAA for a waiver just to remain in the FBS, the highest level of college football.\n\nThe fallout likely won't stop there.\n\nIt could continue into the winter months.\n\nAnd for Manuel and Michigan, what happens during that time period will determine just how steep the deficit actually will be.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports' Steve Berkowitz and Craig Lyons contributed to this report.\n\nContact Orion Sang: osang@freepress.com.

The rates have been similar for the 17 Korn Ferry Tour and 10 PGA Tour Champions events through this week.\n\nThe three Tours combined to play 53 events since golf resumed on June 8. None were delayed because of the coronavirus. The 19 PGA Tour players and caddies who tested positive were fewer than a recent outbreak on one NFL team, the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nThe Tour has a \"bubble,\" but unlike the NBA, where players were sequestered at Disney World and all of the games played there, it's largely dependent on personal responsibility as the Tour has hop-scotched through 14 states, plus Mexico, Bermuda and the Dominican Republic.\n\nAn aspect of PGA Tour culture had to be factored in: players are independent contractors, not members of a team beholden to a coach, general manager, or owner. They play wherever they please.\n\nThe Tour set up charter flights and designated hotels for Tour players and caddies to stay to minimize contact in public. Going out to dinner or otherwise being out and about was discouraged. Testing was required to get onto charter flights and to be on the grounds of next week's tournament.\n\nPlayers had to get used to room service meals (some rented houses and hired chefs for the week), couldn't work out at hotel or resort facilities and until late in the season, couldn't have their wives, girlfriends or other family members attend tournaments.\n\n\"It's amazing,\" said Davis Love III of St. Simons Island, Ga., the host for the RSM Classic at the Sea Island Club. \"Our game changes every week; we go to a new city, new rules, new challenges. It just gets harder and harder, not easier and easier.\"\n\nLove said it wasn't just players, caddies, PGA Tour and tournament staff that had to exhibit responsible behavior to keep the Tour going. Each event still needed dozens of volunteers for scoring, player hospitality, course preparation and other on-site duties such as parking.\n\n\"If our volunteers didn't buy in, get tested, follow protocols ... it's twice, three times as much work for our volunteers now,\" Love said. \"Everything is more difficult to put on these tournaments. So it really is amazing.\"\n\nWhile the Tour has released the names of the players and caddies who tested positive (world No. 1-ranked Dustin Johnson and Adam Scott were the two biggest names to miss events), it has been quick to add that those are only for \"in-market tests.\" It's unknown how many might have tested positive during a break from playing.\n\nHowever, it's clear if they did, they stayed away until they were no longer contagious.\n\nPro-ams resumed, some fans allowed\n\nThere have been scattered attempts at normalcy. A limited number of fans were allowed at Bermuda and Houston, the first time fans were allowed to watch a competition PGA Tour round since March 12 at The Players.\n\nThe Tour resumed pro-ams, an important function of the charity dollars each event can contribute, at the Corales Punta Cana Dominican Championship in late September.\n\nThe Tour is off until the Sentry Tournament of Champions on Maui, Hawaii Jan. 7-10, where a small number of spectators will be allowed. The Sony Open in Honolulu, the American Express Championship in La Quinta, Calif., and the Farmers Insurance Open in La Jolla, Calif., have said they will not sell tickets.\n\nOrganizers at the Waste Management Phoenix Open, the Tour event that annually draws the most fans, are working with local health officials to permit some fans when it's played Feb. 4-7.\n\nVaccines may be rolled out in late December but the first wave will be prioritized for the elderly, health-care providers and first responders. It's not clear when enough PGA Tour players, caddies, staffers and fans will be vaccinated to enable a further return to normal.\n\nMonahan said there is every intention of completing an ambitious 2020-21 PGA Tour schedule that has 50 events and six majors -- since the 2020 Masters and U.S. Open were moved to the fall.\n\nThat includes The Players Championship March 11-14 at the Players Stadium Course.\n\nNot to be overlooked has been the quality of the competition since the Tour returned. Rising stars Byson DeChambeau (U.S. Open) and Collin Morikawa (PGA) captured their first major championships and Dustin Johnson dominated the late summer and fall to win the FedEx Cup and the Masters.\n\nThe PGA Tour Champions, which re-started in late August, got a shot of star power when Phil Mickelson and Jim Furyk both won their first two starts and Ernie Els, Steve Stricker and Darren Clarke also won.\n\nThe summer events on the Korn Ferry Tour produced rising stars such as Will Zalatoris, Taylor Pendrith, Davis Riley and Jared Wolfe, a Nocatee resident.\n\nThe Tour also strengthened both itself and the European PGA Tour with the announcement of an alliance involving global TV rights, marketing and streamlined scheduling in the future.\n\nWhile the Tour has been able to resume a full schedule during the pandemic, there have been still been repercussions.\n\nPGA Tour charity will be down\n\nThere's no getting away from it: the PGA Tour's ability to contribute tournament proceeds to charity has been severely restricted with no fans and pro-ams resuming only six weeks ago.\n\nThe Tour contributed $204.3 million to charity in 2019, pushing the all-time total to more than $3 billion since 1933.\n\nFirst Coast charities received $9.25 million from the 2019 Players Championship, bumping the total since 1977, when the tournament was first played at the Sawgrass Country Club, to more than $100 million.\n\nThose kind of numbers are hardly possible with no fans, corporate hospitality or pro-ams on the pre-pandemic level, along with losing 30 percent of the Tour season to events that were canceled.\n\nHowever, the Tour has gotten creative. The two exhibitions that preceded the opening of golf, with Rory McIlroy, Rickie Fowler, Dustin Johnson and Matthew Wolf playing at the Seminole Country Club; and Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson, Peyton Manning and Tom Brady at The Medalist, combined to raise more than $15 million for charity, and the Tour reports that it has raised a total of more than $30 million for COVID-related relief efforts through other efforts of players, tournaments and corporate partners.\n\nMonahan said even the tournaments that were canceled have been able to impact charity.\n\nThe Players Championship is one of them, with the tournament able to assist several charities as part of their fall \"Red Coat Ride Out.\"\n\nThe Tesori Family Foundation resumed its series of \"All-Star Clinics\" for special-needs children.\n\nThe RSM Classic at Sea Island was able to hold its \"Birdies Fore Love\" campaign, where players who had the most birdies in the first 11 fall events. A total of $500,000 was donated.\n\nThe PGA Tour conducted nine charity events at Tour sites on Wednesdays, raising more than $4.5 million.\n\nPGA Tour operations take hits\n\nThe loss of tournament revenue has also affected the Tour in Ponte Vedra. It announced this summer that around four dozen employees were laid off, spread out over nine departments.\n\nMonahan declined to confirm the amount of money the Tour has lost, or further discuss the layoffs. The total financial effects of the pandemic to the Tour's bottom line might not be completely known until late next year because as a 501 (c) (6) tax-exempt organization, it has until October of 2021 to file this year's return.\n\nMonahan said the Tour has reserves that will bridge the time until a nine-year, $700 million TV and digital rights deal begins in 2022 -- which was announced four days before The Players was canceled.\n\nMonahan is forgoing his salary for the balance of the pandemic, which was $3.9 million annually based on the Tour's latest available tax filing, and his executive staff agreed to salary cuts.\n\nThe Tour can't cut purses and bank the savings because those funds come from title sponsors and TV rights. If the Tour did adjust prize money, it would likely have to be refunded to those constituents.\n\nThe Tour, in a statement, said maintaining purses (which can be as high as $15 million (for The Players and FedEx Cup Championship), is the key to making sure the world's best players continue teeing it up.\n\nLosing those players, especially with an alternative looming (the on-again, off-again Premier Golf Tour) would impact overall tournament revenue, which ultimately would affect charitable giving.\n\nThe Tour also is going ahead with its plan to move its 800 local employees into the new \"Global Home\" Headquarters building in January. Construction has not been delayed and Tour officials said costs have remained within the original budget of $65 million for the 187,000-square-foot structure.\n\nThe recent layoffs also won't impact the Tour's pledge to St. Johns County in 2017 to hire 307 more employees over a 10-year period in exchange for nearly $2.8 million in incentives that include expedited permitting, an economic development grant for up to 100 percent of fees paid to the county (impact fees and water/sewer connection fees) plus four years of ad valorem taxes (general county portion) on capital improvements and tangible personal property valued at $86 million.\n\nThe first annual grant payment is anticipated to come during the 2022 fiscal year.\n\nIn a statement, the Tour pointed out that staff attrition was built into that projection.\n\nYounger demographic bumped ratings\n\nFans may not have been able to watch golf in person but they did on TV -- at least until football season began.\n\nThe early-round coverage of PGA Tour events on Golf Channel for the first 12 events after competition resumed was up 50 percent over comparable events in 2010, and up a whopping 96 percent for the 25-54 age group.\n\nEarly-round coverage through the RSM Classic was the most-watched for the same or comparable events since the beginning of the FedEx Cup Era in 2007.\n\n\"Golf became very meaningful for viewers who were starved for live sports,\" said Tom Knapp, executive vice-president of programming for the NBC Sports Group. \"Golf and NASCAR were the first sports back and I think we took for granted how much sports meant to viewers and our lifestyle. When golf came back, folks turned it on.\"\n\nKnapp was especially pleased with the younger demographics of golf viewers.\n\n\"Younger folks seeking competition on TV watched golf in bigger numbers when it came back,\" he said. \"Then they saw the young, dynamic, athletic players on the leaderboard each week and identified with them. We're building a future fan base that thinks golf is cool, just as a generation thought golf was cool when Tiger Woods first came out.\"\n\nThe final round of the PGA Championship from TPC Harding Park in San Francisco, took advantage of its prime time slot on the east coast to increase its rating slightly from 2019 to 3.3, with 5.1 million viewers. The ESPN early coverage of the final round was up 60 percent from last year and was the most-viewed coverage of a final round on cable since 2010.\n\nESPN's coverage for all four rounds was up 35 percent for the 18-49 age group and up 76 percent for the 18-34 age group.\n\nThe news wasn't so good for the two major championships that were moved to the fall. The final-round U.S. Open rating of 2.0 was the lowest since 1987 and the Masters final-round rating of 3.4 was the lowest since 1995.\n\nHowever, those two tournaments were going head-to-head against college football and the NFL. Oddly enough, the ESPN College GameDay show from Augusta National on Nov. 14 was its highest-rated show of the season.\n\nA younger demographic also found new ways to consume golf. Streaming, digital and social media engagements for the PGA Tour were up 52 percent, according to Tour figures, streaming subscriptions to PGA Tour Live were up 68 percent, and the average user watched nearly an hour longer than prior to the shutdown.\n\nThe average weekly PGA Tour app and website visits were up 28 percent and the average weekly PGA Tour social media engagements were up 68 percent.\n\nThe PGA Tour also forged marketing agreements with gambling and fantasy sports web sites to provide ShotLink data, further adding to its potential popularity with a younger age group.\n\nRecreational golfing participation is up\n\nRecreational golfers seemed to follow Jay Monahan's lead.\n\nSince almost all states allowed golf, even when other activities were shut down in the early months of the pandemic, participation obviously increased. Rounds for the year are projected to jump by nearly 50 million, according to the National Golf Foundation, the largest bump since Tiger Woods burst on the scene in 1997.\n\nThe big explosion came during the summer months. June rounds were up 14 percent over 2019, July was up 20 percent (the largest monthly single increase since 2000) and August rounds increased 21 percent.\n\nWith more play came more money spent on equipment and apparel. Equipment sales in July were nearly $389 million, the highest single-month total reported by Golf Datatech, and retail sales in August were $331 million, up 32 percent over last year.\n\nGolf is one of the few sports where participation can drive interest in the professional game. The NBA, for example, isn't dependent on how many YMCA basketball leagues are in existence and the popularity of the NFL isn't driven by flag football leagues.\n\n\"People can get the golf bug either by watching it first or playing it first,\" Knapp said. \"But eventually they want both experiences, which makes this sport unique. We've been able to cultivate new fans both ways during the pandemic.\"\n\nDave Reese, the executive director of Florida's First Coast of Golf, said the sport's allure is that 20-handicappers can watch the game's stays play courses such as the TPC Sawgrass Players Stadium, then have the same experience.\n\nYankees fans can't step into the box at Yankee Stadium. Green Bay Packers fans can't take snaps on Lambeau Field.\n\n\"That's the relationship golf fans have with the pro golf that doesn't exist in any other sport,\" Reese said. \"Now, those of us in the golf industry need to take this as an opportunity, and keep new fans engaged.\"\n\nLooking ahead to The Players Championship in 2021\n\nThe first round of the 2020 Players Championship was the last time fans could come to a PGA Tour event with no restrictions on numbers, no face coverings and no social distancing.\n\nDespite the fact that vaccines are imminent, it's likely too optimistic to think the skyrocketing COVID-19 numbers of the past month will diminish enough by March for a normal Players Championship experience at the TPC Sawgrass.\n\nMonahan said the Tour is \"examining a variety of options,\" in terms of corporate hospitality and fan attendance at The Players.\n\n\"The landscape of the 2021 Players will look different than what we've all become accustomed to,\" said executive director Jared Rice. \"Whatever we're able to do, we'll be focused on the health and safety of players, caddies, volunteers, tournament staff and the fans as the No. 1 priority.\"\n\nRice said no final decisions have been made on corporate hospitality or the number of tickets that will be sold. Hopes are that tickets will go on sale in mid-January.\n\nThe good news is that the day The Players was canceled, the PGA Tour staff began working on the health and safety protocols that enabled the Tour to begin playing again in June. Rice and his staff have nine months of data and best practices to implement at The Players.\n\nRice, among everyone else at the Tour, is daring to dream that normalcy will return within the next year.\n\n\"The Tour was able to complete 26 events since the restart and has developed health and safety plans to successfully deliver those events for our players and title sponsors,\" he said. \"We've brought back pro-ams and we were able to have 2,500 fans per day in Houston. Things are getting hectic now as we plan for next year's Players ... we still have a lot to plan for. But what's really exciting is that it feels like we're close to turning a page.\"\n\nMonahan said the adversity the PGA Tour has faced and overcome since the aborted Players Championship in March could be, in retrospect, one of the organizations' finest hours.\n\n\"We're very proud of our players, caddies, staff and volunteers,\" he said. \"We have a lot of work left to do until everything is back to normal.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/12/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2018/07/25/hollywoods-10-most-sought-after-actors-dwayne-johnson-tiffany-haddish/789790002/", "title": "Hollywood's 10 most in-demand actors", "text": "If you feel like you’ve been seeing a lot of Dwayne Johnson lately, you’re not wrong: The pro wrestler-turned-actor just released his second popcorn movie in three months – while the first one is still in theaters.\n\n\"If you look up 'international superstar' in the dictionary, Johnson’s name is there,\" says comScore senior media analyst Paul Dergarabedian.\n\nJohnson is one of 10 movie stars who made USA TODAY's ranking of the most in-demand actors in Hollywood. So is Tiffany Haddish, who has prominent roles in a whopping eight movies in 2018 and 2019, and Margot Robbie, who stars in six.\n\nTheir ubiquity made us wonder: Who else leads that list? Using casting and search data from Movie Insider and IMDb, we analyzed actors' recent starring film roles, upcoming projects and page views, with consideration given to name recognition.\n\nOur ranking includes Oscar winners, action stars, independent film stars/producers and character actors, though unsurprisingly, there are some big gaps in our findings. The movie business still skews white and male, and so does this list. There are also two men who have been accused of abusive behavior toward women, which doesn't seem to have diminished their ability to find work.\n\nBut there’s reason to expect progress in the years to come: Haddish, one of three women and three actors of color to make our top 10, was relatively unknown just last summer.\n\n\"What stands out is that this group of actors is truly cross-generational, a mix of old school and new school, with some representing multiple decades in the business, alongside dynamic young stars that are relatively early in their careers,\" Dergarabedian says. \"Given the impressive and growing influence of women both behind and in front of the camera, future lists of this type will likely see a greater number of female creatives among the ranks.\"\n\n1. James Franco\n\nWhat you’ve seen him in lately: Franco starred opposite his brother, Dave, in \"The Disaster Artist\" last December and won a Golden Globe for best actor in a comedy. In May, he played a warlord in \"Future World,\" which was savaged by critics (zero percent positive reviews) on aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nBiggest box-office opening: \"Spider-Man 3\" (2007), $151.1 million\n\nNext roles: He has a handful of indie projects geared up for the next year, including the action drama \"Blood Heist.\" And he'll lend his voice as James the Bottlenose Dolphin in the all-star cast of \"Naya Legend of the Golden Dolphin.\"\n\nWhy we can’t get enough of him: It's tough to reach a consensus here: Franco has mastered playing an array of mustachioed arthouse-cinema weirdos. It's also worth noting that he does a ton of TV work, too (most recently starring in HBO's \"The Deuce\"), but made this list on the basis of his film accomplishments alone. But he has also been accused by multiple women of inappropriate sexual behavior in work settings. (Franco says those allegations aren't accurate.)\n\n2. Dwayne Johnson\n\nWhat you’ve seen him in lately: Quintessential summer action flicks “Skyscraper” and “Rampage,” both in theaters now.\n\nBiggest box-office opening: “Furious 7” (2015), $147.2 million\n\nNext roles: How much time do you have? Johnson stars in the wrestling drama “Fighting With My Family” (slated for March 1) and “Jungle Cruise” (Oct. 11, 2019) based on the Disneyland ride. Farther down the road, he’s in preproduction for his “Fast & Furious” spinoff \"Hobbs & Shaw\" (next July), \"Jumanji” sequel (Dec. 13, 2019) and four other projects. He'll also take on the starring role in DC supervillain flick “Black Adam,” which is still in development. And hopefully, he'll take a nap soon.\n\nWhy we can’t get enough of him: Johnson is the perfect action star, with a combination of ridiculous athleticism and solid comedic timing. His energy is contagious: We all simultaneously want to be him, be best friends with him, and see him in the Oval Office with Tom Hanks (who also made this list) as a running mate. \"Given his unwavering work ethic and tireless marketing efforts on behalf of his films, he is a franchise booster when he joins any cast, and possesses the physical presence to solidify his status as a bigger-than-life action star,\" Dergarabedian says.\n\n3. Octavia Spencer\n\nWhat you’ve seen her in lately: Spencer earned her third Oscar nomination last year for her supporting role in \"The Shape of Water.\" She also was featured in the 2017 sleeper hits \"Gifted\" (with Chris Evans) and faith-based \"The Shack.\"\n\nBiggest box-office opening: \"Zootopia\" (2016), $75.1 million\n\nNext roles: She'll play the title character's teacher in an adaptation of the play \"Luce,\" which explores race and privilege in America. She'll also be featured in the comedy \"Instant Family\" as a social worker in Mark Wahlberg and Rose Byrne's journey through adopting three children.\n\nWhy we can’t get enough of her: Spencer is Hollywood's go-to supporting actress, with a win and two nominations in the category at the Academy Awards. She's nailed the role of everything from nurse to neighbor, and we're ready to see her cast in a lead role.\n\n4. Margot Robbie\n\nWhat you’ve seen her in lately: Last year, Robbie took on the titular role in the Tonya Harding biopic \"I, Tonya\" and played author A.A. Milne's wife, Daphne, in \"Goodbye Christopher Robin.\"\n\nBiggest box-office opening: \"Suicide Squad\" (2016), $133.7 million\n\nNext roles: You can see Robbie as Queen Elizabeth I, starring opposite Saoirse Ronan in \"Mary Queen of Scots\" (Dec. 7). She's also poised to bring back Harley Quinn in a slew of announced DC Comics movies.\n\nWhy we can’t get enough of her: From over-the-top characters like Naomi in \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" to quieter roles like Flopsy in \"Peter Rabbit,\" Robbie proves her acting tool kit is well-stocked. \"Robbie has a depth, grit and edge that few of her peers can match (and) has a great eye for interesting material,\" Dergarabedian says. \"Definitely one to watch.\"\n\n5. Nicolas Cage\n\nWhat you’ve seen him in lately: Cage's success may be more closely associated with his roles in the '80s, '90s and 2000s, but he still has a full movie agenda. He starred in the thriller \"Looking Glass\" in February and action flick \"211\" earlier this summer.\n\nBiggest box-office opening: \"Ghost Rider\" (2007), $45.4 million\n\nNext roles: In a pretty typical Nicolas Cage role, he stars in \"Mandy,\" a psychedelic horror film in which his character must rescue a woman from a sadistic cult (Sept. 14). He'll also lend his voice to the animated \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\" (Dec. 14) that features multiple parallel dimensions worth of Spider-Men. This month, he voices Superman in \"Teen Titans GO! to the Movies\" (July 27), years after he was famously cast as the Man of Steel in Tim Burton's abandoned Superman movie.\n\nWhy we can’t get enough of him: He may be better known lately as the punchline to many an internet joke, but he's also a solid character actor who pushes boundaries and experiments with his roles in a way most actors don't.\n\n6. Tiffany Haddish\n\nWhat you’ve seen her in lately: Still an up-and-comer in Hollywood, Haddish is most recognizable for her role as Dina in last summer's \"Girls Trip,\" and is in theaters now in \"Uncle Drew.\" She also recently hosted \"Saturday Night Live,\" where she notably worked her monologue around wearing the same Alexander McQueen dress she wore to the \"Girls Trip\" premiere.\n\nBiggest box-office opening: \"Girls Trip\" (2017), $31.2 million\n\nNext roles: Get ready to see a lot more of Haddish: She has prominent roles in seven more projects expected to hit theaters this year or the next. Most notably, she'll co-star with Kevin Hart in the comedy \"Night School\" (Sept. 28) and lend her voice to \"The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part\" (Feb. 8).\n\nWhy we can’t get enough of her: Her energy and charisma are out of this world. Haddish is unapologetically herself and commands a scene with natural delivery and perfect comedic timing. Dergarabedian calls her \"a rare talent, and someone to look out for in the years to come.\"\n\n7. Woody Harrelson\n\nWhat you've seen him in lately: Harrelson played the morally ambiguous criminal Beckett in \"Solo: A Star Wars Story\" and police chief Willoughby in \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,\" which earned him his third Oscar nomination.\n\nBiggest box-office opening: \"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire\" (2013), $158.1 million\n\nNext roles: After a good deal of secrecy, Harrelson confirmed he has a part in the upcoming \"Spider-Man\" spinoff \"Venom.\" No official word yet on his role, though there's speculation he may be playing the villain Carnage. And a \"Zombieland\" sequel was just announced, with the four major stars (Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin) set to return in time for an October 2019 release, the 10th anniversary of the original.\n\nWhy we can’t get enough of him: Harrelson is often typecast in the drunken, snarky mentor role – an oddly specific character, but nevertheless one that he can tap into better than anyone.\n\n8. Johnny Depp\n\nWhat you’ve seen him in lately: Depp reprised his famous Capt. Jack Sparrow character in 2017's \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales\" and was featured in the star-studded \"Murder on the Orient Express\" remake.\n\nBiggest box-office opening: \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest\" (2006), $135.6 million\n\nNext roles: He plays LAPD detective Russell Poole in \"City of Lies\" (Sept. 7), a biopic about the Tupac Shakur and Notorious B.I.G. murder investigations. Amid much controversy, he's also slated to play Gellert Grindelwald in the second \"Fantastic Beasts\" film (Nov. 16).\n\nWhy we can’t get enough of him: Depp is the king of thoroughly transforming into an impressive variety of out-of-this-world characters. But allegations against him off-camera (ex-wife Amber Heard has accused him of physical abuse, which Depp denied) make it difficult to say we \"can't get enough of him.\"\n\n9. Chris Pratt\n\nWhat you’ve seen him in lately: Pratt reprised his role as Owen Grady in \"Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom\" earlier this summer, as well as Peter Quill/Star-Lord in \"Avengers: Infinity War.\"\n\nBiggest box-office opening: \"Avengers: Infinity War\" (2018), $257.7 million\n\nNext roles: He'll again lend his voice as Emmet Brickowski in \"The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part.\" And he'll be back in a third \"Jurassic World\" flick in 2021.\n\nWhy we can’t get enough of him: We first got to know Pratt as the lovably dumb, chubby Andy Dwyer on \"Parks and Recreation.\" He may look like a bona fide action star now, but the humor remains. His transformation from small-screen comedy star to Marvel superhero \"was as unexpected as it was welcomed,\" Dergarabedian adds.\n\n10. Tom Hanks\n\nWhat you’ve seen him in lately: As Washington Post executive editor Ben Bradlee in Oscar best-picture nominee \"The Post\" and as tech company head Bailey opposite Emma Watson in \"The Circle.\"\n\nBiggest box-office opening: \"Toy Story 3\" (2010), $110.3 million\n\nNext roles: Hanks is reprising his role as Woody in \"Toy Story 4\" (we're not crying, you're crying), and will play Fred Rogers in \"You Are My Friend.\" (OK, fine, we're crying.) Both are slated for 2019.\n\nWhy we can’t get enough of him: From rom-coms and biopics to action and animation, Hanks does it all. He's even secured an interesting role outside of the movie world: He's America's dad. As Dergarabedian notes, \"He'll go down as one of the greatest and most beloved actors of all-time. Full stop.\"\n\nMethodology: We began with Movie Insider's lists of most prolific actors for 2017 to 2019 and data provided by IMDb of the 50 actors with the most page views since 2012​​​​​​.

Here's a look at 10 things they've missed:\n\n1. Social media. The cicadas crawling out of the ground may be surprised to find photos of themselves all over Twitter and Facebook as smartphones have made it easier than ever to share with friends, family and, well, everyone else in the world. Photos of the red-eyed buggers are already popping up on social-media sites and making their way into the news. Now, the question is whether our buggy little pals will join Facebook and try to friend us or post their selfies to Instagram.\n\n2. O.J. Simpson. The insects emerging in the past week may be a little confused to see O.J. Simpson back in court. Wasn't he acquitted in the \"trial of the century\" in 1995 for the slashing deaths of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and a friend, Ron Goldman? Well, yes, but he was arrested, convicted and sentenced to nine to 33 years in prison for armed robbery and kidnapping of sports memorabilia dealers during a bizarre and disputed confrontation in 2007. Simpson once again took the stand this week, this time in a long-shot bid to win a new trial.\n\n3. Internet. If the insects buzz on over to the Drudge Report, they might wonder for a moment why the Internet hasn't changed much since 1996. But a quick look elsewhere, including at USA TODAY's redesigned website (shameless plug, I know), will show a vastly different interwebs, as we youngsters call it, than they used to know. Of course, the explosion of cat photos, videos and BuzzFeed articles on our feline friends may also lead them to believe that Al Gore sold the Internet to cats.\n\nOne thing the bugs won't be happy about: the ease at which users can find recipes online for cicada delicacies and concoctions. Cicada tacos, anyone?\n\n4. Reality TV. Cicadas hooked on The Real World may be surprised to find the show is still running, now in its 28th season on MTV. And since 1996, the reality TV scene has exploded, and the bugs will find a wide variety of programs they can feast on from Dancing With the Stars and American Idol to Keeping up with the Kardashians and Here Comes Honey Boo Boo.\n\nAs some reality shows, such as American Idol and The Bachelor, have seen their ratings decline, the bugs have got to wonder: Will these shows still be around when their kids emerge from the ground in 2030?\n\n5. Baseball. Among the die-hard Red Sox fans, brood II's insects may be surprised to find the Boston team finally broke the Curse of the Bambino, not once but twice, while they were underground in 2004 and 2007. But not all teams have been as lucky: The Chicago Cubs are still without a World Series win since 1908.\n\nSpeaking of the Cubs, the cicada fans of Chicago's Sammy Sosa and the St. Louis Cardinals' Mark McGwire may be dismayed when they find out that not only did they miss the sluggers' infamous duel for the home run record in 1998 (McGwire won with 70 homers that season), but the two baseball superstars have been tainted amid suspicions their accomplishments were boosted by performance-enhancing drugs. In 2010, McGwire admitted to using steroids off and on during his career, including when he broke baseball's home run record. In 2009, The New York Times reported that Sosa was among those who tested positive for a performance-enhancing drug in MLB's 2003 anonymous survey. (Three years after McGwire set his record, it was stretched to 73 home runs by the San Francisco Giants' Barry Bonds, who also was tied to the PED scandal.)\n\nWhile the bugs missed Miguel Cabrera's Triple Crown win last year — the first MLB Triple Crown winner since 1967 — horse racing's Triple Crown remains elusive, with no horse winning all three races since Affirmed in 1978.\n\n6. Google. Back in 1996, the search engine was just a project called BackRub started by two computer-science grad students at Stanford. Too bad the bugs weren't able to buy any stock before they went underground — the company didn't offer its initial public offering until 2004. What started out as an $85-per-share investment has now shot up to more than $900 per share.\n\n7. Lottery. Players across the nation were looking for a big payday this week as Powerball and Mega Millions competed for attention with two large jackpots. Two winning tickets were sold in Friday's $190 million Mega Million jackpot, and many likely awaited Saturday's Powerball drawing — with a $600 million top prize that could climb — with bated breath.\n\nWho knows, maybe some of this year's early cicadas were able to get in on the action and were surprised at how much the lotto scene has changed since 1996. Of the two big lotteries today — Powerball and Mega Millions — only Powerball was in existence 17 years ago. While Powerball's predecessor, Lotto* America, began in 1988, it wasn't until September 1996 that the first jackpot for The Big Game — a whopping $5 million — was awarded. The lottery was later renamed Mega Millions, and went on to set a record for the largest lottery prize ever of $656 million in March 2012.\n\n8. Space. Our 17-year visitors will find they missed a lot of celestial news, starting with one fewer planet in our solar system: Pluto was ousted in 2006 after being downgraded to a dwarf planet. Meanwhile, if the cicadas are looking for a new place to live, Mars has gained popularity, with 78,000 people applying to become colonists through a non-profit organization called Mars One. The group's goal is to land four people on Mars in 2023 to start a permanent colony, with more arriving every two years thereafter.\n\n\n\n9. Investing. While brood II's parents earned 15.9% a year on their investments in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, and 13.7% annually on the Nasdaq 100 index, the kids emerging today may be a little disappointed in their portfolios. Their 17-year average annual returns were down to 7.3% in the S&P 500 and 6.2% on the Nasdaq.\n\nFortunately for Brood II, their retirement is just a few weeks away. And they experienced a bit less inflation over their 17 years than their parents did. Inflation has averaged 2.4% a year for the past 17 years, vs. 4.8% for 1979-1996.\n\n10. Tiger Woods. Just making his pro golf debut in 1996, Tiger Woods may have looked like he'd have a promising career, but it would have been hard to predict just how good. Today's cicadas would have missed his first PGA Tour win at the Las Vegas Invitational in October 1996, where he finished 27 under par. Today, Woods ranks as the top golfer in the world, with 78 PGA Tour victories to his name.\n\nStill harder to predict would have been the scandal that broke in 2009 after The National Enquirer published a story alleging Woods was having an affair with a New York nightclub hostess. Just two days after the report, Tiger Woods crashed his Cadillac Escalade SUV into a tree and a fire hydrant while driving erratically outside his Florida home. The crash caused more than $3,200 in property damage. Two weeks after the accident, Woods posted a statement on his website admitting he had been unfaithful to his wife, Elin, and shocked the sports world by announcing he was taking an indefinite break from golf to try to mend his family life.\n\nAfter a few weeks up in the trees, this batch of cicadas will die off, but not before breeding and sending their offspring underground, from which they will emerge in 2030. Which makes us wonder: What in the world will the world look like then?\n\nFollow @KatharineLackey on Twitter.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/05/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/arizona-environment/2020/09/25/arizona-was-once-climate-policy-leader-in-west-what-happened/5841376002/", "title": "Arizona was once a climate policy leader in the West. What ...", "text": "On Labor Day weekend in 2020, the campgrounds and trailer parks around the Grand Canyon were quiet. With excessive heat warnings throughout the country and restrictions in place to slow the spread of a deadly virus, the holiday weekend was different from years past. Still, a steady stream of RVers and campers rolled in and out of the campgrounds on the South Rim.\n\nBut those who had come to see one of the nation’s most treasured natural wonders were met with a hazy view. One morning, the other side of the Canyon was barely visible. The striking definition of ridges, the red and orange palettes the Canyon is known for had been flattened by a smoky, at times opaque, haze.\n\nSmoke from some of the largest and hottest wildfires in history in California, Oregon and Washington had blanketed the West, and even reached the East Coast.\n\nFor some, the haze was reminiscent of the 1990s, when the Grand Canyon had often been similarly obscured. Pollution from Los Angeles, vehicles, coal-fired power plants and controlled burns seriously impaired the view at the Canyon at least 75 days a year, dulling its colorful vistas into a muted, murky landscape.\n\nHaze in the Grand Canyon was a particular concern for Arizona, the Grand Canyon state. At the time, Arizona led efforts to address smog in the Canyon, initiating partnerships with other Western states and spurring federal policies that greatly improved both visibility at the Grand Canyon and air pollution across the country.\n\n“The Grand Canyon is like the canary in the coal mine,” said Roger Clark, a program director for the Grand Canyon Trust and an active member in the regional haze work from its earliest stages. “Visibility issues are an early warning sign of things going awry in the atmosphere.”\n\nBy the early 2000s, the partnership of Western states established out of the Grand Canyon haze work was tapped to address another phenomenon just entering mainstream consciousness: climate change.\n\nGrowing concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and their impact on the planet led Arizona to develop a comprehensive state climate action plan. Other states soon followed.\n\nToday, the effects of climate change on Arizona have become almost as evident as the smoke hanging over the canyon: dwindling snowpack and extreme drought are stretching Colorado River supplies thin, summer temperatures are getting hotter and increasing heat-related deaths, and more destructive wildfires are scorching landscapes and lives. Temperatures in Maricopa County alone have risen by nearly 2 degrees Celsius since record-keeping began in 1895.\n\nBut Arizona is not the leader it was 15 years ago when the state led the West on regional haze and then climate policy.\n\nCities have largely taken the lead on climate policies. In recent years, the governor and the Legislature have taken no cohesive action, enacting laws that prohibit mitigation efforts at a local level. One state law even prevents state agencies from monitoring greenhouse gases.\n\n“The state first and foremost needs to stand up and say that we have an issue with climate,” said Coral Evans, the mayor of Flagstaff, the first city in the state to declare a climate emergency. “That leadership needs to be there. We don't talk about climate change. Maybe a lot of people in leadership in our state don't have the lived experience that I have. I’m third generation. I grew up here. Things are definitely different.”\n\nPOLL: Most Arizonans want government to act on climate change\n\nA plan to act\n\nOn a hot day in August 2006, Steve Owens steeled himself before entering the governor’s office. As the director of the state Department of Environmental Quality, it was his job to brief then-Gov. Janet Napolitano on the state’s new climate action plan.\n\nHe and a coalition of dozens of stakeholders — businesspeople, scientists, environmentalists, energy experts, ranchers, river runners, auto industry executives — had worked for more than a year to develop a set of 49 policy recommendations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Arizona.\n\nThat day, Owens expected to defend the economic viability of the plan. Instead, the governor asked why the goals — reduce emissions to 2000 levels by 2020 and 50% below 2000 levels by 2040 — weren't more aggressive.\n\nNearly two decades ago, Arizona emerged as a national leader in developing strategies to combat fossil fuel-driven climate change. A wave of Democratic governors who were concerned about the issue were elected across the West. Republican governors like Arnold Schwarzenegger of California and Jon Huntsman of Utah were vocal about wanting to lead on climate and environment issues.\n\nThe momentum was a response to federal inaction: In 2001, the George W. Bush administration announced that it would not implement the Kyoto Protocol, a landmark international treaty signed in 1997 that required nations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. At the start of his second term, Bush passed numerous policies at the behest of polluting industries who didn’t want more regulation.\n\nBy 2005, the issue drew attention at a more local level. It turned out to be “a watershed year for states deciding it was time for them to step up on climate change,” said Patrick Cummins, senior policy advisor at Colorado State University’s Center for the New Energy Economy.\n\nThat year, Napolitano signed an executive order to create a state climate action plan, one of the first in the nation at a state level.\n\nIn the previous decade, Arizona had added fossil fuel pollutants to the atmosphere more than any other state. Between 1990 and 2005, Arizona’s emissions shot up a staggering 56%, a rate of increase three times the national average. The numbers gave Napolitano compelling reason to act.\n\n“It was a realization that climate was a really big deal and that we needed to have a plan, that we needed to put some intentionality into it,” Napolitano said in a recent interview. Napolitano recently resigned as the President of University of California to teach as a tenured professor at UC Berkeley's Goldman School of Public Policy.\n\n“It seemed to me that this was an area that Arizona needed to take up and also could be a leader in,” she said.\n\nA string of states followed: New Mexico, the Carolinas, Michigan, Florida, Pennsylvania all developed their own climate plans. Arizona dipped its toes into international climate collaboration, too: A few months after Napolitano’s executive order, Arizona and the Mexican state of Sonora declared they would work together to address emissions in the borderlands.\n\n“This had been just something done by governors in the Northeast and the West Coast and not by the heartland. Arizona was the first southwestern state to do this and one of the first red states in the country, period,” said Thomas Peterson, President of the Center for Climate Strategies. The Washington D.C.-based non-profit has worked with more than 20 states across the US and with countries around the world to develop strategies to lower emissions and achieve economic goals.\n\nThe organization leads states to find a consensus on policies and prepared the emissions inventory, forecast, and economic impact analyses for Arizona’s 2006 plan.\n\n“Arizona demonstrated that a very diverse group of stakeholders could reach agreements on a substantial list of things to do to address emissions,” Peterson said.\n\nSeven northeastern states had already signed a memorandum to create the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, the first mandatory market-based program in the US to reduce emissions. Launched in 2009, it continues to be lauded for showing that economic growth can coincide with emissions reductions.\n\nIn 2007, Arizona attempted to spearhead a similar regional approach. Governors of three West Coast states, along with Arizona and New Mexico, signed a memorandum of understanding directing their environmental agencies to design a market-based mechanism to achieve regional emissions goals, what was known as a cap-and-trade program. Republican strongholds Utah and Montana signed on to the program too and the Western Climate Initiative was born.\n\nIn developing the 2006 plan, Arizona found that the transportation and electricity sectors accounted for nearly 40% each of the state’s total emissions. Cities were in a long-running fight with bad air pollution. Passenger vehicles were then and remain a main driver of the state's ozone pollution.\n\nAt the time, Napolitano and ADEQ officials determined that adopting the more stringent California Clean Car standards was necessary, especially in light of Arizona’s rapid growth in both population and vehicle use. The tailpipe standards would not only lower planet-heating emissions, but also help the state meet the stricter ozone standards announced by the Bush Administration in 2008.\n\n“While this regulation alone will not substantially reduce or reverse ongoing global climate change, it is inconceivable that those reduction targets could be achieved without actors like the state of Arizona undertaking reductions like this,” ADEQ stated in its final rulemaking.\n\nMany major policy recommendations from the plan were adopted by other states, helping the US make a significant dent in its emissions over the years. In fact, state policies have had a greater impact than the Great Recession in lowering national emissions.\n\n“There was this period when there was this enormous wave of action,” said Peterson. “But the action didn't get fully implemented and there's all this unfinished business. And that is the failure.”\n\nCLIMATE DISCUSSION: Republic panel talks about threats, solutions\n\nMomentum breaks down\n\nThe Mexican states of Chihuahua and Sonora were on the verge of signing on to the Western Climate Initiative when the Great Recession hit. By the time the Initiative launched in 2012, Arizona had already pulled out of the cap-and-trade program.\n\nWhen Napolitano was appointed to serve in the Obama Administration as Secretary of Homeland Security in 2009, Republican Jan Brewer landed in the governor’s office. The recession, California’s growing regulatory environment, and President Barack Obama’s election rapidly transformed the state’s political landscape.\n\n“2009-10 was a time in Arizona dominated by optimism about solar energy, skepticism about ‘cap and trade,’ and concern about California and the federal government determining Arizona’s environmental and economic competitiveness,” Ben Grumbles, the ADEQ director appointed by Brewer after Owens left for the EPA, wrote in an emailed statement to The Republic.\n\nHe now serves as Maryland’s Secretary of Environment and is an officer for the regional carbon market program in the northeast.\n\nOn Feb. 1, 2010, Brewer signed an executive order to pull Arizona from the Western Climate Initiative, saying the program would cripple the state’s economy. Two months later, she signed a law that prevented any state agencies from even monitoring greenhouse gas emissions. The law remains on the books today.\n\nIn a final blow to the momentum of the Napolitano era, Brewer signed an order that, in 2012, blocked the state from adopting California’s clean car standards. The Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry celebrated the repeal as vindication from California’s “overbearing regulatory environment.” Environmentalists decried the move.\n\n“Brewer and I had very different ideas about what Arizona needed and what good public policy was,” Napolitano said. “She focused on the immigration agenda almost to the exclusion, it seems, of everything else.”\n\nBrewer declined to be interviewed for this story.\n\nBrewer’s signing of SB 1070, an anti-immigration law, plunged Arizona into political chaos and landed the state in the national spotlight. The rise of the Tea Party and increasing political polarization across the nation pushed climate change to the sidelines and made it increasingly a partisan issue.\n\nDuring the Bush years, John McCain had been the only Republican senator to push for climate change legislation, but after his electoral defeat in 2008, he reverted to the party line and played a large role in blocking any climate legislation from reaching the senate floor.\n\nSince that time, there has been no comprehensive climate action from the governor or the Legislature. With the Trump Administration’s repeal of Obama-era clean car standards, despite the EPA’s finding that the rollback could lead to an additional 444 to 1,000 premature deaths from increased air pollution, the federal government has created an even lower backstop for a state already struggling to mitigate bad air.\n\n“Arizona was really standing out because of all the things we were doing,” Owens recalled. “It’s disappointing, the things that could have been done in the last 10, 15 years. With drought conditions that still persist, the record heats we continue to have, the Colorado river drying up, you would think people would be more concerned. But the people who are in positions to do something about it are in complete denial.”\n\nEmissions and climate change today\n\nWhen Flagstaff Mayor Coral Evans was a kid, she swam in the Rio de Flag every summer. The river flowed behind her grandfather’s house, its cool waters a welcome summer respite. By the time Halloween came around, winter had usually settled over the city. Sometimes the snow lasted through April.\n\nToday, Evans lives in the house her grandfather built in 1942, but the river behind it no longer flows like it used to. The heavy winters of Evans’ childhood are rarer. Ski resorts now spray manufactured snow onto the mountains to mark the beginning of ski season. The temperate summers Evans grew up with are warmer; every year, temperatures inch closer to reaching 100 degrees for the first time.\n\n“I have had the ability to experience firsthand the changes caused by this climate crisis we're experiencing,” said Evans, who is running for a seat in the state House as a Democrat. “The local impact of the climate crisis is devastating and is directly impacting our quality of life and our economy right now.”\n\nArizona’s carbon emissions aren’t as dire as the 2006 climate plan anticipated they would be. The plan predicted a whopping 148% increase in emissions by 2020 if Arizona failed to implement any of the recommended policies.\n\nJust before the Great Recession hit, Arizona had increased its emissions from 2000 levels by 20% . In 2008, the state spewed an all-time high of 102 million metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.\n\nThe recession, combined with improving technology over the years and utilities shifting to a more robust renewable energy portfolio, tempered the state’s emissions rate and led to a decrease in total emissions to 2000 levels by 2017, according to the US Energy Information Administration, the best state-level greenhouse gas emissions data in the absence of a state-run greenhouse gas inventory.\n\nStill, Arizona is falling behind in the West when it comes to proactive climate policy. In 2018, voters in Colorado, New Mexico and Nevada elected Democratic governors and legislatures. Soon after, Colorado joined California’s clean car standards. New Mexico and Nevada are moving to do the same. Earlier this year, a climate report ordered by the Utah Legislature developed a roadmap for tackling climate change and pollution.\n\nWhile climate change is a global problem, some of the most innovative and effective solutions in addressing emissions have come from the state and regional levels, and have even incentivized stronger action from the federal government.\n\n“It makes a national program more inevitable when enough states are doing it, so state action and state leadership is going to continue to be important,” said Cummins. “But ultimately when you look at what the scientists are telling us about cutting emissions in half by 2030, getting to net zero by 2050—this requires a national mobilization.”\n\nLocal efforts, state sabotage\n\nArizona’s cities and counties have taken the lead on climate action in the absence of state and national leadership. Flagstaff, Phoenix, and Pima County all conduct their own regular greenhouse gas emissions inventories. Maricopa County published its first inventory this year. Flagstaff, Phoenix, Tempe, and Tucson have either already implemented or are in the process of developing their own climate action plans. Over the years, the cities have enacted innovative policies to reduce their respective carbon footprints.\n\n“Phoenix is home to 1.7 million people, so we are larger than 10 states,” said Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego in a recent interview. “Cities are the branch of government that are closest to our residents. We hear what they need and what they want. If we lead, it really can make a difference. I would love to see the Legislature give us more tools to be able to respond to our residents rather than restrict our ability.”\n\nIn recent years, the Legislature has passed multiple bills that hinder climate action on a local level. In 2014, the Legislature outlawed plastic bag bans in cities and towns. In 2015, the Legislature prohibited cities from requiring energy benchmarking for commercial buildings, a move that Tempe council member Lauren Kuby called a “slap-in-the face to local decision making.”\n\nThis year, in what many called a reflex response to California policies, a state law was fast-tracked through the Legislature and signed by the governor in February to prevent Arizona’s cities and towns from banning natural gas or other fossil fuels in buildings.\n\n“The Legislature has the potential to be a driving force to create an equitable approach to water insecurity and extreme heat,” Kuby wrote in response to emailed questions from The Republic.\n\n“Arizonans, as well as cities, businesses, and nonprofits are way ahead of the AZ Corporation Commission, Legislature, and the Governor in thinking and acting proactively to address the climate emergency,\" she said. \"Extremists in the Legislature are not only content to do nothing, they attempt to squash cities that are innovating to address the climate crisis.”\n\nIn recent years, the Arizona Corporation Commission repealed rooftop solar incentives. Though the state’s major utilities have announced fairly ambitious clean energy goals, the commission has not increased its renewable-energy and energy-efficiency standards since the mid-2000s.\n\nSome lawmakers have attempted to push legislation to require action at a state level. In this last Legislative session, Democrats Kirsten Engel and Juan Mendez introduced bills in the House and Senate respectively to develop a state climate action plan and greenhouse gas inventory. The bills died before ever reaching the Senate floor.\n\n“Fundamentally, we need a state Sustainability Commission and an Arizona Office of Sustainability,” Kuby wrote. “If the State of Florida can dedicate an office to incubating policies that mitigate or adapt to climate change, then Arizona, with a history of coming together on contentious water issues, should be able to agree that we need coordinated sustainability policy at the state level.”\n\nIt was only last year that Governor Doug Ducey publicly acknowledged climate change was influenced by human activity. In the past several years, Ducey has taken some action on environmental issues plaguing the state, particularly water issues. In January 2019 he signed an executive order to create a council to address long-term concerns about a drier future in Arizona beyond the issues involving the Colorado River.\n\n“Governor Ducey believes we have a responsibility to protect the environment, and that doing so is tied to our economy and quality of life,” a spokesperson for the governor wrote in an email to The Republic. “At the same time, we are mindful of how any proposed policies impact our economy, taxpayers, small businesses, everyday Arizonans and energy costs. ADEQ is an entire state agency devoted 365 days a year to protecting our environment and our air and water.”\n\nThe governor declined to be interviewed for this story and didn’t respond to specific questions from The Republic.\n\nEvery year, ADEQ spends millions of dollars on a variety of travel reduction, vehicle efficiency and lawn equipment replacement initiatives to improve emissions. But the agency has no authority to address carbon dioxide emissions, one of the main greenhouse gases.\n\nADEQ spokesperson Caroline Oppleman pointed to partnerships with utilities, the private sector, and advancements like evolving electric vehicle and hydrogen fuel cell technology as ways Arizona will lower its carbon footprint in coming years.\n\nThe market-driven shift from coal dominance will also improve emissions, Oppleman said. The closure of the Navajo Generating Station in November 2019 alone reduced Arizona’s emissions by 13.8 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to ADEQ. Roughly a third of Arizona's energy production is already from non-fossil fuel alternative sources, including Palo Verde nuclear generating station, said Oppleman.\n\n“Our goal with all these efforts has been to take the politics out of it, and focus on good policies that are bipartisan and good for the state of Arizona,” Ducey’s spokesperson wrote.\n\nThe reliance on the federal government and natural market swings will have positive impacts, but those actively working toward solutions say waiting on the market isn’t enough.\n\n“We're implementing climate policy by implementing utility energy policy and transportation policy,” said Jeff Schlegel, a member of the 2006 climate action plan working group and a state energy policy consultant. “The prospects for the Commission improving the energy rules and in so doing, making progress on climate change is probably the best thing that we have going right now.”\n\nOn the transportation side, Schlegel said, a combination of the market and EPA requirements for ozone standards, and other air quality issues in the Valley will also help improve emissions policies.\n\n“It's just a matter of whether you have it three to five years earlier because of some good policy,” Schlegel said. “But not only is the Legislature not taking positive action to address the crisis, they're preventing local municipalities from taking their own action, which is bizarre coming from a political party that claims it is in favor of local control.”\n\nSTUDY: Phoenix will feel more extreme heat as climate changes\n\nTime to act\n\nTime is running out. In 2018, the world’s leading climate scientists warned the world had to take drastic action within 12 years to slow the rate of global warming and keep it at a maximum of 1.5 degrees Celsius. Beyond that, every degree has increasingly dire consequences.\n\nThe world has already warmed more than one degree Celsius since the Industrial Revolution and is on track to reach 3 degrees of warming by the end of the century if major reductions in emissions aren’t achieved.\n\nThe Paris climate agreement, an international treaty to lower greenhouse gas emissions hoped to restrict warming to two degrees. In 2017, the Trump Administration announced the U.S., one of the largest emitters of planet-heating emissions in the world, would no longer participate in the agreement.\n\nFor all living organisms, the faster climate changes, the more difficult it is to adapt to it. When climate change is too rapid, as it has become with the help of human-caused emissions, species start going extinct.\n\nCoral reefs would largely die off with two degrees of warming. Three degrees could result in the loss of many coastal cities. Four degrees could reduce the flow of the Colorado River to a trickle. Five degrees could leave huge swathes of the planet uninhabitable.\n\nThere will also be economic impacts. A 2017 study found the U.S. could lose 2.3% of its GDP for each degree Celsius increase in global warming.\n\nThe Southwest, already the hottest and driest region in the United States, is warming at a faster rate than other parts of the country. Maricopa County's average temperature has increased by 1.9 degrees since 1895. This gradual climate change means longer, hotter summers, experts say, as the monsoon pattern arrives later.\n\nStates can have tremendous power to make a difference, especially in the U.S., which is second only to China in its contribution to planet-heating emissions.\n\n“The states need to be taking the initiative on this because the federal government right now certainly isn't,” said Owens, the former ADEQ director. “While an individual state can only do so much, it's extremely important for an individual state to do as much as it can.”\n\nPolitical polarization in the last decade has made large-scale action difficult, but many see bipartisan consensus as the only way forward.\n\n“The state of Arizona and the federal government can’t continue ignoring this issue,” said Tucson Mayor Regina Romero in a phone interview. “We are at a point where it’s all hands on deck. Democrats, Republicans, the business community, elected officials, students and scientists can work together to plan for the future, invest in green, renewable infrastructure that creates jobs. It is an economic opportunity for us and at the same time, we will be doing something good for our environment.”\n\nIn September, Tucson formally declared a climate emergency and will implement a decade-long plan to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030.\n\nThe need to remove politics from the climate conversation is something many from both sides of the aisle agree needs to happen. This year, representatives from Arizona’s utilities, business community, and political leaders met in a forum to discuss the state’s direction on energy.\n\n“The consensus was clear: the value of diversifying our energy portfolio and expanding our utilization of renewable energy options is not a left or right question, but an imperative that will have significant impacts on our state,” Jaime Molera, a Republican and former state official, and Glenn Hamer, the president of the Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry, wrote in a joint op-ed in The Arizona Capitol Times in February.\n\nDiscourse may be the first step, but the science shows the window for meaningful action is rapidly closing.\n\n\"Climate is the great convener. Our livelihoods and environment should not be partisan,\" said Kuby. \"We need to elect people who are not beholden to corporate interests, who reflect the people and the science that we are in a climate crisis and must take action.”\n\nErin Stone covers the environment for The Arizona Republic and azcentral.com.

She is also a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. Read more opinion on CNN.\n\n(CNN) Soon, parents across the country may finally have the option to vaccinate their young kids against Covid-19. Pfizer and BioNTech announced Tuesday they are requesting emergency use authorization for their Covid-19 vaccine for children ages 6 months to 5 years, signaling the potential arrival of a vaccine for this age group in the weeks to come, pending review of the safety and efficacy data.\n\nWhat feels to many parents like long-awaited news has others thinking long and hard about the choice ahead of them. Currently, only three in 10 parents say they'll get their child under the age of 5 vaccinated as soon as possible when a Covid-19 vaccine is authorized, according to the most recent data from the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nAs a pediatrician, I find this response disheartening. As a new mom to a beautiful boy who will be 6 months this March, I understand this parental concern. I have come to accept that worrying is part of being a parent, and despite being well versed in the science, I too have paused to ask myself whether I'm ready to give my baby the Covid-19 vaccine. My most important job as a mama is, after all, keeping him safe.\n\nKnowing then, that some of us may be torn by the choice ahead of us, but that all of us want to keep our children safe, I want to share with you a few of the things that are bringing me comfort as the Covid-19 vaccine for young children makes its way through the regulatory process.\n\nThe context of childhood vaccinations\n\nFew things in this world are inspected and monitored as closely as childhood vaccinations, and for good reason. Vaccines, unlike drugs to treat illnesses, are given to healthy children in order to keep them healthy. Because of this, the standard for safety and efficacy that vaccines must clear for approval is incredibly high.\n\nWhen it comes to the Covid-19 vaccines specifically, we have had so much collective experience with their safety and efficacy. To date, over 317 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine have been given in the United States alone and the vast majority have been tolerated with no significant problems.\n\nI have also found it helpful to remember that following vaccination, immunity lasts in the body but the vaccine itself does not. Many parents have shared with me their concerns about the long-term effects of the vaccine on their kids' development, future fertility and growth. I often explain the vaccine is a type of brief message to tell the body to make the protection against the virus, and once received and acted upon, the body destroys the message.\n\nThe process of approval for vaccines\n\nIn what can at times be an overwhelming stream of news, it can be hard to keep track of just how thorough the vaccine review and approval process is in this country.\n\nBefore a pharmaceutical company can receive emergency use authorization for a vaccine, trial participants are observed for an average of two months. I find this wait requirement particularly reassuring. In decades past, when a vaccine was found to cause a rare but potentially serious side effect, it occurred within the six-week period following vaccination . The two-month average wait period is therefore a way to ensure these potential side effects have had enough time to manifest themselves before the regulators even examine the data.\n\nOnce the data is submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration, it is reviewed by the agency's independent Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) and, if appropriate, the vaccine is given EUA. From there it goes to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, where yet another group of independent experts, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), examine it and make recommendations about how the vaccine should be administered to the American public. Typically, the CDC director will accept the committee's recommendation.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nBehind the long names and acronyms, these committees are made up of some of the most brilliant scientific minds of our time, which gives me yet another reason to believe in the process.\n\nThe vaccinations children routinely receive have all been through this process over the years and have been shown to be safe and effective. This has until now led me to vaccinate my son as soon as he has been eligible against illnesses like hepatitis B, diphtheria, polio, whooping cough and others. As the Covid-19 vaccine makes its way through the regulatory process in the coming weeks, I hope to be able to tune out the noise, to set aside any anxiety and, with as clear a mind as a new mom can have, know that the FDA and CDC recommendations will be grounded in facts and made by those who have worked diligently for decades to protect our kids from potentially serious and at times deadly illnesses. I can only wish the same for you.", "authors": ["Opinion Edith Bracho-Sanchez"], "publish_date": "2022/02/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/11/18/bye-bye-bei-bei-reverse-bank-robbery-squirrel-survey-news-around-states/40639359/", "title": "Bye-bye to Bei Bei, reverse bank robbery: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The Poarch Band of Creek Indians is offering to pay the state $225 million for the exclusive right to operate casino games in Alabama. The tribe unveiled a compact proposal that includes exclusivity, table games and two new north casino sites. The state would also receive a negotiated share of the revenue. Poarch Tribal Chair Stephanie Bryan said the state has perpetual budget shortfalls, and the revenue could fill needs in education and other areas. The tribe projected it could boost state revenue by $1 billion including taxes and license fees. The proposal also includes a lottery. Dog tracks have long fought any proposal to give the tribe a monopoly. A spokeswoman for Gov. Kay Ivey says Ivey is open to recommendations, but it’s ultimately a question for legislators.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: It appears increasingly less likely that a special session of the Legislature will be held this year to address the check paid to residents from the state’s oil-wealth fund, Gov. Mike Dunleavy says. In August, Dunleavy accepted the dividend passed by lawmakers, which amounted to $1,606, but said he viewed it as partial payment and anticipated a fall special session to address the issue. Under state law, at least 30 days’ notice is needed to hold a non-emergency special session during the interim. That would push any special session now up against the holidays. The Republican governor has pushed for a dividend in line with a long-standing calculation that hasn’t been followed since 2016. Many lawmakers said such a dividend is unaffordable.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Wildlife officials say an endangered squirrel subspecies in southeastern Arizona is fighting its way back after much of its mountain habitat was burned by a 2017 wildfire. The state Game and Fish Department says the Mount Graham red squirrel’s population is stabilizing, with a 4% increase recorded in September during an annual survey that produced an estimate of 78 squirrels, up from 75 in 2018. According to the department, the population peaked at about 550 in the late 1990s. Before the 2017 wildfire, the population ranged between 200 and 300. Terrestrial wildlife specialist Tim Snow says the results are encouraging, though much work remains to help protect the squirrel population. The squirrel is found only in upper-elevation conifer forests of the Pinaleño Mountains.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The head of the city’s teachers union says another strike – or other actions – protesting state takeover of the local school district and the loss of collective bargaining rights is possible. Little Rock Education Association President Teresa Knapp Gordon spoke Friday, a day after hundreds of teachers in the system walked out for the first time in decades. Gordon called Thursday’s one-day strike in the 23,000-student district a success, saying it drew attention to the teachers’ call for a return to full local control of schools. Arkansas has run the Little Rock district since 2015, when it was taken over because of low test scores at several schools. Schools remained open during the strike, though the district said several hundred teachers and more than half the students were absent Thursday.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Author Maya Angelou and performer RuPaul are among the inductees for the next class of the California Hall of Fame. The class includes soccer player and two-time World Cup champion Brandi Chastain, skateboarder and entrepreneur Tony Hawk, actor and comedian George Lopez, chef and restaurateur Wolfgang Puck, astrophysicist France A. Cordova, author Jeanne Wakatsuki Houston, civil rights leader James M. Lawson Jr. and winemaker Helen M. Turley. The class will be inducted during a ceremony Dec. 10, though Angelou died in 2014. The California Hall of Fame started in 2006, and inductees are selected each year by the governor and first partner. Gov. Gavin Newsom, who announced the inductees, says they “embody California’s innovative spirit.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Vail residents fighting to protect habitat for a beleaguered herd of bighorn sheep as developers push to build housing for resort workers have taken their case to state court, The Denver Post reports. A lawsuit filed last week in Eagle County District Court contends Vail town officials violated local rules when they approved a Triumph Development project to build high-density worker housing along Interstate 70 where the bighorns forage during winter. The battle pits the mountain resort’s economic demands against the needs of wildlife, in this case Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep, the state animal. The Colorado bighorn population has dwindled to about 6,800, down from about 7,600 in 2012 and 8,000 in 2001, state data shows. Vail Valley bighorns have decreased to about 5% of their historic numbers.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Two new plans to improve the state’s transportation system include proposals to quicken commutes to and from New York City. Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont says it’s important for Connecticut to improve life for commuters, noting the Big Apple is the “global capital of the world,” and Connecticut is part of that metropolitan center. His 10-year, $21.3 billion transportation plan invests $6.2 billion in rail improvements, including new cars and locomotives. The state Senate Republican plan proposes a new Connecticut/New York Railroad Strategy Board to vet rail projects. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo says his state has been investing in Metro-North Railroad, which has a contract with Connecticut to operate the New Haven Line.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Twenty-two of Delaware’s 30 highest-paid state workers are men, according to salary figures from the Office and Management and Budget as of August. Of the top 10 paid men in 2019, nine earn a regular salary that tops $200,000 per year. That doesn’t include any extra pay such as stipends, benefits or overtime. Four of the top 10 paid women make that much, and the highest-paid female state worker makes less than the top three male workers.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: D.C. will have to say one of its hardest goodbyes Tuesday, to beloved panda Bei Bei, WUSA-TV reports. The 4-year-old panda will leave the Smithsonian National Zoo for China as part of the panda diplomacy program between the U.S and China. An agreement with the China Wildlife Conservation Association requires all cubs born at the zoo to move to China when they turn 4. Bei Bei will play in his outside habitat for the last time Tuesday, between 7 and 8 a.m., before he makes his way to Dulles Airport for a long flight. To give his many adoring fans time to bid Bei Bei farewell, the Smithsonian National Zoo has been hosting a series of public events, including postcard writing and friendship bracelet making. Panda Cam 1 is focused exclusively on Bei Bei for the duration of his “goodbye week.”\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Legal skirmishes over elections were fought on two fronts Friday, as a pair of federal court cases underscored the crucial role the state could play in next year’s election. Republicans and Democrats are battling over the order of names on ballots and who is eligible to vote. Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis filed an appeal Friday in a bid to lift a federal judge’s temporary order allowing some felons to regain voting rights despite failing to settle unpaid fines and other legal debts. DeSantis also said he would appeal a ruling handed down by another federal judge who sided with Democrats on name order on ballots. Judge Mark Walker agreed that a candidate whose name appears first has an undue advantage. Noting Florida’s history of close elections, he said that “systematically allocating that small but statistically significant advantage” would be constitutionally unfair. Under current law, top ballot billing goes to the governor’s party.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state’s ethics commission has filed a lawsuit seeking communications between Democrat Stacey Abrams’ unsuccessful 2018 campaign for governor and several third-party organizations. But Abrams’ former campaign manager Lauren Groh-Wargo says they’ve already turned over thousands of financial records and calls the investigation politically motivated. The Georgia Government Transparency and Campaign Finance Commission filed the motion in Fulton County Superior Court on Friday. It’s part of an investigation accusing the Abrams campaign of “unlawful coordination” with an outside organization. The commission says the campaign isn’t complying with subpoenas issued last spring. Abrams narrowly lost to Republican Gov. Brian Kemp last year. Ethics commission chief David Emadi is a former county prosecutor who had donated to Kemp’s campaign.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: After conducting an aerial survey of the island forest, officials have discovered an ohia tree-killing fungal disease local to the state is spreading on Oahu. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports state Division of Forestry and Wildlife officials tagged 41 more trees that could be ailing from rapid ohia death after first discovering an infected tree July 31. Wildlife officials say the latest confirmed tree is infected with Ceratocystis huliohia, the less aggressive fungal pathogen of two types associated with the disease. Officials say this form is known to take months to years to kill ohia trees. Officials say the more aggressive form has been discovered on Kauai and is responsible for wiping out 80% of the trees destroyed by rapid ohia death on the Big Island.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The State Board of Health and Welfare has removed a controversial rule requiring transgender minors to get a doctor’s approval before changing the gender listed on their birth certificate. The Idaho Press reports after a closed-door executive session with attorneys on Thursday, board chairman Darrell Kerby announced the rule was being vacated because it didn’t have enough votes when it was approved last spring. At that time, three board members voted “yes,” one voted “no,” and one person abstained. Kerby says that fell short of the four affirmative votes required to put the rule into effect. In 2018 a federal judge ruled that Idaho violated the constitutional rights of two transgender women who were denied permission to change the gender on their birth certificates to match their identity. Idaho complied with the court order, but the Board of Health and Welfare created the rule requiring a doctor’s sign-off for minors a short time later.\n\nIllinois\n\nO’Fallon: A $10 million pedestrian trail connecting two southwest Illinois counties has opened after 15 years of planning. The extension of the Madison County Transit Goshen Trail runs 7 miles connecting Troy in Madison County to O’Fallon in St. Clair County. The new trail is about 10 feet wide. Organizers have estimated roughly 115,000 people will use it every year, including cyclists and joggers. The initial idea came in 2003. It took time to secure ownership of properties. Funding was split among several entities, including the state, counties, a park district and the city of O’Fallon. Roughly 150 people attended the ribbon cutting Saturday. At the opening, Madison County Transit Managing Director Jerry Kane jokingly referred to it as the “It’s Finally Open Trail.”\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Christmas came early at the Indianapolis Zoo last week. The two walruses at the zoo, Pakak and Aurora, were shipped off to new homes: Aurora to SeaWorld Orlando to breed, and Pakak to the Point Defiance Zoo in Tacoma, Washington, to be reunited with the walrus with whom he was rescued. After saying goodbye, the Indianapolis Zoo welcomed 2-year-old walruses Aku and Ginger to the Oceans area. Aku is an 841-pound male who lost his right eye shortly after being rescued. Ginger is a 711-pound female who is very fond of Aku. Indianapolis Zoo public relations specialist Carla Knapp says the zoo is very hopeful the two walruses will eventually breed. According to a release, walruses are vulnerable to extinction, and there are only 14 in human care across four zoos and aquariums in the United States. Climate change and melting ice have resulted in fewer habitats for walruses.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Organizers of a new statewide bicycle ride are changing the date of their planned event so it doesn’t conflict with an annual ride that dates to the 1970s. Organizers of Iowa’s Ride announced Friday on the group’s Facebook page that the ride would be held July 12-18, a week earlier than previously planned. The change means the ride won’t overlap with the Des Moines Register’s Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa, or RAGBRAI, scheduled for July 19-25. Iowa’s Ride also will move from east to west, while RAGBRAI traditionally travels west to east. The former director of RAGBRAI and his staff resigned and launched the rival event amid a backlash over the Register’s handling of a story involving fundraiser Carson King.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: The city has joined a community coalition to memorialize the lynching of three black men near downtown in 1882. The Lawrence chapter of the NAACP is working with the Equal Justice Initiative to erect a historical marker with information about the lynching, The Lawrence Journal-World reports. The city commission recently voted unanimously to become a member of the Community Remembrance Coalition. Mayor Lisa Larsen says she thinks joining the coalition signifies that the city supports the NAACP’s efforts. NAACP chapter President Ursula Minor wrote in a letter to Larsen that the purpose of the coalition is to build awareness and enable truthful conversations about the legacy of racial terrorism and injustice through the historical marker project. The Lawrence NAACP has been working on the project for several months.\n\nKentucky\n\nBowling Green: The Kentucky Folklife Program at Western Kentucky University is looking for proposals for articles and other pieces documenting the state’s folklife. The program said in a news release that this is the first call for proposals for the multimedia digital publication and said the magazine “explores the diversity of expressive cultures within Kentucky.” In addition to articles, the magazine is looking for ideas for photo essays, documentary film and audio, interviews, and oral histories and performances. Proposals of about 200 to 400 words can be submitted to kyfolklife@wku.edu with the subject heading “Kentucky Folklife Magazine Proposal.” Published features receive a contributor’s honorarium.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The governor says the state’s fishing industry has been hit with $258 million in losses due to historic flooding this year. In a news release, Gov. John Bel Edwards says the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries conducted an economic impact analysis to determine the flooding impacts. The analysis was submitted to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to help the state qualify for part of the fisheries disaster assistance. Edwards also asked the state’s congressional delegation for help in a letter Friday. According to the analysis, the private lease oyster industry was the hardest hit with $121 million in losses. Heavy rains in the Midwest kept the Mississippi River at flood stage for extended periods of time and forced the opening of the Bonnet Carre Spillway two times.\n\nMaine\n\nScarborough: A Maine-based supermarket chain says it’s launching a new initiative to tackle hunger and food insecurity in children, starting with a $1 million donation. Hannaford Supermarkets says it’s calling the project “Fuel Kids at School.” The company says it will work with hunger relief groups to establish 90 school food pantries in Maine and other states in the Northeast. Hannaford says it expects the effort to take two years. Company President Mike Vail says the goal of the effort is for “access to food to be easy for kids.” The company says the pantries will be located inside schools and will allow students to choose foods they can eat during and after the school day.\n\nMaryland\n\nBel Air: Police have arrested a bank teller accused of breaking into the home of a customer who had recently withdrawn a large sum of money. The Harford County Sheriff’s Office said in a release that 19-year-old Nathan Michael Newell assaulted a 78-year-old man and his stepdaughter Monday night inside a Bel Air home. He got away but was arrested at the bank Wednesday. Freedom Federal Credit Union president and CEO Michael MacPherson told The Baltimore Sun that Newell has been fired. Charging documents say Newell confessed to the crime and said he did it because he was tired of working two jobs. Harford County Sheriff Jeff Gahler told WJZ-TV it was “almost like a reverse bank robbery,” and he hadn’t seen anything like it in 34 years in law enforcement.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The state’s cranberry growers are getting assistance to help overhaul their bogs. Gov. Charlie Baker’s administration says 21 growers have received a total of nearly $1 million for bog renovation projects. The new grant program is meant to help growers reduce their environmental impact while making their bogs more efficient and productive. Farmers are receiving state grants to reconfigure bogs, improve irrigation systems and plant higher-yield cranberry varieties. Baker says the effort comes from a 2016 recommendation from the state’s Cranberry Revitalization Task Force. The price of cranberries has plummeted 57% over the past decade as the industry struggles with overproduction and weakening demand for cranberry juice. Massachusetts is the nation’s second-largest cranberry growing region after Wisconsin. It has 363 farms on more than 13,555 acres.\n\nMichigan\n\nLeland: A late 19th-century shipwreck has been discovered in northern Lake Michigan. MLive reports the discovery of W.C. Kimball was announced last week with photos and videos documenting the details on social media. Shipwreck hunter Ross Richardson, technical diver Steve Wimer and a group of other wreck enthusiasts documented its position in May. Richardson initially found it more than a year ago on his boat’s sonar screen. He was passing through the lake when he noticed a small blip. At first, there was speculation the Kimball was run over by a larger ship. But the condition of the boat has ruled out that claim. The ship was lost in an 1891 storm with four people aboard. Richardson’s website account notes that it was set to round the Leelanau Peninsula.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The president of Macalester College is asking his board of trustees to remove the school founder’s name from a campus building over concerns about his racist and sexist views in the 1800s. The Star Tribune reports that Brian Rosenberg, leader of the private liberal arts college, told faculty last week that he planned to strip Edward Duffield Neill’s name from the humanities building, following pressure from student activists and journalists. Neill Hall was chosen in 2013. Rosenberg said in a statement to the newspaper that his recommendation “is based on the racism reflected in his historical writings, which are extreme even by the standards of his time.” The decision came two weeks after the student publication Mac Weekly published a special issue citing numerous examples of derogatory comments Neill made about American Indians in his published writings.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The governor has announced more than $53 million in projects to help coastal communities recover from the 2010 BP oil spill. Money for the 15 projects is coming from civil and criminal penalties resulting from the spill. They include $8 million to find and counter sources of coastal water pollution and $7 million to restore and create wetlands with dredged silt. Projects totaling at least $10 million are aimed at economic recovery. Those include $3 million each to improve the Interstate 10 commercial corridor in Moss Point, to help build an information systems job training center at a community college and to improve a public marina in Biloxi. Nearly $6 million would continue assessing reef fish in coastal and nearshore Gulf of Mexico waters.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue says he has “absolutely zero regrets” over the decision to move two research agencies’ headquarters from Washington, D.C., to Kansas City. Perdue joined government leaders from Kansas and Missouri on Friday to tour the new headquarters for the Economic Research Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture. Critics say the move will harm agriculture research and make the findings less accessible to federal policymakers. Perdue contends moving the agencies to the heart of agriculture country will allow researchers to work more closely with farmers, land grant universities and private agriculture-related companies. But Laura Dodson, an agricultural economist and union representative at the Economic Research Service, said the agencies’ researchers focus on national questions, and living near agricultural land is irrelevant to the work they do.\n\nMontana\n\nTroy: A moose tested positive for chronic wasting disease, marking the first time the disease has been detected in the species in the state. A hunter harvested the bull moose in late October near Pulpit Mountain west of Quartz Creek and north of Troy. The harvest occurred less than half a mile to the west of the existing Libby CWD Management Zone. CWD is a fatal disease that can affect the nervous system of mule deer, white-tailed deer, elk and moose. Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks collected the voluntary sample from the moose and submitted it for testing to the Veterinary Diagnostic Lab at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, Colorado. The lab identified it to be suspected of CWD infection and confirmed the positive detection with a second test.\n\nNebraska\n\nValentine: The state Transportation Department is reporting progress in restoring traffic on floodwater-covered highways in the Sandhills region. The department said Thursday that normal, two-lane traffic is returning to U.S. Highway 83 between Thedford and Valentine, and one lane of traffic has been restored on Nebraska Highway 97 south of Merritt Reservoir. The department also says it plans to raise a portion of the roadbed this week on Nebraska Highway 61 between Hyannis and Merriman. Unusually high rainfall since spring flooded Sandhills marshes and ponds, resulting in floodwaters covering nearby highways and county roads.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Nineteen unvaccinated students were forced to temporarily unenroll from a local high school to avoid exposure during an outbreak of whooping cough. Unenrolling during the disease’s 21-day incubation period allows the Damonte Ranch High School students to avoid being classified as chronically absent. The 19 affected students claimed a religious exemption from the vaccine for whooping cough. The Washoe County Health Department says they should avoid going to school until 21 days after the last student was diagnosed. A school district official says the students will be in touch with their teachers and won’t be held back. She says absences because of a lack of vaccination can’t be excused under federal law. Three students at the school have been diagnosed with whooping cough.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: The Currier Museum of Art on Friday acquired a second New Hampshire home designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. The Kalil House in Manchester was built in 1957 and is an example of the “Usonian Automatic” houses Wright designed as a more moderately priced option for the postwar middle class. The two-bedroom house, which includes the original furniture and fixtures, is made of modular concrete blocks made in Manchester and mahogany imported from the Philippines. It was built for Dr. Toufic and Mildred Kalil, who were inspired by the home of a friend whose Wright house had been built on the same street a few years earlier. That property, the Zimmerman house, was left to the Currier in 1988. The Kalil house went on sale this year. The Currier said an anonymous donor provided the funds.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nPleasantville: More piping plover pairs nested in the state this year – 114 compared with 98 last year – with an average of 1.24 young per nest reaching independence, The Press of Atlantic City reports. That’s a 19% increase in pairs, according to the 2019 nesting results report by the Conserve Wildlife Foundation of New Jersey and the New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife Endangered and Nongame Species Program. But it’s still not back to the long-term average of 117 pairs and is well below the peak of 144 in 2003, the report states. Depredation, particularly by red foxes, continues to plague the endangered species that must build its nest in small impressions on beach sand. But residents in Brigantine and Stone Harbor have protested state programs to protect the plovers by trapping and killing red foxes there.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Vegas: New Mexico Highlands University says it’s developing a special anthropology master’s degree program focused on cultural resource management. If approved by higher education officials, the program would be delivered through distance learning. Highlands professor Orit Tamir developed the proposal with the goal of preparing people to work in the private sector or with tribal, state and federal agencies. In New Mexico, Tamir says, a master’s degree in anthropology is needed to be a principal or lead investigator on a cultural resources project or other forms of professional anthropology analysis. University Provost Roxanne Gonzales says offering the program through distance learning will allow working professionals to bolster their skills and make themselves more marketable. The program could begin as soon as fall 2020 once it gets final approval.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Winter hasn’t officially begun, but state officials are already urging families to start thinking about summer camp. Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner Basil Seggos says online registration for the agency’s 2020 summer camps opens Jan. 26. Parents are encouraged to register early because some weeks fill up quickly. The department operates four residential camps: Colby in Saranac Lake, Camp DeBruce in Livingston Manor, Camp Rushford in Caneadea and Pack Forest in Warrensburg. The camps offer weeklong programs in conservation education for children ages 11 through 17. Activities include fishing, bird watching, fly-tying, archery, canoeing, hiking, camping, orienteering and hunter safety. One week of camp costs $350 per child.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nPittsboro: Authorities say three people were arrested during a protest near a Confederate statue slated for removal. The News & Observer reports a fight erupted Saturday in Pittsboro when protesters who oppose the statue’s removal complained about counterprotesters standing near a protester’s vehicle. The Chatham County Sheriff’s Office said 52-year-old Allan Wayne Hall was charged with inciting a riot and simple affray; 29-year-old Calvin James Megginson was charged with simple assault; and 63-year-old Robert Butler was charged with inciting a riot. All three live in Pittsboro. On Wednesday, a judge lifted an injunction that has blocked the county from removing the statue from where it has stood outside a courthouse since 1907. Several people have been arrested at previous protests.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: A police sergeant has undergone a four-hour surgery after shooting himself in the hand. KFGO radio reports Sgt. Matt Ysteboe was hurt Friday while hunkering down after a man fired a gun toward officers. Fargo Police Chief David Todd says Ysteboe suffered a serious injury. No further information about Ysteboe’s condition was released. Todd says the 54-year-old suspect shot a revolver with a laser in the direction of officers and fired additional shots in the Radisson Hotel lobby, where he was arrested. No other injuries were reported. Ysteboe, who was the night shift supervisor Friday, has been with the department since 2001. He was promoted to sergeant in 2016.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A group of conservative lawmakers in the state has introduced a bill to outlaw abortion outright. State Rep. Candice Keller, a Republican from Middletown, says backers are tired of taking an incremental approach to ending abortion. The legislation was introduced Thursday. It declares a fetus a person and would subject doctors who terminate pregnancies to potential murder charges. The bill appears to make an exception for the life of the mother. Ohio is among states that have passed restrictive abortion laws in recent years in hopes of sparking a legal challenge that would overturn Roe v. Wade. The conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court has emboldened abortion opponents. The Ohio bill is opposed by abortion rights groups. The state’s largest anti-abortion group is remaining neutral.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The Oklahoma Court of Civil Appeals has upheld the class action designation of a lawsuit against an oil company over damage caused by earthquakes near Prague in November 2011, including one of magnitude 5.7. The court on Friday rejected the appeal of New Dominion LLC in the lawsuit filed by Jennifer Lin Cooper. Three other oil companies originally included in the lawsuit agreed to a settlement in December. The lawsuit alleges saltwater disposal wells led to the earthquakes. The 5.7 magnitude quake was the largest ever recorded in Oklahoma until a magnitude 5.8 temblor struck near Pawnee in 2016. The lawsuit would include residents in Lincoln, Payne, Logan, Oklahoma, Cleveland, Pottawatomie, Seminole, Okfuskee and Creek counties who had earthquake-related property damage.\n\nOregon\n\nCoos Bay: The proposed Jordan Cove liquefied natural gas terminal and its 230-mile feeder pipeline in southern Oregon would have some adverse and significant impacts, according to staff at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports the agency’s staff issued their final environmental analysis of the contentious natural gas export project Friday, concluding it would result in “temporary, long-term and permanent impacts on the environment.” The report says the project would impact Coos Bay and 18 threatened and endangered species. The report says many of those impacts would not be significant or could be reduced to less than significant levels with avoidance and mitigation measures.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Discussions on raising the state’s minimum wage for the first time since 2009 are heating up, in part to get Gov. Tom Wolf to abandon an effort to extend overtime pay eligibility to tens of thousands of additional workers. Negotiators are up against a Thursday deadline, when a state rule-making board is scheduled to vote on an overtime regulation proposed by Wolf. If Wolf, a Democrat, is to get the GOP-controlled Legislature to agree to raise the minimum wage, he’ll have to make concessions, including rescinding the overtime proposal. The increase under negotiation is far more modest than what Wolf proposed in January when he pushed for a multiyear increase to $15 an hour in 2025. The discussion revolves around increasing the minimum wage to about $9.50 an hour in steps over 18 months or so, while Wolf would have to drop elements of his January proposal, including eliminating Pennsylvania’s tipped wage minimum, now $2.83.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Gov. Gina Raimondo has announced her plan to make construction of new homes a priority as the state joins its neighbors at a “tipping point” of high housing costs. The Providence Journal reports Raimondo has not committed to any specific policy for dealing with the state’s housing issue in 2020 but has reiterated that having secure housing is a “moral” and “economic” imperative. The Democratic governor says the issue is one of supply and demand in which not enough homes are being built to meet the market’s demand and the affordable housing bonds are not enough to help fill the gap. The newspaper reports the state’s housing market has come back somewhat after the recession, but as home prices rise steadily, construction of new units remains idle.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The University of South Carolina is investigating members of a fraternity who a television reporter says made sexist and offensive remarks to her while she was working. WACH-TV says reporter Brittany Breeding was covering Lambda Chi Alpha’s four-year suspension Monday when some fraternity members yelled out derogatory remarks at her. University spokesman Jeff Stensland says a staff member witnessed the harassment and reported it. Fraternity spokesman Tad Lichtenauer says it expects ethical behavior from all students and takes harassment allegations seriously. News outlets report Lambda Chi Alpha had already been suspended from the school’s campus until 2023 because of hazing allegations involving violence and alcohol.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: An organization in the state has received a national award for its work in immigration and justice. South Dakota Voices for Peace was named a winner of the J.M.K. Innovation Prize, which is given to groups working on social challenges in the United States, according to a news release from the J.M. Kaplan Fund. South Dakota Voices for Peace, along with its sister organization South Dakota Voices for Justice, aims to counter anti-immigrant, anti-refugee and anti-Muslim legislation as well as build a rural model to sustain immigration services. The award is given out every other year to 10 organizations nationwide. Each awardee receives up to $175,000 over three years and the ability to work with other social justice organizations.\n\nTennessee\n\nChattanooga: Volkswagen plans to donate $1.25 million to help expand Cherokee National Forest near the company’s Chattanooga plant and offer community grants. The Conservation Fund has announced a collaboration with Volkswagen to open three tracts near the plant for outdoor public recreation and to protect the habitat for the black bear and the Indiana bat. Volkswagen is using $200,000 of the $1.25 million on community grants up to $50,000 each to help nonprofits, schools and public agencies improve water quality, increase outdoor recreation access and advance environmental education. Volkswagen broke ground Wednesday on an $800 million expansion to make electric cars in Chattanooga. The company has sought to transform itself after the 2015 diesel scandal, in which Volkswagen was caught using software to cheat on emissions testing.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Planned Parenthood gave up roughly $60 million when it left a federal family planning program this year in opposition to a new Trump administration rule prohibiting clinics from referring women for abortions. In Texas, a network of eight Christian pregnancy centers is jockeying for that Title X funding as it makes plans to take the unprecedented step of offering unmarried women contraceptives next year. The move by The Source marks a turning point for faith-based pregnancy centers that are opposed to abortions and typically do not provide birth control, while they instead preach abstinence outside of marriage. Andy Schoonover, chief executive for The Source, said the nonprofit organization will add contraception options including pills, injections and intrauterine devices to its services. The chain of clinics will not provide the morning-after pill or copper-based IUDs.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Karen Pence visited the city to file paperwork to put President Donald Trump on the state’s GOP primary ballot in the 2020 presidential race. The Deseret News reports Vice President Mike Pence’s wife told supporters Friday that the race will be close. She also highlighted Trump’s support of religious liberty and other conservative values. Republican Sen. Mike Lee will serve as co-chairman of the president’s re-election campaign in the state – a turnaround from 2016, when he led a fight against Trump’s nomination. Lee says he took the “scenic route” to becoming a Trump supporter and respects him for keeping campaign promises. Reps. Chris Stewart and Rob Bishop as well as former Sen. Orrin Hatch are also among the honorary co-chairmen of the Trump Victory campaign in Utah.\n\nVermont\n\nBellows Falls: A community group is attempting to save a former YMCA building that the town wants to demolish. Elijah Zimmer told village trustees last week that the group has received an emergency grant to evaluate the structure and has applied for emergency repair funds. The Brattleboro Reformer reports the structure was built in 1835. It used to be a YMCA and at one time was a church. Zimmer says the building, if restored, could provide a large community space that Bellows Falls lacks. Trustees say the structure is so deteriorated that it isn’t safe to have workers inside, and money is being spent on barriers. Trustees voted to pursue legal options for demolition, but some said they hope Zimmer can save the building.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Three African American lawmakers are expected to lead powerful legislative committees next year in the House of Delegates. Black legislators haven’t led a House committee in two decades. Democratic Del. Eileen Filler-Corn, who is set to be the next House speaker, announced the heads of four legislative committees Thursday. Three of the four are African American. Del. Luke Torian will lead the House Appropriations Committee; Del. Jeion Ward will lead the House Commerce and Labor Committee; and Del. Roslyn Tyler will lead the House Education Committee. Democrats flipped control of the Virginia’s General Assembly in legislative elections this month.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Military families have raised concerns saying housing at Joint Base Lewis-McChord made them sick. KOMO-TV reports multiple families who were living on the base are now living in motels and recreational vehicles because of moldy conditions. Private company officials from Lincoln Military Housing say they are working to fix the problem. Army wife Kelsey White says the mold gave her family serious health issues, including her 7-month-old son. Company officials say the White family was put in a motel and then moved to an RV because no other on-base housing was offered. Company officials say they are preparing a statement in response to concerns. Attorneys for the White family and 22 other military families expect to file a lawsuit in the next few months.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMorgantown: A library says violent threats prompted it to cancel an event where drag queens were going to read to children. The Morgantown Public Library System announced it was canceling its Drag Queen Story Time event in a Facebook post Friday. The statement cited “multiple threats of violence against the volunteer readers” as the reason for the cancellation. A voicemail left at the library wasn’t immediately returned. The library’s statement says it “remains committed to fostering a love of reading for all ages” and will instead have its staffers read for the event Saturday morning. Libraries and bookstores across the country have had similar events where men in drag read stories to kids, with some drawing protests.\n\nWisconsin\n\nFlorence: Florence County, in rural northeastern Wisconsin, has declared itself a Second Amendment sanctuary, a move commissioners say is designed to send a “keep your hands off our guns” message to politicians. The nonbinding measure gives the sheriff the ability to “exercise sound discretion to not enforce against any citizen an unconstitutional firearms law.” Florence County Supervisor Edwin Kelley says a recent call by Gov. Tony Evers for gun control action has made his constituents nervous. Sheriff Dan Miller says people who live “up north” tend to be more conservative and like their guns. He says the ordinance “sends a message that all of Wisconsin is not exactly the same.” The ordinance doesn’t mean firearms will not be taken away from convicted felons or in criminal cases, including domestic violence or drugs.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Lawmakers have decided against giving college students more state scholarship money for high grades. The Joint Education Interim Committee voted 8-5 against the proposal Thursday in Cheyenne. The bill would have enabled students to boost Hathaway Scholarship funding by maintaining a 3.75 GPA for two consecutive semesters. The Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports some lawmakers worry GPA-based incentives would be unfair for students seeking certain degrees. Students can use the Hathaway Scholarship at the University of Wyoming or any in-state community college. The bill would have increased the amount awarded through the scholarships by $3.6 million annually. Democratic Sen. Chris Rothfuss, of Laramie, says he would rather use the increase for more scholarship funding overall.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/12/11/speakers-death-concert-memorial-open-playgrounds-news-around-states/115133114/", "title": "Speaker's death, concert memorial: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Before his death from COVID-19, former state senator Larry Dixon spoke to his wife of 53 years from his hospital bed and asked her to relay a warning. “Sweetheart, we messed up. We just dropped our guard,” Dr. David Thrasher, a pulmonologist and friend of Dixon, recalled him saying. Dixon, 78, died Friday from complications of COVID-19. Thrasher said his longtime friend had been mostly careful but may have contracted the virus after gathering with friends. “Larry has been conscientious with masks, doing everything right, social distancing since March … he made one slip-up,” Thrasher said. Three people at the gathering became ill, he said. “The last thing he told her was, ‘Gaynell, I love you. We’ve got to tell people this is real,’ ” Thrasher said. He said he’s telling his friend’s story with the family’s permission in the hopes that people can learn just how easily the virus can spread at casual gatherings. He said it is also important for people to seek medical care when they first get sick.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Officials at the state’s largest homeless shelter are optimistic that demand for services has stabilized for now. The emergency mass shelter at Anchorage’s Sullivan Arena serves 400 people, with about 200 more at a newly opened shelter at the Fairview Recreation Center and in hotel rooms funded by the city, Alaska Public Media reports. There are more people in the Anchorage shelter system now than there have been during any other year on record, Anchorage Housing and Homeless Services Coordinator Nancy Burke said. However, a moratorium on evictions of people behind on rent payments because of the coronavirus pandemic is scheduled to end Dec. 31. “People, frankly, are running out of money with the assistance that was coming in from the federal government,” Burke said. “So we could see an increase even beyond what we’ve seen so far.” Sullivan Arena workers observed an increase in demand as temperatures dropped in recent months. They laid out extra floor mats to increase capacity, but demand has continued rising, said Cathleen McLaughlin, who oversees that shelter.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A judge has ruled the city erroneously excluded immigrants from receiving coronavirus aid to cover utility bills, mortgage and rental costs. The city required applicants to its $25 million utility, rent and mortgage assistance program to provide proof of legal status in the United States. The coronavirus’ current surge saw Arizona on Thursday report nearly 5,000 additional known COVID-19 cases, the eighth day in the past 10 that the state has reported over 4,000 additional cases. It added a record 12,314 cases Tuesday. U.S. District Judge Dominic Lanza concluded Wednesday that Phoenix isn’t required to exclude unqualified immigrants from participating because the assistance program falls within exceptions in federal law for “short-term, non-cash, in-kind emergency disaster relief.” The judge said the city’s decision to exclude immigrants was trumped by federal law. The judge said the city has said its decision to exclude immigrants wasn’t a policy decision but rather based solely on its interpretation of federal law. Lanza said Phoenix has indicated it will begin allowing immigrants to participate in the program in the future.\n\nArkansas\n\nMountain Home: The Baxter County Library is hosting a virtual visit from Santa Claus on Saturday morning, live from 9 to 10 a.m. Viewers can wear pajamas, drink milk and eat cookies at home while joining a special live Storytime with Santa on Facebook Live on the Baxter County Library’s page. They can enjoy time with Santa to sing songs and listen to stories. Those unable to join during the live Storytime can visit the library’s YouTube channel. To keep up with other programs happening at the library, visit the library’s website at baxlib.org.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state changed its rules overnight Wednesday to allow outdoor playgrounds to stay open in regions under strict stay-home orders, apparently swayed by broad criticism that closing them would harm children who have few options to safely romp outside. On its website, the state said playgrounds could stay open to “facilitate physically distanced personal health and wellness through outdoor exercise.” Ali Bay, a spokesperson for California’s Department of Public Health, said in an email that the change was new as of Wednesday morning, and the department was working to share the news more broadly. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has come under heavy criticism for the closure of children’s playgrounds when the administration has repeatedly said being outdoors is safer than being indoors, and there is little evidence of virus spread on playground structures. Playground advocates have said children need fresh air and exercise for their emotional and physical health, and many don’t have access to private backyards. Fraught parents also need a place to take their cooped-up kids, advocates said.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A Colorado Springs barbershop owner has sued the governor in relation to roughly $4 million in coronavirus relief designated for minority-owned small businesses, claiming the funding is unconstitutional, and the race-based requirement should be removed. Locals Barbershop owner Etienne Hardre, who is white, filed the lawsuit against Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, the state minority business office and its director. Hardre argued the aid intended for businesses that are at least 51% minority-owned is based entirely on race and is discriminatory, The Denver Post reports. “The Supreme Court has held that if you are going to do race-conscious measures, you are required to specify the past or present discrimination you are remedying,” Hardre’s attorney Michael Kuhn said. “And societal, so-called systemic racism isn’t sufficient.” The lawsuit said Hardre lost a third of his barbershop’s revenue during the pandemic, but since he is white, he can’t receive the aid designated for minority-owned businesses. “We have nothing against minorities, minorities are fantastic,” Hardre said. “However, everybody, all Americans, all Coloradans have been hurt. Business owners of all kinds, whites as well as minorities.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A coalition of public education unions is demanding that schools shift to full-time remote learning if statewide COVID-19 safety protocols and a uniform policy for reporting and responding to positive cases are not required. The group, which submitted a petition signed by nearly 14,000 education and community members to Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont’s office Thursday, contends that policies are inconsistent by district and that teachers and staff, as well as students, are being put at risk for contracting COVID-19. “What we know is that in different places in Connecticut, in different districts, superintendents are under tremendous pressure to try to make sure that every kid is coming into school,” said Jeff Leake, president of the Connecticut Education Association, the state’s largest teachers union. He said there are some districts where students are not wearing masks, and superintendents are not sending them home, as well as schools where the standard 6 feet of social distancing has dropped to 3 feet or less. Meanwhile, union officials acknowledged that social distancing and other safety measures are working in some districts and said those schools should remain open.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The state reported records Wednesday for its daily average of new coronavirus cases and for hospitalizations. The state reported 925 new cases, the second most it’s reported in a single day trailing only last Thursday, when there were 936 new cases. The seven-day average for new cases increased to 810.9. The daily case average record has been broken in 11 consecutive days. On the day after Delaware surpassed its spring peak, the number of hospitalizations in the state increased by 10 to 348. Based on the increasing case counts over the past several weeks, the number of hospitalizations will likely continue to increase and threaten the state’s capacity to treat COVID-19 patients. “Those hospitalization numbers are as real as real can be,” Gov. John Carney said Tuesday. Since the start of November, the average daily case count has quintupled. It’s increased from 531.4 to 810.9 (a 52.6% rise) since the start of December. Increased testing accounts for some of the increase, but the percentage of tests that are positive is also rising, with the seven-day average now 10%, the highest it’s been this fall.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C., wants the National Park Service to ensure its employees are safe from contracting COVID-19 and asked NPS in a letter to close monument access and visitor centers even more amid the pandemic, WUSA-TV reports. Norton sent a letter to Margaret Everson, acting director of NPS, about the safety of employees amid the highest levels yet of the coronavirus in the capital region, the congresswoman’s office said in a statement. Norton’s letter asked Everson to close the Washington Monument, visitor centers, and any other indoor properties in the National Capital Region until this wave of the virus has subsided. “I understand that there have been at least four cases of COVID-19 and one hospitalization among NPS employees who work on the National Mall,” Norton said. “NPS employees need to be able to protect themselves and their families during this time of crisis.”\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Democrats in the state Senate on Thursday called on Gov. Ron DeSantis to either lead the state’s coronavirus fight or get out of the way and allow the Legislature to do it. Gathered in a video conference on Facebook, the group accused the Republican governor of rarely being seen or heard since the Nov. 3 election, maintaining a tight grip on public information about the virus, and politicizing a public health crisis. Some public health officials criticized Florida’s lifting of restrictions over the summer and DeSantis’ resistance to a statewide mask mandate as reckless. “A mask is not a symbol of liberty. It is a tool that will stop the spread of this terrible disease and save lives,” said Sen. Tina Polsky, D-Boca Raton. Talking to reporters two weeks ago, DeSantis mocked mask mandates and lockdowns as ineffective tools to fight the virus. And this past weekend, he hosted Republican Party activists at the Governor’s Mansion. In tweeted photos, it appeared no one was wearing masks.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: As COVID-19 continues to rise in Georgia, state Supreme Court Chief Justice Harold D. Martin is urging the state’s courts to reevaluate resuming jury trials and other in-person court proceedings. In a statement Wednesday, Melton said judges may need to reverse course on the in-person hearings if the spread of the virus prevents them from doing so safely. Melton made the statement after signing his ninth order extending the statewide judicial emergency he first announced March 14 due to the pandemic. “While this order does not impose a blanket shutdown of non-essential in-person proceedings, courts should remain vigilant of changing COVID-19 conditions and be prepared to suspend jury trials as necessary and to reconsider grand jury proceedings as well,” the order says. It also urged courts to conduct proceedings remotely if possible. “We recognize there is such a thing as Zoom fatigue,” the chief justice said. “But we urge people not to get weary just yet.” The latest order extends the judicial emergency another 30 days to Jan. 8.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state’s biggest surfing competition of the year has started amid ongoing concerns about the spread of the coronavirus among fans eager to watch the action. The 2020 Billabong Pipe Masters began Tuesday on Oahu’s North Shore and is scheduled to run through Dec. 20, with crowds watching surfers ride waves reaching up to 30 feet high, Hawaii Public Radio reports. Hundreds of spectators were at Ehukai Beach Park on the first day, with few wearing masks and limited social distancing. The World Surf League, which organizes the annual event, has changed the format in an attempt to reduce the large crowds associated with pro surfing contests. The organization is trying to minimize the in-person audience by eliminating announcers and other public attractions that are normally staples of surfing events, said Michele Nekota of the Honolulu Department of Parks and Recreation, which issues permits for the competitions. “They are basically advertising as a virtual event, so we’re having competitors, but not spectators,” Nekota said. Mailers were sent to North Shore households urging residents to stream the event live from home.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little said Thursday that residents can expect diminished health care if hospitals fill with COVID-19 patients and the state has to initiate crisis standards of care. The Republican governor warned of the impending standards during a news conference on the same day health officials announced COVID-19 was the state’s leading cause of death in November. Little also said county morgues were asking for mobile refrigerators to hold bodies. The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare said the illness killed 247 people last month. COVID-19 has killed just over 1,100 residents to date, making it the third-leading cause of death in Idaho for the year. That’s about four to five times the number of annual deaths from flu and pneumonia. More than 116,000 residents have been infected. A northern Idaho doctor who took part in the news conference said some of them could face lasting lung damage from the disease. “This is not like any virus I’ve ever seen,” said Robert Scoggins, a doctor at Kootenai Health in Coeur d’Alene who specializes in pulmonary diseases and critical care medicine.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Public health officials on Wednesday reported 179 deaths related to COVID-19 in the state. That’s the fourth-highest single-day fatality total since the coronavirus entered Illinois in February. The largest total was 238 on Dec. 2. Officials are still expecting darker days ahead – a surge of new cases of COVID-19 and deaths to accompany them because of holiday gatherings where the virus can spread. But the number of fresh infections recorded Wednesday was 8,256, marking the fifth day in a row the number has fallen below 10,000. There were 5,284 COVID-19 patients hospitalized, a number that has not been lower than 5,000 since Nov. 10. There was a slight uptick from the previous day in the sickest patients, with 1,176 in intensive care and 647 on ventilators. Overall, 13,666 Illinoisans have died as a result of COVID-19 complications, and 812,430 have tested positive for the virus.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state’s hospitals will have to postpone elective surgeries starting next week under an order the governor said Wednesday was needed to free up hospital capacity amid steep recent increases in serious COVID-19 illnesses. An initial shipment of some 55,000 doses of the first coronavirus vaccine is expected to arrive at Indiana hospitals next week as front-line health care workers start to receive shots. Gov. Eric Holcomb said hospitals were being directed to postpone all non-urgent inpatient surgeries beginning Dec. 16 through Jan. 3. Holcomb said Indiana is “on fire” with coronavirus spread, as the number of counties with the highest risk level of coronavirus spread more than doubled in the state health department’s weekly update. The state halted elective medical procedures for most of April, but Holcomb lifted that restriction as concerns eased about availability of equipment and protective gear. But Indiana’s hospitals are currently treating more than quadruple the number of COVID-19 patients than they were in September, with health officials worried about facilities being overwhelmed.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Public health officials posted another 99 coronavirus-related deaths Thursday, raising the state’s death toll to 3,120. The state this week modified the methodology for counting COVID-19 deaths, which has added 399 deaths to the state total in the past three days. COVID-19 cases increased by 2,246, pushing the state total to 251,028. Hospitalizations and admissions were lower Thursday, with 863 people hospitalized with COVID-19. Hospitalizations and new positive cases have been trending lower, giving health care officials hope that Iowa may not see the spike in virus activity after Thanksgiving that was anticipated. “I still think we’re not out of the danger zone. We’re still facing a winter season that’s going to keep people indoors,” said University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics CEO Suresh Gunasekaran. “There’s going to be an opportunity with another holiday season right around us to be vulnerable for this.” Vaccinations of front-line health care workers and nursing home residents and employees may begin next week, but the White House Coronavirus Task Force warns against complacency about mask-wearing, distancing and handwashing.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly on Wednesday imposed stronger coronavirus testing rules for several hundred state-licensed nursing homes that will have most of them testing their employees twice a week. The executive order on testing comes as Kansas waits to receive its first shipments of a vaccine made by Pfizer. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is expected to consider within days whether to authorize emergency use of the two-dose vaccine. If it does, the state expects the first shipments by the end of next week. The order affecting nursing homes applies to more than 470 facilities and imposes the same testing requirements already faced by about 360 homes in Kansas licensed by the federal government. The rules require greater testing of employees if a county’s rate of positive tests grows. “Now that we have broader testing capacity in the state, it’s really a commonsense measure,” Laura Howard, the top administrator at the state Department for Aging and Disability Services, said during a Statehouse news conference.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Legislative Republicans who expanded their supermajorities in last month’s election were given a mandate by voters to put limits on the Democratic governor’s executive powers in times of emergency, a leading GOP lawmaker said Wednesday. Senate Republican leaders outlined main issues awaiting them when the General Assembly convenes in January for a 30-day session. Passing another state budget tops the agenda, but debate about limiting the scope of a governor’s emergency powers will be a priority, too. Kentucky’s response to the coronavirus threat “pointed out holes” in state laws and the constitution, Senate Majority Floor Leader Damon Thayer said. The push to rein in the governor’s authority represents something of a turnabout from the position Republican lawmakers generally took with Beshear’s predecessor, GOP Gov. Matt Bevin, when they largely stood by as he wielded his gubernatorial powers. But Bevin didn’t confront a crisis on the scale of the global pandemic during his one term in office. Beshear spokeswoman Crystal Staley responded that it’s “unfortunate” the governor is being attacked while he’s “focused on defeating COVID-19 and saving lives.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nConvent: St. James Parish canceled its annual Christmas Eve bonfire celebration due to an increase in coronavirus cases, officials said. Parish officials called off the event Wednesday after discussing possible plans with the State Fire Marshal’s office, news outlets report. Officials said they were concerned about the crowds the event could bring in and how they could maintain social distancing, as the event runs for miles along the Mississippi River levee. The two groups tried to find an alternative way to hold the bonfire safely, but rising COVID-19 cases halted the discussion. On Wednesday, the parish said its positivity rate had nearly doubled, hitting 16.9%. “This was by no means an easy decision to make, as this tradition is long-standing and special to our community in particular,” parish officials said Wednesday. “We understand this has been an extremely difficult year for many of us, and we have hoped for a sense of normalcy in the Christmas season especially; however, we must first and foremost protect the health, safety and well-being of our residents.” The Christmas Eve bonfire celebrations in St. James and other river parishes may have begun in the late 1800s. The bonfires are tepee-shaped and are said to light the way for Papa Noel on his nighttime ride to deliver gifts.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The bishop of Maine’s Roman Catholic diocese is calling on all Christians – and everyone else – to get the coronavirus vaccine when it’s available to them. Bishop Robert Deeley of the Diocese of Portland said he has been fielding questions from Christians in the state about his perspective on the vaccine. He said Thursday that he unequivocally supports vaccines for everyone. “Our first response must be to give thanks to God for the scientific advancement and talent that helped to create such lifesaving vaccines,” Deeley said. “I have already been asked several times: Should I receive the vaccine when it is available to me? My answer is a resounding yes.” Deeley said he is concerned about enough people using the vaccine in Maine because the state has had lower-than-average rates of vaccine uptake in the past. That has led to resurgences of diseases such as whooping cough in Maine. He said it’s imperative for Catholics to “care about the common good.”\n\nMaryland\n\nCollege Park: The University of Maryland will begin its spring semester with virtual learning and continue the semester with a similar “look and feel” to its fall classes, according to the school’s president. Students will mostly have virtual classes for the first two weeks of the semester before the school shifts to hybrid learning, University President Darryll J. Pines wrote in a Tuesday letter to the university community. Only about 25% of the classes will be in-person when hybrid learning resumes. “If there is a lesson that we have learned throughout this pandemic, it is this: We must remain nimble and flexible and expect change,” Pines wrote. “If new information comes to light, we will not hesitate to adapt our plans accordingly.” All students are required to submit a negative COVID-19 test before coming back to campus. Everyone who will be on campus will also have to get tested for the virus every two weeks. Pines said students will have two weeks of virtual classes after spring break to allow for campuswide testing before in-person classes resume. Dorms will also operate at a reduced capacity, with students residing only in single rooms.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Gov. Charlie Baker did not overstep his authority when he issued sweeping orders to close businesses and limit gatherings to control the spread of the coronavirus, the highest court in Massachusetts said in a ruling released Thursday. The Supreme Judicial Court rejected a challenge brought on behalf of a group including salon owners, pastors and the headmaster of a private school, who accused the Republican governor of exercising “legislative police power” by declaring a state of emergency under the state’s Civil Defense Act. The court said the pandemic clearly merits action by the governor under the Cold War-era law. It also rejected the lawsuit’s argument that the governor’s actions infringe on people’s constitutional rights to due process and free assembly. “Given that COVID-19 is a pandemic that has killed over a million people worldwide, it spreads from person to person, effective vaccines have not yet been distributed, there is no known cure, and a rise in cases threatens to overrun the Commonwealth’s hospital system, it is a natural cause for which action is needed,” the court wrote, quoting the state law.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The state’s top epidemiologist said Wednesday that there’s reason for “cautious optimism” as new data emerges about the spread of coronavirus in the state. COVID-19 case rates are starting to dip, and Michigan is now averaging about 516 cases per million people, down from 610 cases per million last week, said Sarah Lyon-Callo, director of the Bureau of Epidemiology and Population Health at the state health department. And hospitalizations of people with COVID-19 symptoms and the rate of intensive care unit admissions appears to be plateauing or declining, too, she said, even though the state overall is now seeing hospitalizations at about 90% of the spring peak. These are encouraging signs that suggest the coronavirus public health restrictions put in place last month – temporarily halting indoor dining at bars and restaurants and canceling in-person classes at high schools and colleges – might be starting to flatten the curve. It’s still too soon to say definitively whether Thanksgiving might change the outlook for Michigan when it comes to COVID-19, Lyon-Callo said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: State health officials said they’re grateful that the spread of the coronavirus appears to have stabilized in recent days but cautioned Wednesday that case growth and hospitalization levels remain worryingly high. Meanwhile, Gov. Tim Walz formally called a special session of the Legislature for Monday to pass a relief package for businesses and workers affected by the four-week “pause” he ordered last month. Those restrictions included a shutdown of bars and restaurants except for takeout and delivery, gyms, and other activities, including high school sports. The governor has not yet said whether he’ll extend any of those restrictions past Dec. 18. The Minnesota Department of Health reported 4,539 new coronavirus cases Wednesday and 82 new deaths, the state’s third-highest one-day total of the pandemic. Three-fourths of the deaths were patients from outside the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. The new cases raised Minnesota’s total case count to 363,719 and its cumulative death toll to 4,109. The state is on pace to surpass 400,000 cases “within the next week or so,” Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm said.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves on Wednesday defended his decision to hold Christmas parties at the Governor’s Mansion, despite repeatedly warning residents to avoid social gatherings as coronavirus cases surge. The Republican governor said he invited family, friends and state officials to the multiple parties, but he expects many will choose not to attend. The front part of the Governor’s Mansion is a museum that is open by appointment only, and the Reeves family lives in a private portion in the back. Reeves compared the parties to tours that have been happening during the pandemic. No more than 10 people are allowed on each tour of the historic home, and masks are required. “What I think we are doing by offering the public the opportunity to, for instance, tour the Governor’s Mansion, is to offer a sense of normalcy,” Reeves said during a news conference. In a story first reported by Mississippi Today, elected officials said they were invited to a governor’s Christmas party happening Wednesday. The governor also invited lawmakers to separate parties next week.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: The state’s health department on Thursday reported 67 new deaths from the coronavirus, adding to a total that has risen sharply since the start of the month. Only 10 other states have reported more deaths than Missouri over the past seven days, according to the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Service’s daily tracking dashboard. Since Dec. 1, the state has cited 195 new deaths among the 290,000 Americans killed by the virus since its onset. Among the recent deaths was a young woman in her upper teens from Taney County. Hospitals remain dangerously close to full. Inpatient bed capacity is down to 22% statewide, and intensive care unit bed space is in even worse shape – 18% statewide. In northeast Missouri, just 3% of ICU beds are available, 6% are available in the southwestern part of the state and 9% in northwest Missouri, according to health department data. KCUR reports that state data on hospitalizations – often cited by Gov. Mike Parson and other leaders as evidence that hospitals were not at risk – was unreliable into the fall, in part because many hospitals failed to follow reporting guidelines.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: Alluvion Health is holding a drive-thru flu shot clinic Friday that is open to the public for people age 12 and older. Shots are available for $30 but are offered at no cost with most health insurance plans, according to a release, and no one will be turned away for financial reasons. The drive-thru clinic is being held at the Montana ExpoPark from noon to 4 p.m. Friday. “This year, it is more important than ever to ensure you and your family are protected against influenza,” the release says. Immunization is the best way to stop the spread of influenza, Alluvion said, but officials also encouraged the same methods used for combatting COVID-19, such as regular hand-washing, covering coughs, wearing a mask and staying home when sick.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A prisoner in his 60s died at a Lincoln hospital Wednesday after testing positive for the coronavirus in mid-November, corrections officials said. Corrections officials said the inmate had underlying medical conditions, and the exact cause of death hasn’t been confirmed. Officials did not release the inmate’s identity but said he was serving time for a robbery conviction in Seward County. A grand jury will investigate the death, as is normal procedure. Nebraska officials reported 781 coronavirus patients who were hospitalized in the state as of Wednesday evening, a decline from last month’s record highs but still far more than the number earlier this year. The state confirmed 1,321 new cases, bringing the total to 143,924 since the pandemic began. So far, 1,294 people have died after contracting the virus. About two-thirds of those who have died were at least 75 years old, according to the state’s online tracking portal.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The state is adding another voluntary, free app to efforts to track person-to-person coronavirus contacts, with the launch Thursday of the Exposure Notification Express program developed by Apple and Google. The Department of Health and Human Services said Wednesday that Nevada will be the first state to use both ENX and a COVID Trace app the state launched Aug. 24. COVID Trace has more than 130,000 downloads, representing a fraction of the more than 3 million people in a state where 176,334 cases of COVID-19 have been reported since March. ENX is available for all Apple devices, said Julia Peek, the state official overseeing contact tracing efforts in Nevada, and COVID Trace will continue to be available in both the iOS App Store and Android’s Google Play Store. Peek said the apps are “completely anonymous, private and secure.” By opting in, app users receive COVID-19 notifications informing them if they have been near someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 and reported their exposure to the program. ENX and COVID Trace both use Bluetooth technology and will work together, Peek said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: State House Speaker Dick Hinch died from COVID-19, a medical examiner ruled Thursday following his unexpected death. Hinch, who was only sworn in as leader of the state’s newly Republican-led Legislature a week ago, died Wednesday. Hinch was 71 and was starting his seventh, two-year term in the state House. His death was announced Wednesday night by his office, which did not give any details of what it called “this unexpected tragedy.” Hinch is the first New Hampshire speaker to die during the session, according to House Clerk Paul Smith. “We are sitting in unchartered territory here,” Smith said. The swearing in of the the 400-member House and 24-member Senate was held outdoors at the University of New Hampshire because of the pandemic. More than a quarter of House members, most of them Democrats, skipped the ceremony after learning the day before that several Republican lawmakers had tested positive for the virus after attending an indoor GOP caucus meeting Nov. 20 where many attendees weren’t wearing masks.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: How New Jerseyans handle the upcoming holidays could prevent thousands of people from going to the hospital with COVID-19 and hundreds from needing to be put on ventilators, according to new four-month modeling predictions from the state Department of Health and the Office of Innovation released Wednesday. In the worst-case prediction, more New Jersey residents could be hospitalized than during the first wave of the pandemic in the spring – if people travel for the holidays and continue social gatherings. That interaction would cause the virus to spread more than during past religious holidays and after the reopening of indoor dining and schools, according to both agencies. About 8,747 people could be hospitalized during the peak of the second wave Jan. 13, predicts the state Department of Health, while the Office of Innovation’s best guess is a peak of 8,689 people in the hospital Feb. 5. During the first wave, 8,270 people were hospitalized with COVID-19 on April 14, according to the governor’s office.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The state has begun monitoring sewage from prisons and youth rehabilitation facilities to more efficiently detect COVID-19 outbreaks in the southwest of the state, the state Environment Department announced Wednesday. The agency says the goal is to sample human feces in group-living situations to quickly identify coronavirus outbreaks. The results may be used to more effectively deploy individual testing to pinpoint infections and halt the spread. Sampling will take place at federal, state and local jails, along with facilities overseen by the state Children, Youth and Families Department. Environment Department spokeswoman Maddy Hayden said the initial effort comes at a cost of about $300,000, utilizing federal relief funds. The southwest region was selected for the initial phase of testing because of high positivity rates along with limited access to testing. New Mexico on Wednesday reported an additional 1,759 COVID-19 cases, bringing the statewide total to nearly 113,000 since the pandemic began. An additional 34 deaths also were reported, including a woman in her 30s.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Coronavirus infections and deaths are rising in the state’s nursing homes amid a race to deploy a COVID-19 vaccine among frail and elderly people most vulnerable to the respiratory disease. Since late September, at least 2,240 nursing home residents have contracted COVID-19 in New York, resulting in 219 deaths, according to USA TODAY Network analysis of the latest federal data through Nov. 22. Of the deaths, about 45% hit during a two-week stretch as infections spiked last month inside nursing homes, offering an early warning of the virus’s renewed assault on long-term care facilities just days before the expected arrival of 170,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccine in New York as soon as this weekend. And while state government plans to prioritize all 170,000 initial doses for nursing home residents and staff, the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine involved requires each person to take two doses separated by 21 days to build up immunity, meaning New York nursing homes will remain at risk into January.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper and Republican legislative leaders said Thursday that they’ve found a solution to address the potential loss of $30 million in federal coronavirus relief funds that lawmakers earmarked for rural broadband projects. A state law approved in September had funneled the money to a broadband program. But Cooper’s administration and GOP lawmakers disagreed on whether federal guidance required the money be spent by Dec. 30. Under the announced agreement, Cooper will redirect the $30 million to other federal COVID-19 relief qualifying expenses that would have otherwise been paid for with state government operating funds. The legislature, in turn, will vote in early 2021 to spend $30 million in state funds for the rural broadband initiative called the GREAT program.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Gov. Doug Burgum on Wednesday extended an executive order that requires people to wear masks and limits the size of gatherings until next month but will allow high school sports to resume next week. The Republican governor issued the executive order Nov. 13, and it was set expire Sunday. The mandate, which has been extended until Jan. 18, requires residents to wear face coverings in indoor businesses and indoor public settings, as well as outdoor public settings where physical distancing isn’t possible. Burgum also directed all bars and restaurants to limit capacity to 50% and closed all in-person services between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. Large-scale venues also are limited to 25% capacity. The governor extended that part of the order until Jan. 8, saying the shorter extension “recognizes the economic impact” the restrictions have placed on businesses. Since the order has gone into effect, North Dakota has dropped from first to 10th in the country for new cases per capita in the past two weeks, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: For years, alumni of an area high school have gathered to raise scholarship money in memory of three classmates killed in a crush of people at a 1979 concert by The Who in Cincinnati. And they were determined to do it again in 2020, despite the pandemic. They just didn’t know how. But with the help of their friends – including two famous ones – they had their most memorable evening yet. Fred Wittenbaum, one of the organizers of the fundraiser, said he and others had kicked around “some strange ideas” for the benefit, normally held over the past decade in the Finneytown High School performing arts center. In the end, Saturday night’s show included prerecorded video interviews with The Who’s frontman Roger Daltrey and guitarist-songwriter Pete Townshend, plus a mix of recorded and live discussions with relatives of the 11 people killed Dec. 3, 1979. There were also plenty of covers of the Rock & Roll Hall of Famers’ music performed by alumni rock bands and taped in a park along the Ohio River and at other scenic venues in and around Cincinnati.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: Mayor G.T. Bynum said Wednesday that he’s disgusted that some cities, particularly in the Tulsa area, have not mandated mask-wearing to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. Cities with mask ordinances listened to medical professionals, Bynum said, suggesting city leaders in some other municipalities who opposed mask mandates took advice from “Facebook epidemiologists who can cite some sham website and claim that makes them an expert on the value of mask-wearing.” Many Tulsa suburbs have adopted mask ordinances, but officials in nearby Broken Arrow on Nov. 23 rejected a proposal to strongly encourage mask-wearing. Meanwhile, Tulsa International Airport announced Thursday that it will begin offering coronavirus testing for current and recent airline passengers. The airport board approved testing at a terminal beginning Jan. 4 for people who are flying or have flown in the previous three days. Tests will cost from $70 for the rapid antigen test to $185 for a complete respiratory test. The Oklahoma State Department of Health on Thursday reported 2,460 new cases of the virus and 35 more deaths.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state continues to break records for COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. The state reported 10,355 new cases between Nov. 30 and Dec. 6 – a 14% increase over the previous week and a record high for the seventh week in a row. Through Dec. 6, a total of 85,788 cases had been reported. That means 2% of Oregonians have had positive or presumptive cases. COVID-19 hospitalizations for last week increased to 494, a 24% increase over the previous week. There were 133 COVID-19 deaths reported over the week, an average of 19 per day. That’s the highest since the pandemic began. There were 170,964 COVID-19 tests administered in Oregon during the week. The percentage of positive tests was 8.1%.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A group of Democrats in the state House of Representatives wants their adamantly maskless Republican colleagues to be sworn in next month after everyone else, to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. As a safety measure, the 203 state representatives will take the oath of office Jan. 5 in four sets of about 50 people each, starting with newly elected members, the House speaker’s office said Wednesday. Philadelphia state Rep. Joe Hohenstein, who has objected strenuously to some Republicans remaining maskless during recent State Government Committee meetings, said there is “significant support” among his fellow Democrats to have the maskless “just simply be placed at the end of the line so that they don’t potentially contaminate the House floor.” Hohenstein said a medical exception to the House bipartisan leadership group’s policy on masks needs some teeth, suggesting the leaders might require a doctor’s note verifying the maskless member’s condition. In a memo to members sent last week, House Speaker Bryan Cutler, R-Lancaster, said masks “will be required of everyone unless an individual cannot wear a face covering due to a medical condition.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Restrictions on some businesses that began late last month to counter a second surge of COVID-19 cases in the state will be extended one more week, Gov. Gina Raimondo announced Thursday. Raimondo’s “two-week pause” that began Nov. 30 will now run through Dec. 20, the Democrat said at a news conference. Certain key metrics used to measure the spread of the virus, including the hospitalization rate and the percent positive rate, have not declined as hoped, she said. She also noted that Rhode Island has the highest infection rate per capita in the country, something she attributed in part to the state’s aggressive testing program. “If we continue to stay at home as much as possible for that week, for next week, I believe it will have the impact that we need,” she said. An extra $200 per week in unemployment benefits for workers who have lost their jobs will be extended another week. When the pause ends, starting Dec. 21, closed businesses will be allowed to open with limited capacity, and restaurants will be allowed to move to 50% capacity, Raimondo said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nWest Columbia: Prisoners and poultry plant workers will follow soon after front-line health care employees in the state’s COVID-19 vaccine plan, Gov. Henry McMaster said Wednesday. At the outset of the first phase of the state’s vaccine distribution plan, the state will focus on health care employees including physicians, medical students, speech pathologists, and residents and staff of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, McMaster said. He said the second half of the state’s first phase will include people living in settings such as prisons, jails and homeless shelters, as well as processing plant and other food production workers, plus utilities employees. The governor said others included will be those age 75 and older and people with two or more underlying health conditions such as diabetes or heart disease. Among people to be prioritized in the state’s second phase are pharmacists, K-12 school employees, child care workers and food delivery workers.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: State residents who have been exposed to COVID-19 or think they might have been can now take an at-home saliva test free of charge. The state will send Vault Health saliva tests to residents who have been exposed, think they’ve been exposed or want to use the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention method of ending quarantine with a negative test. The test can be ordered through the South Dakota Department of Health website. Vault Health requires a telemedicine Zoom consult to watch the user take the saliva sample. The sample can then be sent to the lab, located in Minnesota, with a prepaid UPS package. Results should be available in 24 to 48 hours after the sample arrives at the lab. The test is free and can be ordered more than once if COVID-19 symptoms surface. The South Dakota Department of Health website also offers a COVID-19 quarantine guideline calculator and COVID-19 risk calculator.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Shelby County health officials said Thursday that inspectors visiting restaurants and other businesses to ensure they are complying with coronavirus-related rules have received threats of violence and are being accompanied by police officers as they make their rounds. The county sends inspectors to businesses to check that they are following regulations, such as employees wearing masks, proper social distancing, and closing times. Police officers are going with the inspectors after some received racial slurs and threats of violence, said Dr. Bruce Randolph, the county’s chief health officer. “We’re not out to just close businesses,” Randolph said Thursday. “We’re out to protect the public’s health.” Memphis officials also say health care facilities are seeing a shortage of nurses and other staff. Doug McGowen, the city’s chief operating officer, has put out a call for people with medical training and experience, such as retirees, those who are working administrative jobs, or those employed outside the health care field to contact the Tennessee Medical Reserve Corps if they are willing to help ease the staffing shortage.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Houston-area authorities have announced a new task force to combat a more than 30% rise in road rage incidents this year, an increase that officials are blaming in part on the stress of the pandemic. The rise in road rage incidents coincides with an overall increase in violent crime in Houston during the public health and economic crisis, including a homicide rate that could be the city’s highest in nearly 30 years. “We’re not psychologists here at the Houston police department … but we do know that COVID has had an impact on the collective psyche of the American people,” Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo said. More than 200 road rage incidents in which someone was shot have occurred during the first 10 months of this year, compared to 150 during the same period a year ago, Acevedo said. Six of these road rage incidents this year have resulted in murder. “This year has been very difficult, and there’s been a lot of loss both in our community and our nation, and we shouldn’t be compounding that suffering with unnecessary carnage on our roadways,” Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Scenes reminiscent of an early-pandemic summer have returned to Zion National Park, with rangers regularly closing the road into the park’s main canyon due to overcrowding. Nearly every day since the park’s shuttle system closed for the season Nov. 30, the popular Scenic Drive roadway has filled with cars before noon, forcing officials to close the gates to ease the traffic and prevent illegal parking. During the early summer when there was no shuttle service due to COVID-19 precautions, the scenic drive was packed with cars filling up parking lots in order to hike The Narrows. So when the shuttle opened in July this year, required tickets sold out almost immediately and remained in high demand through the end of the season. However, when the gate is down, there is no passage through the canyon, in contrast to past years when park rangers have occasionally let people by to just drive through when the canyon is full. The Scenic Drive will remain open to private vehicles and commercial shuttles through Dec. 24, when it will close for shuttle operation until Jan. 2, 2021. Throughout the winter season, biking and hiking up the canyon are still permitted.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: A legislative panel considering how the state should spend the remaining federal coronavirus relief money has approved about $3.1 million of the administration’s $24 million worth of proposals but needs more information and time to decide on the rest. The money must be allocated by Dec. 30, or it goes back to the federal government. The Legislative Joint Fiscal Committee voted 9-1 on Wednesday to turn down reallocations for grants and hazard pay proposals, including a $10 million addition to an existing grant program for non-food and hospitality businesses, the Bennington Banner reports. Secretary of Administration Susanne Young and Economic Development Commissioner Joan Goldstein warned the committee the administration’s ability to process grants and issue checks becomes more difficult as time runs short and the holidays approach. Lawmakers including Sen. Dick Sears, D-Bennington, however, said the proposals were given to them on short notice without enough background for them to consider.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Ralph Northam announced new measures to combat the coronavirus Thursday that include a stricter mask mandate and a curfew that will requires most Virginians to stay at home between midnight and 5 a.m. The executive order is set to take effect Monday and will also reduce the state’s cap on public gatherings from 25 people to 10. Northam is expanding the state’s long-standing mask requirements to include outdoor areas where social distancing isn’t possible and all indoor areas shared with others, except for households. The current mask mandate requires only that masks be worn in indoor public settings. The new mandate does not apply to children under 5. The order will be in place through the end of January. Asked why he chose midnight to 5 a.m. for a curfew, Northam said it was “common sense.” “I’ll also say something that my parents taught me when I was younger, and that is nothing good happens after midnight,” the Democratic governor said at a news conference. He added that the state will be stepping up enforcement efforts against businesses that “flout” coronavirus-related restrictions.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: With an additional 49 deaths reported Wednesday, the death toll from the coronavirus in the state has surpassed 3,000, according to health officials. Since the pandemic began, 3,016 people in Washington have died from the virus that causes COVID-19, according to the state Department of Health. The total number of confirmed cases in the state is now nearing 190,000, officials said. Health officials also reported that a total of 11,996 people have been hospitalized in the state because of the virus, including 155 new hospitalizations as of Tuesday. Also on Wednesday, the state Department of Corrections reported 740 cases among the approximately 1,900 inmates at the Airway Heights Corrections Center near Spokane. The prison had just seven cases last week, The Spokesman-Review reports. “The humanity of what’s going on here is decaying faster and faster every day,” inmate Tobin Sather told the newspaper. He’s had two showers in the past 15 days and hasn’t had a single change of clothes in that time. For six days, the room’s temperature was hovering around 55 degrees after the heating system broke down, Sather said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: Marshall University’s first virtual commencement ceremonies are this weekend, celebrating both recent graduates and those who completed their degrees earlier in the pandemic, and will be livestreamed at https://livestream.com/marshallu. The ceremony for spring 2020 graduates will be at 9 a.m. Saturday. Marshall alumna Jennifer Leslie Wells is the keynote speaker. She is the senior regional organizer for Community Change and Community Change Action, a national organization that strengthens social change from the ground up, Marshall said. The second ceremony, for summer 2020 and winter 2020 graduates, will be at noon Saturday. Professor Dan Hollis, recipient of the university’s Dr. Charles E. Hedrick Outstanding Faculty Award, will be the guest speaker. Jazz great Ellis Marsalis Jr., whose namesake jazz piano competition has been held at Marshall, will be awarded a posthumous honorary degree, to be accepted by his son, Ellis Marsalis III, by video during the second ceremony. Robert Simpson, former interim dean of the Lewis College of Business, will receive an honorary degree during the morning ceremony.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The Legislature’s top Republicans have signaled they want oversight of how Democratic Gov. Tony Evers divvies up any future federal pandemic relief money and distributes vaccines. Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and incoming Senate Majority Leader Devin LaMahieu said during a conference call with Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce on Wednesday that they believe Evers is making too many unilateral decisions on how to respond to COVID-19 without any public input. They said legislative oversight of federal aid and vaccine distribution would create transparency. Evers rejected suggestions of legislative oversight Thursday, saying having more than 100 lawmakers figuring out who gets a vaccine first “doesn’t pass the smell test.” “We need to make decisions in a timely manner,” he said. The Republican leaders also said they want to restore a one-week waiting period for unemployment benefits that Evers and the Legislature suspended in April. They said unemployment has subsided since then, and the state shouldn’t provide incentives for people to stay home and not work.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The University of Wyoming has banned new ticket sales to home sporting events until at least 2021 after new statewide public health orders imposed by Republican Gov. Mark Gordon went into effect Wednesday. The university said no new tickets will be sold until at least Jan. 8. There will be no additional ticket sales for two upcoming home games scheduled this week, but fans who bought tickets before noon Tuesday will still be allowed to attend. The new state orders were implemented in response to the recent spike in statewide coronavirus cases.

She is the co-editor of \" Vying for the Iron Throne \" and four other books. The views expressed here are hers. View more opinion on CNN.\n\n(CNN) \"House of the Dragon,\" HBO's new prequel to its blockbuster series \"Game of Thrones,\" is complicated for me. Since its premiere on Sunday, fans and critics have been comparing notes about how this new show stacks up against its forerunner's epic scale -- and its abysmal finale .\n\nAnd many -- especially this fan -- are wondering if their hearts, shattered by the nonsensical storytelling in many of \"Game of Thrones\" last episodes, might be mended.\n\nIt's worth asking if this new show, which focuses on one thread of the complex tapestry of the \"Game of Thrones\" universe, matters despite its smaller scale, and what it might have to say about our current moment in culture, over a decade after the original series first aired. I haven't answered those questions for myself yet, but as a fan of the original series who remains viscerally angry at its ending -- particularly the way the writers betrayed their characters as well as rules of time and space -- I'm left wondering what it means to be a fan of the franchise after all these years and why I'm watching \"House of the Dragon\" at all.\n\nThere's a lot we've been asked to forgive, and I'm embarking on the \"House of the Dragon\" journey wondering if that forgiveness is possible.\n\nAfter two and a half years of living amid a global pandemic, with the isolation of lockdowns, the heartbreak of positive tests derailing family gatherings, and the frustration of canceled vacations, perhaps there's comfort in returning to familiar plotlines and characters, even if what fans are now seeing are their ancestors. The \"House of the Dragon\" writers keenly tap into this nostalgia, including in the premiere episode a throne room scene in which the heads of significant Westerosi houses swear fealty to the King, Viserys Targaryen, and his named heir, Princess Rhaenyra.\n\nThere's a thrill of excitement in seeing a Stark ancestor of Jon, Sansa and Arya bend the knee to House Targaryen (though bending the knee didn't work out so well for Jon) and a Baratheon patriarch vow to support a new (female) Targaryen heir, even as fans know his descendant Robert later attempts to assassinate Daenerys Targaryen.\n\nAnd the Easter eggs don't stop there -- the premiere concludes with King Viserys disclosing a secret to his daughter, a prediction he says has been passed down from monarch to heir since the Targaryans first conquered Westeros: that \"a terrible winter gusting out of the distant north\" would someday threaten to \"destroy the world of the living,\" and \"all of Westeros must stand against it.\"\n\nIn case viewers aren't clear that Viserys is referencing the entire plotline of \"Game of Thrones,\" he concludes his speech by calling this vision \"The Song of Ice and Fire,\" the overarching name author George R. R. Martin gives to books the original series is based on.\n\nThese nods of recognition feel like rewards for loyal viewers who have dedicated years to Martin's labyrinthine world. They also create a sense of community across the fandom, with friends separated by geography or the pandemic reaching out to trade reactions and draw connections.\n\nOf course, it's not clear how long fans or even the network will stick with the series, with critics raising questions about a fantasy head-to-head between HBO's \"House of the Dragon\" and Amazon's \"Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power.\" But the viewership numbers for the premiere -- HBO, which shares a parent company with CNN, has said it was the most-watched premiere in HBO and HBO Max history -- demonstrate at least an initial appetite to return to Westeros and its often incestual and always bloody intrigue.\n\nSpin-off shows that effectively deploy nostalgia dominate the streaming landscape these days, with Disney+ capitalizing on both the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the Star Wars franchise via series narrowly focused on the development of characters fans have already grown to love. The success of shows like \"WandaVision,\" \"The Mandalorian,\" and \"Obi-Wan Kenobi\" have proved fans will tune in for screentime zeroed in on a small slice of a beloved epic landscape, which essentially describes the relationship between \"House of the Dragon\" and \"Game of Thrones.\"\n\nBut the uneven reception of shows such as the Sex and the City continuation, \"And Just Like That,\" and \"The Book of Boba Fett\" prove that a spin-off's success is not a foregone conclusion. It requires a careful blend of reinforcing the franchise's brand while adapting to new contemporary contexts, and throwing in something innovative and new for spice.\n\nFans tune in seek the comfort of the themes and aesthetics they know while also searching for the new. To this effect, the premiere of \"House of the Dragon\" self-consciously addresses the misogyny and sexual violence all too often apparent in \"Game of Thrones,\" and given that the narrative begins with the King asking Westeros to accept a future female monarch, there's hope that representation of female characters might be an improvement over the original series.\n\nBut as with any prequel, we already kind of know how this one ends: patriarchy, White supremacy and misogyny will win out, and last in the Westerosi world for at least 200 more years. The first episode of \"House of the Dragon\" maintains the investment \"Game of Thrones\" made in portraying medieval brutality, including mutilation and dismemberment, nudity and shocking violations of female bodily autonomy . The show's producers dance around the post-MeToo context they must work in now, relocating violence against women from sexual coercion to, horrifyingly, childbirth, which has profoundly uncomfortable resonances in a post-Roe United States.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter.

On August 21, \"Game of Thrones\" spinoff \"House of the Dragon\" will premiere on HBO (and stream on HBO Max), and 12 days later, Amazon's ambitious \"Lord of the Rings\" own prequel series, \"The Rings of Power\" will debut. It will be a dragon-filled swords-and-sorcery bonanza for fantasy fans.\n\nBut other TV shows are worth checking out that aren't about lords or thrones. The season's best new TV shows include a misanthropic medical drama, a new Marvel hero origin story, a blinged-out workplace sitcom, an adult animated Antichrist series, a Chicago chef drama and an autobiographical series about a standup comedian.\n\nJust a few things to tide you over with until \"Dragon\" and \"Rings\" are ready:\n\n'This Is Going to Hurt'\n\nAMC+ (Thursday; weekly on Thursdays)\n\nBen Whishaw (the voice of Paddington Bear) stars in this understated BBC drama about an obstetrics doctor working in Britain’s National Health system in the mid-2000s. It’s based on the memoir by Dr. Adam Kay; Whishaw plays the overworked OB-GYN with pithy asides to the audience and an extra dose of cynicism. Medical dramas are a dime a dozen, but \"Hurt\" stands out for its rather unflashy approach to portraying hospital life. Kay's job is often dreary, patients and superiors often treat him poorly and he doesn't get to help people as much as he wishes he could. But don't worry, Whishaw's innate charm and wit keep the tone from becoming too depressing.\n\nMore:2022 TV premiere dates, from 'Stranger Things' and 'Hacks' to 'Obi-Wan Kenobi' and 'AGT'\n\n'Ms. Marvel'\n\nDisney+ (Wednesday; weekly on Wednesdays)\n\nGet ready to hear a lot more about Kamala Khan (Iman Vellani). Disney+'s latest Marvel series captures the spirit (if not every detail) of one of its most groundbreaking comic book characters: a Pakistani American, Muslim teen girl from New Jersey. Kamala's journey of self-discovery, her conflicts with protective parents and romantic entanglements make it the ideal teen superhero series, a female Spider-Man of sorts. Vellani, a newcomer destined for at least one Marvel movie after this six-episode show, is a joy to watch and certain to inspire a new generation of young girls to try on a cape.\n\nExclusive sneak peek:Muslim teen 'Ms. Marvel' brings new perspective in Disney+ series\n\n'The Bear'\n\nHulu (June 23)\n\nDespite its outdoorsy-sounding title, this new Hulu drama from FX is about a gourmet chef (Jeremy Allen White, \"Shameless\") who leaves his swanky restaurant job to run his family's Chicago steak sandwich shop after an unexpected death. Fast-paced, tense and wickedly funny, \"Bear\" storms out of the gate as a fully formed, entertaining series. The intricacies of its restaurant kitchen will delight fans of cooking shows, and the tense conflict will draw in fans of family dramas.\n\n'Loot'\n\nApple TV+ (June 24; weekly on Fridays)\n\nMaya Rudolph leads the cast of this workplace comedy from \"Master of None\" producer Alan Yang. She plays a billionaire who goes through a midlife crisis and decides to dedicate herself to her charity foundation, much to the chagrin of the people who already work there. The cast, which also includes Michaela Jaé Rodriguez, Joel Kim Booster, Nat Faxon and Ron Funches, is wonderfully appealing. Rudolph's character could use a little more comeuppance to make the series work even better, but it's a strong start to a show that balances silly and serious.\n\n'Mo'\n\nNetflix (August 24)\n\nComedian Mo Amer, best known for a supporting role in Ramy Youssef's Hulu series, \"Ramy,\" gets his own star vehicle in his new sitcom (also produced by Youssef). In the semi-autobiographical series, Amer plays Mo Najjar, a Palestinian refugee seeking asylum while living in Texas most of his life. Mo is a man in limbo, who's never able to hold down a job or get health care because of his immigration status, and the way he casually flits through his life is reflective of that reality. Amer mines great comedy from this unique situation, and he surrounds himself with a strong and charming supporting cast.\n\n'Little Demon'\n\nFXX (August 25, Thursdays at 10 EDT/PDT, and streaming on Hulu)\n\nThe newest entry in FXX's adult animation slate imagines what might happen if the Antichrist was an awkward teen girl going through puberty. Satan's daughter Chrissy may have mystical powers, but she also has trouble making friends and has a strained relationship with her mom (Aubrey Plaza). The comedy is dense with laughs, cartoon violence and action, but perhaps the best part is the real father-daughter connection between Satan and Chrissy: They're voiced by Danny DeVito and his daughter Lucy.\n\nOther shows we're excited about...", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/reviewed/2021/05/17/incredible-90-s-tv-shows-stream-now/5129682001/", "title": "26 incredible '90s TV shows to stream now", "text": "— Recommendations are independently chosen by Reviewed’s editors. Purchases you make through our links may earn us a commission.\n\nIt’s hard to pin down when the Golden Age of Television really began. Some argue that it started in 1999 with the premiere of The Sopranos on HBO, while others contend that it really only kicked off circa 2008, thanks to shows like Mad Men, Breaking Bad and later, Game of Thrones.\n\nBut if you came of age during the 1990s, you know better. From 1990 all the way up to the new millennium (or should I say, Willennium), television was positively glorious.\n\nOn any given night, you could tune into one of the major networks like ABC, NBC, or Fox and catch a family-friendly sitcom (like Fresh Prince of Bel-Air), an edgy teen drama (cue the Beverly Hills 90210 theme), or—if you were lucky enough to be a house with cable—channel surf over to HBO and follow groundbreaking shows like Sex and the City or Oz right from the beginning.\n\nThe best ‘90s TV shows had it all: aliens, gangsters, great friends, wise-cracking cats, vampires with souls (before it was cool) and that’s only the tip of the iceberg. Here are 26 of the most incredible '90s TV shows you can watch for the first time—or fall in love with all over again—on HBO Max, Disney+ and other streaming platforms.

Buffy the Vampire Slayer\n\nFor most folks, high school is hell. But on Buffy the Vampire Slayer—the influential ‘90s teen show that was based on the 1992 box-office bomb of the same name—that metaphor is taken to its most literal place. Full of special effects that haven’t aged well (but storylines that did), Buffy gave us sexy vamps, LGBTQ+ witches, one-off episodic gems like the musical Once More With Feeling and teen angst and melodrama for days.\n\nBut perhaps its biggest contribution of all is that it gave us a heroine like Buffy Summers (played with wit and tenderness by Sarah Michelle Gellar), a blonde high school cheerleader chosen—reluctantly—by fate to save the world. A lot. In that way, show creator Joss Whedon (despite his recent controversies) helped give an entire generation of young girls the best female superhero since Wonder Woman and that slays.\n\nStream Buffy the Vampire Slayer on Hulu with the Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ bundle\n\n2. Friends\n\nHave you been on a break from this hit ‘90s sitcom since it wrapped up in 2004? With a reunion set to air later this month and the entire 10 seasons available to stream right now on HBO Max, there’s never been a better time to give the Central Perk gang another go-around, especially if you’ve been dying for a good excuse to sing along during a rendition of Smelly Cat again.\n\nStream Friends on HBO Max\n\n3. The X Files\n\nThought science fiction was all navel-gazing or men in cheesy green alien suits firing off plastic ray-guns? Think again. Fox brought new life to the genre with this hit show about a couple of FBI agents—one a skeptic, the other a true believer—charged with investigating the unknown. Often considered the best 90 sci-fi TV show of them all, The X Files launched stars David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson into the pop-culture stratosphere and helped make conspiracy theorists out of all of us (for an hour a week, at least).\n\nStream The X Files on Hulu with the Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ bundle\n\n4. Seinfeld\n\nAlthough Seinfeld is usually described as a “show about nothing,” this mega-hit ‘90s sitcom created by Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David of eventual Curb Your Enthusiasm fame actually gives viewers a whole lot of \"somethings\" to think about. Like, is it wise to pretend to be a marine biologist just to impress a woman? Answer: No, probably not. Or, is it advisable to stock up on your favorite birth control before it goes off the market and only use it with those deemed the most “sponge-worthy”? Answer: Maybe, but ask your doctor first. As ‘90s sitcoms go, Seinfeld is arguably the best (sorry, Friends stans) and absolutely worth a rewatch.\n\nStream Seinfeld on Hulu with the Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ bundle\n\n5. Twin Peaks\n\nUnless you were an arthouse kid back in ‘70s or ‘80s, chances are that director David Lynch slipped under your radar. That is, until the 1990 premiere on ABC of Twin Peaks, which he co-created with Mark Frost. This weird murder mystery, set in a quirky fictional town in Washington state, weaves together comedy, soap opera and tragedy in a way that Lynch fans know well.\n\nAfter an acclaimed first season, the show went off the rails in season two and ended on one of the most famous cliffhangers of all time. But do yourself a favor and don’t Google it, or watch Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me (Lynch’s divisive 1992 prequel) or Twin Peaks: The Return (the limited-run series that aired on Showtime in 2017) first. Just grab a hot cup of dang good coffee, kick back and start from episode one of the O.G. series. Trust me, you’ll enjoy it better that way.\n\nStream Twin Peaks on Netflix\n\n6. Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\n\nWill Smith is better known these days for blowing up aliens and passing on one the most influential films of all time, but back in the early ‘90s, he was just an up-and-coming rapper from Philly and the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air was his breakthrough role.\n\nAs one of the most beloved ‘90s family TV shows, this NBC hit aired from 1990 to 1996 and gave us so much, from quippy one-liners to incredible dance moves. You can catch the reunion on HBO Max right now, but consider treating yourself to a weekend of binge-watching this series, too.\n\nStream Fresh Prince of Bel-Air on HBO Max\n\n7. Boy Meets World\n\nRaise your hand if you always secretly wished you were in Mr. Feeny’s (William Daniels) class alongside Cory (Ben Savage), Topanga (Danielle Fishel) and the rest of the gang of Boy Meets World. As one of the most charming ‘90s family TV shows of its time, this series started in 1993 and served as a cute coming-of-age tale that definitely resonated with millennials of the time. Plus, you get to admire Topanga’s hair in all its thick, wavy, Gen X glory.\n\nStream Boy Meets World on Disney+\n\n8. Frasier\n\nSitcoms have a rich history of spawning spin-offs: All in the Family famously led to seven other shows, including The Jeffersons and Maude (which, in turn, eventually led to Good Times). But it’s rare for a sitcom spin-off to truly match—or in some cases, even outdo—the show that inspired it. Frasier is a notable exception, though.\n\nThe character Frasier Crane (Kelsey Grammer) first appeared on the hit sitcom Cheers, but in 1993, got his own eponymous show. Set in Seattle, the show follows his life as a radio advice show host, as well as his relationship with his father and brother. Contrary to what you might think, you don’t need an IQ of 130 or higher to chuckle along with the jokes on this show, either.\n\nStream Fraiser on Hulu with the Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ bundle\n\n9. Daria\n\nSpeaking of spin-offs, it’s impossible to talk about the best ‘90s TV shows and not mention Daria. As MTV’s “loose” spin-off of Beavis and Butthead, this cartoon series is as hilarious and insightful today as it was when it originally aired.\n\nRemembered for her monotone voice and scathing one-liners, the character of Daria Morgandorffer was like a stand-in for anyone who felt out-of-sorts in high school, but the supporting cast of characters (from popular kids to alt-rock crushes and more) help make this one of the most nuanced teen shows of its time. Along the way, the show does an admirable job of critiquing suburbia, teen culture and the status quo, but with lots of heart, too.\n\nStream Daria on Paramount+\n\n10. The Sopranos\n\nDepending on who you ask, The Sopranos didn’t just kickstart the Golden Age of Television, it created it. Even 22 years later, the HBO crime drama is often considered the best show of all time, period. (Although fans of The Wire, HBO’s critically acclaimed drama from the 2000s, can wage a strong counter-argument.)\n\nThe premise—a mafia capo in therapy—could just as easily read as a comedy (and was fodder for several, starting with Analyze This), but show creator David Chase’s celebrated series goes deeper, with all the violence, intensity, family drama and pathos you’d expect. It still holds up, more than two decades later.\n\nStream The Sopranos on HBO Max\n\n11. Law & Order\n\nThis procedural drama about cops and attorneys in New York City might be one of the best binge-worthy shows of all time. It spawned several spin-offs, most famously Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (which is still airing but available on Sling TV, too) and Law & Order: Criminal Intent, which ran from 2001 to 2011. The O.G. Law & Order—which featured Jerry Orbach, a bonafide national treasure—proves that being formulaic isn’t necessarily a bad thing, because the show is still wildly addictive, all these years later.\n\nStream Law & Order on Sling TV\n\n12. Dawson's Creek\n\nYou wouldn’t get teen drama shows like Riverdale or One Tree Hill if it wasn’t for Dawson’s Creek, the WB/CW hit about brooding teens living in a fictional New England town. Filmed on location in Wilmington, North Carolina (another thing it shares in common with One Tree Hill), Dawson’s Creek is one of the best-known ‘90s teen shows and helped to cement a tried-and-true formula that still works to this day: beautiful teens + beautiful location + beautiful tragic problems = ratings gold.\n\nBeyond its catchy theme song, the show helped to launch the careers of Katie Holmes, Josh Jackson and Michelle Williams, respectively. Of the three, Williams has enjoyed the greatest success, thanks to her impressive work in critically acclaimed films like Blue Valentine, Brokeback Mountain and My Week With Marilyn, as well as TV shows like FX's wonderful Fosse/Verdon, but it all started here.\n\nStream Dawson’s Creek on Hulu with the Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ bundle\n\n13. Sex and the City\n\nWhether you love it or you kind of cringe over it now, there’s no denying that Sex and the City broke new ground when it premiered on HBO in 1998.\n\nOstensibly, this show about four single, successful ladies in their 30s living and loving in the big city was part of HBO’s gritty, hyper-realistic programming for the era, along with The Sopranos. These days though, Sex and the City mostly reads like an urban fairy tale. (“What do you mean a writer with only one article due a week and no side hustles could afford to live in her own apartment and buy $400 designer shoes on the regular in ‘90s-era Manhattan, that’s not fair,” sobbed the single, city-dwelling, 30-something year-old millennial author of this article after dodging another month of student loan bills.)\n\nStill, some fairy tales are worth passing onto the next generation, especially when they involve general sex positivity (the show didn't age well around certain LGBTQ+ issues, it must be said) and characters as woke and wonderful as Samantha Jones (Kim Cattrall). For all those reasons, Sex and the City is worth hanging onto.\n\nStream Sex and the City on HBO Max\n\n14. Freaks and Geeks\n\nAlthough Freaks and Geeks famously only lasted for a single season on NBC back in 1999, its sweet yet merciless take on the high school experience garnered many fans. It’s since become a cult classic and for many, was the first real taste of what Judd Apatow could do, plus a great introduction to future mega-stars like Seth Rogen, Jason Segel, James Franco and others.\n\nStream Freaks and Geeks on Hulu with the Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ bundle\n\n15. Living Single\n\nTell me if this sounds familiar: A show about a group of single, successful ladies living and loving in the big city in their 20s and the heartbreaks and friendships that bind them and help them grow better as people.\n\nSounds a lot like Friends and Sex and the City, right? Except unlike those two shows, Living Single features a cast of talented Black actors, including Queen Latifah. Also, it came out in 1993, before anyone had ever been introduced to the saga of Ross and Rachel or Carrie Bradshaw’s never-ending love-affair with Manolo Blahnik. Criminally underrated but a total delight, Living Single is a delightful show to consider giving a watch, especially if it flew under your radar.\n\nStream Living Single on Hulu with the Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ bundle\n\n16. Beverly Hills 90210\n\nRemember that formula from before? You know, the one about how shows based on beautiful teens and their beautiful, tragic problems will almost always equal network ratings gold? While Dawson's Creek directly inspired a string of imitators in the 2000s like One Tree Hill, Gossip Girl and others, all of these shows owe a debt to the grand-daddy of them all: Beverly Hills 90210.\n\nProduced by the legendary Aaron Spelling (whose small-screen hits prior to the 1990s included Charlie's Angels, Dynasty and others) this iconic '90s teen melodrama focused on a group of teens from one of the poshest zip codes in the U.S. and touched on after-school special topics like teen pregnancy, addiction and parental pressure. It also helped make its cast of dreamy mostly 20-somethings like Luke Perry and Shannen Doherty mega-stars in the early part of the decade.\n\nStream Beverly Hills 90210 on Hulu with the Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ bundle\n\n17. Sabrina the Teenage Witch\n\nThe ‘90s were the perfect time for witches to get cool again. You had bell bottoms, girl power, Lilith Fair—so much divine feminine energy just bursting through everywhere. And of course, who could forget Sabrina, the titular character of the popular ABC show Sabrina the Teenage Witch?\n\nInspired by the Archie Comics series of the same name (just like Riverdale), this tween-friendly hit was completely adorable and anchored by a charming performance by Melissa Joan Hart, who was already known to kids of the era as Clarissa, from Nickelodeon’s show Clarissa Explains It All. Plus, there was a talking cat. Nothing can ever be bad about a show that features a talking cat that also makes puns, I mean really.\n\nStream Sabrina the Teenage Witch on Hulu with the Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ bundle\n\n18. Sister, Sister\n\nAlthough Disney remade The Parent Trap in the ‘90s, ABC’s popular show Sister, Sister always felt like a more modern version of the same premise. Starring real-life twins Tia and Tamera Mowry, the plot focuses on two twin sisters separated at birth and adopted out to separate people—one, a straight-laced dad (Tim Reid) and the other, a fast-talking fashionista (Jackée Harry). This is one of those ‘90s family TV shows that feels safe and cozy upon rewatch and could be especially good if you’re looking for options to mix it up.\n\nStream Sister, Sister on Netflix\n\n19. Are You Afraid of the Dark?\n\nThere’s a good chance that Are You Afraid of the Dark? eventually led an entire generation of millennials to love shows like Black Mirror. In the vein of The Twilight Zone, this Nickelodeon show conjured up all things creepy and spooky and the unleashed them in anthology form over 45-minute blocks of time. The initial show ran over the course of five seasons (with subsequent reboots in 1999, 2019 and 2021). Gather round the campfire—or in this case, your TV—and give this kid-friendly horror series another go.\n\nStream Are You Afraid of the Dark? on Paramount+\n\n20. Oz\n\nOz isn’t a show for everyone. Set in a prison, it’s about as brutal and violent as you might expect and it features a truly chilling performance by J.K. Simmons. If you want a drama that has sweet, tender moments, look elsewhere, because Oz really is unrelentingly bleak. But as ‘90s drama TV shows go, it’s important to include in the conversation because it did push the envelope and pave the way for other gritty shows like The Shield in the 2000s and 2010s.\n\nStream Oz on HBO Max\n\n21. My So Called Life\n\nTeen angst earned its poster girl in the form of Angela Chase (Claire Danes), the protagonist of the short-lived but celebrated ABC series, My So-Called Life. Over the course of its lone season, the show netted lots of critical acclaim and earned a then-15-year-old Danes a Golden Globe award and Primetime Emmy nomination for Best Actress due to her portrayal, as well as helped launch the career of Jared Leto (who would later earn an Academy Award for his performance in Dallas Buyers Club). It also tackled serious issues, from homophobia to drug use, but in less of a soap-opera way than contemporary shows like 90210.\n\nStream My So Called Life on Hulu with the Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ bundle\n\n22. Full House\n\nWas it possible to experience the ‘90s and not know about Full House? As the king of ‘90s family TV shows, this classic is totally corny, but that’s also part of it’s charm.\n\nDive back into one of these old episodes and Uncle Jesse (John Stamos) is still as hot as ever, little Michelle (played by the immortal Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen) is still adorable and Dave Coulier is now the guy you can’t believe probably inspired Alanis Morisette’s signature anthem. Aside from Aunt Becky (now better known for Operation Varsity Blues), everything about the show feels wholesome and nostalgic in the sweetest way possible.\n\nStream Full House on Hulu with the Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ bundle\n\n23. The Nanny\n\nFran Drescher's distinctive voice isn't the only draw to The Nanny, the popular '90s sitcom that just became available on HBO Max, but it's among the most memorable. As a show about a street-smart Jewish woman from Flushing who, by sheer twist of luck, ends up as the nanny for a well-to-do Broadway producer, this is comfort viewing at its finest.\n\nStream The Nanny on HBO Max\n\n24. Moesha\n\nR&B singer Brandy Norwood was already a teen sensation when she signed on in 1996 to star as the title character in Moesha, but her fame grew exponentially larger by the end of it's six seasons thanks to hits like The Boy is Mine, off her chart-topping 1998 album Never Say Never. All that's to say, Brandy was a big deal in the '90s and this UPN sitcom just served to further showcase her talents. Similar to other tween-friendly dramas of the era, the show has an after school special vibe to it, but features fun appearances by stars like Bernie Mac, Usher, Mo'Nique and others.\n\nStream Moesha on Netflix\n\n25. Will & Grace\n\nSay what you will about Will & Grace now (it's always been divisive), but when it first appeared on the small screen in 1998, it became an instant game-changer. Co-created by Max Mutchnick, who is gay, the series debuted in 1998 during a period of time where the LGBTQ+ community was still reeling from the AIDS epidemic and rarely represented on screen.\n\nWill & Grace however, is all about queer celebration: of love, of friendship, of culture. It's fair to say that the show played to certain stereotypes along the way, but it helped change the country's views (in a favorable way) toward queer humans. For that reason, it deserves a solid rewatch.\n\nStream Will & Grace on Hulu with the Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ bundle\n\n26.

Unfortunately, the platform shuttered after only a month, but Discovery+ has just announced that they’re creating a CNN Originals hub on their platform that will offer many of the same shows previously offered by CNN+.\n\nThe new hub isn’t meant to replace CNN+, but it will allow Discovery+ subscribers the chance to watch a curated selection of popular shows and specials that originally premiered on the cable news channel, on demand.

Purchases you make through our links may earn us a commission.\n\nMonica Lewinsky is back in the news cycle this year, but instead of being the butt of everyone’s jokes, she’s reclaiming the narrative around the affair between her and President Clinton. Lewinsky recently co-produced FX’s scripted series Impeachment: American Crime Story that followed the affair, the people involved in its cover-up, and the subsequent investigation, and on top of that, she has produced a new documentary that touches on her experiences called 15 Minutes of Shame.\n\nGet expert shopping advice delivered to your phone. Sign up for text message alerts from the deal-hunting nerds at Reviewed.\n\nThe documentary, which premiered on HBO Max on October 7, explores the phenomenon of public shaming from the perspective of those who have lived through it, as well as those who perpetrate it in the media and beyond. Lewinsky was 22 years old when she had a consensual affair with President Bill Clinton, and she has been relentlessly scrutinized and joked about in the years since. She has spoken openly about her PTSD, a result of the relentless shaming she suffered after her affair came to light, and she has emerged as an advocate for others in similar positions.\n\nWhere can you stream 15 Minutes of Shame?\n\nYou can stream 15 Minutes of Shame, as well as other HBO Max originals, on HBO Max. The streaming service is available in the U.S. and the following territories: American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, The Northern Mariana Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The streaming platform can be accessed from desktop browsers, mobile devices, game consoles, streaming devices and more.\n\nHBO Max is home to thousands of hours of new and classic content, from every show currently on HBO and in its back catalog, to new Max Originals, and many more titles from other Warner Media companies. That means fans will be able to watch everything from Studio Ghibli favorites like My Neighbor Totoro, to DC Entertainment titles like Suicide Squad, to CNN documentaries.\n\nWhat is 15 Minutes of Shame about?\n\n15 Minutes of Shame is a documentary that explores the way people, both public personalities and private citizens, have to navigate harassment online and in the media. While some versions of public shaming result in incremental progress toward fair treatment, public shaming is more typically weaponized to hurt individual people. Director Max Joseph embedded himself with people who have experienced everything from cyber-bullying to media scrutiny and also addresses the way that social and digital media perpetuate a never-ending news cycle that thrives on calling people out.\n\nExecutive produced by Monica Lewinsky, the film explores why we as a society love to cancel people, and what happens when public shaming goes too far and peoples’ livelihoods and lives suffer as a consequence.\n\nHow can I sign up for HBO Max?\n\nTo stream 15 Minutes of Shame, you can subscribe to HBO Max today, starting at $9.99/month or $99.99/year for a plan with ads, $14.99/month or $149.99/year for the ad-free version. The $9.99 plan with ads was launched in June 2021 with four significant differences to the $14.99 ad-free plan. The biggest difference is, well, the ads. In addition, subscribers to the $9.99 plan also do not have the ability to download content to their devices, there is no option to watch select films in 4K HD, and they will not receive same-day access to Warner Bros. films like Reminiscence or Wonder Woman 1984 on their theatrical release date.\n\nIf you're a new subscriber, you can sign-up at HBO Max's website. You’ll then need to download the HBO Max app on a supported device to start watching. HBO Max is currently available on Apple products, Roku streaming devices, Amazon Fire devices, Cox Contour 2 and Contour Stream Players, Google Chromecast, AirPlay, Android phones and TV devices, XBOX One and XBOX Series X|S, Xfinity One and Flex, PlayStation 4 and 5, LG TVs, select Samsung products, Spectrum WorldBox (available in select areas), Vizio SmartTVs, and Chrome OS, Mac OS or Windows PC.\n\nIn addition to its slate of high-profile documentaries, HBO Max subscribers can also access the libraries of HBO Originals, Studio Ghibli films, Looney Tunes, DC Films, Cartoon Network Collection, Turner Classic Movies Collection, and more.\n\nGet the latest on streaming, deals and more by signing up for our weekly newsletter.

Like \"Game of Thrones,\" to which the fantastical \"Wheel\" will inevitably draw comparisons, the world of the series is vast and full of mythology, culture and politics. But Judkins wants fans to fall in love with the characters, first and foremost.\n\nMore:The 10 best new TV shows to watch this fall, from 'Wheel of Time' to 'Muhammad Ali'\n\n\"The thing that’s always gotten people so excited about the book series and kept them reading for 14 books and a prequel book, is these characters at the center of it,\" Judkins says. \"Even if it takes them a little bit of time to catch up to the mythology of the world that we’re existing in, that they can identify with these people at the center of the show and want to follow what happens to them.\"\n\nWith Pike and Judkins' help, we answer some of the biggest questions you might have about \"Wheel\" ahead of its Amazon debut:\n\nWho are the major players in the 'Wheel' world?\n\nThe series is set in a world in which a select group of women have access to magical powers, but men can't tap into it without going insane and dying. When the story kicks off, an ancient evil (the \"Dark One\") is stirring and an ancient hero has been reborn into one of five young adults and friends from a tiny village: Rand (Josha Stradowski), Perrin (Marcus Rutherford), Mat (Barney Harris), Egwene (Madeleine Madden) or Nynaeve (Zoë Robins).\n\n\"At the center of (the show) are these five kids from a mountain village who are swept out of this place and out into the adventure of the world,\" says Judkins. \"Finding out which one of them is the Dragon Reborn will hopefully let people, through the eyes of these five kids, see this giant and complex world that surrounds them.\"\n\nPike's Moiraine is an Aes Sedai, or a woman who can \"channel\" the \"One Power,\" performing magic. Her life's mission is to find that chosen one, known as the Dragon Reborn, and deliver him or her to a final battle with the Dark One. She shows up in the tiny village and whisks the kids away.\n\n\"She’s a woman with tremendous sense of purpose, of honor, of mission,\" Pike says. \"She’s like the best army general you could wish for who has got a true north and is not going to deviate. But along the way she might make decisions that not everyone will admire because she’s always got her sole purpose. And so she’s not all good.\"\n\nMore:'She's so shocking': Rosamund Pike finds her new role of a lifetime with Netflix's 'I Care a Lot'\n\nMoiraine is accompanied on her adventures by her \"warder,\" Lan (Daniel Henney), her sworn fighter and protector.\n\nWho are the bad guys?\n\nThere are many other powerful women like Moiraine, but they don't all have the same goals.\n\nThe women who are Aes Sedai \"all have different political allegiances,\" Pike says. \"They’re divided into Ajahs, and Ajahs are like political parties. Moiraine is of the Blue Ajah, but it would mean that someone of the Red Ajah is very likely to be diametrically opposed to her.\"\n\nAlso in Moiraine's way are the forces of the Dark One, including eyeless \"fades,\" evil humans and monstrous \"trollocs\" that resemble minotaurs and other human/beast hybrids. She also has to worry about the Children of the Light, an extremist religious group that hates the Aes Sedai and seeks to burn them at the stake as witches.\n\nWhat does magic look like in 'Wheel'?\n\nOne of Pike's favorite parts filming \"Wheel\" was figuring out how she would show Moiraine performing magic.\n\n\"Robert Jordan describes it as channeling, which means it passes through you. So what is the cost of doing it?\" Pike says. \"I don’t want it to always look easy. Because I don’t think it always can be easy. ... The feeling of wielding the power is completely seductive. Almost like an elixir of very sensual (being) – a kind of total body state of pleasure.\"\n\nIs this the new 'Game of Thrones,' or what?\n\nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos famously said he wanted the company's streaming service to find its own version of HBO's fantasy hit, and \"Wheel\" certainly looks like the first attempt to recreate the fantasy magic that brought record ratings to HBO (a series based on the world of \"Lord of the Rings\" is due on Amazon next year). But Judkins insists that \"Wheel\" is its own story that isn't trying to recreate the \"Thrones\" hype.\n\nThe \"Wheel of Time\" books \"came before 'Game of Thrones,'\" Judkins points out (the first \"Wheel\" book was published in 1990, six years before George R.R. Martin published the first \"Thrones\"). \"I think that’s a problem that I see in a lot of stuff: it’s always chasing that ('Thrones' phenomenon). Whenever you’re in the position of chasing something you’re not likely to succeed. ... We don’t have to chase 'Thrones.' We can just bring this world (to life), which is really incredible.\"\n\nMore:'Fire and Blood': HBO releases first trailer for 'Game of Thrones' prequel, 'House of the Dragon'", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/03/us/five-things-april-3-trnd/index.html", "title": "5 things to know on April 3, 2022: Start your week smart: Ukraine ...", "text": "Curious about cryptocurrencies but don't know where to begin?

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more\n\n(CNN) A stellar nursery where stars are born, interactions between galaxies and a unique view of an exoplanet are just some of the new cosmic images were shared Tuesday.\n\nAfter decades of waiting, it's finally time for the world to see the first images taken bythe most powerful space telescope ever -- the James Webb Space Telescope\n\nDevelopment of the world's premier space observatory began in 2004, and after years of delays, the telescope and its massive gold mirror finally launched on December 25.\n\nThe images are worth the wait -- and they will forever change the way we see the universe.\n\nPresident Joe Biden released one of Webb's first images on Monday, and it is \"the deepest and sharpest infrared image of the distant universe to date,\" according to NASA. The rest of the high-resolution color images made their debut on Tuesday.\n\nThe space observatory can investigate the mysteries of the universe by observing them through infrared light, which is invisible to the human eye.\n\nWebb will peer into the very atmospheres of exoplanets , some of which are potentially habitable, and it could uncover clues in the ongoing search for life outside of Earth.\n\nThe telescope will also look at every phase of cosmic history, including the first glows after the big bang that created our universe and the formation of the galaxies, stars and planets that fill it today.\n\nNow, Webb is ready to help us understand the origins of the universe and begin to answer key questions about our existence, such as where we came from and if we're alone in the cosmos.\n\nThe first images\n\nThe first image, released on Monday, shows SMACS 0723, where a massive group of galaxy clusters act as a magnifying glass for the objects behind them. Called gravitational lensing, this created Webb's first deep field view that includes incredibly old and faint galaxies.\n\nThe image of SMACS 0723 is \"the deepest and sharpest infrared image of the distant universe to date,\" according to NASA.\n\nSome of these distant galaxies and star clusters have never been seen before. The galaxy cluster is shown as it appeared 4.6 billion years ago.\n\nThe image, taken by Webb's Near-Infrared Camera, is composed of images taken at different wavelengths of light over a collective 12.5 hours. Deep field observations are lengthy observations of regions of the sky that can reveal faint objects.\n\nWebb's other primary targets for the first image release included the Carina Nebula, WASP-96 b, the Southern Ring Nebula and Stephan's Quintet.\n\nWebb's study of the giant gas planet WASP-96 b is the most detailed spectrum of an exoplanet to date. The spectrum includes different wavelengths of light that reveal new information about the planet and its atmosphere. Discovered in 2014, WASP-96 b is located 1,150 light-years from Earth. It has half the mass of Jupiter and completes an orbit around its star every 3.4 days.\n\nNASA's James Webb Space Telescope captured a spectrum of WASP-96 b.\n\nWebb's spectrum includes \"the distinct signature of water, along with evidence for clouds and haze, in the atmosphere surrounding a hot, puffy gas giant planet orbiting a distant Sun-like star,\" according to NASA.\n\nThe observation demonstrates \"Webb's unprecedented ability to analyze atmospheres hundreds of light-years away,\" according to NASA.\n\nIn the future, Webb will capture actual images of known exoplanets while also searching for unknown planets, said Knicole Colón, Webb deputy project scientist for exoplanet science at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, during a news conference. And the spectrium of WASP-96 b is \"barely scratching the surface of what we're going to learn.\"\n\nColón anticipates that scientists will determine just how much water is in the exoplanet's atmosphere.\n\nThe Southern Ring Nebula, also called the \"Eight-Burst,\" is 2,000 light-years away from Earth. This large planetary nebula includes an expanding cloud of gas around a dying star. Webb helped reveal previously hidden details about the nebula, which is a shell of gas and dust released by the dying star. The nebula's second star can be seen in the Webb image, as well as how the stars shape the gas and dust cloud.\n\nThe second star is surrounded by dust while the brighter star, at an earlier stage of evolution, will release its own cloud of gas and dust later on. As the two stars orbit one another, they effectively \"stir\" the gas and dust, resulting in the patterns seen in the image.\n\nThe insights from images like this could help astronomers to unlock how stars change their environments as they evolve. Multi-colored points of light in the background represent galaxies.\n\nThe space telescope's view of Stephan's Quintet shows the way galaxies interact with one another. This compact galaxy group, first discovered in 1877, is located 290 million light-years away in the constellation Pegasus. Four of the five galaxies in the group \"are locked in a cosmic dance of repeated close encounters,\" according to a NASA statement.\n\nIf you've ever watched \"It's a Wonderful Life,\" you've seen Stephan's Quintet. Now, Webb has revealed the galactic grouping in a new mosaic which is the telescope's largest image to date.\n\n\"The information from Webb provides new insights into how galactic interactions may have driven galaxy evolution in the early universe,\" according to NASA.\n\nThe Stephan's Quintet image provides a rare glimpse into how galaxies can trigger star formation in one another when they interact, as well as outflows driven by a black hole at a new level of detail.\n\nThe gravitational dance between these galaxies can be seen through tails of gas, dust and stars and even shock waves as one of the galaxies pushes through the cluster.\n\nLocated 7,600 light-years away, the Carina Nebula is a stellar nursery, where stars are born. It is one of the largest and brightest nebulae in the sky and home to many stars much more massive than our sun.\n\nNow, its \"Cosmic Cliffs\" are revealed in an incredible new Webb image.\n\nWebb's ability to see through cosmic dust has revealed previously invisible areas of star birth within the nebula, which could provide new insight on the formation of stars. The earliest stages of star formation are harder to capture -- but something Webb's sensitivity can chronicle.\n\nWhat looks like a landscape in the image is really a massive gaseous cavity with \"peaks\" reaching 7 light-years high.\n\n\"The cavernous area has been carved from the nebula by the intense ultraviolet radiation and stellar winds from extremely massive, hot, young stars located in the center of the bubble, above the area shown in this image,\" according to NASA. And what looks like \"steam\" rising off the \"mountains\" is hot, energetic gas and dust.\n\nThe targets were selected by an international committee, including members from NASA, the European Space Agency, the Canadian Space Agency and the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore.\n\nJUST WATCHED 'I'm a little verklempt': Analyst breaks down stunning new Webb telescope images Replay More Videos ...

The Hubble Space Telescope's deepest fields took weeks to capture.\n\nThe rest of the high-resolution color images will make their debut on Tuesday, July 12.\n\nThe space observatory, which launched in December, will be able to peer inside the atmospheres of exoplanets and observe some of the first galaxies created after the universe began by viewing them through infrared light, which is invisible to the human eye.\n\nThe first image release highlights Webb's science capabilities as well as the ability of its massive golden mirror and science instruments to produce spectacular images.\n\nThere are several events taking place during Tuesday's image release, and all of them will stream live on NASA's website\n\nOpening remarks by NASA leadership and the Webb team will begin Tuesday at 9:45 a.m. ET, followed by an image release broadcast that kicks off at 10:30 a.m. ET. Images will be revealed one by one, and a news conference at 12:30 p.m. ET will offer details about them.\n\nThe first images\n\nNASA shared Webb's first cosmic targets on Friday, providing a teaser for what else Tuesday's image release will include: the Carina Nebula, WASP-96b, the Southern Ring Nebula and Stephan's Quintet.\n\nLocated 7,600 light-years away, the Carina Nebula is a stellar nursery, where stars are born. It is one of the largest and brightest nebulae in the sky and home to many stars much more massive than our sun.\n\nWebb's study of the giant gas planet WASP-96b will be the first full-color spectrum of an exoplanet. The spectrum will include different wavelengths of light that could reveal new information about the planet, such as whether it has an atmosphere. Discovered in 2014, WASP-96b is located 1,150 light-years from Earth. It has half the mass of Jupiter and completes an orbit around its star every 3.4 days.\n\nThis test image was taken by Webb's Fine Guidance Sensor over a period of eight days at the beginning of May. It shows how Webb can capture detailed images of very faint objects.\n\nThe Southern Ring Nebula, also called the \"Eight-Burst,\" is 2,000 light-years away from Earth.

All 39 belonged to Heaven's Gate , a quasi-religious sect that believed a spaceship traveling in the comet's tail was coming to help them ascend to a higher plane.\n\nThe realization that a powerful celestial event could cut two ways -- that it could bring people together in shared awe and also spark an unspeakable tragedy -- stayed with me even as the comet faded. I thought of the comet as I pored over the first remarkable images from the James Webb telescope , released by NASA earlier this week.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more\n\n(CNN) The James Webb Space Telescope is setting up shop while it chills out a million miles from Earth.\n\nThe observatory shared its first selfie from space after testing its iconic gold mirror and Near Infrared Camera.\n\nWebb has been in the process of cooling down and aligning its mirror segments since February 2, after reaching its orbital point beyond the moon on January 24 . The telescope launched to space on December 25 and will serve as NASA's most complex and powerful observatory yet.\n\nIf the images look a little blurry, that's to be expected, Webb team members said. Right now, the telescope is still in the commissioning phase before it begins collecting data and science observations this summer, when dazzling new images of our universe are expected to be released.\n\nCapturing starlight\n\nWebb's latest challenge was a trial run of the Near Infrared Camera, or NIRCam, identifying dots of starlight from the same star in each of the 18 hexagonal segments of its massive mirror. The telescope aimed its mirrors at a bright solitary star in the Ursa Major constellation called HD 84406.\n\n\"This star was chosen specifically because it is easily identifiable and not crowded by other stars of similar brightness, which helps to reduce background confusion,\" according to the Webb team.\n\nWebb created a mosaic of 18 points of starlight when mirror segments reflected this light back at the telescope's small secondary mirrors and into NIRCam's detectors.\n\nImages like the ones NASA shared on Friday can help the Webb team make sure the mirrors are perfectly aligned before the observatory sets its sights on exoplanets and distant galaxies, forever changing the way we see the universe.\n\nOver the next month, careful adjustments will unite the mirror segments so those 18 dots become an image of a single star.\n\n\"The entire Webb team is ecstatic at how well the first steps of taking images and aligning the telescope are proceeding. We were so happy to see that light makes its way into NIRCam,\" said Marcia Rieke, principal investigator for the NIRCam instrument and regents professor of astronomy at University of Arizona, in a statement.\n\nThe mosaic of 18 dots is the result of Webb capturing 1,560 images over the course of 25 hours, although the observatory was able to find the star during the first six hours and using just 16 images. The 18 points are just the center of a giant mosaic with more than 2 billion pixels.\n\nThese spots of starlight are just the center of a massive mosaic captured by Webb as it focused on a single star.\n\n\"This initial search covered an area about the size of the full Moon because the segment dots could potentially have been that spread out on the sky,\" said Marshall Perrin, deputy telescope scientist for Webb and astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, in a statement.\n\nThe mirror selfie was captured by a special lens inside NIRCam that can image the primary mirror rather than what Webb sees in space. The lens mainly exists for engineering and alignment, so it was a bonus image that made the Webb team say \"holy cow,\" said Lee Feinberg, Webb optical telescope element manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.\n\nKeeping a deep freeze to operate\n\nWebb's orbit will keep the telescope in line with Earth as our planet orbits the sun. This alignment protects the telescope from the heat released by the sun, Earth and even the moon.\n\nIt's imperative that the telescope stay cool because it will observe the universe in infrared light and detect the faintest signals from objects in our distant universe. Because infrared light can be detected as heat, the entire spacecraft needs to be shielded from bright sources of heat.\n\nThe spacecraft includes a five-layer sunshield to protect Webb's giant mirror and instruments from the sun's blistering rays. Webb's equipment needs to be kept at a very frigid negative 370 degrees Fahrenheit (negative 223 degrees Celsius) to operate.\n\nSome of Webb's instruments need to be even colder to operate, so they will continue to cool down over the next few months. Future images captured by Webb will only become clearer and more detailed as the spacecraft cools and the mirrors align.\n\n\"This amazing telescope has not only spread its wings, but it has now opened its eyes,\" Feinberg said.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/02/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/08/world/james-webb-telescope-mirror-scn/index.html", "title": "James Webb Space Telescope unfolds its giant mirror in space | CNN", "text": "Sign up for CNN's Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more\n\n(CNN) Just 14 days after launching, the world's most complex space observatory has already overcome some of its greatest challenges. The James Webb Space Telescope successfully completed the unfolding of its giant gold mirror on Saturday.\n\n\"I am so proud of the team -- spanning continents and decades -- that delivered this first-of-its kind achievement,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, in a statement. \"Webb's successful deployment exemplifies the best of what NASA has to offer: the willingness to attempt bold and challenging things in the name of discoveries still unknown.\"\n\nIt's the largest mirror NASA has ever built, but its size created a unique problem. The mirror was so large that it couldn't fit inside a rocket. Engineers designed the telescope as a series of moving parts that can fold origami-style and fit inside a 16-foot (5-meter) space for launch.\n\nThe mirror can extend 21 feet and 4 inches (6.5 meters) -- a massive length that will allow it to collect more light from objects in space. The more light the mirror can collect, the more details the telescope can observe.\n\nA look back in time\n\nIn addition to investigating the wealth of planets outside of our solar system, the observatory will peer back to some of the earliest galaxies that formed after the Big Bang and explore the very structure of the universe. Webb will act as an infrared sleuth, detecting light that is invisible to us and revealing otherwise hidden regions of space, including distant corners of our universe.\n\nAnd in order for the observatory to achieve those goals, the mirror's 18 hexagonal gold-coated segments had to unfold and lock together in perfect sequence.\n\nThe precarious process began on Wednesday when the spacecraft deployed a secondary mirror's support structure. Although much of the focus has been on Webb's iconic gold mirror, the light collected by it will actually hit a smaller, secondary 2.4-foot (0.74-meter) mirror. This relatively tiny mirror is what directs infrared light to Webb's science instruments.\n\nThree nearly 25-feet-long (7.6-meter-long) struts support this little mirror. Those were successfully lowered into place, locked and latched on January 5.\n\n\"Webb's secondary mirror had to deploy in microgravity, and in extremely cold temperatures, and it ultimately had to work the first time without error,\" said Lee Feinberg, optical telescope element manager for Webb at NASA's Goddard Spaceflight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, in a statement on Wednesday.\n\n\"It also had to deploy, position, and lock itself into place to a tolerance of about one and a half millimeters, and then it has to stay extremely stable while the telescope points to different places in the sky -- and that's all for a secondary mirror support structure that is over 7 meters in length.\"\n\nThis is what Webb's iconic primary mirror looks like when its segments are fitted together.\n\nWebb's gold mirror began to take shape as the first of the two primary wings was unfolded and latched on Friday. These wings are side panels that hold three mirror segments each. This was followed by the unfolding and latching of the second panel on the other side Saturday.\n\nRisky, painstaking process\n\nAll of Webb's deployments since launch have been controlled from the ground by a dedicated team working 12-hour shifts to ensure that Webb aces each achievement on its journey.\n\nUnfolding the mirrors didn't take long -- only about five minutes per side panel, thanks to a motor-driven process. But the meticulous latching of the panels into place took two hours for each one.\n\nThis artist's illustrations shows the Webb telescope as it appears in space after it's completely set up.\n\nNow that Webb's mirror and tennis court-size sunshield are in place, the telescope is considered to be \"fully deployed.\"\n\n\"The successful completion of all of the Webb Space Telescope's deployments is historic,\" said Gregory L. Robinson, Webb program director at NASA, in a statement. \"This is the first time a NASA-led mission has ever attempted to complete a complex sequence to unfold an observatory in space -- a remarkable feat for our team, NASA, and the world.\"\n\nIt will spend the next two weeks traveling to reach its intended orbit, which is about a million miles (1.6 million kilometers) from Earth.\n\nDuring that time, the telescope will make small adjustments to the mirror segments and make a final trajectory adjustment to insert itself into an orbit that reaches beyond the moon.\n\n\"While the journey is not complete, I join the Webb team in breathing a little easier and imagining the future breakthroughs bound to inspire the world,\" said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson in a statement. \"Each feat already achieved and future accomplishment is a testament to the thousands of innovators who poured their life's passion into this mission.\"\n\nA technically complex feat\n\nSensors, rather than images, have helped Webb's team monitor the spacecraft as it executed and completed each task.\n\nInitially, NASA considered adding cameras to the spacecraft to help with this process, but they were deemed unnecessary for several reasons. The large telescope has come to life in space by unfolding and unfurling multiple components, which have repeatedly changed its configuration. Webb is also incredibly shiny, so it would be difficult to reduce glare for the cameras. And they also would have added risk to an already incredibly complex design.\n\n\"Webb's built-in sense of 'touch' (for example, switches and various mechanical, electrical, and temperature sensors) provides much more useful information than mere surveillance cameras can,\" said Paul Geithner, technical deputy project manager for the Webb telescope at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, in a statement.\n\nOnce Webb reaches orbit, the telescope will go through a period of setting up shop in space that lasts for about five months, which involves cooling down, aligning and calibrating its instruments. All of the instruments also will go through a checkout process to see how they are functioning.\n\nWebb will begin to collect data and its first images later in 2022, and those are expected to be released in June or July, forever changing the way we see and understand the universe.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/01/08"}]}

The new record of 3.01 inches of rainfall in one hour replaced the airport's previous record of 2.9 inches in one hour, set on Aug. 31, 1976, according to Porter.\n\n\"There have been reports of over 13 inches from other parts of the of the Dallas-Fort Worth area, including 13.14 inches just northeast of the downtown area in the last 24 hours,\" he said.\n\nThe NWS issued several flash flood warnings with predictions of 3 to 6 additional inches of rainfall and 7 or more inches possible over the next week from central Texas to central Mississippi.\n\n\"Life-threatening flash flooding\" across the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex is expected to continue east toward Shreveport, Louisiana, through Monday night, Porter told USA TODAY. \"This is a very serious flooding situation that's evolving,\" he said.\n\nDrier conditions could be on the way for the Dallas areas after the heaviest rain Monday night later shifts toward the south and east, according to Porter.\n\nFlash flooding possible in New Jersey\n\nPersistent and \"quite serious\" downpours drenched portions of Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia on Sunday, Porter said, and the same system that produced flash flooding in those states moved into New Jersey early Monday.\n\nWater trickled onto some New Jersey roads Monday morning as flash flooding posed a threat to the central part of the state. The NWS issued several flash flood warnings for New Jersey cities Monday as conditions worsened. The risk for localized downpours and flash flooding will continue across parts of New York state up into New England, according to Porter.\n\nThe unsettled weather is expected to persist into early Tuesday along the Eastern Seaboard before drying out by Tuesday night, according to the NWS.\n\nFloods hit parts of Utah as woman remains missing\n\nFlooding caused issues in the Mountain states over the weekend, including in Arizona, where the Gila River nearly reached the “major” flood stage Monday, prompting an evacuation of the town of Duncan, ABC-15 News reported.\n\nThe area along the border of New Mexico and Arizona was under inches of water after storms raised the river’s water levels. The Utah city of Moab was hit hard by flooding Saturday after between 1-2 inches of rain, the NWS reported.\n\nIn southern Utah, a search-and-rescue team continued looking Monday for a woman who vanished in Springdale's Zion National Park, where park rangers reported multiple hikers getting swept away by flash floods on Friday. Rescuers were searching for Jetal Agnihotri in and around the Virgin River.\n\nSEARCH CONTINUES:Arizona woman still missing after flash flooding at Zion National Park\n\nWhy is the flooding happening?\n\nA moisture-laden mass of air that came from the tropics is behind the recent flooding, Porter said.\n\n\"That moisture pooling with other moisture that had been drawn into the southwestern part of the United States really set the stage for the flash flooding that occurred across Arizona and New Mexico and Utah,\" he said. \"That promoted the really extreme rainfall rates that we saw in some places.\"\n\nWATCH:Fire, flood threaten a New Mexico city's drinking water\n\n'MEGAFLOODS' LOOMING:Experts warn California of a disaster 'larger than any in world history.'

A bomb cyclone is defined as a storm whose central pressure plummets 24 millibars in 24 hours. The storm could whip up strong winds, pull in more moisture and drive higher snow totals as it heads toward New England, Lundberg said.\n\nIn the East, New York state was already being blasted Thursday by lake-effect snow. Buffalo had already picked up over 14 inches of snow by early afternoon, the National Weather Service said.\n\n\"Heavy snow at the Buffalo airport this morning has already established a record for the date,\" the National Weather Service tweeted Thursday.\n\nIn the South, Nashville was also seeing snow Thursday: \"Snow has spread across much of Middle Tennessee including Nashville Metro, and travel is deteriorating quickly,\" the National Weather Service in Nashville tweeted. \"1-2 inches per hour could fall at times.\"\n\nThursday was the snowiest day in Nashville since Jan. 22, 2016, when 8 inches of snow fell in one day, according to AccuWeather. As of noon Thursday, the airport was up to 4 inches since midnight, AccuWeather said.\n\nAuthorities in Tennessee urged people to travel only when necessary. Metro Nashville Police reported accidents and other driving woes that snarled and slowed several roads. Police reported dozens of wrecks on the roads by early afternoon.\n\nAlong the Kentucky border, authorities in Montgomery County, Tennessee, were dealing with dozens of crashes as well, including a wreck that killed one person involving a commercial vehicle on Interstate 24.\n\nSchools around the region canceled classes, including a closure through Friday for Nashville’s public school students. Parts of Maryland and Virginia were awaiting the storm, which was due to roll in Thursday afternoon and evening.\n\nIn and around Washington, D.C., where more than a foot of snow fell in some places Monday, up to 3 inches more snow was forecast Thursday night into Friday.\n\nWHAT IS A BOMB CYCLONE?:The weather phenomenon is basically a winter hurricane\n\nVirginia officials sought to reassure the public Thursday as they reacted to harsh criticism of their response to a snowstorm earlier this week that left hundreds of motorists stranded on Interstate 95 in frigid temperatures.\n\nCrews in Virginia worked through Tuesday to free up a roughly 50-mile traffic jam on I-95 that trapped scores of drivers in their cars for more than 24 hours. More than 100,000 Virginia homes and businesses remained without power Thursday from Monday's storm.\n\n\"These back-to-back storms will generate landmark winter weather that requires extra flexibility, particularly as many continue to deal with power outages,\" said Gov. Ralph Northam, who declared a state of emergency and has formally asked the Virginia National Guard for assistance ahead of the latest storm.\n\nNortham also pushed back against the criticism, questioning why drivers were out in force on the highways Monday when they had been warned to stay home.\n\nVirginia lawmakers, local officials, at least two members of Congress and the AAA auto club called for action. Stafford County Board of Supervisors Chair Crystal Vanuch, a Republican and lifelong county native, said Thursday that the gridlock was “probably the biggest disaster we’ve ever seen.”\n\nAccording to Vanuch, the county’s emergency operations command received roughly 1,800 calls for service over a 24-hour period — more than five times the normal amount — and local emergency workers told her they weren’t getting the help they needed from state officials.\n\nNortham, a Democrat who leaves office later this month, said in an uncharacteristically combative interview that he was “getting sick and tired of people talking about what went wrong.”\n\nHe told radio station WRVA that no one was injured and that people should be thanking first responders and emergency workers.\n\n'AN OUTRAGE': Why drivers were left stranded overnight, some for 24 hours, on I-95 in Virginia\n\nUp to a foot of snow could sweep across parts of Maine, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts, if the storm strengthens fast enough, AccuWeather said. Boston was expecting up to 8 inches.\n\n\"This will be a disruptive storm, and since cold air will be preceding the storm, snow will accumulate on roads as soon as it starts,” AccuWeather meteorologist Bernie Rayno said.\n\nICE CAUSES DEADLY TRAFFIC ISSUES: Virginia's Gov. Northam declares state of emergency\n\nLake-effect snow bands were already slamming Buffalo and surrounding areas of western New York on Thursday, producing snowfall rates of 1 to 2 inches per hour. Gusty winds up to 25 mph were also creating limited visibility and dangerous travel conditions along stretches of Interstate 90.\n\nThe news wasn't all bad, however: The storm presented a boon to the ski industry in West Virginia, where up to 8 inches of snow was forecast. Three of the state’s four major downhill ski resorts had suspended on-slope operations earlier this week because of warmer conditions. Now the activity was picking back up.\n\n“West Virginia can’t wait to welcome travelers to our snow-capped mountains this winter,” said Chelsea Ruby, secretary of the state’s Department of Tourism.\n\nElsewhere, in the Upper Midwest, parts of Michigan were buried under a foot of snow, with more expected into Friday. Minnesota and Wisconsin were expecting less snow, but wind chills of minus 25 to minus 35 will continue into Friday morning across much of the state, the weather service said.\n\nDangerously cold temperatures enveloping North Dakota have pushed wind chill readings down to minus 59 degrees in Bowbells, the county seat of Burke County in northwestern North Dakota.\n\nAnd a powerful storm was pounding parts of Colorado on Thursday with what could reach 16 inches of snow, the National Weather Service said.

From the Wasatch to the Colorado Rockies, mountain snow totals of a foot or more were forecast; localized amounts up to 2 feet were possible.\n\nWHAT DATA TELL US ABOUT YOUR STATE?:Our warming climate is having a dramatic impact on precipitation.\n\nThe University of California, Berkeley, Central Sierra Snow Lab in Donner Pass reported a 24-hour snow total of 38.9 inches, giving the lab site a whopping 193.7 inches for December. That smashed the old record of 179 inches set in 1970.\n\n\"Snow rates are still heavy and we could even break the 200\" mark today!\" the lab tweeted Monday.\n\nMammoth Mountain, a popular skiing destination in California, saw over two and a half feet of snow on Monday morning. The heavy snowfall, totaling almost 12 feet in December, led the resort to begin avalanche mitigation work.\n\nMullinax said the \"unrelenting\" pattern over the West Coast would spread east, fueling a storm in the Upper Midwest on Monday morning that could bring 6 inches to parts of Minnesota. Farther east, warmer air aloft will support the potential for an icy wintry mix from the Great Lakes to Pennsylvania.\n\n\"Travel delays due to icy conditions are possible ... on the ground and in the air,\" he said.\n\nSeattle-Tacoma airport, which experienced delays and cancellations on Sunday due to the winter conditions, saw temperatures as low as 17 degrees Fahrenheit on Monday morning, the lowest temperature observed at the airport since Nov. 24, 2010, according to AccuWeather.\n\nFarther south was a far different story. The South and Southeast remain under the influence of a system that will provide above-normal temperatures through midweek.\n\n\"Record warm temperatures are expected for broad areas of the South,\" Mullinax said. \"Parts of the South Central U.S. will soar into the 70s and 80s once again this afternoon, with temperatures becoming warmer across much of the Deep South by Tuesday.\"\n\nNumerous record warm highs and lows are on tap Tuesday and Wednesday, he said, and the abnormally warm temperatures, mixed with dry conditions and gusty winds, provide an elevated risk for wildfires.\n\nOn Sunday, Charlotte, North Carolina, recorded a temperature of 77, which broke its daily record for Dec. 26, Accuweather reported. Chattanooga, Tennessee, Birmingham, Alabama, and San Angelo, Texas, all broke records Sunday as well. Several cities in Texas saw daily records fall on Christmas Day.\n\n\"Dallas has been experiencing temperatures of nearly 11 degrees above average for the first 20 days of the month,\" AccuWeather meteorologist Randy Adkins said.

Up to a foot of snow was likely from northeast Kansas to the Chicago Metro area, a Weather Prediction Center forecast said. Freezing rain and sleet was possible from eastern Kansas into central to northern Missouri and west central Illinois.\n\n\"We are continuing to see snow accumulating on the roads,\" the National Weather Service in Chicago said on Twitter Saturday afternoon, warning of steady snowfall through the evening.\n\nIntense cold was expected to continue across much of the north-central U.S., where wind chill readings will drop to as low as 50 below zero in some areas, including Montana and North Dakota, over the next few days. \"The dangerously cold wind chills could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 10 minutes,\" the National Weather Service warned.\n\nAt the same time, unusual warmth could lead to hundreds of record-high temperatures across the southeastern U.S., the Weather Service said.

A blizzard by definition is not simply a large snowstorm. It requires snow or blowing snow in winds of at least 35 mph and a quarter-mile visibility for 3 hours or longer, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nIn Monroe County and surrounding counties, a winter storm warning is in effect until 8 p.m. Wednesday.\n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo, in a mid-morning news conference, said the storm in New York City and Long Island was not as bad as expected. But it is \"worse than anticipated elsewhere in the state\" including Broome County in the Southern Tier and other communities in Central New York, where around 30 inches have fallen.\n\nAccording to the National Weather Service in Binghamton, 26.4 inches of snow was measured as of 6 p.m. near the NWS office near the Binghamton Regional Airport.

Cuomo said roughly 2,000 trucks and 443,000 tons of road salt would be on standby across the state to respond to the storm. County crews were also preparing to salt and plow local roads. Cuomo warned against any unnecessary travel in New York state on Tuesday.\n\nGreece Town Supervisor Bill Reilich is asking residents to restrict travel to necessary travel only. \"The more folks that stay off the road the better,\" he said via a Facebook post. \"They are predicting the potential of a foot of snow or more.\"\n\nCounty officials have not officially restricted travel within Monroe County but reminded residents of the challenges of driving in the snow as the storm continues through Wednesday night. Seneca County sheriff's deputies on the other hand, issued a travel advisory Tuesday morning asking citizens to avoid traveling today.\n\nDatabase:Record temps and precipitation for every day\n\nAirport issues\n\nTravelers will want to check the status of their flight at the Greater Rochester International Airport as the late-winter snowstorm pounds the East Coast. The storm continues to ground flights nationally, impacting dozens of inbound and outbound flights in Rochester. \"Anybody looking to travel on Tuesday, whether by land or air, will find it difficult or impossible in many places,\" AccuWeather senior meteorologist Tom Kines warned.\n\nAmtrak modifies schedule\n\nAmtrak will operate a modified train schedule Wednesday throughout the Northeast, due to the snowstorm. Passengers are encouraged to monitor conditions, make any necessary changes, or utilize the Amtrak mobile app to check their train status.\n\nPassengers should allow for extra time to get to the station and be mindful of slippery conditions at stations, on platforms, and in the doorways of trains.

Of the 972 homes without power, 455 are in Rochester, RG&E said.\n\nThe outages were down significantly since last Wednesday, when a windstorm swept across the area bringing down poles, trees and power to tens of thousands in Monroe County. Meanwhile, National Grid reported that service to its customers in the western portion of the county had been restored.\n\nFuture forecast\n\nSorry, spring lovers. After the storm exits, a second blast of arctic air will keep the eastern half of the nation in its clutches for the rest of the week. “Winter will hold a tight grip on the Northeast in wake of the significant snowstorm early this week,” AccuWeather Meteorologist Max Vido said.\n\nCity recycling, refuse delay\n\nGarbage and recycling collection in the city of Rochester will be delayed one day for the remainder of the week, Mayor Lovely Warren announced.\n\n\"Wednesday’s collection will take place on Thursday, Thursday’s collection will take place on Friday, and Friday’s collection will take place on Saturday,\" Warren said in a release.

The Des Moines Register will be providing updates as more information becomes available.\n\n5:05 p.m. 'Sun showed the true devastation'\n\nMadison County Sheriff Jason Barnes did not sleep overnight. At 11 a.m. Sunday, Barnes talked to residents just northeast of U.S. HWY 169.\n\nOn Saturday night Barnes had said, “It looked like a bomb went off.” As he was out surveying the damage and talking to residents, he said it was even worse than he initially thought.\n\n“It’s every bit of last night and more,” Barnes said. “Sun showed the true devastation.” - Philip Joens\n\n5:02 p.m. Wedding dress of Cecilia Lloyd, who died in the Winterset tornado, is recovered from the rubble\n\nMichelle McCool lives three houses south on Carver Road of Cecilia and Tom Lloyd’s house. She and her husband watched the tornado go past their house and turn before they lost sight of it. She had never been through a tornado before.\n\n“I thought it was a loud truck coming up the road,” McCool said. “And it got louder, louder. You could see the debris in the clouds as it went over.”\n\nVolunteers at the Lloyd’s house treated McCool like the foreperson there. McCool kept the most precious personal belongings found — a film reel, social security cards, a Bible and even glassware that survived without breaking — in her pickup truck. She coordinated with people who had questions and occasionally gave out orders. The son of Cecilia and Tom Lloyd was in the hospital with his dad. Cecilia was one of six in Winterset who died as a result of the tornado.\n\nAround 2:30 p.m., a volunteer found Cecilia Lloyd’s wedding dress wrapped in a garment bag. McCool placed the old lace dress in the passenger seat of her pickup and couldn’t help but tremble.\n\n“That’s sad,” McCool said as she choked up. “Especially knowing she didn’t make it.\n\n“That’s the tough stuff. It’s the personal side of it, you know?”\n\nWinterset residents, including McCool, said that the community spirit shown Sunday felt important. People came from as far away as Pella, New Sharon and Pleasant Hill to clean up.\n\n“It brings you tears,” McCool said. “You always hear about the bad in the world, (then) you see this. There are good people. This is what matters.” - Philip Joens\n\n4:39 p.m. MidAmerican reports fewer than 1,000 still without power\n\nAbout 800 customers are still without power primarily in the southern and southeastern parts of the Des Moines metro, said MidAmerican Media Relations Manager Geoff Greenwood.\n\nAs of 4:30 p.m., 558 of those customers are in Des Moines and greater Polk County and 157 are in Norwalk and greater Warren County. At its peak Saturday, MidAmerican reports that about 10,500 customers were affected.\n\nSunday night's anticipated snowfall may slow crews down, with some residents expected to be without power through at least tomorrow, Greenwood said.\n\n4:17 p.m. A meaningful treehouse stood no chance during Saturday's tornadoes\n\nSheltering in their basement during Saturday's tornadoes, Von and Chris Miller of Pleasant Hill had no idea what kind of damage their property would sustain.\n\nNow, on Sunday, friends and family have gathered to help the Millers clean up downed trees and the wreckage that remains of the family's gazebo and treehouse. This was the first tornado the couple had experienced while living in their Pleasant Hill home, but both were prepared for the storms.\n\n\"We both grew up on farms in Iowa,\" Chris Miller said. \"If it wasn't like right outside your house, you just stood outside and watched it.\"\n\nThe Millers lost power around 5:30 p.m. Saturday and expect to be without power for a couple weeks, as several of the utility poles holding power lines in their neighborhood either snapped or were leveled completely.\n\nMORE: As they clean up, Iowans share harrowing stories of destruction, survival from Saturday's tornadoes and severe weather\n\n\"We are very fortunate and very lucky that our house is still livable,\" Von said. \"The neighbors lost their roof, two houses down she lost her whole house. It was on a slab and it's just gone.\"\n\nWhile their house took less severe damage, the treehouse destroyed in the tornado held special meaning for the family.\n\n\"We'll probably put something out there (to replace it),\" Von said. \"The sad thing is, when we added onto this house, we had an old two-story garage that was kind of pulling off. Our daughter asked what we were going to do with it.\n\n\"My daughter and I tore it down, pulled all the nails out, salvaged all the wood and built a two-story treehouse. And now that's gone. It's kind of sad.\"\n\nParts of the treehouse and gazebo were blown onto neighboring property, and pieces of neighbors' property are now in the Millers' yard. - Grace Altenhofen\n\n4:12 p.m. NWS Des Moines says to be prepared for winter weather Sunday night\n\nPeak snowfall will occur between 9 p.m. and 3 a.m. from Sunday night to early Monday morning. \"Be prepared for possible slick roads,\" NWS said in a tweet.\n\nMORE: What is a 'wedge' tornado and did we see one in Iowa on Saturday?\n\nThe most amount of snow is predicted to happen in southeast Iowa, although Winterset and Chariton, two of the cities most affected by Saturday's tornadoes and severe weather, are included in the NWS map.\n\n3:45 p.m. Winterset boys basketball plays in the state tournament Tuesday. On Sunday, they were cleaning up tornado damage\n\nWhen a devastating tornado hit Winterset Saturday, members of the Winterset Huskies boys basketball team sprang to action.\n\nTuesday at 3:45 p.m., No. 4 seed Winterset (19-5) will play No. 5 seed Marion (19-5) in the Class 3A boys state basketball tournament at Wells Fargo Arena in Des Moines.\n\nSunday, however, the Huskies were far from the court, at the home of Cecilia Lloyd, 72, who was killed in the tornado.\n\nAn overturned Cadillac rested where a three-car garage used to be. Photos, statues, video tapes and other knick-knacks sat scattered across the property Cecilia Lloyd shared with her husband Tom Lloyd, who was seriously injured.\n\nWinterset head coach Josh Henry picked up personal belongings shortly after arriving at about 1:30 p.m. Henry and other Huskies never imagined they’d be working in the mud on a bitterly cold day in Winterset three days before their state tournament appearance.\n\nBut at Cecilia Lloyd’s home, life humbled Henry and his players.\n\n“It’s way more than basketball. We preach that to our guys anyway,” Henry said. “This is real life seeing that play out. Picking up clothes and personal belongings, it shows you that life is way more than basketball or any sport.”\n\nThe stakes Tuesday at Wells Fargo Arena will be high. Henry and his team want to win. But this is life, he said. That's so, so much more important. Brayden Dinkla, one of Winterset's players, told the Register a cheerleader's house was destroyed, as was the house of an uncle of one of the players.\n\n“We as a society put so much emphasis on sports,\" Henry said. \"But things like this help everyone open their eyes up.”\n\nMORE: See photos and videos of damage from the tornadoes and severe weather that swept through Iowa on Saturday\n\nSenior Blake Bellamy is a forward for Winterset. He met up with Henry and several of his teammates at 1 p.m. to clean up at houses around Winterset.\n\nLike his teammates, Bellamy is excited for Tuesday. When the tornado hit Saturday, he was in Des Moines. Bellamy echoed his coach’s sentiment that this showed the importance of sports as an escape, but that they also have their place.\n\n“At the end of the day basketball is just basketball. This is real life stuff that needs to be done before basketball,” Bellamy said. “Basketball doesn’t come first when stuff like this happens.”\n\n3:20 p.m. Red Haw State Park in Chariton has extensive damage and will be closed for the time being\n\nIowa DNR spokesperson Tammie Krausman said there was extensive damage to trees, a few beach docks and then campground, where a woman was ultimately killed at Red Haw State Park in Chariton, Iowa.\n\nTwo shelters and a storage building are \"pretty much demolished,\" she said.\n\nKrausman said they still don't know the full extent of damage. The park is closed and she doesn't know when it will reopen at this time.\n\n2:53 p.m. Names of 6 people who died from Winterset tornado released\n\nAccording to Iowa State Patrol Sergeant Alex Dinkla, they are:\n\nMelissa Bazley, 63\n\nRodney Clark, 64\n\nCecilia Lloyd, 72\n\nMichael Bolger, 37\n\nKinlee Bolger, 5\n\nOwen Bolger, 2\n\nThere also also six more people being treated for their injuries, according to Dinkla.\n\n2:38 p.m. Carver Road in Winterset is closed; Winterset school bus transporting volunteers to help\n\nMadison County Emergency Management Director Diogenes Ayala said Carver Road is closed and that they have a Winterset school bus picking up volunteers and transporting them to clean-up areas to keep traffic off the road.\n\n\"Today, as we're talking, people are out there picking up debris, using chainsaws because they wanted to help,\" Ayala said.\n\n2:31 p.m. Official says warning system worked 'really well'\n\nMadison County Emergency Management Director Diogenes Ayala said he thinks the weather warning system in the county worked “really well.\"\n\n\"I know for my agency, my office, we sent out about three or four notifications,\" he said. \"Even when the tornado warning came through, we sent out a quick alert.\n\n\"We did our best to make sure everyone was aware of what was going on before the storm and after the storm as well.\"\n\n2:28 p.m. Official says Winterset tornado affected 52 homes, spanned 13.7 miles\n\nMadison County Emergency Management Director Diogenes Ayala said the EF-3 tornado that struck Winterset spanned over 13.7 miles damaged or destroyed 52 homes.\n\n\"I cannot express the heroism of the responders that were out there last night and worked tirelessly across the state to make sure that every single person that was missing is accounted for,\" Ayala said, \"and worked to really make sure that we can get up this morning to do the exact same thing again.\"\n\n2:20 p.m. Gov. Reynolds says FEMA is ready to help after Iowa tornado damage\n\nReynolds she heard from Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas of the Department of Homeland Security this morning and he had already reached out to FEMA, which stands ready if there’s anything they need to do.\n\nMadison County Emergency Management Director Diogenes Ayala said American Red Cross Madison County has an emergency shelter set up at Newbridge Church in Winterset for anyone needing assistance.\n\n2:10 p.m. Gov. Kim Reynolds teared up when talking about volunteers after touring Iowa tornado damage in Winterset\n\n\"Lastly before I turn it over, (I want to) just to talk about the number of volunteers; 200-300 Iowans not only from Madison County and Winterset but from communities and towns all across the state that were on the ground the minute it was light and they started helping.\"\n\n\"Over and over the response was 'We’re Iowans. That’s what we do. We show up. We take care of our family. We take care of our neighbors. We take care of our community.\"\n\n\"I'm proud of Iowans and the way that they always step up and respond and I'm so proud of local leaders and the coordination that takes place every time we have an emergency disaster.\"\n\n2:03 p.m. Kim Reynolds calls the damage in Winterset 'devastating'\n\nDuring her 2 p.m. press conference following a tour of damage from the Winterset tornado, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds opened by calling the damage \"devastating.\"\n\n\"It was unimaginable the destruction we were able to witness on the brief tour we just went through,\" she said.\n\n1:31 p.m. Saturday's formation could be a 'wedge' tornado\n\nA tornado that hit Madison County in Iowa Saturday and killed six people there was so wide it could be considered a wedge tornado.\n\nThe term is pretty subjective and based on appearances, said National Weather Service meteorologist Alex Krull. There aren't any exact measurements that define a wedge tornado, only that the formation is very large — typically short and wide.\n\nThe Register has more information on wedge tornadoes online.\n\n1:17 p.m. Faith Mathews felt the tornado pulling her away as she ran inside\n\nAt the end of a particularly hard-hit stretch of Southeast Sixth Avenue in Runnells, a long line of 120-foot high MidAmerican highline wooden power lines were toppled, prohibiting people who wanted to help about six neighbors whose homes and barns were severely damaged in the storm.\n\nFaith Mathews said she and her husband David had just returned home on Saturday around 4:30 p.m. and were assessing the weather when they both heard the wind making a strange sound.\n\nDavid yelled at Faith from outside the house to get down into the basement.\n\nFaith said she could feel the tornado pulling her away from the house as she made her way down toward the basement. She covered their dog with her body. David covered them both with his.\n\nWhen they finally were able to get up, their home was completely destroyed.\n\nThe tornado tore the roof off the three-bedroom home and crumbled the brick walls. The Mathews’ coffee business, American Pride Roasters, which sells beans at the downtown Des Moines Farmers Market, also was destroyed. A Lance camper the couple purchased last fall sat upside down on the couple’s Corvette. Two Ford pickups also were damaged. The house was uninhabitable.\n\n“You just think this isn’t real,” said Faith Mathews, who is 45. “I don’t know how I feel really. I think I’m still in a lot of shock.”\n\nBy noon Sunday, numerous people had reached out to help the neighbors along Southeast Sixth Ave, though many could not get near the homes and farms.\n\n“It’s so amazing how people reach out,” Faith Mathews said. “We’ll rebuild. It’s all we can do.”\n\nIn the farm field next to the Mathews home, corn stalks were bent to the ground toward the east, the direction of the tornado. Grain wagons from a five-generation farm a half mile away were tossed around like children’s toys.\n\nThe grain wagons belonged to Tim Fritz, who lost his 180-year-old barn, original to the family farm he grew up on, when the tornado tore through from the 8400 block to 9300 block of Southeast Sixth.\n\nDowned trees and other debris also lay in the field. Fritz and his girlfriend Julie were hauling cattle to southwest Iowa when the tornado hit, they said.\n\nAt Four Mile Elementary School, members of the Red Cross, the Polk County Sheriff’s Department, Pleasant Hill Fire Department and other volunteers stood by to help families who stopped in infrequently needing help.\n\nBut most neighbors who were affected, as well as their family and their friends, were busy cleaning up the widespread damage on their properties as snow was forecast to hit the area by evening. - Lee Rood\n\n1:10 p.m. Professor estimates $1 billion in damages after Iowa tornado, severe weather\n\nNorthern Illinois University meteorology professor Victor Gensini told the Associated Press that Saturday's tornadoes and severe weather across Iowa, combined with wind damage as far away as Illinois, likely caused more than $1 billion in damages.\n\n1:02 p.m. 'It was so loud, it was quiet. I don't know how else to describe it.'\n\nJosie Carter and her father Chad Carter rode out the Winterset tornado in the basement of their home on top of a tall hill about a mile northeast of U.S. HWY 169. On Sunday morning, a small army of volunteers helped them clean up what remained of their home.\n\n“It was so loud, it was quiet,” Josie Carter, 17, said. “I don’t know how else to describe it. I could hear it was a big wind storm, then so much was going on. It just went quiet and still. I want to say that was the eye.”\n\n“I just remember the pressure,” Chad Carter added.\n\nThey narrowly survived, they said.\n\n“I was able to get to the basement and the door slammed because of the wind, but (my dad) was still at the bottom of the stairs. He didn’t quite get into the basement. So I thought he was gone,” Josie Carter said.\n\nThe Carters moved into the home about eight years ago. On Sunday morning, they found a few pictures and keepsakes among the rubble.\n\n“No treasures yet,” Chad Carter said. - Philip Joens\n\n12:54 p.m. Description of a man being inside a Chariton camper that was thrown into the air\n\nThe owner of Country Cabins in Chariton, Nick Cattell, told the Register a man was in one of his campers when it was propelled in the air by a tornado Saturday.\n\n12:48 p.m. HyVee offers meals to impacted families\n\nEmergency centers are continuing to serve impacted areas Sunday. In Winterset, the New Bridge Church is open as a shelter. A nearby Casey's also stayed open through the night to help first responders.\n\nIn Polk County, Four Mile Elementary has been set up as a temporary hub for the Red Cross. HyVee will be serving free lunches to staff, families and emergency personnel starting at 1 p.m.\n\nThe Red Cross has asked for cash donations at this time. They are not in need of clothing or food right now.\n\n12:38 p.m. Kim Reynolds is in Winterset\n\nIowa's governor is in Winterset to survey the damage from the tornado that killed six and damaged 25-30 homes on Saturday. She is expected to hold a press conference at 2 p.m.\n\n12:25 p.m. 'It’s like God came down, rolled the trailer into a ball and threw it back down to the ground'\n\nNorm Paulsen Sr. said he could see the tornado’s path.\n\nThe house across the street with its garage replaced with a pile of rubble, the snapped trees on his property — he imagined that destruction happened before the tornado made a direct hit on Paulsen’s dream, the Soda Pop Saloon.\n\nFor over 20 years the saloon had been a place where families in Chariton and beyond would come together, laugh and dance line, two and three step, polka and waltz without alcohol. A place where children could “get their fingers off them damn contraptions,” as Paulsen puts it.\n\nAnd throughout the years, he said he’s always heard the phrase: “I wish I had something like this in my hometown.” People didn’t think his dream could fly, he said, but it did.\n\n“It’s the neatest place in southern Iowa,” Paulsen, 83, said of his western rustic-meets-retro establishment. Old CDs, guitars, western posters and cowboy hats still don the panels and walls of what’s left of the structure.\n\nBut the Soda Pop Saloon wasn’t hit the hardest on his property, which is called the Frontier Trading Post. It stood upright, despite a large swath of its roof blown off. Next door, the family’s antique barn, was destroyed.\n\nAnd just a little further, trailers, a large Conex cargo container and fishing merchandise propelled from the tornado laid scattered across the family’s 8-acre property, hundreds of feet away from where they should be.\n\n“It’s like God came down, rolled the trailer into a ball and threw it back down to the ground,” said Cindy Reyes, Paulsen’s daughter, of their Diamond Trio trailer discovered upside down in trees, crushed and crumpled.\n\nThe Diamond Trio is a country band Paulsen started with his sister, Charlotte, and Reyes – another one of Paulsen’s dreams.\n\nOn Sunday, the Paulsen family came together to asses the damage and make sure their loved ones were accounted for. Humor plays a large part in the family’s make up – Norm Paulsen Jr. says he gets his bad jokes from his father – and to cope with the loss, they cracked jokes with one another.\n\nBut when Norm Paulsen Sr. drove up to the property, it was quiet.\n\nHis brother, Richard Roberts, 67, warned him: “It’s even worse out back – you will never imagine the devastation.\"\n\nIt took a few minutes for Paulsen Sr. to collect himself. But when he did, he sat down in the untouched gift shop of the trading post.\n\n“Where the hell do you even start,” he said.\n\nThen, Paulsen Sr. laughed.\n\n“Looks like the summer opening of the Soda Pop Saloon will be delayed a week or two.”\n\nHis family surrounding him laughed, too. - Andrea May Sahouri\n\nMore:See photos and videos of the damage from Saturday's deadly tornado in Iowa\n\n11:48 a.m. One fatality, one injury in Chariton\n\nThe Department of Natural Resources confirmed that one person has died and another was injured when a tornado swept through Red Haw State Park in Chariton.\n\n\"Extensive damage\" throughout the campground included \"significant\" destruction to \"the beach area, including the boat docks, the Bait House, beach shelters and a storage building,\" the department said in a news release.\n\n\"The park is currently without power,\" according to the release. \"The public is asked to keep away from the area, so debris clean-up and repairs can be completed.\"\n\n11:40 a.m. Upcoming Des Moines, Iowa, weather forecast\n\nAccording to National Weather Service Des Moines, the worst of the severe weather that struck Iowa Saturday and caused destruction in Winterset and Chariton is done.\n\nBut tonight the Des Moines area is expected to get rain and snow before 9 p.m., which could affect road conditions in damaged areas.

One person with life-threatening injuries was taken to a Des Moines hospital with serious injuries, Ayala said.\n\nThe tornado hit about 25 to 30 homes and the fatalities were in different locations, Ayala said. He would not say how many residents live in the area because families were still being notified that people died. After hitting the neighborhood, the tornado continued northeast through Madison County.\n\n“On Carver Road we saw the biggest impact of the tornadoes,” Ayala said. “On both sides there was a big impact to housing. Many people had their houses lost.”\n\nAn emergency shelter was set up at New Bridge Church at 1305 W. Jefferson St. in Winterset for anyone needing assistance.\n\nCarver Road is closed Saturday night near the affected area. People were asked to avoid the affected area Saturday night. Volunteers can gather at the Madison County Chamber of Commerce Sunday morning to help clean up.\n\nEMS, firefighters and police officers from around central Iowa responded to search for victims, Ayala said.

He saw the swirl marks in the fields from the tornado as he drove to the scene and said it looked like it had been a wide tornado.\n\nNational Weather Service meteorologists will be at the scene Sunday surveying the damage to get an estimate of its path, length on the ground and width.\n\n“It looked like a bomb went off,” Barnes said. “I’m not going to sugarcoat it. It’s bad. Leveled houses, trees. Just unbelievable.”\n\nFor days, the NWS warned there could be a chance of severe weather, the first of 2022, coming on the heels of the Dec. 15 derecho which spawned 63 tornadoes in Iowa. Early in the day Saturday, the NWS raised the risk of severe weather to \"enhanced\" for Des Moines and areas south of Des Moines.\n\n“I knew to be watching it, to be paying attention.

Overnight curfews were in effect beginning at 6 p.m. Sunday in Columbia, Sumter and several counties.\n\nGov. Nikki Haley on Sunday said South Carolina's first responders were battling flooding from rains that can be expected once in 1,000 years.\n\n\"Our goal is all hands on deck,\" Haley said of the emergency response. \"We will get through this, but we need everyone to stay strong.\"\n\nThe National Weather Service's Charleston office reported \"mind-boggling rain amounts.\" They included 24-plus inches in Mount Pleasant, a suburb of Charleston, since the storm began Thursday. Columbia recorded more than 10 inches.\n\nPresident Obama approved federal disaster aid for South Carolina.\n\nHaley said first responders received more than 750 rescue calls in a 12-hour period that started before dawn Sunday. Hundreds of road closures were reported, including a section of Interstate 95, the vital highway connecting eastern states from Maine to Florida.\n\nHaley said 600 National Guard personnel have been called out, with hundreds more on alert. And she warned residents not to plan on getting out until Tuesday to ease the burden on rescue personnel.\n\nAmong those rescued were a mother and her 15-month-old daughter, who were rescued from the roof of their flooded home by a Coast Guard air crew in Huger, about 25 miles north of Charleston, on Sunday. A helicopter crew from Coast Guard Air Station Savannah, Ga., evacuated the pair to Mt. Pleasant Regional Airport.\n\nAccuWeather senior meteorologist Dan Pydynowski called the weather event the worst in the state since Hurricane Hugo, which made landfall near Charleston as a Category 4 storm in 1989, killing 27 people in the state.\n\n\"Charleston got 11.5 inches of rain on Saturday, which is a one-day record,\" Pydynowski said. \"Today Columbia is setting records.\"\n\nHeavy rain pounds South, floods historic Charleston, S.C.\n\nIn Mount Pleasant, Sarah Shinners said her home was above the waterline — but the only road out of her neighborhood was impassable.\n\n\"Everything around us is completely flooded. It's terrible,\" Shinners told USA TODAY. \"We are just hunkering down.\"\n\nMuch of the East Coast has been saturated by rains that have lingered since Thursday. Power was knocked out to about 50,000 residences and businesses in South Carolina and Georgia as of Sunday afternoon.\n\n\"Major to localized catastrophic flash flooding along with possible landslides and mudslides in the higher elevations of South Carolina and Georgia remain an ongoing concern,\" the National Weather Service warned.\n\nFlood warnings also were issued for three Virginia counties. North Carolina also was dealing with flash flooding on some secondary roads, and some ferry services were canceled. But South Carolina was taking the brunt of the unrelenting storm.\n\nChris Morris is one of the lucky ones in his Charleston neighborhood. He said many neighbors have evacuated, but his family's home is on a raised slab and hasn't been breached. He lives on a golf course, but you would not know that by looking at it.\n\n\"We woke up this morning to about 10 inches of water surrounding the house,\" Morris told USA TODAY. \"And the golf course is completely under water.\"\n\nThe weather service blamed a low pressure system that has stalled over the state since Thursday, combined with the outer edges of Hurricane Joaquin. The Category 2 hurricane, with sustained top winds of 105 mph, avoided a direct hit to the U.S. but did add fuel to rains and high wind along the coast. Joaquin was forecast to lash Bermuda late Sunday and Monday.\n\nSouth Carolina emergency management officials counseled residents to \"remain where you are if you are safely able to do so. Call 911 for life-threatening emergencies.\"\n\nIn Columbia, officials said many residents were without drinking water because of water main breaks. Greater downtown Columbia and southeast Richland County were most affected. City officials said those affected should be prepared to be without potable water from the city system for three to four days. The city issued a boil water advisory for all of its 375,000 customers.\n\nCity fire officials said several dams had breached. WLTX-TV meteorologist Jim Gandy said the Village of Sandhill had received 11 inches of rain by 6 a.m. On I-95 in Clarendon County, a 32-mile stretch of road was closed. Parts of Interstate 77 and Interstate 20 also were covered in water.\n\nColumbia Fire Chief Aubrey Jenkins told WLTX-TV that the city has been inundated with rescue calls.\n\n\"We do need more resources,\" Jenkins said. \"People who can't get out should call 9-1-1.

Traffic was at a standstill in some areas because of roads blocked by downed trees, poles and wires.\n\nThe storm's fury stretched far beyond Massachusetts. Some Amtrak trains across the Northeast corridor were delayed by the weather. In New York, high winds at La Guardia Airport on Thursday caused some arriving flights to be delayed an average of 1 hour and 47 minutes, the FAA said. And the Yankees-Astros baseball playoff game Wednesday night was canceled because of heavy rains and high winds.\n\nIn Maine, more than 200,000 power customers – a quarter of the state – were without power and the number was rising Thursday.

The cause of the accident remains under investigation. However, AccuWeather meteorologists say rainy weather could be to blame.\n\n“At the time of the crash, heavy rain was falling across the area and could have been a factor,” AccuWeather meteorologist Jake Sojda said.\n\nMost of the rain was ending Thursday, but Deger warned that strong winds will persist across much of the region through the day.

What is it and how does it happen?\n\nOfficials also said wind-blown snow could make travel “nearly impossible.” Forecasters say the storm could unload over 3 feet of snow and up to 90-mph winds as it pounds eastern New England.\n\nThe strong winds raised concerns about potential power outages. The Eversource utility company, which serves much of New England, secured hundreds of extra repair crews and is placing them in locations that are expected to be hardest hit by the storm.\n\nAcross New England, the inevitable, shelf-clearing rush for bread, eggs, milk and other vittles at grocery stores was well underway Friday.

In Boston, wind chills could dip as low as 7 below zero.\n\n“This has the potential to be a historic storm,\" Boston Mayor Michelle Wu said during a news conference Friday morning.\n\nA snow emergency goes into effect in Boston at 9 p.m., when parking will be banned on major city streets. The city has not seen a snowstorm deliver more than 2 feet of snow during the month of January. If amounts exceed 28 inches, which is possible, it would become the city's biggest snow event on record, Axios reported.\n\nNew York City, meanwhile, could see up to a foot of snow from the storm, the National Weather Service predicted.\n\nAirlines braced for the highest single-day total of cancellations in three weeks. By midday Friday, airlines had canceled more than 1,000 flights in the U.S., and they had already scrubbed about 2,500 scheduled for Saturday, according to tracking service FlightAware. The hardest-hit airports included those in Chicago, the New York City area and Boston.\n\nThe storm is classified as a nor'easter, named because of the direction from which the winds blow as the system moves up the coast.

The snow isn't done yet, either.\n\n\"The cold will continue to shift south and east into Wednesday, finally encompassing more than half of the country,\" Roys said.\n\nMore than 300 daily records could fall through Thursday, the weather service said.\n\nThe weather front is related to the polar vortex, a large cold air mass high up in the atmosphere that normally spins over the North Pole in winter. Sometimes it drifts down, funneling cold air across the country.\n\n\"Of course, this Arctic blast is related to the dreaded polar vortex,\" tweeted meteorologist Ryan Maue of BAM Weather, who also noted that \"24-hour temperature change is incredible with 40°-50°F drops behind the brutal front.\"\n\nWeather forecast for the South\n\nThe cold will dip deep into the South. Tuesday night into early Wednesday morning, temperatures are forecast to dip into the 20s in Pensacola. The record low of 30 for Nov. 13 was set in 1911.\n\n“The big story is how cold it’s going to be,” said Cody Lindsey, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. “And with the gusty winds during the day, it will definitely feel a little colder than it actually is.”\n\nThe high Tuesday in Dallas was forecast for 41 degrees – 27 degrees below average for the date. Tuesday's forecast high of 39 degrees in Brownsville, Texas, was more than double Monday's high temperature of 86 degrees.\n\nIs fall dead? Is this a blue norther? Questions answered about the Arctic blast\n\nEast Coast weather\n\nBy Wednesday, the coldest temperatures will drift east. Cities from Boston to Washington will challenge record lows for the date.\n\nSnow will add to the wintry feel across the interior Northeast on Tuesday and Wednesday. Rochester, New York, already had more than 8 inches of snow late Monday, smashing the day's record by 3 inches, according to the weather service.\n\n\"We expect a swath of higher snowfall totals from central New York to northern Maine, where accumulations could climb into the double digits,\" AccuWeather meteorologist Courtney Travis said.\n\nIn Chicago, Cristen Hamilton said she has no problem with the cold and snow. The California transplant said her 6-year-old daughter was thrilled.\n\n\"I think it’s fantastic to have snow and clear skies and cold weather compared to fire and smoke and blackouts,\" Hamilton said. \"It’s still kind of beautiful to see snow on trees that still have leaves and color.\"\n\nBacon reported from McLean, Va.

Over six episodes – each focused on catastrophes such as killer asteroids and earthquakes – the longtime TV scientist lays out the harsh realities of surviving mass disasters, while also offering urgent pleas for meaningful action on climate change.\n\n\"If you're old enough to deal with talking trees and flying monkeys (in 'Oz'), you can watch this show,\" says Nye, 66, who became a household name with his beloved educational program \"Bill Nye the Science Guy,\" which aired on PBS and in syndication in the mid-’90s. He later tackled science deniers in 2017's \"Bill Nye Saves the World\" on Netflix.\n\n'I was ticked off':Bill Nye talks viral TikTok, reflects on 'Science Guy' success\n\nNye first started developing \"End\" in December 2020 with executive producers Seth MacFarlane (\"The Orville) and Brannon Braga (the \"Star Trek\" franchise). The show was shot primarily on a soundstage in Montreal where – with the help of digital effects – he demonstrates what it might look like trying to dodge debris and escape floodwaters during a massive hurricane.\n\nComing off the last 2 ½ years, a series that viscerally depict apocalyptic events may not seem like anyone's idea of comfort viewing.\n\nBut Nye says you'd be surprised: \"When things are happy, we watch comedies. When things are anxiety-producing, we watch anxiety-producing entertainment. When there's a pandemic, let's rent 'Contagion!' It's some crazy thing about humans.\"\n\nThe show isn't all doom and gloom: Nye ends each episode by discussing scientific solutions to climate issues. He also encourages viewers to take individual action.\n\n\"Vote for lawmakers who want to address these problems. Take the environment and the future into account when you vote,\" Nye says. \"If you're not optimistic, you're not going to get anything done.\"\n\nThere's a 50-50 chance Earth will reach critical climate change mark within 5 years, report says\n\nMacFarlane believes Nye's mix of intelligence and positivity is what continues to endear him to viewers of all ages. \"In a world full of celebrity voices of all kinds pushing misinformation and superstition, the 'science star' is a rarity,\" he says via email. \"The Carl Sagans and the Neil DeGrasse Tysons are as precious as they are anomalous. We’re lucky to have Bill.\"\n\nNavigating onscreen calamities in \"End\" has forced Nye to consider how he'd handle them in real life. He says he most worries about the potential of a \"coronal mass ejection,\" in which highly charged particles from the sun could create a magnetic field that causes mass power blackouts on Earth. He also points to the recent flooding in Kentucky that killed at least 37 people and displaced hundreds more.\n\n\"These huge floods happen quickly, and people don't have the resources to go someplace else,\" Nye says.\n\nExperts warn California of a disaster 'larger than any in world history.' It's not an earthquake.\n\nThe mechanical engineer-turned-TV fixture tries to always stay prepared for extreme natural events.\n\n\"I have 45 gallons of water stored (in) different places,\" says Nye, who lives in California. \"If there's an earthquake, you may not be able to get to some parts of the house. It could be under debris. It's all very grim, but it's possible.\"\n\nHe also recommends keeping \"shoes near the bed because disaster can happen in the middle of the night, and the floor (could be) strewn with broken glass and planks with exposed nails.\"\n\nNye praises end-of-the-world movies such as 2004's \"The Day After Tomorrow\" and last year's star-studded \"Don't Look Up\" on Netflix for their realistic science portrayals. But he says that \"Up,\" about a pair of climate scientists warning of an impending meteor strike, is \"preaching to the choir. I wouldn't be surprised if the irony of 'Don't Look Up' is lost on the people it was really intended for because it is so painfully close to what's happening right now.\"\n\n'Don't Look Up':The five craziest moments, from President Streep to apocalyptic Ariana Grande\n\nIn addition to his science education with \"End,\" Nye speaks regularly on climate change panels and serves as CEO of The Planetary Society, a nonprofit group that promotes space exploration. Earlier this summer, he tied the knot with the \"very smart and funny\" Liza Mundy, a journalist and author. (\"Married three months and still happy as newlyweds,\" Nye says with a smile.)\n\nAnd he still can't escape the \"Bill Nye the Science Guy\" theme, which strangers chant at him \"at least once a day.\"\n\n\"I love the song, it's fabulous,\" Nye says. \"I saw the guy who wrote it, Mike Greene, in the grocery store a while ago and said 'Hey, man.' That was just great work.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/25"}]}

In addition to extending the existing payment pause, borrowers who make less than $125,000 a year are eligible for up to $20,000 in student loan forgiveness if they received Pell Grants, which are given to students from low- and middle-income families. Individuals who make less than $125,000 a year but did not receive Pell Grants are eligible for $10,000 in loan forgiveness. So, what steps do eligible borrowers need to take ? Nearly 8 million borrowers may be able to receive debt forgiveness automatically because the Department of Education already has their income information. For those who need to provide this data, the Biden administration said it will launch a new application in the coming weeks.\n\n2. Kobe Bryant\n\nA federal jury awarded $31 million in damages after finding the Los Angeles County Sheriff and Fire departments liable for infringing on the constitutional rights of Vanessa Bryant and co-plaintiff Christopher Chester, who each lost a spouse and daughter in the helicopter crash in January 2020 . Bryant was awarded $16 million in damages and Chris Chester was awarded $15 million. The lawsuit said LA County deputies and firefighters took photos of not just wreckage from the helicopter, but also the mangled bodies of those killed -- including NBA star Kobe Bryant, his daughter Gianna, Chester's wife Sarah, his daughter Payton and five others. Bryant and Chester testified they live in fear the photos may surface, despite LA County's assertion each picture had been destroyed.\n\nJUST WATCHED Kobe Bryant's widow leaves court in tears after moment in court Replay More Videos ...

Uvalde\n\nThe Uvalde school board voted unanimously Wednesday to immediately terminate the contract of district police chief Pete Arredondo , three months after a gunman killed 19 children and two teachers at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas. Arredondo has come under intense public scrutiny over the law enforcement response to the May 24 massacre , America's deadliest school shooting since 2012. During the attack, the shooter remained in two adjoined classrooms for more than an hour before officers entered the rooms and killed him, authorities say. The delay contradicted widely taught protocol for active shooter situations that calls for police to immediately stop the threat. State officials identified Arredondo as the on-scene police commander, though he has said he did not consider himself in charge.\n\nJUST WATCHED 'Turn in your badge': Child demands Chief Arredondo be fired Replay More Videos ...

Abortion\n\nA number of restrictive state abortion laws, including so-called trigger laws, are set to take effect this week , putting access to abortion further out of reach for millions of women as Republican-led states rush to limit the procedure following the Supreme Court's reversal of Roe v. Wade . Trigger laws in three states -- Idaho, Tennessee and Texas -- will take effect today, banning abortions in their respective states with few exceptions. On Friday, North Dakota's trigger law that bans abortions in most circumstances is set to take effect. And on Saturday, an Oklahoma law enacting higher criminal penalties for performing illegal abortions takes effect, adding to the state's already tough laws prohibiting the procedure. The laws will impact about 10 million women of reproductive age (15-49) across those five states.\n\nJUST WATCHED GOP governor: Red states need to expand support for families after banning abortion Replay More Videos ...

The season's third Grand Slam tournament ends less than two weeks prior to the opening ceremony of the Summer Games.\n\nNADAL:Says he won't play Wimbledon or Tokyo Olympics to 'prolong career'\n\nAs a native of Japan, Osaka became the face of the Tokyo Olympics when she was featured in one of the first promos last February, before the Games were rescheduled due to COVID-19.\n\nOsaka made headlines in late May when she withdrew from the French Open after her refusal to participate in scheduled pre-tournament media availability created a rift between her and tournament officials.\n\nPrior to her start in the tournament, Osaka announced that she would not participate in the mandatory press conferences due to “no regard for athletes mental health.” She won her first-round match against Romania’s Patricia Maria Tig, and despite speaking during a short on-court interview, she did not attend the postgame conference.\n\nOPINION:Osaka's shocking French Open withdrawal offers lessons for all\n\nOPINION:Osaka sparked a mental health conversation. Are we willing to have it?\n\nShe was fined $15,000 by the French Tennis Federation and risked additional fines and possible expulsion from the French Open if she missed more media opportunities. Osaka withdrew from the tournament altogether shortly after. On the Monday after her first-round win, she released a statement on social media explaining her reasoning for the withdraw.\n\n“I never wanted to be a distraction and I accept that my timing was not ideal and my message could have been clearer,” said Osaka. “More importantly I would never trivialize mental health or use that term lightly. The truth is that I have suffered long bouts of depression since the US Open in 2018 and I have had a really hard time coping with that.”\n\nOsaka further explained how required media availability impacts her social anxiety and creates additional stress for her during tournaments.\n\nOne week after her French Open announcement, tournament organizers for the bett1open in Berlin confirmed that Osaka would not compete. Her withdrawal from Berlin immediately raised questions about whether Osaka would participate at Wimbledon.\n\nOsaka, who is touted as one of the best tennis players of her generation, has won both the U.S. Open (2018, 2020) and Australian Open (2019, 2021) twice but has never done better than the third round at either the French Open or Wimbledon.

Osaka was active on Twitter discussing racial justice issues earlier this year following the murder of George Floyd.\n\n\"As a Black woman I feel as though there are much more important matters at hand that need immediate attention, rather than watching me play tennis,\" Osaka wrote on Wednesday night. \"I don't expect anything drastic to happen with me not playing, but if I can get a conversation started in a majority white sport I consider that a step in the right direction. Watching the continued genocide of Black people at the hand of the police is honestly making me sick to my stomach.\"\n\nLater Wednesday, in a joint statement issued by the ATP, WTA and USTA, it was announced that the tournament would be taking Thursday off entirely.\n\n\"As a sport, tennis is collectively taking a stance against racial inequality and social injustice that once again has been thrust to the forefront in the United States,\" the statement read.\n\n\"The USTA, ATP Tour, and WTA have decided to recognize this moment in time by pausing tournament play.\"\n\nThe statement said matches will resume Friday.

The men's main draw starts Thursday and continues through March 20. Djokovic remained in the BNP Paribas Open draw until Wednesday, when the tournament announced his withdrawal due to his inability to travel into the country.\n\nDjokovic, 34, then tweeted his own announcement, stating that he also will not play in Miami later this month.\n\n\"While I was automatically in the @BNPParibasOpen and @MiamiOpen draw, I knew it would be unlikely I'd be able to travel,\" Djokovic tweeted. \"The CDC has confirmed that regulations won't be changing, so I won't be able to play in the US. Good luck to those playing in these great tournaments.\"\n\nDjokovic's withdrawal, though late, was not surprising. He was not expected to play at Indian Wells prior to the official withdrawal, and the tournament hinted as much with a life-sized cutout of Djokovic hung on a wall at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden, along with other stars who have withdrawn. Next to the cutouts were the words, \"We miss you.\"\n\nAs the next player in line to be seeded, Grigor Dimitrov will move into Djokovic's spot in the draw, and a Lucky Loser from qualifying will move into Dimitrov’s space in the draw once qualifying is complete.\n\nThe absence of Djokovic at this year’s BNP Paribas Open will surely be disappointing for a tournament that also will not have Roger Federer. The two tennis icons have each won the tournament a record five times. Djokovic holds the record for most consecutive matches won (19) at Indian Wells, which he accomplished from 2014-17, and his 85% (50-9) win percentage is the highest in tournament history.\n\nIndian Wells and Miami are two of the largest tournaments in the world. A crowd of 475,372 attended the BNP Paribas Open over two weeks in 2019, before the pandemic canceled the 2020 event and played a role in a reduced attendance in 2021. The Miami Open drew 388,734 in 2019.\n\nRAFAEL NADAL:Grand Slam king off to best start to a season in his career\n\nGAME, SET, SHAD:Who will win the BNP Paribas Open men's singles title?\n\nMEN'S STORYLINES: Unbeatable Nadal and possible Canadian breakthrough\n\nIt’s fair to wonder how vaccine travel restrictions may affect the upcoming tournament schedule of the second-ranked player in the world, who until Feb. 28 had held the top ranking in men’s tennis, consecutively, for more than two years. He lost that distinction to Daniil Medvedev.\n\nThough the Tour does not require players to be vaccinated for COVID-19, the U.S. does not currently allow unvaccinated foreigners to fly into the country. The country has no such mandate for U.S. citizens, permanent residents or those traveling on an immigration visa.\n\nIn late February, Djokovic was asked by a reporter in Dubai if he had plans to play at Indian Wells, and Djokovic replied that he was waiting to see if the U.S. may change those travel restrictions, which would allow him to fly into the country.\n\n“As of today, … I can’t go — can’t enter United States,” Djokovic said. “As of today, I’m not able to play. But let’s see what happens. I mean, maybe things change in the next few weeks.”\n\nThings did not change. Djokovic's absence from the tournament that he’s won five times will now be extended at least another year. Djokovic has not played at Indian Wells since 2019, when he was upset by Philipp Kohlschreiber in the Round of 32.\n\nThe tournament was then canceled amid the pandemic in 2020 and rescheduled in 2021 for October. Djokovic, who had won three of the four Grand Slam singles titles before falling short of a Calendar Slam at the U.S. Open in September, did not travel to Indian Wells.\n\nDjokovic traveled to Melbourne in January to defend his Australian Open title. But after a public clash with the country’s health officials, he was eventually expelled from the country and flew home to Serbia.\n\nDjokovic played in Dubai last month, where he defeated Lorenzo Musetti and Karen Khachanov before falling to qualifier Jiri Vesely in the quarterfinals.\n\nAndrew John covers sports for The Desert Sun and the USA Today Network.

Sue Bird. Allyson Felix. Sylvia Fowles.\n\nSome of the greatest female athletes in the world have reached the end of their careers this year, and are now pivoting to build their legacies beyond sport. For some, that means improving the games they long dominated as part of their next chapter. For others, it means finding a way to use their hard-earned capital to elevate like-minded leaders.\n\nThis conversation was thrust into the spotlight when Williams, one of the best tennis players in history, announced in a Vogue magazine cover story that she would step away from the game after playing in this year's U.S. Open, which starts Aug. 29. Many have lauded the tennis star for leaving the game exactly as she played it for more than two decades — on her own terms.\n\n“I have never liked the word retirement. It doesn’t feel like a modern word to me,” Williams wrote in the piece. “Maybe the best word to describe what I’m up to is evolution. I’m here to tell you that I’m evolving away from tennis, toward other things that are important to me.”\n\nFor Williams, that means growing her family. It also means focusing on Serena Ventures — the company she founded to invest in others like her, as she explained in Vogue. She learned that only 2% of venture capital money went to women. “In order for us to change that, more people who look like me need to be in that position, giving money back to themselves,” she wrote.\n\nThis idea of giving back has become a pillar of women’s sports. Now, more than ever, some of the biggest names in sports are turning to improving the games they played.\n\nFelix has been doing it for years. Felix, the most decorated American track and field athlete in Olympic history, ran on a 100-meter track in downtown Los Angeles this week in what is being described as the last race of her professional career. The race concluded “The Allyson Felix Race for Change,” an event presented by Athleta to raise awareness about the importance of child care and equity for women.\n\nThat cause is personal for Felix. In 2019, she spoke out in a New York Times essay against her sponsor, Nike, when the company refused to pay her while on maternity leave. Her advocacy led Nike to announce a new maternity policy for all its sponsored athletes, and just this week the shoe giant said it’s launching a maternity training program.\n\nFelix has said she will now shift her focus to her footwear company, Saysh, and will use her involvement in the International Olympic Committee Athletes’ Commission to further raise awareness on child care and gender equity issues. In the past, she’s partnered with organizations to help fund child care costs for traveling athletes. In June, she worked to provide onsite child care to fellow athletes at the USA Track & Field Outdoor Championship in Eugene, Oregon.\n\n“The dream is for that to be the norm at all events,’’ she told USA TODAY Sports. “And obviously that’s going to take a lot of work to get that in place, but that’s where I want to see that going, and just finding ways to be thoughtful and supporting women in general.’’\n\nSometimes giving back means investing in the next generation. That’s what Fowles, a less talked about WNBA icon, has quietly done for years. The Minnesota Lynx star sponsors Team Fowles, an AAU team within the Miami Suns organization, and pays for scholarships for girls who can’t afford it. She’s even invited one player to play in WNBA pickup runs, as described in a recent Ringer profile.\n\nMeanwhile Bird, the WNBA star who also is in the final stretch of her legendary career with the Seattle Storm, was recently introduced as one of the newest investors in Gotham FC. In a statement released by the National Women's Soccer League club, Bird said: “There is a lot of talk about the power of investing in women’s sports. As an athlete in a position to invest, I’m excited to now lead by example.”\n\nBird is joining a Gotham FC ownership group that includes Carli Lloyd, another Team USA great. This past spring, after ending her playing career with Gotham, Lloyd was named a surprise minority investor in the club. It shouldn't have come as much of a shock, though. In her final USWNT game in October, she concluded her farewell to fans with an iconic mic drop. She told the crowd: “You will not see me on the field, but you best believe that I will be around helping this game grow.\"\n\nIn many ways, the sports world will look different next year. Tennis without Williams. Track and field without Felix. Basketball without Bird and Fowles. But there’s little doubt that some of the greatest to have ever played won't stray too far.\n\nWomen & Sport is a NorthJersey.com column devoted to female athletes from the rec league level to those in college and the pros.

One posting also says about the newborn, \"Grand Slam Titles: 1.\"\n\nWilliams won her 23rd Grand Slam singles championship at the Australian Open in January — while she was pregnant.\n\nShe has not competed anywhere since but has said she intends to return to competition by next year's Australian Open, which starts on Jan. 15, 4½ months after her baby was born.\n\n\"If she's ready, she'll play. If she's not, she won't play. I'm not a doctor. I can't decide when she's going to be ready to practice.

And I will do everything for her to be ready for Australia. But if she is not ready, of course she won't compete.\"\n\nThere is recent precedent for tennis players to return to action after giving birth.\n\nKim Clijsters, inducted this year into the International Tennis Hall of Fame, retired to start a family after having won one U.S. Open title, then came back to action in 2009 and won three more Grand Slam trophies.

After the match, a reporter asked Djokovic if he expects to play at Indian Wells in two weeks.\n\n“As of today, (no). I can’t go — can’t enter United States,” Djokovic was reported to have said. “As of today, I’m not able to play. But let’s see what happens. I mean, maybe things change in the next few weeks.”\n\nThough the World Tour does not require players to be vaccinated for COVID-19, Djokovic’s ability to fly into the U.S. as an unvaccinated foreigner has been in question in recent weeks. U.S. citizens, permanent residents and those traveling on an immigration visa are not required to be fully vaccinated to fly into the country, but foreign visitors are required to be fully vaccinated to do so.\n\nDjokovic has said that he will not receive the vaccination in order to play at large tournaments.\n\nBut as some countries ease COVID-19 rules and open travel to foreigners, Djokovic’s name remains on the entry list to the BNP Paribas Open that begins March 7. If he were to play, he would be a massive draw for the tournament that he’s won five times. Djokovic is tied with Roger Federer with the most singles titles won at Indian Wells.\n\nIf Djokovic were allowed into the U.S. to play at Indian Wells, it would also open the door for him to play at the Miami Open next month. The two tournaments are Masters 1000 events, and the two largest tennis tournaments in the country, after the U.S. Open.\n\nAfter Djokovic, 34, was unable to compete at the Australian Open last month, it’s been unclear which tournaments he’ll be able to play in this year. He is one of the few top-ranked players who are unvaccinated. As of mid-January, 97 of the top 100 men were vaccinated.\n\nDjokovic was initially allowed into Melbourne to defend his Australian Open title and in the hopes of securing a record 21st Grand Slam singles title. The tournament, which required players to be vaccinated to participate, had granted Djokovic a medical exemption.\n\nBut following a judge’s ruling on Jan. 15 that the country’s immigration minister was within his rights to revoke Djokovic’s visa, the Serbian tennis star was ordered to leave the country on the basis that he could pose a risk to public health and order.\n\nThe 20-time Grand Slam singles champion has held the No. 1 ranking since Aug. 24, 2020, and has now held the top ranking for 361 weeks, which is more than anyone in the history of men’s tennis.\n\nDjokovic has not played at Indian Wells since he was upset by Philipp Kohlschreiber in the Round of 32 in 2019.\n\nIf he were to play at Indian Wells, Djokovic would join fifth-ranked Rafael Nadal, who set a men’s record with his 21st Grand Slam title last month at the Australian Open, and the women’s top-ranked player, Ash Barty, as the headliners. The tournament will run until March 20 at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden.\n\nAndrew John covers sports for The Desert Sun and the USA Today Network.

But Stach says her landlord found an end-run to Wisconsin’s eviction ban: Instead of starting a court process, he sent her a notice to vacate this summer because he was not renewing her lease.\n\nThat type of informal or “extrajudicial” eviction is a work-around to the patchwork of emergency state and federal rules created this year to prevent landlords from ejecting tenants into unstable or crowded living arrangements during the health emergency.\n\nWhat once was a fringe concern has become a quiet scourge across the nation, said Eric Dunn, director of litigation at the National Housing Law Project, feeding housing instability concerns among the millions who have missed rent payments.\n\n“Since the pandemic started, and courts froze their dockets or had moratoriums, we’ve seen a huge spike in tactics from landlords to get people out,” Dunn said, “including changing locks, cutting off utility service, refusing to make repairs, making threats, providing misinformation and any other creative way to accuse someone of a lease violation that fits an exception in the moratorium.”\n\nTricks and intimidation behind the scenes add to more overt efforts by landlords to legally evict tenants. With statewide bans largely expired and federal protection from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention moratorium nearing its final days, tenant advocates like Dunn fear things will only get worse.\n\nUSA TODAY reviewed hundreds of complaints about landlords filed through the summer by consumers with attorneys general in seven states, including Maryland, Missouri, Ohio, Washington state and Wisconsin.\n\nLandlords, they told the state agencies, hiked rents even as the tenants lost their jobs and missed utility bill payments. They skipped out on basic maintenance and let conditions deteriorate, leaving renters a choice between leaving on their own or living with mold outbreaks or infestations of bed bugs, roaches and maggots.\n\nWhile the complaints offer a window into the problem, tenants often found their efforts to enlist state help went nowhere since wrongful evictions typically must be fought in court.\n\nFrom elderly residents on Social Security to single mothers struggling with unemployment, some reported that they were pushed into homelessness, where they could not take basic steps to protect themselves from the virus.\n\nThat threat was a driving force behind the moratoriums, and a group of epidemiologists found this month that the measures have helped stem COVID-19’s spread, particularly in poorer neighborhoods where court-ordered eviction is more prevalent.\n\nStach, the mother of a 15-year-old daughter with disabilities, came up short in April on her $850 rent. Her lease was up but she assumed she could renew it. Instead, she came home to the notice to vacate.\n\n“It was devastating. I was confused and crying and felt like I was having a panic attack,” Stach said. “I lost my job and now I had to basically beg someone to let us live somewhere else instead of a homeless shelter.”\n\nStach complained to Wisconsin's consumer protection agency, which intervened as a mediator, but did not manage to resolve the dispute. Eventually she located a new apartment, but it’s more expensive and in a different neighborhood of La Crosse, requiring her to transfer her daughter to another school district.\n\nFinding a place to live came with added challenges because Stach has a criminal record tied to past drug use. But, armed with a new job at a cheese manufacturer, she was able to get a lease – with an additional rider that says she will be evicted if she has a drug relapse.\n\n“In the middle of this, it’s a lot to pay for rent plus a new security deposit on such short notice while everyone is freaking out about the pandemic,” Stach said.\n\nHer previous landlord at Reliant Real Estate Services said he couldn’t discuss specific tenants but he said none had faced non-renewals or eviction proceedings since late spring. He added that those with looming lease expirations can negotiate move-out dates or month-to-month extensions.\n\n“Evictions and lease non-renewals are never a desired outcome,” Reliant President Aaron Wickesburg wrote in an email. “We will continue to do whatever we can to help keep our tenants in their homes.”\n\nEviction bans and moratoriums are full of holes\n\nEviction moratoriums under the federal CARES Act expired on July 25. Many state bans also ended over the summer, or in the fall. The remaining CDC order, enacted Sept. 4, has a simple goal: prevent evictions for non-payment of rent during the pandemic.\n\nBut the CDC’s rules are full of exemptions and tricky legal definitions, leaving openings for unscrupulous landlords.\n\nThe current CDC order, set to expire Dec. 31, specifies that evictions for non-payment of rent can be prevented if renters fill out a form declaring that they make less than $99,000, are trying to make partial payments and would likely be homeless if evicted. Rent still accrues and is due eventually.\n\nThe CDC order comes with criminal penalties, but neither the agency nor the U.S. Department of Justice answered questions on whether a single landlord has been prosecuted.\n\nThe order also offers five other reasons evictions can move forward: criminal activity, threats to other residents, damage to property, violation of building codes or violation of any other aspect of a lease.\n\nDunn said landlords can find subtle ways to use those exemptions to evict a non-paying renter, say when adding a satellite dish turns out to be a lease violation, or when a boyfriend stays over more nights than allowed in the guest portion of the lease. Non-renewals of leases that lead to eviction are a gray area in the CDC order.\n\n“If a landlord truly wants to evict someone, you know they can find a reason,” said Andrew Aurand, vice president for research at the National Low Income Housing Coalition.\n\nAurand and others have lobbied on Capitol Hill for a federal rent assistance program as part of a pandemic relief bill. Tenant groups favor such programs, which would cost as much as $100 billion, over extended eviction moratoriums.\n\n“The real concern is what happens in January if we don’t find a rental solution,” Aurand said, “and the 30 to 40 million people that again will be at risk for eviction.”\n\nSelf-help evictions date back centuries\n\nExtrajudicial or “self-help” evictions – in which landlords take matters into their own hands – date back to Roman law. They were part of English common law and then barred by U.S. courts to quell violence. Today, they refer to any method outside the legal court eviction process.\n\nWhile self-help removals are by their nature impossible to measure, the usual number of court evictions offers a hint of the tsunami some advocates fear could be coming, obscured by the various COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nThe National Housing Law Project estimates about 900,000 legal judicial evictions take place in the U.S. each year. Research by the Eviction Lab at Princeton University indicates that, on average across 26 tracked cities, eviction filings have dropped by more than half during the pandemic, but now are steadily increasing.\n\nTenants facing an extrajudicial situation have few options, especially if all of their belongings are locked away by a landlord or they can’t afford legal representation.\n\nWith the help of free legal aid representation, Lena Jefferson of Washington, D.C., took her complaint to court in the fall, filing a wrongful eviction claim against her landlord.\n\nShe says her landlord moved her to temporary housing after her apartment flooded, but problems there led her to withhold rent until a better solution was found. Instead, her landlord locked her out.\n\n“I’ve been living in a rooming house,” Jefferson said. “It’s another stress that’s constantly on your mind when you’re moving from place to place.”\n\nIn West Palm Beach, Florida, Legal Aid Society attorney Tequisha Myles said her program quadrupled its staffing for eviction prevention work after the pandemic began. Her program represents one couple that was evicted but is now countersuing because the landlord locked them out of a rental house without going through a formal court process.\n\n“The laws are very clear even before the pandemic: Turning off electricity or water or blocking access to the property is prohibited,” Myles said. “I understand that many landlords are struggling and they haven’t been paid, but you have to follow the law.”\n\nAttorney: Everyone is 'getting screwed'\n\nAttorneys in Massachusetts challenged Gov. Charlie Baker’s blanket moratorium on evictions this summer, arguing it was overly broad and unconstitutional, said real estate attorney Richard Vetstein.\n\n“The state ban was the strictest by far,” Vetstein said. “Unlike the CDC moratorium, it applied to every eviction case, including lease expirations, most behavioral issues, for-cause evictions and squatting.”\n\nThe case’s named landlord, Marie Baptiste, had a tenant who owed $18,900 for eight months of unpaid rent and was struggling to maintain her finances.\n\n“Everyone’s getting screwed,” Vetstein said, adding that the moratoriums don’t solve cash flow shortages. He called for rental assistance to help tenants.\n\nVetstein said he’s warned clients to avoid self-help actions no matter how frustrated they become. He said some have turned to “cash for keys” programs where landlords pay non-paying tenants to leave.\n\nResearchers at the Urban Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, surveyed nearly 1,400 landlords in October. They reported that 38% said they did not expect to receive full rent payments that month. More than a third also said they had added stricter screening for new tenants, such as requiring higher credit scores and higher income.\n\nLandlord groups have challenged the CDC order’s constitutionality in federal courts in Atlanta, Memphis, and Columbus and Akron, Ohio. So far, federal judges have declined to knock down the order.\n\nNational housing groups have been disappointed in a Department of Justice legal brief in the Atlanta case that seemed to encourage landlords to pursue evictions now in anticipation of the moratorium lifting.\n\n“Even where a tenant is entitled to its protections, the Order does not bar a landlord from commencing a state court eviction proceeding, provided that that actual eviction does not occur while the order remains in place,” DOJ lawyers wrote, in language that ended up in a CDC “frequently asked questions” document.\n\nThat’s what’s happening in Maryland, where despite a ban on actual evictions, the apartment company owned by White House adviser Jared Kushner has been sending letters to tenants “threatening legal fees and then filing eviction notices in court – a first legal step toward removing tenants,” according to the Washington Post.\n\nColleen Foley, head of the Legal Aid Society of Milwaukee, says the county already has a backlog of cases filed by landlords just waiting to boot renters as soon as judges allow it.\n\nHowever, she said local landlord groups are unified with the legal aid community in calling for government rental assistance.\n\n“It’s a rare moment, for sure,” Foley said. “Everyone understands we all rise and fall together.”\n\nMissouri family 'camps' after threats\n\nUSA TODAY’s review of complaints filed with various state attorneys general shows landlords across the country attempted to raise rents on financially struggling tenants, and then turned to extreme measures to evict them when they could not pay.\n\nOne Missouri renter said she was forced to leave her apartment during the pandemic after the landlord raised rent $35 a month and the monthly dog fee by $5.\n\nOthers in the state complained of even steeper hikes, despite job losses and other financial hardships.\n\n“During a pandemic like we’ve never seen before, they’re acting like everything was normal,” said Debbie Carter, who filed a complaint in March after her landlord raised her rent and would not let her go month-to-month on her lease.\n\nIn the deep woods near the Ozarks, residents of a shuttered nine-hole golf resort that was converted into apartments say their landlord tripled rents, threatened them with eviction and had them work under the table to repair the derelict units to pay off their debts.\n\nThe former timeshare property had been neglected for years, with mold growing on stairs, ceilings and curtains. Residents complained to the state about holes in the walls and floor, where roaches, ants and bed bugs scurried.\n\nLaura Loyd had been living in a two-bedroom unit there for two years when it changed ownership at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, in February. Out of work, she was struggling to make the $575-a-month rent, and asked if she could split it into two installments.\n\nHer landlord instead emailed her a notice to vacate, saying that he had nearly tripled the rent on the 850-square-foot apartment to $1,500 per month, and she had to either pay that amount right away or get out, according to a complaint she filed with the Missouri Attorney General's Office.\n\nDuplexes dot the property known as LaGrand Lodges, which lines a river and forest, with weeds growing in an old tennis court, an emptied out swimming pool and long-closed restaurant. When it’s cold, utility bills rise to hundreds of dollars per month because of the poor insulation, Loyd said.\n\nShe told USA TODAY that she received two more eviction notices. The landlord never formally took her to court but, tired of his scare tactics, she opted to leave.\n\n“It got so bad,” said Loyd, who has since moved to Arkansas. “We couldn’t be there anymore.”\n\nLoyd wasn’t the only tenant of LaGrand Lodges who complained to the attorney general. When neighbor Tasha Tavenner couldn’t pay rent, two men attempted to pull the front door right off its hinges until Tavenner called the police, according to her handwritten complaint.\n\nThe single mother of four had been laid off from her job at a resort in nearby Branson when tourism froze up from coronavirus.\n\nWith no money coming in amid the threats of rent increases, she tried to work out a deal where she would help fix the deteriorating units, including ripping out carpets and tearing down walls.\n\nAt least four other tenants who couldn’t afford to pay also were working as handymen off the books to pay down rent debts, Tavenner said.\n\nIn April, she asked for three additional weeks to come up with rent money. White and green mold had gotten so bad that Tavenner said she moved everything but the family’s beds into storage, even keeping their clothes in the car. At one point, she remembers maggots crawling around on the carpet.\n\nShe complained in April to the state Attorney General’s Office, which told her that there was nothing that they could do. The agency did not return several calls and emails from USA TODAY seeking comment.\n\nWith kids ages 2, 8, 12 and 15, Tavenner decided that she couldn’t take it anymore. They left in early May, she said, and ended up camping together in the woods for five weeks until they could find a new place to stay.\n\n“I wasn’t even two months late on my rent,” Tavenner said. “They started harassing me on a daily basis. It was scary. It got really ugly.”\n\nTony LaGrand, who was the landlord at the time but no longer owns the property, planned to renovate the former timeshare and turn it back into nightly rentals. He had just turned 24 when he purchased the units in February. It was his first time as a landlord, he said.\n\nHe went months without any rent from tenants, he said, even though he says many were collecting unemployment checks. LaGrand did not deny attempting to raise rents or file evictions, but he said he did not break any rules and tried first to ask the tenants who could not pay to leave on their own.\n\nLaGrand, who lost the property to foreclosure, says he’s now more than $1.6 million in debt.\n\n“The place was falling apart,” LaGrand said. “I didn’t have any rent coming in, and people wouldn’t pay. It was a really messed up situation. I spent my entire life savings on this project.”\n\nA cigarette leads to eviction in Ohio\n\nAcross the country, landlords evicted their tenants over unapproved guests, pets and other alleged violations to various apartment rules. One blind man in Ohio lived on the streets following a dispute with his landlords over smoking cigarettes inside the unit.\n\nYet most consumers who spoke with USA TODAY said that their attorneys general were ultimately unable to help. State regulators can act as mediators in disputes, but challenges to evictions are often only successful in court.\n\nIn Ohio, David Whipple complained to the attorney general after the Wellness Village affordable housing complex for seniors in Canton sent him a notice of eviction in February, a month before the national moratorium began.\n\nThe facility claimed to have found ashes from cigarettes in the bathroom, and workers said they could smell smoke near the unit. It accused Whipple of violating its rules. Whipple's complaint also alleges he was charged late fees for rent for several months even though he paid his $651 rent on time.\n\nWhen reached by USA TODAY, Whipple acknowledged he had smoked a cigarette because he was nervous about an upcoming eye surgery. But the 64-year-old, who is blind, said staff at the senior living complex continued to accuse him of breaking the rules.\n\nFollowing the notice of eviction in February, the virus put the process on hold for several months. When the CARES Act relief bill was signed in March, it included an eviction moratorium for 120 days on public housing, housing choice vouchers and FHA-insured multifamily properties.\n\nBut by the time that moratorium expired in July, Whipple was in court, where the judge ruled against him. By August, he was out.\n\n“They kicked out a senior citizen during COVID-19 like they didn’t have a care in the world,” Whipple said. “I didn’t deserve what they did to me.”\n\nA representative, who answered the phone at Wellness Village and identified herself as a manager but declined to give her name, said the property followed the necessary guidance from the court system.\n\n“We had to wait until we had permission from the courts, and when we did, we moved forward,” the property manager said. She declined further comment.\n\nWhipple’s complaint was among nearly 200 filed with the attorney general in Ohio related to issues with landlords and COVID-19. Whipple said he ultimately got no help from the agency.\n\nWhen Kansas Fecher of western Ohio could not pay her April rent after being laid off due to the virus, she told the landlord that as soon as her unemployment check came in, she could get caught up. The landlord instead gave her four days to get out, according to the complaint.\n\nAnother Ohio renter complained that the property owner illegally changed the locks on her and other tenants residing in the home, while removing the city trash container so waste piled up.\n\nAt a mobile home park in Lancaster, residents said the landlord threatened to evict them for rule violations, including failing to take the hitches off their trailers. Most of the tenants are too old to take the hitches off their own trailers, and the manager of the park knows this, the complaint states.\n\nIn Ohio, the attorney general’s consumer protection division does not have jurisdiction over landlord and tenant complaints. The office says it tries to work with people as a courtesy, but renters who complained say they received little help to ward off aggressive landlords.\n\nWith no family to turn to, Whipple said he was forced into homelessness. He’s shuffled among five houses of friends and other people trying to help him.\n\n“I’m just in a bad situation,” he said. “I don’t know what to do.”\n\nNick Penzenstadler and Josh Salman are reporters on the USA TODAY investigations team.

Wilson High School Principal Gary Horton told WAFF-TV the removal of some of the stall doors in the boys’ restroom comes two weeks after a student vaping in the bathroom passed out. He says students sneak off to vape every day in the bathroom. Parent Rachel Munsey says she doesn’t agree with the tactic, saying the school took away the “only private place … they can do their business.” Parent Brandon Campbell says the school should instead use hallway monitors. Horton says the door removals could be temporary while the school figures out another solution.\n\nAlaska\n\nNome: Alaska Native women say the Nome Police Department has a history of failing to conduct full investigations on rape complaints. Nome police data show that from 2008 through 2017, just 8% of calls about sexual assaults against adults resulted in an arrest. Nome’s prosecutor says limited resources make it hard for police to respond to calls of all kinds. Survivors and advocates contend that Nome police pay less attention and investigate less when sexual assaults are reported by Alaska Natives. More than half of Nome’s population is Alaska Native, but all of its police department’s sworn officers are non-Native. This year the City Council approved the hiring of the police department’s first victims advocate and passed an ordinance to create a civilian oversight committee to monitor police conduct.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: The cost of a gem and mineral museum under construction – set to be among the largest in the world – has grown by $3.25 million, and officials say they would, in a worst-case scenario, sell part of their collection to cover expenses. The University of Arizona’s Gem and Mineral Museum will be housed in part of the historic Pima County Courthouse. The university asked the Arizona Board of Regents to approve spending for the increased costs, which officials attributed to rising labor and material expenses. The regents voted to accept the changes Aug. 22. With the increase, the cost of the project has grown to $12.9 million, and so far the museum has raised $4 million, says Robert Downs, curator of the Gem and Mineral Museum, who anticipates the museum will receive enough in donations to cover the full cost and avoid the last resort of selling gems and minerals.\n\nArkansas\n\nCamden: Lockheed Martin has broken ground on the first part of a $142 million expansion at its southern Arkansas facility that is expected to create more than 300 new jobs. Company executives and state officials broke ground Tuesday on the new Long Range Fires Production Facility at the site in Camden. Lockheed Martin and Gov. Asa Hutchinson in June announced the expansion of its facility, which will add 326 new jobs by 2024. Approximately 650 employees currently work at the Lockheed facility. Construction for the 70,000-square-foot Long Range Fires facility is slated to be completed in the beginning of 2021.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Athletes at colleges in the state could hire agents and sign endorsement deals under a bill the Legislature sent to the governor Wednesday, setting up a potential confrontation with the NCAA that could jeopardize the athletic futures of powerhouse programs like USC, UCLA and Stanford. Gov. Gavin Newsom has not said whether he will sign it. But the NCAA Board of Governors is already urging him not to, sending him a letter Wednesday saying the bill “would erase the critical distinction between college and professional athletics” and have drastic consequences for California’s colleges and universities. The bill would allow student-athletes to hire agents and be paid for the use of their names, images or likenesses. It would stop California universities and the NCAA from banning athletes that take the money.\n\nColorado\n\nTrinidad: Gov. Jared Polis says Fisher’s Peak and the former ranch land surrounding it will become Colorado’s newest state park. Polis’ office said in a statement that the Nature Conservancy and The Trust for Public Land plan to transfer the 30-square-mile property near Trinidad to public ownership, with the goal of opening access by 2021. Polis signed an executive order during a ceremony Thursday. Trinidad Mayor Phil Rico tells the Gazette that access to the 9,633-foot Fisher’s Peak has long been a dream among residents. The Trust for Public Land and the Nature Conservancy last year pledged the $25 million needed to buy the former Crazy French Ranch after the state put down an initial $14.5 million. It will be Colorado’s 42nd state park.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: State health officials are urging residents to minimize outdoor activities in the evening to avoid mosquitoes carrying eastern equine encephalitis. The Department of Public Health issued the guidance Wednesday. The virus has been identified in mosquitoes in 12 eastern Connecticut towns and in horses in two other towns. In one town, Groton, school outdoor activities have been restricted because of concern about the virus. Mosquitoes are most active from dusk to dawn. State health officials say the mosquitoes that carry the virus are active until the first heavy frost.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The deadline is nigh for anyone hankering to be the state’s chief justice. Applications from candidates seeking to replace retiring Chief Justice Leo Strine Jr. are due by noon Friday. Delaware’s Judicial Nominating Commission will then interview the applicants, who will be considered simultaneously for a potential derivative vacancy on the Supreme Court if one of the sitting justices is nominated to be chief justice. Strine announced his planned resignation in July, less than halfway through his 12-year term. He plans to step down Oct. 30. The state Senate must confirm judicial appointees and has scheduled a special session for Nov. 7. Before becoming chief justice, Strine served as legal counsel to then-Gov. Tom Carper and spent more than 15 years as a judge on Delaware’s Chancery Court.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The nation’s capital has hit or surpassed the 90-degree temperature mark a total of 54 days so far this year through Wednesday, WUSA-TV reports. On average, D.C. sees 36 days of 90-plus temperatures for the entire year. Last year, the city recorded 42. The record is 67 days above 90, hit in both 2010 and 1980. This past July was the ninth warmest on record in the district, tied with 1955. All the temperatures were taken by the National Weather Service at Reagan National Airport.\n\nFlorida\n\nJacksonville: A 7-year-old boy made national headlines when he emptied his savings to help feed Hurricane Dorian evacuees. Now Mickey is paying it forward. Jermaine Bell saved for a year to visit Disney’s Animal Kingdom, but when he saw the terrifying storm, he decided to use his trip money to buy hundreds of hot dogs, chips and bottled water for evacuees. He had been visiting his grandmother in South Carolina at the time. He waved a sign by the road and passed out refreshments to drivers fleeing the city. On Sunday, he found Mickey Mouse and several characters on his Jacksonville doorstep, holding balloons. They gave him a “Lion King”-themed cake to celebrate his 7th birthday and a VIP getaway for later this month.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Another former building of historic Morris Brown College has burned. Atlanta Fire Rescue says it responded Wednesday night to the fire west of downtown. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports the fire engulfed Furber Cottage, a onetime Morris Brown dormitory built in 1899. The college sold Furber and much of its remaining property in 2014 while in bankruptcy. Firefighters say the structure was too unstable to enter. No injuries were reported, and the cause is unknown. Furber, along with three other buildings once part of Morris Brown, was listed in 2016 as among Georgia’s most endangered historic sites. Gaines Hall, another one of the four buildings listed, was damaged by fire in 2015. Morris Brown lost its accreditation in 2002. The school remains open and is trying to regain accreditation.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state’s supply of doctors is the lowest since 2015 as older physicians retire and younger practitioners move elsewhere for higher pay. News organizations report workforce data shows there are now 2,819 active physicians in Hawaii, a decrease of 108 full-time doctors over the past year. A survey by the University of Hawaii Burns School of Medicine indicates the state needs at least 3,481 doctors to care for the aging population. The school’s Hawaii/Pacific Basin Area Health Education Center says a quarter of the state’s doctors are 65 and older. Center Executive Director Kelley Withy says physicians are finding opening their own offices too expensive. Withy says a new fixed payment transformation system that reduces the money earned per patient also makes the business “challenging” for doctors.\n\nIdaho\n\nCaldwell: Seven jail inmates have filed tort claims against Canyon County because they say deputies gave them used razors to shave. The Idaho Press reports that the inmates say a deputy pulled the used razors from a biohazard waste box before handing them out to inmates to use and that all seven of the inmates tested positive for hepatitis C following the incident. The virus attacks the liver, and it is easily spread through contact with contaminated blood. The inmates say they suffered damages in an amount likely to exceed $500,000. Canyon County has until the end of November to decide whether to respond to the tort claims. If the inmates are unhappy with the response at that point, they will be able to file lawsuits against the county.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The fate of one of the oldest Greek Orthodox churches in the nation has become clear. The sale of Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church for $2.5 million to Universal Life Church was approved Tuesday by a U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge. The congregation of Holy Trinity will now have 75 days to vacate the building. The Chicago church’s future hung in the balance after financial woes put it on the verge of closing for good. Church officials said a bank rejected a loan request after the church was unable to secure $1.6 million in needed pledges. Holy Trinity avoided foreclosure late last year after an anonymous donation. But an issue with the money arose, forcing the church to go up for sale again. Officials say Holy Trinity is the second-oldest Greek Orthodox church in the United States.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The History Channel has dropped out of a planned documentary on John Dillinger that would have included the proposed exhumation of the 1930s gangster’s Indianapolis gravesite. A&E Networks spokesman Dan Silberman says The History Channel is no longer involved in the Dillinger documentary. Silberman says network officials won’t comment on the reasons for the withdrawal. The planned exhumation of Dillinger’s grave has become the subject of a lawsuit. Crown Hill Cemetery officials objected to the exhumation, prompting Dillinger’s nephew, Michael C. Thompson, to sue the cemetery. Thompson is one of two Dillinger relatives who obtained a state permit to exhume the gravesite, saying they have evidence Dillinger’s body may not be buried there. An Oct. 1 hearing is scheduled in the exhumation lawsuit.\n\nIowa\n\nBondurant: A small school district won’t be getting nearly $900,000 it wanted to spend as part of this year’s budget because officials have learned the budget revenue was in part based on an erroneous tax valuation from the county assessor’s office. The Polk County assessor’s office had included in the tax base figures for the Bondurant-Farrar school district a fourth building at Facebook’s giant data center in Altoona. But the $52.4 million building was exempted from taxation for 20 years as part of a development agreement the social media giant signed with the city and the Iowa Economic Development Authority. Exemptions also were granted for the center’s first three buildings. Facebook spokeswoman Melanie Roe says the company learned about the error just a few days ago.\n\nKansas\n\nOverland Park: The Kansas and Missouri affiliates of the American Civil Liberties Union say they have reached a settlement with the Federal Bureau of Prisons that allows an inmate to receive a drug used to treat his opioid addiction. The ACLU said in a news release Wednesday that the settlement allows the federal prison in Leavenworth to give inmate Leaman Crews a drug used to keep life-threatening withdrawal symptoms at bay. A federal lawsuit filed on his behalf last week sought to compel prison officials to treat his addiction with buprenorphine. Kansas ACLU Executive Director Nadine Johnson says Crews was their primary concern, but the narrow agreement focusing only on him isn’t sufficient. She says they look forward to seeing a prison policy that respects what doctors are recommending in these cases.\n\nKentucky\n\nRichmond: Fort Boonesborough State Park is hosting its annual 1778 Siege of Boonesborough weekend this month. Events at the Madison County park will include a battle reenactment on the afternoons of Sept. 28 and 29 and a night battle at dusk on Sept. 28. The event commemorates the 1778 attack on the fort by Native Americans and French Canadians during the Revolutionary War. The settlers in the fort refused to surrender, and the attackers gave up and left. There will be militia and settlers’ camps, a Native American village, merchants, traders, pioneer skills demonstrations and food. This event is free with regular fort admission of $8 for adults and $5 for children.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Officials have voted to require new commercial parking surfaces to use porous pavement in this city where flooded streets are a common sight. The Times Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reports the City Council last week unanimously ruled in favor of the pavement ordinance, which allows rainwater to flow into the soil below. Council members say the pavement won’t solve the city’s problem with flooded streets, but it will lighten the burden placed on the city’s drainage system during heavy rain. The pavement can clog if not washed regularly, so the city recently outfitted some work trucks with power-washing attachments. The ordinance comes more than a year after the city’s code was amended to require that some developments keep the first 1.25 inches of storm rainfall out of the city’s drainage system.\n\nMaine\n\nBar Harbor: Acadia National Park officials say they have some leeway in regulating so-called e-bikes following an Interior Department directive to treat them the same as regular bicycles. Superintendent Kevin Schneider tells the Bangor Daily News the park has the authority to ban or restrict e-bikes to protect users and natural resources or to balance other objectives. Thus, it remains to be seen whether bikes with electric motors will be restricted on the park’s popular carriage roads. David MacDonald, president of Friends of Acadia, says the Rockefeller family that donated the roads specified that there be no motorized vehicles. But Matt Horton, a member of Acadia’s advisory commission, says the Rockefellers were opposed to combustion engines. He said those are much different from e-bikes. The park has 30 days to propose rules.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: An attorney representing Maryland’s four historically black colleges is urging the state to settle a long-running lawsuit over disparities in programs for $577 million “over a reasonable period of time.” Michael Jones wrote Tuesday to lawmakers, after mediation failed in July. Jones notes that Mississippi settled its HBCU case nearly 20 years ago for about $517 million. Jones says that is about $791 million in today’s dollars. Jones says if Mississippi could afford that, “surely Maryland can afford a lesser amount to remedy its constitutional violation.” The colleges say the state underfunded them while developing programs at traditionally white schools. A federal judge ruled in favor of the HBCUs in 2013, saying the state unnecessarily duplicated programs. The state proposed a settlement last year of $100 million over 10 years.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nScituate: Experts say another minke whale has been found dead in state waters. The New England Aquarium says the 22-foot, sub-adult whale was found dead rolling in the surf off Scituate on Monday. The aquarium’s Marine Animal Rescue Team responded and determined the whale had likely died within the past couple of days, but because it had been significantly scavenged by sharks, a full necropsy could not be completed. The carcass showed had no evidence of marine gear interference or evidence of any other human interaction. Over Labor Day weekend, another dead minke whale washed up in Duxbury. In 2017 and 2018, a greater than normal number of minke whales died along the U.S. East Coast. In response, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration declared an unusual mortality event for the species.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Mercedes-Benz USA is asking a judge to protect it from legal action over its use of images of outdoor murals in Motor City in social media posts. The company says four artists threatened to file a lawsuit after their works appeared last year in Instagram posts about the G 500 Series truck. Mercedes-Benz removed the posts, although it insists it didn’t infringe on copyrights and was entitled to fair use of the murals. The company accused the artists of engaging in an “aggressive shakedown.” James Lewis says Mercedes-Benz “defamed” his mural by posting it slightly out of focus. He says it’s a “sacred piece” honoring African women. Detroit federal Judge Avern Cohn on Wednesday rejected a request by the artists to dismiss three lawsuits by Mercedes-Benz.\n\nMinnesota\n\nBemidji: A summer of heavy rains has caused a rise in cases of a rare fungal infection in northern Minnesota. So far this year, more than 45 people and 150 animals have been diagnosed with blastomycosis. Last year, only 31 human cases and fewer than 100 animal infections were reported by this time. An epidemiologist with the Minnesota Department of Health, Malia Ireland, tells Minnesota Public Radio News the infections are caused by fungi living in the ground. Ireland says flooding has moved land around, exposing spores to the air. The fungus thrives in moist ground, especially in wooded areas near rivers and lakes. Most of the cases were reported in northern Minnesota. Most of the animal cases are dogs, which dig their noses in the dirt.\n\nMississippi\n\nTylertown: Some students say they won’t be returning to class while they protest the removal of their prayer group from school hours to after school. News outlets report students at Tylertown High School walked out of class Wednesday and won’t return until their faith-based program, First Priority, is reinstated to its normal time, during school hours. Student Tyasia Shackleford says First Priority has existed for 15 years and meets once a month to praise God. Student Kaitlynn Brown says students “want to celebrate God,” and the school took that away. It’s unclear why the program was removed from school hours. Walthall County School superintendent Wade Carney says all student-led organizations cannot meet during instruction time. He says they can meet before or after school.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: A Catholic priest says “fornication,” not pregnancy, was the problem in the case of a teacher who alleges she was fired from a Catholic school because she was pregnant and unmarried. The Kansas City Star reports the Rev. Joseph Cisetti testified Wednesday that he “praised” the decision of former St. Therese School teacher Michelle Bolen not to have an abortion but told her she violated her contract. Cisetti said that “sexual relations must take place exclusively in marriage.” He said he favored offering Bolen a contract, while the school’s then-principal didn’t. He said he was concerned about dismissing her because it might create an environment that would be conducive to abortion. Bolen said administrators concocted non-pregnancy-related reasons to justify not renewing her contract in July 2015.\n\nMontana\n\nKalispell: Wildlife officials say feral hogs from Canada encroaching on the state’s northern border are a serious concern for farmers and others. Daily Inter Lake reports the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Wildlife Services division says there have been multiple reports of feral hogs near the border. An official says eight mature pigs were discovered in Canada directly above Montana’s Lincoln County this summer. Wildlife Services, the Montana Invasive Species Council, the National Feral Swine Program, and the Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks department say the pigs could do widespread damage. Officials say the pigs are “rototillers” that root for food and wallow in farms, fields and forests, leaving terrain unrecognizable. The pigs may also spread diseases affecting livestock and other animals.\n\nNebraska\n\nKearney: City leaders are backing a proposal to restore an open-air theater in Harmon Park. The City Council heard about the plan for the Sonotorium at Tuesday’s meeting. The Kearney Hub reports Councilman Randy Buschkoetter said it says a lot about the community that members wish to preserve the landmark built in 1938. A group led by Kearney High School band director Nathan LeFeber plans to raise $683,000 to construct a roof over the stage and upgrade the structure’s lighting and sound system and backstage rooms. The city has committed $5,000 to cover the costs of structural tests and conceptual plans.\n\nNevada\n\nWadsworth: Federal officials are making fish-friendly modifications to a northern Nevada dam that for more than a century has blocked off spawning grounds for a threatened trout species that once migrated 120 miles upstream to the alpine waters of Lake Tahoe. Officials for the Bureau of Reclamation, Fish and Wildlife Service and Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe broke ground Tuesday for a $23.5 million fish-passage project to help Lahontan cutthroat trout navigate the Truckee River’s Derby Dam about 20 miles east of Reno. It’s expected to be completed next year. Fish screens in a bypass canal longer than a football field will allow the trout – once believed to have gone extinct – to get past the high-desert dam for the first time since it was built in 1905 to divert water to farmers and ranchers.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHanover: Dartmouth College has become the latest university to allow students to easily change their name or gender identity in directories, on identification cards and elsewhere across the Ivy League campus. Transgender and nonbinary students have been able to request IDs and directory listings that reflect their preferred names for more than a decade, but the new policy announced Wednesday allows them to log on to the college’s information system and make changes on their own. Chosen names also will be allowed to appear on transcripts and diplomas. Campus Pride, a nonprofit organization that promotes LGBTQ-friendly learning environments, tracks such policies. It says most of the other seven Ivy League schools also provide students with a simple process to change their names or gender identities on university documents.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: Gamblers wagered more than $293 million on sports in the state in August, helping Atlantic City’s casinos win 13% more than they did a year ago. Figures released Thursday by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement show the nine casinos won nearly $339 million for the month, assisted by sports betting money. The Borgata won nearly $80 million and had the best month at slot machines since it opened in 2003. The two newest casinos also fared well in August. Hard Rock retained the No. 2 spot in the market with nearly $41 million, up nearly 31% from a year ago. And the Ocean casino had the best month in its short history, with more than $25 million, up more than 25% from a year ago.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nGallup: A western New Mexico high school is becoming a tiny house factory to build affordable housing in a city near the Navajo Nation. The Gallup Independent reports that Hiroshi Miyamura High School in Gallup will begin a program to teach students about building tiny homes and the business behind them. Principal Jack McFarland says the program will provide real results and hands-on learning for students. He says the goal is to build about two tiny houses a year. The houses will be sold at auction at the end of the year to help recoup the costs of the project and help plan for the following school year.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: A state law that went into effect Thursday lengthens the waiting period on certain gun purchases from three days to 30 days. Gov. Andrew Cuomo approved the measure in July and issued a statement Thursday saying the change will save lives. He also called on the federal government to pass universal background checks. The Democrat said New York has taken action “while the federal government turns a blind eye to the scourge of gun violence ripping our nation apart and continues to allow this bloodshed to take parents and children away from their families.” The law applies in cases where a federal background check returns an inconclusive response on a potential firearm purchaser. Extending the state waiting period will give federal authorities more time for the background checks.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nFayetteville: The mayor wants the public’s input on a proposed Civil War history center. The Fayetteville Observer reports Mayor Mitch Colvin is calling for a special City Council meeting to gauge support. He says the $7.5 million the city would have to invest in the project could be put to better use than the proposed North Carolina Civil War & Reconstruction History Center. Colvin, who is black, says he no longer backs the project, and he says a growing number of the city’s black residents are expressing concerns about it. Troy Williams, a criminal defense investigator and radio co-host, supports the center and accuses the mayor of stirring up opposition. Williams, who also is black, says the center will tell the truth about the war.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The Department of Agriculture has confirmed the presence of a Palmer amaranth plant in a seventh county in the state. The agency said Wednesday that it found the plant in Emmons County, in the south of the state, just weeks after finding it in nearby Grant County. The Bismarck Tribune reports Palmer amaranth can grow up to 7 feet and resist herbicides. Purdue University research shows the plant’s heavy infestation can cut soybean yields by as much as 79% and corn yields by up to 91%. Brian Jenks, a North Dakota State University weed scientist, says this summer’s weed discoveries were in fields with millet. Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring says producers should monitor millet plantings for Palmer amaranth to avoid infestation.\n\nOhio\n\nToledo: The school district is apologizing for posting photos that showed students with fake blood stains during an active shooter drill. Officials with the Toledo Public Schools say the photos have been removed from a Facebook post that prompted complaints. The Blade newspaper reports the photos showed high school students looking lifeless and others with red marks resembling blood on their clothes and bodies. Some people commented that they found the photos disturbing. A school spokeswoman said the district takes safety very seriously and apologized if anyone found the post inappropriate.\n\nOklahoma\n\nLawton: Officials say a house explosion that left one man dead and was initially investigated as a homicide is now considered an accident. The state Fire Marshal’s Office says the Aug. 24 blast killed chiropractor Anthony Ferrara of Cache, who operated a chiropractic clinic in Lawton and owned the vacant home about 78 miles southwest of Oklahoma City. Comanche County Sheriff Kenny Stradley told the Lawton Constitution that although there was no electricity, natural gas or propane connected to the house, a “combustion fluid” was inside the home and ignited. Stradley says there is no indication a fire was intentionally started, and investigators are waiting for the fire marshal to determine the cause of the explosion.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Officials say a diminutive fish species native only to one spring in Eastern Oregon is set to be removed from the federal list of endangered species. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports the Foskett speckled dace is one of several fish species that have seen comebacks in recent years. It was proposed for removal last year. The Foskett speckled dace was first listed under the Endangered Species Act in 1985 after biologists realized it only existed in one location at a remote spring and was extremely vulnerable to habitat loss. The Bureau of Land Management purchased over 150 acres surrounding the spring east of the town of Lakeview. Federal officials worked to protect the population at Foskett Spring and introduced the fish at a second location.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The state Supreme Court was asked Wednesday to outlaw the death penalty because of what critics call the cruel and arbitrary way it’s applied to poor and black defendants. More than half of the 441 death sentences handed down since the death penalty was reinstated in the late 1970s have been deemed flawed and overturned, Assistant Federal Defender Timothy Kane told the court. Among the 155 from Philadelphia, the reversal rate is 72%. “The reliability of the system as a whole is cruel ... and the systemic problems affect every case,” Kane argued before an overflow crowd at Philadelphia City Hall. Statewide, just under half of the current death row inmates in Pennsylvania are black, compared to 11% of residents. The average appeal in Pennsylvania takes 17 years, straining the resources of the court system, critics say.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A new study estimates the state’s greenhouse gas emissions are higher than previously calculated. Brown University’s Climate and Development Lab and the Stockholm Environment Institute calculated emissions in 2017 were about 45% higher than estimated in Rhode Island’s climate planning study. The study released Thursday was based on updated science on methane leakage from natural gas infrastructure and its short-term impacts. The researchers suggest shifting to electric cars and heating systems, insulating homes, getting rid of old appliances and expanding offshore wind development. Climate lab director Timmons Roberts says the study’s ideas can be applied to other states because the big picture is largely the same, due to natural gas leakage.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Reality television star and ex-state treasurer Thomas Ravenel has been fined $500 after taking a plea deal to charges he assaulted a former nanny. Ravenel was initially charged with misdemeanor second-degree assault and battery after the nanny said the former “Southern Charm” star dropped his pants and fondled her at his Charleston home in January 2015. Ravenel pleaded guilty to third-degree assault and battery. He was sentenced to 30 days in jail, suspended if he pays a $500 fine. WCSC-TV reports Ravenel said in court Wednesday that he tried to kiss her and grabbed her arm, and he was wrong. Prosecutors say the woman agreed to the deal. Bravo took Ravenel off “Southern Charm” after his arrest. Ravenel pleaded guilty to cocaine charges in 2007 and resigned as state treasurer.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nAberdeen: A South Dakotan has created a new online site where livestock producers can contract to sell their cattle. Kim Ulmer, who owns a livestock and machinery marketing company in Huron, says he created the American Mercantile Exchange in response to volatile market conditions. The first contract sales on the American Mercantile Exchange were made Sept. 3. Ulmer tells the Aberdeen News four loads of cattle were up for sale, and all four sold. Ulmer says sales will be limited to cattle that are close to sale weight until the mercantile has a larger database of buyers and sellers. He says selling cattle through his exchange is different from an auction barn because it eliminates the need for farmers to take the cattle to auction and sell on a particular day.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A federal judge has blocked the state’s new restrictions for registering voters from taking effect Oct. 1, saying Thursday that any benefit of the law won’t likely outweigh its potential harm. The ruling, for now, sets aside a law that goes beyond other states by fining groups that pay workers when too many incomplete registration forms are submitted. The law would also criminalize intentional infractions of a new set of rules, exposing voting advocates to misdemeanor charges. Voter registration groups who sued said the law has already curtailed their ability to enroll voters in communities of color and other historically disenfranchised groups. U.S. District Judge Aleta Trauger picked apart the law in an order earlier this week, saying efforts to restrict voter registration drives to try to preserve election commission resources are akin to “poisoning the soil in order to have an easier harvest.”\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Eleven protesters have been arrested after they rappelled from a busy highway bridge over the Houston Ship Channel, closing the vital artery for hours. The Coast Guard said the closure came after the protesters were spotted Thursday afternoon dangling from the Fred Hartman Bridge near Baytown. The demonstrators were Greenpeace USA activists protesting the use of fossil fuels. They suspended themselves from a bridge ahead of Thursday night’s Democratic presidential debate in Houston. Firefighters rappelled to the protesters Thursday evening and lowered them to boats below. Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez says 12 activists serving as spotters on the bridge also were arrested. The Port of Houston, located along the ship channel, is home to the largest petrochemical complex in the U.S.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state Supreme Court has ruled that partisan state school board elections are constitutional, overturning a 2017 district court decision. High court officials say the Wednesday ruling reinstates a 2016 law meaning people who want to run for the state Board of Education can file as partisan candidates beginning in 2020. The state Board of Education is composed of 15 members who are elected to four-year terms, with elections occurring every two years. Proponents of partisan elections say political party mechanisms were needed to adequately vet school board candidates, a move lawmakers had intended under the now-reinstated law. Current and former members of the state school board and some educational organizations say the ruling could lead to an educational system driven by a single political ideology influencing curriculum and policy.\n\nVermont\n\nLyndon: Vermont State Colleges officials are holding meetings at campuses to get input as the system charts its future amid declining enrollment, low state support and other challenges. An overflow crowd of students, faculty, alumni and community members shared their worries, suggestions and criticisms at a passion-filled meeting at Northern University in Lyndonville on Thursday. They expressed concerns about the school’s growing online classes and whether the programs and school they cherish will continue. They pointed out that the college – originally Lyndon State College – only recently went through a transformation in joining with Johnson State College to become Northern Vermont University. State Colleges Chancellor Jeb Spaulding told the crowd there is no proposal to close a campus or become all Northern Vermont University Online.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Virginia has launched a live “elk cam.” The Department of Game and Inland Fisheries says the elk cam will run annually from mid-August through November. Elk rut peaks between late September and early October. During the fall rut period, elk are highly social and stay in large harem groups out in open areas. Three viewing stations are now open on Buchanan County Industrial Development Authority property, located near Poplar Gap Community Park. The Department of Game and Inland Fisheries, the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation and the Kentucky Wildlife Resources Foundation restored 75 elk from Kentucky to Buchanan County between 2012 and 2014. The population has grown to an estimated 250.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: As the area tries to tackle its homelessness crisis, an official wants to expand a strategy of buying long-distance bus tickets for people living on the streets. The concept of sending homeless people out of town to where they say they’re from or may have support has been in place for decades in parts of the U.S. The city of Seattle and community organizations already offer free bus tickets as part of their broader approach to helping homeless people. King County council member Reagan Dunn wants to go a step further by spending $1 million to create a stand-alone bus ticket program that will emphasize “family reunification.” Critics say Dunn’s idea won’t realistically address chronic homelessness.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nRainelle: Police say three protesters who chained themselves to equipment at the Mountain Valley Pipeline have been arrested. WOAY-TV reports someone called 911 Tuesday morning and said about 15 protesters were blocking the road by the pipeline near Rainelle. Officers say three other people were chained to three excavators with their arms encased in steel pipes up to their elbows. Police say the three protesters had the ability to unchain themselves from the equipment but refused. Members of the Rainelle and Clintonville fire departments were called to remove them. Officers arrested a fourth person they say refused to get out of the road. All four were charged, arraigned in Greenbrier County Magistrate Court and released on bond.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: An appeals court has reduced compensation for a man who got into a legal battle over bedbugs. According to court documents, Steven Stack rented a bedbug-infested room in La Crosse from Donald Lecheler, who planned to solve the problem by moving the kitchen oven around the house, hoping to increase the temperature and kill the bedbugs. Stack said that would create a fire hazard and moved out. Stack filed a lawsuit in 2018 alleging Lecheler didn’t return his security deposit, he had to replace his mattress and clothes, and he suffered emotional distress. A judge awarded him $2,000. The 4th District Court of Appeals reduced Stack’s award Thursday to $1,000, saying Stack failed to show he suffered extreme emotional distress.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: Campbell County school district trustees have decided to move forward with developing a policy that will allow armed school staff for security. The Gillette News Record reports the decision Tuesday to move forward with a policy for concealed carry staff, along with other safety procedures, followed a long and divisive comment period in which educators, parents, law enforcement and veterans spoke out. Not everyone agreed about arming school staff in the city limits, but they did agree safety was an issue and advocated for adding more school resource officers. They also agreed on the need for continued discussion. Officials say it will take at least two months to come up with a policy that will then be presented to the school board for a final decision.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/09/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/05/03/virus-sniffing-dog-vegas-boom-vaccine-hecklers-news-around-states/115956336/", "title": "Virus-sniffing dog, Vegas boom: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Vaccines for COVID-19 are now widely available, but some people remain hesitant to take the shots, State Health Officer Scott Harris said Friday. After months of struggling with getting an adequate supply into the state, Harris said health officials are now trying to battle some people’s reluctance to sign up for doses. While people can be reluctant to take the vaccine for a variety of reasons, one is the false belief that the vaccine is more dangerous than the coronavirus, he said. “If you can identify one single issue that is a problem, it’s that there are people who are just convinced that the vaccine is somehow more dangerous than the disease,” Harris told reporters. “That’s a false belief we have to try to combat as often as we can. It’s simply not true.” Nearly one-third of Alabama’s population has received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. However, that figure ranks the state third from last in the nation, ahead of Mississippi and Louisiana, and Alabama is last nationally in its overall rate of vaccination. Harris said health officials are conducting media campaigns and asking doctors to contact their patients about the benefits of getting vaccinated. He emphasized that vaccination “is the fastest way to get back to normal.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Gov. Mike Dunleavy on Friday ended the state’s COVID-19 disaster declaration, saying the state is in such a good position he doesn’t need emergency powers bestowed by the Legislature. “Alaska is in the recovery phase where an emergency declaration is no longer necessary,” Dunleavy said in a statement. “Our systems are fully functioning with vaccine distribution, adequate testing, and health care capacity. It is important our focus remains on getting Alaska’s economy back on track and welcoming summer tourism throughout our great state.” Dunleavy acted on the recommendation of health commissioner Adam Crum, who concluded the emergency disaster declaration is no longer necessary. “While COVID-19 is still present in Alaska, the urgent nature of the pandemic has passed and we are no longer anticipating the widespread emergency that Alaska faced earlier in this pandemic,” Crum wrote in a memo to Dunleavy. The Republican governor also signed a bill that his office says ensures the continuation of COVID-19 federal relief to affected Alaskans and liability protections for businesses in the state.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Numerous doctors’ offices and clinics will be able to directly obtain COVID-19 vaccines starting this week, state health officials said Friday. Dr. Cara Christ, director of the Arizona Department of Health Services, announced eligible physicians and local health care providers will no longer have to rely on allocations from their county public health department. That means nearly 1,200 providers registered with the state can order up to 200 doses within a two-week period from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They will receive the Moderna vaccine because it has less complex storage requirements. The hope is that being able to go to a primary care doctor for a shot will “be a major driver,” Christ said. “Based on our community listening sessions, people indicated that a recommendation from their health care provider, that would be one of the things that would drive them to get vaccinated,” Christ said. State officials are expecting 100,000 doses to be available for these smaller providers to order directly during the first week. As vaccine demand declines, state health officials have been working with community groups on pop-up vaccination events in underserved areas like Yuma and south Phoenix. Strategies include telephonic town halls, door-to-door canvassing and targeted social media posts.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson has signed into law legislation banning state and local mask mandates for preventing the spread of the coronavirus, even though the prohibition will not take effect until later this summer. Hutchinson dropped the state’s mandate in March, but cities including Fayetteville and Little Rock were allowed to keep their requirements in place. The bill is the latest measure the Republican governor has signed to curb Arkansas’ pandemic-related restrictions. On Wednesday he signed bills prohibiting the state and local governments from requiring vaccinations against COVID-19 or “vaccine passports” to access services. The mask mandate ban does not prevent businesses from imposing their own requirements, unlike an earlier version of the bill Hutchinson had said he would veto. The new law doesn’t take effect until late July at the earliest. Hutchinson cited the delay in the prohibition taking effect and its exemption of private businesses. “It is important to respect the individual decisions made by private businesses,” Hutchinson said in a statement. “It also does not have an emergency clause, so the law will not go into effect until the current school year ends.” The measure doesn’t apply to state-owned or state-controlled health care facilities, state prisons or facilities operated by the Division of Youth Services.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Mayor Eric Garcetti announced Friday that the COVID-19 mass vaccination site at Dodger Stadium will close by the end of May, part of a trend in California to bring doses closer to where people live as appointments in some places go unfilled. Winding down operations at the stadium marks the transition of the city’s vaccination efforts to appointment-free options and putting more doses into walk-up centers and mobile clinics, the mayor said in a statement. Dodger Stadium became one of the nation’s most prominent sites for coronavirus response, first for testing and then for delivery of vaccines to people waiting in long lines of cars. “Dodger Stadium set the standard for sports franchises and community institutions playing a starring role in our COVID-19 response for the country,” Garcetti said. More than 1 million people were tested at the stadium, and the number of vaccine doses administered there has topped 420,000, according to the city. Orange County’s big vaccination site at Disneyland closed Friday as the theme park reopened to visitors for the first time in more than a year. Similarly, a major site at Six Flags Magic Mountain in northern Los Angeles County recently closed as that park welcomed visitors back. North of San Francisco, Marin County will close two mass vaccination sites in San Rafael by the end of May.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: A little more than a year since schools and all their events shut down, some traditions, like prom, are returning – or, as some schools called them, “prom-like events.” Poudre School District’s four comprehensive high schools – Fort Collins High School, Fossil Ridge High School, Poudre High School and Rocky Mountain High School – hosted proms Saturday night, with a few stark differences from those of years past. At this year’s events, students could choose to wear formal or informal attire, food was not served for safety reasons, and the dances were all hosted outside to allow for social distancing and airflow. Tickets had to be bought ahead of time through an application that allows a school’s COVID-19 response team to perform contact tracing if a student who attended tests positive for the coronavirus. Students also had to register for the dance in a “pod” of no more than 10 and be limited to hanging out with that group for the evening. The district said by having students register in groups, kids within a pod were able to be less than 6 feet away from each other. Students were unable to attend if they had “any illness symptoms or are probable/positive for COVID-19.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Several of the state’s best-known museums have signed on to a proposal by Gov. Ned Lamont designed to combat some of the learning lost during the pandemic by allowing children to visit for free this summer. Mystic Aquarium, Mystic Seaport Museum, Beardsley Zoo, the Connecticut Science Center and the Maritime Aquarium at Norwalk have all expressed interest in participating, Lamont said Friday. Under the initiative, all Connecticut children 18 and under and one accompanying adult can visit the museums free of charge from July 1 to Sept. 6. “By participating in this program, we hope to provide more children access to a fun and educational destination and instill a love of the ocean that motivates young audiences to make a difference in our world,” said Dr. Stephen M. Coan, president and CEO of Sea Research Foundation Inc., the nonprofit that operates Mystic Aquarium. The governor’s plan would fund the program with $15 million from the state’s federal recovery funds. “Connecticut has some of the best museums in the region, and they were significantly impacted by the pandemic,” Lamont said. “Investing these recovery dollars into our museums just makes sense.” The Legislature must sign off on the proposal.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The state had the highest foreclosure rate in the country so far this year, according to a nationwide realty data analysis. One in every 1,705 housing units in Delaware had a foreclosure filing in the first quarter of 2021, according to the report from ATTOM Data Solutions. Of the state’s three counties, Kent County saw the highest foreclosure rate at the start of this year, with 1 in every 1,281 housing units seeing a foreclosure filing. New Castle County saw 1 in every 1,691, and Sussex County saw 1 in every 2,094. While the First State ranked first in terms of its foreclosure rate this past quarter, it was 31st in the total number of foreclosure filings, according to the data. The state had 254 filings, showing that even a small change in the small state can have a big impact on its ranking. And some state officials questioned the data. The Delaware State Housing Authority launched a mortgage assistance program in August to help people struggling to make their payments during the COVID-19 pandemic. That program was paused at the end of last year because the state was unsure if the federal government would continue to help fund the program, according to Jessica Eisenbrey Welch, a spokeswoman for the Delaware State Housing Authority.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Fully vaccinated people may do more without wearing a mask under a new order from Mayor Muriel Bowser, WUSA-TV reports. People who are fully vaccinated – meaning at least two weeks have passed since their final dose of a COVID-19 vaccine – may now gather outdoors with a small group of vaccinated and unvaccinated people without wearing a mask, but social distance must be maintained, and people in the group who are not fully vaccinated must continue to wear masks. Fully vaccinated people can visit with a small group of fully vaccinated people only at a private indoor setting without wearing a mask. They may travel within the United States without getting tested for the coronavirus before or after their trip. Those flying into the U.S. from another country still need to show a negative test before boarding and get tested three to five days after their return. Fully vaccinated people may also continue activities after being exposed to someone with COVID-19 without needing to get tested or quarantine, unless they have symptoms or live in a group setting. Businesses and other institutions may ask to see a person’s vaccine card or other proof of inoculation. Employers are also required to provide masks for their employees and can implement mask mandates at the office, according to the order.\n\nFlorida\n\nSarasota: Three days a week, Buffy greets visitors at the entrance to Doctors Hospital of Sarasota. If they grant permission, she sniffs their feet, seeking a whiff of active COVID-19 infection. Few decline the offer when they see the yellow Labrador retriever with a wagging tail. People generally don’t love going to a hospital, said CEO Robert Meade, but “who doesn’t love labs?” Buffy was trained by Palmetto-based Southeastern Guide Dogs as part of a four-dog pilot program for scent detection. The original plan was to train dogs to detect heightened levels of cortisol, the stress hormone. The coronavirus pandemic derailed that plan but opened the door to another. Small, early studies on dogs trained to detect the virus in Europe – though still unproven – showed promise. Southeastern decided to give it a shot. The four dogs selected had flunked out of Southeastern’s guide dog training, seen as easily distracted or “a little high-energy,” trainer Laska Parrow said. But “they were dogs that never gave up when a treat was hidden somewhere.” Saliva samples were collected from Doctors Hospital patients with active COVID-19 infections and “inactivated,” rendering them noninfectious. The dogs trained for three months. At the end, Buffy was 95% accurate at detecting the virus samples. Meade said he believes Doctors Hospital of Sarasota is the first hospital in the U.S. with such a pooch.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Gov. Brian Kemp is removing many remaining requirements for social distancing and masked employees from businesses, saying the state’s efforts to control COVID-19 have been successful – even as its vaccination rate lags and as federal officials continue to warn that infection rates remain relatively high. While Kemp was touring the Mexican border in Texas on Friday, the Republican’s office released a new executive order that took effect Saturday and runs through May 30. “Businesses across the Peach State have followed COVID-19 restrictions for over a year to keep their employees and customers safe and will now be able to make informed decisions about how their business operations move forward,” said Mallory Blount, a spokesperson for Kemp. “Georgians know best how to protect themselves and their families, and they deserve to be able to return to normal.” But public health experts fear another surge, possibly driven by more infectious variants of the coronavirus. “Too soon,” Emory University infectious disease expert Carlos del Rio wrote on Twitter, pointing to federal statistics. “We still have ‘substantial transmission’ and our percent of population fully vaccinated is low.” More than 6 million doses of vaccines have been given in Georgia, but the state ranks 44th in doses per capita to people 18 and up.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Gov. David Ige says the state’s mask mandate will remain in place for now. Ige urged people to continue wearing masks despite the latest guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about vaccinated people not having to wear masks in certain outdoor situations, Hawaii News Now reports. “We believe that the basic mask mandate is still appropriate, and we won’t be making changes, or making significant changes, at this time,” Ige said. He said said it would be difficult to determine who has been vaccinated against COVID-19 when it comes to enforcement. Some people at a beach park agreed. “It’s great that he’s not going to change it because how can you tell if somebody’s vaccinated or not?” said Terry Kakazu. “For my own protection, I’m gonna wear it anyway.” And beachgoer Claire Nakamua-Rochon asked: “What are we gonna do, put a ‘V’ on everybody’s arm to let everybody know you’re the vaccinated one?” Ige said he believes masks have helped keep the coronavirus in check in the state. “Hawaii continues to have amongst the lowest per capita infection rates and fatality rates in the country,” he said. “I do believe that our mask mandate is part of that success.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Lawmakers hesitant to leave the governor in charge of pandemic decisions after the legislative session are delaying their adjournment, a move that analysts say could cause a government shutdown by threatening the start date of some 200 pieces of legislation. A measure intended to change the effective date of the legislation should be amended to avoid a potential government shutdown starting in June, a legal analysis has determined. The Idaho attorney general’s office sent the analysis Thursday to the Idaho Legislative Services Office, a nonpartisan government entity that supports state lawmakers. The document obtained by the Associated Press said the legislation as written could pass a court challenge, but the consequences for failing could be severe. The 200 bills include 65 critical appropriations bills. They would typically not take effect until at least 60 days after the Legislature adjourns. But the Legislature still being in session pushes their effective date past the start of the new fiscal year, starting July 1. If the bill is found unconstitutional, “some 200 bills, including appropriations bills to fund parts of state government, would not take effect on July 1, 2021,” wrote Chief Deputy Brian Kane, and “there could be funding issues for parts of state government as early as June 12.”\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Consistent statewide procedures and ongoing drills that target infection response and other emergencies will be routine at Illinois veterans’ homes after COVID-19 caught the LaSalle Veterans’ Home unprepared and claimed 36 lives last fall, said the newly appointed director of the state Department of Veterans Affairs. Terry Prince, a 31-year Navy veteran and former senior adviser to the U.S. surgeon general, has issued a six-point plan for improving readiness at the state’s veterans’ homes in Anna, Manteno, Quincy and LaSalle. The plan follows a blistering investigative report that laid out a string of miscommunications, lax policy and missed opportunities when the pandemic hit the home in LaSalle, 94 miles west of Chicago. The report by the inspector general of the Illinois Department of Human Services, released Friday, noted that despite escaping all traces of the deadly respiratory illness for eight months after it entered Illinois, little was done to devise protocols for preventing or managing infections. After the first four cases were reported Nov. 1, the virus spread to 60 residents and 43 employees as confused staff operated in an environment that was “inefficient, reactive and chaotic,” the report said.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Gamblers will have to keep wearing face masks inside the state’s casinos at least through the end of May. Updated health guidelines issued by the Indiana Gaming Commission said operators of the 13 state-licensed casinos decided to keep the mask rule in place to stem COVID-19 spread even though Gov. Eric Holcomb lifted the statewide mask mandate as of April 6. The casino rules require customers to wear masks except when eating, drinking or smoking while seated at a slot machine, bar or restaurant table. Gamblers must wear masks at table games, and employees are required to have masks on at all times. The gaming commission said casinos will review whether to continue the mask requirement past June 1. The state guidelines direct casinos to obtain permission from local health officials before holding any events involving large crowds and continue extra spacing between slot machine players.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Gov. Kim Reynolds said she rejected $95 million in federal money for coronavirus testing in schools because she didn’t think there was a need for the funding. Reynolds, a Republican, announced her decision on a Thursday night Fox News show and criticized President Joe Biden’s administration for offering the money aimed at expanding testing. “I think he thinks that COVID just started,” Reynolds said on the show, which was televised from a forum with other Republican governors in Florida. ”I just returned $95 million because they sent an additional $95 million to the state of Iowa to get our kids back in the classroom by doing surveillance testing. And I said we’ve been in the classroom since August. Here’s your $95 million back.” Kelly Garcia, director of the Iowa Department of Human Services, confirmed later that Iowa had turned down the funding. The Republican Party of Iowa praised Reynolds’ decision, saying the Biden administration had failed in its efforts to return students to in-person classrooms, but “Gov. Reynolds fought back against the teachers unions and succeeded.” Democratic state Auditor Rob Sand questioned the rejection of federal money that would have assisted testing at schools and funded Iowa jobs.\n\nKansas\n\nOverland Park: A Kansas City-area high school athletic director is pleading with families to take pandemic safety protocols seriously after instructing about 200 students to quarantine last week. John Johnson, who oversees athletics at Shawnee Mission South High School, said in a message to parents and athletes that “there are more students with positive tests, and that is causing an extreme domino effect of COVID transmission concerns.” He also warned that post-season play could be affected, The Kansas City Star reports. Elected officials in Johnson County voted Thursday to switch the mask mandate to a recommendation, although the decision doesn’t affect schools. Health officials in the county, which is the state’s largest, have warned that while the number of new coronavirus cases is down, the drop in testing makes it more difficult to know how widespread transmission of the virus has become. And they are urging eligible residents to get vaccinated, saying demand has slowed. District spokesman David Smith said it is typical for student-athletes to be quarantined from playing sports after a potential exposure but still be allowed to attend class. “At school, we have protocols, including mask-wearing and social distancing. But when you’re participating in sports, it’s not always possible to do those things,” Smith said.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Thousands of spectators gathered in the infield at Churchill Downs on Saturday for the Kentucky Derby, many not wearing face masks required amid the coronavirus pandemic. Hundreds stood in lines that were not spaced out to use ATMs or buy food. Unlike some Derby tickets this year that are all-inclusive, infield tickets don’t include drinks or food, so fans have to use cash to make purchases. Sydney Lowe of Columbus, Ohio, said she and her friends were fine with not wearing masks because they were outside and had been vaccinated. “We’re outside; I feel like it’s not that big a deal,” Lowe said. “I wish there were more ATMs and that it wasn’t only cash, that’s one thing,” added her friend Halle Vozar. A recording played over a loudspeaker at the entrance said guests were required to wear masks over their mouths and noses. Ticket-takers reminded people coming in the front gate: “Please have your mask on! Masks on! Masks on!” A sign posted indoors by the wagering windows reminding spectators to wear masks largely went ignored. Others had masks pulled down covering their chins. The crowd at the Downs reportedly topped 50,000 people, which would make the Derby the biggest gathering for a U.S. sports event since the pandemic began.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Gov. John Bel Edwards has proposed spending $1.6billion of the state’s $3.2billion in federal funding from the latest pandemic relief package on Louisiana’s bankrupt unemployment trust fund, tourism and infrastructure to help stand up the economy. “It’s my belief that these are the three most important things we can do right now ... to have a transformative, positive impact on Louisiana,” Edwards said at a Thursday press conference. Edwards, who will need approval from the Legislature, wants to direct $230 million to repay federal loans that have propped up the state’s unemployment trust fund and another $400 million to replenish the trust fund to avoid triggering tax hikes on businesses. “I don’t believe it’s a good thing to increase taxes on businesses when we’re trying to grow the economy coming out of a pandemic,” he said. Edwards is proposing $750 million go toward infrastructure – $400 million to roads and bridges, $300 million to upgrade dilapidated water systems and $50 million for ports. He’s also recommending $125 million for Convention and Visitors Bureaus and other tourism venues and $20 million for the Office of Culture, Recreation and Tourism. “That’s incredibly important to jump-start our economy,” he said.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Cities and towns would be able to get access to federal coronavirus aid under a pandemic law change. The Legislature on Wednesday passed a proposal to set up an account for the state to receive and distribute federal funds for the municipalities via the American Rescue Plan. The proposal, which was a governor’s bill, is now before Democratic Gov. Janet Mills. Democratic Senate President Troy Jackson said the money is important for Maine cities and towns to “work to rebuild local communities and economies.” The American Rescue Plan allocated funds to Maine municipalities based on their populations, the Maine Legislature Office of the Presiding Officers said. Every town in the state will receive money, Democratic Rep. Teresa Pierce said. That will result in more than $600 million going into the communities, she said.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Preliminary data from 2020 reveals a dramatic increase in deaths linked with opioids in the state, particularly fentanyl, and health officials blame the pandemic. The number of unintentional intoxication overdoses – those involving all drugs and alcohol – rose 18.7% to 2,773 in 2020 from 2,379 in 2019, according to data collected by the Maryland Department of Health. In more than 90% of cases, opioids were detected in bodies postmortem. That’s the highest rate recorded in the state’s history of collecting this data. While too early to formally determine the extent to which COVID-19 has influenced this increase, experts agree the pandemic is likely to blame for the widespread increase in drug use. Dr. Aaron Greenblatt, medical director of the University of Maryland Medical Center Addiction Treatment Programs, said pandemic-induced stress is likely a major factor in drug users’ relapses, but COVID-19 restricted treatment options, too. “I think that access to treatment – particularly access to psychosocial treatments – was really significantly impacted by COVID … we haven’t had groups,” Greenblatt told Capital News Service. Outpatient addiction treatment programs are intense and may require patients to visit an office or a clinic to get supervised therapeutic medication dosing up to six days a week.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The state is pouring $70 million into summer educational programs to benefit students who have fallen behind academically and socially while learning remotely during the coronavirus pandemic, Gov. Charlie Baker said Friday. “Studies continue to show that amid the school closures, many students did miss out on some fundamental issues around math and reading,” the Republican governor said after touring a Canton middle school. The programs designed for every grade level – including high school seniors graduating this spring – will feature a mix of academic and recreational opportunities at schools, after-school providers, community colleges and recreation sites, he said. Many students were out of school for longer than a year during the pandemic, and some high school students continue to learn remotely. The programs include so-called Acceleration Academies, which will offer intensive instruction in one subject with smaller classes, longer instructional blocks and individualized attention. Under the Summer Acceleration to College program, class of 2021 high school graduates will be able to take math and English courses for credit at no cost at 14 community colleges. Another program is aimed at incoming kindergartners.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Republican legislative leaders on Friday welcomed Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s metric-based approach to further relaxing coronavirus restrictions, but they questioned what will happen if Michigan’s COVID-19 vaccination rate falls below targets. Their comments came a day after the Democratic governor announced four benchmarks that will trigger additional economic reopening – when 55%, 60%, 65% and 70% of people ages 16 and up get at least one shot. About half have done so to date. The state, where the seven-day infection rate remains highest in the U.S. but is dropping, now needs at least 2 of every 5 unvaccinated residents to receive a dose. “I think that we need a little more of a discussion on this metric of vaccines alone. I believe there’s a little more breadth that needs to be taken into consideration there, especially if we run into resistance and reluctance that causes us to plateau below the numbers that have been indicated,” Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, R-Clarklake, said during a virtual event sponsored by the Detroit Regional Chamber. It included all four legislative leaders. House Speaker Jason Wentworth, R-Clare, applauded Whitmer for providing people “some sense of hope” and said both the vaccination rate and vaccine accessibility are important.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud: About 100 people gathered at Lake George on Saturday morning to memorialize the nearly 400 area residents who have died from COVID-19 in the past year and to share messages of resilience and hope for the future. The event was organized by St. Cloud Times journalists Nora Hertel and Sarah Kocher. “I had the idea to do something like this in January,” Hertel said after the memorial. “I just thought, how are we honoring these people?” Each death has added to a “huge community loss,” Hertel said, and “I just felt like we needed to reckon with it.” The memorial took place on the deck on the east side of Lake George. Guests were invited to tie strips of cloth, donated by Gruber’s Quilt Shop in Waite Park, to the railing, where they will remain until Friday. Those ribbons fluttered in the breeze behind each speaker during the event. The Rev. James Alberts, of the Higher Ground Church of God in Christ, was the first guest to speak, opting to use his “pastor voice” instead of a microphone. “It’s good to see your faces, in a shared space and to be able to do this together,” Alberts said, before leading the group in prayer. “It’s so important that we recognize the loss of nearly 400 people in our area,” Mayor Dave Kleis said. “I hope there’s a day not too distant in the future where we will celebrate the last case of COVID.”\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves on Friday erased most restrictions he had set to try to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The Republican governor left one rule in place: a mandate for students 6 or older to wear masks in schools for the rest of the current academic year. The school year ends within the next few weeks in most parts of the state. Reeves’ new executive order removes capacity restrictions for sports events. Previously, indoor arenas could only fill two-thirds of their seats to allow for social distancing. School sporting events and other activities were limited to 50% capacity for both indoor and outdoor events. Now, both indoor and outdoor school activities are no longer under capacity restrictions. “Getting our kids back in school last August was one of the most important decisions of the pandemic and keeping them in the classroom is one of my top priorities,” Reeves said in a statement Friday. “Even so – our class of 2021 has not been afforded a normal senior year. I want every one of them to attend their graduation and I want everyone in their family to be able to join them!” Reeves had already removed mask requirements in public spaces and all capacity restrictions for restaurants, bars and other businesses.\n\nMissouri\n\nReeds Spring: A southwest Missouri school district that dropped its mask mandate last month has decided to reinstate it after several students became infected with the coronavirus, leading to dozens of quarantines. The 1,700-student Reeds Spring district had gone weeks without a case when it decided to make masks optional beginning April 22. Several other districts in the Springfield area also have ditched mask orders in recent weeks. “It’s getting harder and harder to even get kids to keep those masks on as they are seeing people, adults and everyone in the community, not wearing masks,” Superintendent Cody Hirschi said in a video at the time. The change didn’t last long, though, before the district decided to reinstate the mandate starting Friday. “The cases of quarantine are really our biggest concern,” said district spokesman Ben Fisher, noting that six positive tests led to 95 quarantines in several buildings. “We really think it is essential for kids to be able to participate in end-of-year activities, so we decided this was the best option to keep kids in school.” Statewide, the percentage of Missouri residents receiving at least one shot of a COVID-19 vaccine barely budged Friday, remaining a little above 37% of the state population, KMIZ-TV reports.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: The state posted 169 new COVID-19 cases Saturday, bringing Montana’s total to 108,985 confirmed reports. Of the 108,985 cases, 106,324 are recovered, and 1,087 remain active. There are 53 people who are now hospitalized out of 5,021 total COVID-19 hospitalizations since the pandemic began, according to the state website covid19.mt.gov. Montana added two deaths overnight, bringing the total to 1,574 fatalities related to the respiratory illness. The state has thus far administered 1,302,221 tests for the coronavirus. The first case of COVID-19 in Montana was reported March 11, 2020. The state’s highest daily total of newly detected cases came Nov. 12, when 1,429 new cases were reported.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A community college is using federal COVID-19 relief funds to pay for tuition and books for high schoolers from the state to take courses this summer. The Omaha World-Herald reports officials at the Metropolitan Community College hope their newly approved offer will pull in thousands of students. The college saw about a 15% drop in summer enrollment from 2019 to 2020, said Bill Owen, the college’s vice president for strategic initiatives. “If we’re truly in recovery mode, and we hope we are, we think we’ll see a return to those numbers,” he said. Typically, high school students pay $33 per credit hour – half the full rate – if they enroll in a program called CollegeNow that is designed for high school students to jump-start their college education. While those students will be allowed to attend courses for free this summer, they will be responsible for tools and other required supplies.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The city has been almost elbow-to-elbow lately with pandemic-weary tourists looking for excitement and entertainment, after casinos rose from 35% to 50% occupancy March 15 under state health guidelines. Capacity limits in Las Vegas casinos dropped again Saturday – allowing 80% occupancy – while person-to-person distancing went from 6 feet to 3 feet. Masks are still required. “People were just yearning to go someplace and let loose,” said Alan Feldman, a former casino executive who is now a fellow at the International Gaming Institute at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Among the first arrivals were people ages 60 and older who were recently vaccinated with time and disposable income, he said. Analysts said pent-up demand, available hotel rooms and $1,400 federal pandemic recovery checks have contributed to the rush. “People are feeling more comfortable traveling as science appears to be getting ahead of the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Jeremy Aguero, principal analyst at Applied Analysis in Las Vegas. And every Sunday, a nearly 20-mile line of vehicles jams southbound Interstate 15 near the Nevada-California state line. “You have visitors coming throughout the week, all leaving at the same time,” Nevada Highway Patrol Trooper Travis Smaka said. “It’s very busy every Sunday.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Gov. Chris Sununu says state health officials and private agencies have begun a number of initiatives to encourage residents to get vaccinated. Officials warn that New Hampshire, which has been leading the nation in the percentage of the population that’s received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, is starting to see growth in the number of fully vaccinated residents slow down. WMUR-TV reports many people who are eligible to receive a shot have not signed up for an appointment. Data from the Department of Health and Human Services shows more than 790,000 New Hampshire residents have received their first dose, about 60% of the population, while more than 351,000 of those people are fully vaccinated, or about 26% of the population. The state says a series of public service announcements and electronic billboards will encourage people who may be hesitant to get vaccinated. Experts say it is important for everyone to get inoculated. “They may not become ill. They may be a transmitter and simply part of an asymptomatic transmission,” said Martha Wassell, director of Infection Prevention at Wentworth-Douglass Hospital. “That could in turn spread this to someone who either was vaccinated, and it didn’t work well, or for whatever medical reason could not be vaccinated.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: Business, casino and political officials called on Gov. Phil Murphy on Friday to ease coronavirus regulations enough to allow conventions and trade shows to resume in the city. Saying the convention industry generates nearly $2 billion in annual revenue for Atlantic City, the groups asked the Democratic governor to allow meetings to utilize available space at 50% of capacity, as is permitted on the gambling floors of the city’s nine casinos. Michael Chait, president of the Greater Atlantic City Chamber of Commerce, praised Murphy’s handling of the pandemic but said state-imposed rules are inconsistent and are hurting the convention industry. “I can only have 25 people in a meeting room, but I can have 225 people in a banquet hall,” he said at a press conference on the Boardwalk as workmen attended to the facade of Boardwalk Hall in anticipation of the summer tourism season. “I can have 50% capacity on the casino floor, but I can only take 25 of them and put them into an adjacent meeting room.” Chait said the city would like to be able to host conventions and trade shows at 50% of capacity, using the same safety and distancing protocols the casinos have been using since they were allowed to reopen last July. He said the casino industry has proven it is possible to operate at higher levels without compromising safety.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A judge has ordered education officials to provide computers and high-speed internet to students who still don’t have them in a landmark ruling that for the first time in the state has set a standard for internet speeds for public school children. The ruling requires state officials to immediately determine which students covered by the sweeping lawsuit are still lacking quality internet or devices and to provide them with what they need, including transportation if they can’t get fast internet from home. “Children who are lacking access to internet and technology for remote learning are not getting much of an education, if at all, let alone one that is sufficient to make them college and career ready,” state District Judge Matthew Wilson said in the ruling Friday morning. It’s unclear how the court might compel state officials to act on the ruling or when it might hold them in contempt. The vast majority of New Mexico schools are open to in-person learning. But school districts serving tribal areas, which were particularly hard-hit by COVID-19 cases and deaths, are still under lockdown orders, and some are still in remote or partially remote learning. About 10% of New Mexico children are Native American and often confront major barriers to online and in-person learning.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Restaurants in New York City can increase their indoor dining to 75% of capacity starting Friday, May 7, in line with the rest of the state, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Friday. That will let city eateries fill more of their tables on Mother’s Day, May 9. Cuomo on Friday also said personal services including hair salons and barbershops could expand to 75% capacity starting May 7 as well. Gyms in New York City can go to 50% capacity starting May 15. Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio both spoke Thursday about wanting to see coronavirus-related restrictions lifted in the next couple of months. Infection rates throughout the state have continued to fall at a steady pace in recent weeks as more people have become vaccinated against COVID-19. The number of new infections reported daily in New York has dropped 56% since the start of April, even as more and more social activity has resumed. Still, the crisis isn’t over yet. A majority of New Yorkers have yet to receive even a single dose of the vaccine. The state recorded 25,000 positive coronavirus tests in the prior seven days, more than it did in the entire month of September.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Some low-income families missed out on getting coronavirus relief grants last year because of administrative and qualifying hurdles required by the General Assembly, a state audit concluded last week. The legislature in September approved using federal COVID-19 relief funds to give families one-time $335 payments. The “Extra Credit Grant” money was designed to assist with virtual schooling and child care costs during the pandemic but could be used for any purpose. Lawmakers tasked the Department of Revenue with managing the program. More than 1.1 million payments had been sent by the department through December totaling about $375 million, according to State Auditor Beth Wood’s office. They were sent automatically to families who were 2019 tax filers and reported having at least one child age 16 or under. But parents or guardians who didn’t make enough money in 2019 to file a return were required to fill out an application to obtain payments. By the end of 2020, about 25,000 payments had been made to those who had applied, the performance audit said. Wood’s report found that other low-income families didn’t receive payments because of the additional steps the Revenue Department had to complete within a matter of weeks to accept applications and award payments.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The 2021 Legislature reached its finale early Friday in a session marked by a record-high state budget, the first expulsion of a lawmaker and pandemic protocols that greatly dampened public participation at the state Capitol. Lt. Gov. Brent Sanford, the state Senate’s presiding officer, hit the final gavel at 12:26 a.m. Friday. House members officially completed their work at 12:18 a.m. after finishing a brief chorus of “Auld Lang Syne.” Lawmakers from both sides exchanged handshakes and hugs after a marathon day that came to an end after approval of the spending bill for the Office of Management and Budget, which also serves as Legislature’s last-minute catchall measure. Thursday was Day 76 for the Legislature, just short of the 80-day maximum set by the North Dakota Constitution. The Legislature will use the remaining days later in the year to approve new legislative districts. The Republican-led Legislature has passed record-setting budgets in most of the past several sessions, but the spending plan for the next two-year budget cycle is particularly eye-popping, due in part to federal coronavirus aid. As the session wound down Thursday, lawmakers completed work on a nearly $17 billion, two-year budget, about $2.1 billion more than the current budget cycle ending June 30.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: Teens have been trickling into COVID-19 vaccination clinics ever since Gov. Mike DeWine opened up eligibility to everyone 16 and older March 29. Soon, experts say it’s possible a vaccine will be allowed for children as young as 5. Dr. Robert Frenck, director of the Gamble Vaccine Research Center at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, said that could happen by August or September. Until then, public health officials are working to get more and more eligible teens vaccinated. In some cases, that means bringing clinics to school buildings. Milford High School in Clermont County hosted a vaccination clinic in partnership with Clermont Public Health last month. District spokesperson Wendy Planicka said about 200 people came to the clinic, 150 of whom were students. Milford senior Jack McKenney, 18, said he caught the coronavirus in the fall. He said he didn’t feel very sick, and a sinus infection he had last March was much worse. Still, he went to Milford’s clinic because he’s worried about spreading COVID-19.“I mean, I know if I were to get COVID again, I would most likely be OK, but it’s just I’m relieved that I wouldn’t give it to someone else as easily,” he said. Other school districts are considering hosting vaccine clinics or at least encouraging students to get shots if able.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Mask mandates intended to slow the spread of the coronavirus are ending in the state’s two largest cities, Oklahoma City and Tulsa. The requirement ended Friday in Oklahoma City and Saturday in Tulsa, although the mandate continues at places such as city offices. Mayors David Holt in Oklahoma City and G.T. Bynum in Tulsa both credited COVID-19 vaccinations for lowering the number of virus cases and hospitalizations. “It is possible we are taking the miracle vaccinations for granted,” Holt said during a Friday news conference. “These proven, safe vaccines are remarkable.” Bynum said residents should also continue wearing masks when in groups of people outside their family. “While we’re in a position to end the city’s mandate that people wear masks in public, that doesn’t mean everyone should have a mask-burning party over the weekend,” Bynum said Thursday. In both cities, private businesses can continue requiring masks if desired. The Oklahoma State Department of Health on Friday reported 448,305 total virus cases since the pandemic began. The seven-day rolling average of new cases in the state has declined from 314.4 daily to 240.7, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nOregon\n\nBend: A vaccine clinic set up inside a high school attracted anti-vaccine protesters who heckled teenagers as they entered the site Thursday, prompting the church that provided a parking lot for the event to call police. The Bend-La Pine School District plans to offer COVID-19 vaccines at six different clinics at Central Oregon high schools through June 3 in hopes of stemming an outbreak that’s sickened at least 95 students and staff, The Bulletin reports. Before the school clinics began, Bend-La Pine School Board members received hundreds of angry emails from anti-vaccine activists, said board member Julie Craig. Most had the exact same copy-and-paste wording, but a few were especially nasty, she said. Board member Carrie McPherson Douglass shared emails with The Bulletin that called the school board Nazis for allowing vaccine clinics. In one, a parent promised to “exact cruel and inhuman revenge” if their child was harmed by the shot. “I’m frankly so done with it,” Craig told the newspaper. “I’m so disappointed in community members who feel that is the best way to try and have a conversation, when they don’t agree with something that we’re doing.” In Oregon, teens 15 and up can agree to medical services – including immunization – without parental consent, according to the Oregon Health Authority.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: Light of Life Rescue Mission’s plans to hold a vaccine clinic for homeless people last month were upended about three hours before the event was supposed to start, when news broke that use of the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine had been paused, the Tribune-Review reports. The shelter quickly shifted gears and administered the Moderna option instead, said Jerrel Gilliam, executive director. But the development altered Light of Life’s vaccine strategy, as clinicians had to inform patients without consistent housing that they needed to return for a second dose. “It is very frustrating,” Gilliam said. “This was part of our strategy to use in the camps because of the one shot.” U.S. health officials later lifted the 11-day J&J vaccine pause, but many of the challenges facing shelters and the homeless during the pandemic will remain. More than 70% of residents in Light of Life’s long-term program have been fully vaccinated, which provides some peace of mind, Gilliam said. But in a population with so much transience and turnover, he said the shelter can’t let its guard down. Barriers to health care, mental health care, food and other basic needs will remain, even after COVID-19 is resolved. “There is some concern that this population will once again go to the back burner,” Gilliam said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state Department of Health is partnering with nine colleges and universities to make getting a COVID-19 shot as easy as possible for all students, faculty and staff before the end of the spring semester. Under the program announced Thursday, schools will either hold on-campus vaccination clinics or provide free shuttle service from campus to vaccination sites. “Now that vaccine eligibility is open to all people 16 and older who live, work, or go to school in Rhode Island, it’s important that we get our young people who live in congregate settings vaccinated,” Gov. Daniel McKee said in a statement. For example, Brown University is participating at a designated day at the Dunkin’ Donuts Center in Providence by providing shuttle service to the clinic. Roger Williams University is partnering with the town of Bristol to host an on-campus clinic. Bryant University, the University of Rhode Island, Providence College, Community College of Rhode Island, New England Institute of Technology, Rhode Island College and the Rhode Island School of Design are also participating in the program. Many colleges are requiring students to be vaccinated before returning to campus for the fall. There is no cost to get a shot, and participants do not need health insurance.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Masks continue to be important in schools and many other crowded public settings, state health officials said Friday, after Gov. Henry McMaster last week called masks in schools the “height of ridiculosity.” McMaster criticized the requirements Wednesday, and in a Twitter post he also urged cities and towns to remove mask requirements. Other state officials, from education and health departments, have voiced concern about the Republican governor’s mask recommendations. The South Carolina Department of Education and state Department of Health and Environmental Control have both issued statements saying mask usage is critical to preventing the spread of the coronavirus. South Carolina’s assistant state epidemiologist said Friday in a media briefing that mask mandates in cities and towns continue to be important. Even in cities that have taken away those orders, Dr. Jane Kelly said, “I would urge you to protect yourself, your family and your community by wearing a mask.” She said masks work and likened wearing a mask to wearing a seat belt because once traffic fatalities began to drop, and seat belts were widely adopted, the belts remained, and the fatalities stayed low.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSturgis: The 2020 Sturgis Motorcycle Rally caused “widespread transmission” of the coronavirus across the United States, finds a new study released Thursday. More than 463 COVID-19 cases across 30 states were directly connected to the Sturgis Rally in August and September 2020. Seventeen patients were hospitalized, and one person died, according to the report by the Oxford University Press for the Infectious Diseases Society of America. The information was reviewed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including members of the CDC COVID-19 Response Team, though a disclaimer in the study says the findings “do not necessarily represent the official position.” A total of 649 primary and secondary cases were attributed to the South Dakota event in the study. About 56% of the Sturgis-associated cases were reported in South Dakota, Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, Nebraska and Wyoming. “While the number of cases identified is sizable – 140 cases per 100,000 attendees – it is likely that the true national impact of the Sturgis event is underestimated,” the report says. Some attendees could have been asymptomatic or hadn’t been tested when they returned home from the rally, leading to untraceable infections.\n\nTennessee\n\nKnoxville: For the second year in a row, the University of Tennessee at Knoxville has recommended no increase in tuition or fees for students. It’s a purposeful decision to help students in a challenging time as families continue to recover from the economic effects of COVID-19, UT Knoxville Chancellor Donde Plowman said Friday. “The proposed budget with no increase in tuition and fees represents our commitment to provide affordable access to a world-class education, especially as students and families continue to recover from the economic impacts of the pandemic,” Plowman said. “We are also grateful for the state support we receive, which helps us keep tuition flat and continue to offer the academic opportunities and college experiences that make our university special.” The chancellor’s advisory board approved the flat tuition and fees for the 2021-22 school year Friday morning, as part of the budget recommendation for the next fiscal year. The budget and tuition recommendations still needs to be approved by the board of trustees later this year. Last year, tuition and fees were kept flat at all UT campuses because of financial hardship caused by the coronavirus. The year before that, tuition increased by 2%. There was no tuition increase in 2018.\n\nTexas\n\nArlington: A runoff for a U.S. House seat is set between Republican Susan Wright, whose husband was the first member of Congress to die after being diagnosed with COVID-19, and Republican Jake Ellzey. Democrat Jana Lynne Sanchez was narrowly locked out of the runoff in Texas’ 6th Congressional District, which has long been GOP territory. With nearly all votes counted, Sanchez had trailed Ellzey by 354 votes. She said in a statement Sunday that her campaign “came up short.” “Democrats have come a long way toward competing in Texas but we still have a long way to go,” Sanchez said in a statement. Ellzey is a state lawmaker who narrowly lost the GOP nomination for the seat in 2018 and carried the backing of former Gov. Rick Perry. Susan Wright had already been seen as a favorite in a crowded race to fill the seat of her late husband, who died in February after being diagnosed with COVID-19. He was 67. The date of the runoff has not yet been set. Wright will enter the runoff with the backing of former President Donald Trump, who waited until just days before the election to endorse Wright.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: In the past year, lifestyle changes sparked by society’s reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic have led to more time at home, more time in front of a screen and a propensity for more frequent snacking. “We call it the COVID diet,” said Dr. Daniel Cannon, a pediatrician with Red Rock Pediatrics in St. George. “We’ve seen a real uptick in weight gain in a lot of kids.” Although the problem may have increased due to factors related to pandemic-era lifestyles, it’s definitely not the first time medical professionals have seen this problem. “Childhood obesity is basically an epidemic,” Cannon said. The problem stems from an increasingly unhealthy lifestyle in children and adolescents and from behaviors sometimes learned from generations of family obesity, he said. Other causes may include a lack of education on the topic of health, poverty, home environment, and accessibility of health care and healthy nutrition. “We call these ‘social determinants of health,’ ” Cannon said, adding that these determinants and others are screened for and discussed at each well visit in order to identify concerning trends before they become a problem. When it comes to increasing activity in children and young adults, Cannon said it’s best to find something the child is interested in and build activity around that.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state relaxed its guidance on mask-wearing outside Saturday while also moving to the second phase of reopening that allows larger gatherings, lifts industry-specific guidance for most businesses, and requires them to all follow the same rules about wearing masks, distancing and staying home when sick, Gov. Phil Scott said Friday. Vaccinated and unvaccinated Vermonters will no longer be required to wear masks outdoors if they are able to physically distance themselves. The new rules follow updated guidance last week from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Scott said during his twice-weekly virus briefing. Masks will only be required in crowds or with multiple households when distancing isn’t possible, said Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine. “The science and data show that outdoor transmission is rare; it poses little risk if you follow our guidance,” the Republican governor said. Municipalities and businesses can have stricter policies if they want, Scott said. More than 60% of adult residents are vaccinated, meeting the state’s goal to move to the second phase of reopening, Scott said. If the state reaches 70% of adults vaccinated by June 1, it will be able to take its final step to turn mandates into recommendations in July, he said.\n\nVirginia\n\nFalls Church: Republican candidates for governor touted plans to reopen schools and lift pandemic restrictions as they made videotaped pitches to the tens of thousands of party delegates who will choose a nominee at a convention next Saturday. Pandemic restrictions on mass gatherings have prevented the GOP from holding a traditional convention, so the party has instead opted to hold an “unassembled convention” in which delegates who preregistered to participate will cast ballots at more than 30 locations to choose a nominee. The convention will use ranked-choice voting to more closely mimic the balloting at a traditional convention, where the field is winnowed in successive votes until one candidate gets a minority. And because the candidates won’t be able to make traditional convention speeches to assembled delegates, the GOP arranged for candidates to submit videos touting themselves on the party’s website, which were posted Saturday night.\n\nWashington\n\nRepublic: About 10% of the population of this small city in north-central Washington has tested positive for the coronavirus in an outbreak traced to large indoor events last month at the local Fraternal Order of Eagles hall. Ferry County Memorial Hospital officials have confirmed more than 100 cases, with one reported death, since the April 9-11 events, including a membership drive that featured dinner, live music and a 1980s-themed karaoke night. Some patients have had to be transferred to Wenatchee and Yakima because of a lack of capacity at the 25-bed hospital – the only hospital in a 50-mile radius – and other closer facilities. “In Ferry County especially, we’re seeing really sick young people showing up in the emergency room to get care,” Northeast Tri County Health Officer Dr. Sam Artzis said, according to The Spokesman-Review. The county previously had relatively few COVID-19 cases, and many in the conservative, rural community saw mask mandates as infringing on their liberty. Less than one-quarter of the county’s residents have received a vaccine to date, according to the health district, but officials said the outbreak has increased interest in it. The situation should serve as a warning to other communities about the danger of large indoor events with unvaccinated people, they said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nBluefield: Signs featuring the words “Now Hiring” and “Help Wanted” are an increasingly common sight outside restaurants locally, but surprisingly few people are stepping forward and taking those jobs, business owners and hiring managers say. The COVID-19 pandemic put many people out of work as restrictions kept diners out of restaurants. Adjustments such as more drive-thru traffic, deliveries and limited seating helped, but restaurants cut back on wait staff and other employees. Restrictions are starting to relax, but now they are having trouble bringing new employees in. Jamie Null, executive director of the Mercer County Convention & Visitors Bureau, said local restaurants and service industries have been looking for new employees, but they are not receiving many applicants. Some area restaurants are seeing people ask about jobs, but few are taking the next step from applicant to employee. The Corner Shop in downtown Bramwell has been hiring for months, manager Mandy Fink said. She said she believed some of the people who apply but never follow through are listing applications so they can keep receiving unemployment benefits. “Right now, there’s a lot of people who are able to work,” she said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state Capitol, closed to the public since late March 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic, will reopen Monday, Gov. Tony Evers’ administration announced Friday. It will be opened for limited hours, 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., and only on weekdays. Before the pandemic, the building stayed open until 6 p.m. during the week and was also open on weekends. There will be no public tours of the Capitol, but the tour desk will be staffed for visitors to get information. Only one entrance to the building will be open to the public. Capitol staff, including those who work for Evers, lawmakers and the state Supreme Court, have been working out of the building for months. The Legislature has also been holding hearings and floor sessions, which are open to the public. State office buildings that surround the Capitol remain closed, but Evers has said he’s targeting a return to work for many this summer. Republicans have been pushing Evers to move faster to open the offices. As of Friday, more than 43% of people in Wisconsin had received at least one shot of a COVID-19 vaccine, while nearly 34% were fully vaccinated, according to the state Department of Health Services.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Telephone scammers are trying to take advantage of an accidental Wyoming Department of Health data release affecting over a quarter of the state’s population, agency officials said Friday. Scammers request insurance, Medicare, Medicaid or other financial information and in some cases look like they’re calling from state government numbers, department administrator Jeri Hendricks said in a statement. “No one representing the department will ask you for insurance, Medicare, Medicaid or personal financial information. No one representing the department will call you about the breach unless they are returning a call you made to us first,” Hendricks said. The scammers appear to be targeting residents at random and not through access to phone numbers inadvertently released, department spokeswoman Kim Deti said. A department employee working with computer code accidentally posted coronavirus test results as well as associated names, addresses, birth dates and other information on GitHub.com, an internet-based software development platform. The employee released coronavirus plus flu test results for 145,698 Wyoming residents. Also posted were blood alcohol test results for 18,312 people, mainly from Wyoming but also other states, dating to 2012.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/05/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/04/01/music-festivals-opening-day-casino-clinics-news-around-states/115660304/", "title": "Music festivals, Opening Day: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nAuburn: Auburn University officials say they will reinstate the school’s bass fishing team this spring following allegations that it repeatedly violated COVID-19 policies. The school had initially suspended the team for the entire year but agreed to the shorter punishment after a meeting that involved school administrators and team members. The team violated the travel and events policy in July 2020, February 2021 and March 2021, school officials said in a memo. The team will now be able to return to competition April 22. During the suspension, no member of the team will be allowed to compete, recruit or represent the Auburn University Bass Fishing Team. “I am thankful that Auburn University and its administration were willing to listen to us and consider all of the facts with an open mind,” said Logan Parks, president of the Auburn University Bass Fishing Club. “We have reached an agreement, and, most importantly, the Auburn Team is excited about being able to resume representing Auburn University as we pursue another National Championship.” Auburn’s team is one of the country’s top-ranked programs. Several former members have gone on to compete in professional bass fishing competitions.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The state health department is floating the idea of providing COVID-19 vaccinations to travelers at the state’s busiest airports with the summer tourism and fishing seasons looming. The department released a request for information last week to determine interest among potential contractors to provide a one-dose vaccine to interested travelers in a secure section of the airports in Anchorage, Juneau, Fairbanks and Ketchikan. Implementing strategies to reduce the spread of COVID-19 through Alaska communities is critical with the levels of travel activity expected between May and October, the document said. The department says its Division of Public Health intends to use the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine for such a program, subject to availability. Under emergency use authorizations, people 18 and older can receive the J&J shot, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Division of Public Health Director Heidi Hedberg said officials would need to wait for increased allocations of the vaccine from the federal government. But she said the state health department is looking at “sometime late spring, hopefully before tourist season picks up,” for when it could set up vaccine sites at airports. Alaska provides optional coronavirus testing at airports.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Pima County officials said Tuesday that they will continue to enforce a mask mandate to contain the spread of the coronavirus, joining a group of local leaders defying Gov. Doug Ducey’s order banning government requirements for face coverings. Officials in Arizona’s second-largest county said health inspectors will continue enforcing mask requirements in restaurants, and other businesses face possible fines up to $500 or the loss of their operating permits. “We believe we are on solid ground,” said Dr. Francisco Garcia, Pima County’s chief medical officer. “Do we believe we are going to be challenged on this? Absolutely. Bring it on.” Garcia said the county had 10 straight weeks of declining COVID-19 cases before an increase last week. “So this is real, and this is concerning. And this is the reason we cannot let up on masking mandates in Pima County,” he said. The reaction to Pima County’s action was swift, with three Republican lawmakers asking the state attorney general to review it to determine if it conflicts with Ducey’s order. Rep. Bret Roberts of Maricopa is seeking an official opinion as to whether the county’s order is enforceable. GOP Sens. Vince Leach of Tucson and Michelle Ugenti-Rita of Scottsdale joined in sending a similar request.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Lawmakers on Tuesday gave final approval to Gov. Asa Hutchinson’s plan to overhaul the state’s Medicaid expansion by encouraging work by recipients rather than requiring it. The House voted 64-34 for the legislation, sending it to the Republican governor’s desk. Under the measure, the program will continue to use Medicaid funds to place recipients on private health insurance. But under the proposal, those who don’t work or attend school could be moved to the traditional fee-for-service Medicaid program. More than 300,000 people are currently on the state’s Medicaid expansion. Hutchinson and GOP lawmakers proposed the overhaul after a work requirement for the expansion was blocked by federal courts and President Joe Biden’s administration. The Biden administration must still approve the changes. The state Department of Health has said it will submit its proposal for the new expansion program by July. The proposal includes other changes, including a home-visiting program for at-risk moms.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: A sheriff announced in January that a man died hours after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine even though his county’s health officials said the declaration was premature and detrimental, The Sacramento Bee reports, citing emails obtained under the state Public Records Act. The announcement by Placer County Sheriff Devon Bell on Facebook quickly spread around the world and was used by anti-vaccine activists to try to discredit COVID-19 vaccinations, according to the newspaper. The man, identified only as a 64-year-old health care worker, died Jan. 21 after receiving the shot in Auburn, northeast of Sacramento in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada. Eventually, it would be determined that the vaccination was coincidental to the death, but at the time the sheriff’s statement on Facebook said the man had received a shot “several hours before their death.” The Bee said its review of county emails shows an intense internal debate about the death, the language of an announcement, how an announcement could feed fears about the vaccine and the intent of the Sheriff’s Office to proceed with an announcement. The sheriff apologized a week later in a statement that said the man’s death was unrelated to the vaccine.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Residents over age 16 will be eligible for COVID-19 vaccines starting Friday, Gov. Jared Polis announced Monday. “We still anticipate by mid-to-late May … everybody who wants the vaccine will have had the vaccine. So it’ll take about six to eight weeks,” Polis said. He said there will be six mass drive-in sites for the state’s eligible population and four mobile bus clinics to distribute vaccines to underserved communities. More than 1 million Colorado residents have been fully vaccinated, and over 1.5 million have received their first doses, Polis said. Despite the expanded eligibility, Polis said vaccine providers have been ordered to prioritize people in higher risk groups. Polis said 16- and 17-year-olds can only receive the Pfizer vaccine, and people over 18 can get the Pfizer, Moderna or Johnson & Johnson vaccines. With the updated distribution, Polis said the state could look forward to a “fairly normal summer” due to widespread immunity from vaccines. Polis also said he would likely extend the statewide mask mandate into mid-April, until the state transitions to county-controlled COVID-19 public health orders. He said the mask mandate would remain in place in public schools for the rest of the school year to avoid scaling back on in-person learning.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Lawmakers granted final legislative approval Tuesday to extending Gov. Ned Lamont’s emergency powers during the coronavirus pandemic to May 20, despite concerns raised by Republicans who argued it’s time for the General Assembly to take back its authority. The Democratic-controlled Senate voted along partisan lines, 24-10, to authorize the Democratic governor to renew the state’s public health and civil preparedness emergency declarations through May 20. They were set to expire April 20. The measure already cleared the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives. “We do not have this pandemic in the rear-view mirror, as of yet. It is still staring us in the face,” said Senate President Pro Tempore Martin Looney, D-New Haven, noting the administration reported more than 3,200 new confirmed or probable cases of COVID-19 over the weekend. Looney credited Lamont with handling his extraordinary executive authority in a “prudent and measured way,” noting that the state Supreme Court on Monday, in elaborating on an earlier decision involving a Milford tavern owner, affirmed the governor has the authority to order closures and partial shutdowns during the pandemic.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Firefly Music Festival has teased a fall return to The Woodlands on Sept.23-26, according to its website. The festival, which was canceled last year due to COVID-19, posted the new date on its website without notice Monday morning. State officials said the Division of Public Health has been in communication with AEG Presents. “Event organizers are aware they will need a formal plan approval from the agency before the event takes place. We will continue to actively work with the organizers to ensure their plan meets all necessary health and safety requirements and the necessary mitigation and safety measures are in place,” public health officials said. State Sen. Trey Paradee, D-Dover, said he’s had many people reach out to him about the Firefly news, including friends, family and constituents. Some were “thrilled,” he said, while others “have expressed to me they’re really concerned about where we will be in terms of the virus.” Paradee is optimistic the festival will be safe if it happens because of President Joe Biden’s progress with vaccinations. Paradee, who hopes previously scheduled 2020 headliner rap-metal band Rage Against the Machine will be on this year’s lineup, said he wants the festival to return because it’s great for the economy.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Ahead of Opening Day on Thursday, restaurants and bars near Nationals Park have been getting ready to welcome back fans before the ballpark opens with limited seating to start the regular season, WUSA-TV reports. Last month, Mayor Muriel Bowser announced that 5,000 fans would be let into the park to watch baseball. While attendance will be notably low due to COVID-19 restrictions, managers at nearby bars voiced excitement Tuesday for the start of the season. “We’re so close you can actually hear the crack of the bat within the ballpark,” said Atlas Brew Works founder Justin Cox. “You can expect there to be a lot more people that are coming down just to watch the game near the ballpark.” Staff set up a socially distanced patio outside and hope to get a projector screen up so fans can watch the games, he said. Mission BBQ Navy Yard owner Fritz Brogan remembers the thousands of fans it saw during the Nationals 2019 World Series run. He said fans in the stands and the foot traffic that brings are great for him and his employees. “I mean, it’s been a tough year for the restaurant industry,” Brogan said. “I think our staff and regulars are really excited about having something to look forward to ... some optimism.”\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Schools and universities that took precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19 would be protected from pandemic-related lawsuits, including parents and students who sue seeking a refund of tuition, under a bill approved by a Senate committee Tuesday. Several universities have been sued after moving to online classes and shutting down campus activities. Students argue they weren’t given the full campus experience. The measure unanimously approved by the Senate Education Committee would prevent those lawsuits and be retroactive to when the public health emergency was declared in March 2020. Sandra Harris, a lobbyist for Nova Southeastern University, said colleges would have been sued no matter how they responded to the pandemic. “The irony is, if we had required students to go to campus to finish their semester, we would have been faced with lawsuits. If we had just suspended educating our students, we would have been faced with lawsuits,” Harris said. “Students are claiming that they were not allowed to get the rich learning experience as provided on a campus.” The bill also would allow parents of students in kindergarten through fifth grade to ask schools to have their children repeat the grade for academic reasons.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state will not grade schools and districts using state test results for the second year in a row, the Georgia Department of Education announced Tuesday, saying federal officials had waived the requirement for the state accountability system. Georgia will not compute its College and Career Ready Performance Index, a numerical system that the governor’s office then uses to assign letter grades to schools and districts. Last year, the state couldn’t produce the index because it didn’t administer its Milestones tests to students in third grade and up. This year, the federal government is requiring Georgia to give the tests, but districts won’t be graded on how students do. “The intent of these accountability waivers is to focus on assessments to provide information to parents, educators, and the public about student performance and to help target resources and supports. This is particularly crucial this year, due to the COVID pandemic,” the Department of Education wrote to Georgia in the letter granting the waiver. State Superintendent Richard Woods has instructed districts that they can’t deny course credit or deny promotion to the next grade to any student who has been attending class virtually and declines to come in person to take a test citing health and safety concerns.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Officials are looking into vaccine passports, especially for inter-island travel. Lt. Gov. Josh Green said the state hopes to work with a local company to create an app that would verify a traveler has been inoculated, KHON-TV reports. Green also said that while the app is being developed, people could simply show their COVID-19 vaccination cards to travel without current testing restrictions. “You would have a company that would do spot checking, and certainly you can check the card itself and make sure that it looks legitimate,” Green said. He said he is not concerned about people trying to falsify records, noting that being caught doing so could mean a fine of up to $5,000, a year in jail or both. Green said people who have been fully vaccinated might be able to travel between islands with fewer restrictions as early as April. Tourism officials are supportive of the idea. “That’s what we see, families that haven’t seen each other for a while that live in Kauai, Maui, Hawaii Island, Oahu. And this will allow that kind of travel to take place without the additional cost of being tested,” said Mufi Hannemann, president and CEO of the Hawaii Lodging and Tourism Association. The decision about vaccine passports will ultimately be made by Gov. David Ige in consultation with island mayors.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: More areas of the state are opening even earlier to additional categories of people wanting to get COVID-19 vaccines. Republican Gov. Brad Little last week opened eligibility to those 16 and older starting April 6. But four of the state’s seven health districts say that category is open as of Wednesday. Central District Health officials in heavily populated southwestern Idaho opened the category Tuesday afternoon, saying health care providers had open appointments and doses available. That category is also open in the Southeastern Idaho Public Health and two health districts in northern Idaho. About 280,000 residents are fully vaccinated, and another 160,000 have received the first dose of vaccines requiring two shots. State health officials have said they are speeding up eligibility because there appears to be reluctance among some residents to get the vaccine and because increasing supplies of vaccine doses are arriving into the state. Health officials have said people who want the vaccine should sign up at coronavirus.idaho.gov. The state website was set up last month to link providers with vaccine doses to people who want them.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: As thousands of people get ready to flock to Wrigley Field on Thursday for the city’s largest mass gathering in more than a year, officials warned that they may again shut the venerated ballpark to fans if the number of COVID-19 cases keeps climbing. The warning from the city’s Office of Emergency Management and Communications also applies to the White Sox’s ballpark, as well as bars, restaurants and other businesses, and comes amid an increase in the number of cases in Chicago and Illinois, particularly among young adults. The Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office announced a few hours later that the county that includes Chicago had recorded its 10,000th COVID-19 death. Just this week, state public health officials announced that the lifting of some restrictions was being delayed because of increasing numbers of COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations since mid-March. Both the Cubs and the White Sox will be allowed to admit as much as 25% capacity. For Wrigley Field, that means a maximum of a little more than 10,000 fans in the stands. Many more are expected to watch the game from nearby bars and restaurants that are routinely crowded with fans during home games. Those establishments are limited to 50% capacity, and customers must wear masks, just like at Wrigley. City officials already have said they are on the lookout for whether bars and restaurants are complying with restrictions.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state Senate voted Monday to approve a proposal that would curb the governor’s authority under the state emergency powers law following months of complaints from conservatives about Gov. Eric Holcomb’s coronavirus-related orders. The bill would establish a new process for the General Assembly to call itself into a 40-day emergency session to consider legislative action in response to a gubernatorial declaration of a statewide emergency. That limits a governor’s authority to impose long-lasting emergency restrictions such as mask rules and business closures. The proposal would additionally give lawmakers more control over federal economic stimulus funds Indiana receives, although the bill does not require legislators to appropriate any of the funds. Senators contended they’ve been shut out of conversations about how to respond to emergency situations and said the legislation wouldn’t impede how the state responds to emergencies but instead would involve lawmakers in decision-making. The Senate Rules Committee dialed back the plan last month, removing provisions from the legislation that would have allowed local units of government to adopt less stringent public safety guidelines than those contained in the governor’s executive orders. A total prohibition on emergency restrictions applying to religious worship was also deleted.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Residents from the state’s racial and ethnic minorities are increasingly willing to accept COVID-19 vaccinations if offered the shots, advocates say. Before the vaccines started arriving in December, experts worried about hesitancy especially among Black Americans, whose history includes inadequate or unethical treatment by health care authorities. But recent state and national polls have shown people’s acceptance of the vaccines varies little by race or ethnicity. A Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll found 27% of white adults and 29% of nonwhite adults don’t plan to be vaccinated. The gap between those demographic groups is far smaller than the partisan gap between Democrats and Republicans: Just 8% of Democrats say they do not plan to be vaccinated but 41% of Republicans. Jacquie Easley McGhee, a longtime African American advocate in Des Moines and health chair for the Iowa/Nebraska NAACP, said she has been gratified to see how many trusted community leaders – religious leaders, familiar health care professionals and other respected figures – have joined the effort to provide accurate COVID-19 information to Iowans of color. “That is the key: They’re trusted messengers,” she said. “They’re not coming in at the 11th hour, trying to bring information to these communities.”\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Republicans in the GOP-controlled state House formally registered their opposition Tuesday to Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s plan for encouraging counties to keep mask mandates in place as a potentially more infectious strain of coronavirus became more widespread in the state. The House voted 84-39 along party lines for a resolution telling legislative leaders to revoke any order from Kelly for a statewide mask policy. Kelly issued such an order in November that was due to expire Wednesday, and she has said she will issue a new order Thursday. A law that took effect last week extends a state of emergency for the pandemic from March 31 until May 28, but it also allows eight top legislative leaders to revoke orders the governor issues during a state of emergency. The new law leaves the final decision about mask mandates and restrictions on businesses and public gatherings to counties. But Kelly’s planned order would require their elected county commissions to take a specific public vote to opt out of a statewide policy requiring people to wear masks in indoor businesses and public spaces. Kelly said in a statement that the resolution is “unnecessary” because counties can opt out her planned order and said Republicans are engaged in “political games.”\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The Libertarian Party of Kentucky compared COVID-19 “vaccine passports” to star-shaped identification badges people of Jewish descent were forced to wear during the Holocaust in a tweet this week, drawing outrage from across the nation. The post Monday compared such credentials, which would show whether a person has received a vaccine and theoretically grant access to businesses and other spaces that will require proof of vaccination before entry, to “the stuff of totalitarian dictatorships” that the party considers a “complete and total violation of human liberty.” “Are the vaccine passports going to be yellow, shaped like a star, and sewn on our clothes?” the party wrote on Twitter. Thousands of responses flowed in, including one from Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt that called the post an “ignorant and shameful comparison” and another from Jewish actor Seth Rogen, who explicitly suggested the party take its message elsewhere. The Kentucky Democratic Party ripped the statement as “unconscionable and unacceptable,” while Republican Party of Kentucky spokesman Mike Lonergan said the commonwealth’s GOP members “will always condemn this kind of hateful and extreme rhetoric.” In a tweet, Gov. Andy Beshear said that “comparing vaccines to the Holocaust is shameful.” Jewish people in Nazi-occupied Europe were forced to wear yellow badges shaped like the Star of David to make them easier to identify and separate from society.\n\nLouisiana\n\nShreveport: The parish’s school district has approved a $1,000, one-time supplement for employees to thank them for their work during a school year filled with challenges due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Caddo Heroes Supplement, estimated to cost $6 million, is made possible through higher-than-estimated sales tax revenues. “Well, almost within a period of days, they had to totally reformat the way they planned,” said Keith Burton, the chief academic officer of Caddo Parish Schools. “The way they pulled resources together, as well as how they delivered instruction – many of them had to incorporate, within days, technology they never used before.” The money will be distributed in June to employees who worked at least 90% of their scheduled workdays during the calendar year, KSLA-TV reports. Employees absent for workshops, trainings or due to COVID-19 would not have those days counted against the eligibility requirements, according to the television station. Caddo Parish is the first school board in Louisiana to approve funds to be dispersed not only to full-time and part-time employees of the district but also to any substitutes who meet the criteria, school officials said.\n\nMaine\n\nRockland: The state’s celebration of all things lobster is a no-go for this summer. The board of the Maine Lobster Festival voted unanimously Tuesday night to cancel the event for a second straight year because of the pandemic. “Because we hold a festival that serves food in tents to tens of thousands of guests, there are not safe ways for us to do this and comply with CDC guidelines,” festival officials said on social media. The event, normally held each August in Rockland, features multiple attractions and serves up tens of thousands of pounds of lobster. Meanwhile, the state is working to get more COVID-19 vaccines into small and independent pharmacies. Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Nirav Shah said nearly a third of residents have received at least their first dose of the vaccine. He said Tuesday that the state is working to “chart a course for independent pharmacies here in Maine” to participate more in the rollout via long-term care facilities and their own storefronts. “For a lot of Maine communities, the independent pharmacies are the most trusted source in town,” Shah said. “We’re working to get them vaccines.” Maine opened eligibility for vaccines to people 50 and older in late March. The state is scheduled to open eligibility to everyone 16 and older April 19.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A bill that would require the Maryland Department of Health to create and implement a two-year plan for COVID-19 recovery by June 1, among other measures, is nearing passage in the General Assembly. Central to the measure, with a price tag of at least $152.5 million in federal funds, is a framework that would require the state agency to collaborate with local health departments to organize efforts to “monitor, prevent, and mitigate the spread of COVID-19,” the fiscal note says. Included in the guidelines the bill lays out for state and local health departments are requirements to set precise targets for the number of coronavirus tests to administer each month, creating methods for addressing responses that have fallen short, and a requirement to bill health insurance, when applicable, for all virus tests. The bill also prioritizes the assessment and improvement of contact tracing. Through the proposed Maryland Public Health Jobs Corps, local health departments would recruit unemployed or displaced workers to serve in different roles that aid in the COVID-19 response. When their duties are complete, the workers would transition to more permanent roles that target “post-pandemic population health needs of underserved communities and vulnerable populations.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: U.S. Rep. Stephen Lynch is urging government agencies, schools and businesses to use their federal COVID-19 relief funding to buy medical protective equipment made in the U.S. rather than China. “We’ve got China hacking federal agencies, hacking our military and hacking our domestic companies; we’ve had theft of intellectual property,” the Massachusetts Democrat said Tuesday. “We shouldn’t put our future and our safety in the hands of a government that’s been hostile to the interests of the United States.” President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan provides billions of dollars for the purchase of masks, gloves, gowns and other equipment needed to help protect people against COVID-19. There are plenty of companies in Massachusetts and across the nation manufacturing such equipment, Lynch said after a tour of the Hynes Convention Center mass vaccination site in Boston. “We’re asking all those given money to purchase PPE in the U.S.,” he said. “Support that market that we’re trying to create here in the U.S. There are companies all over the U.S. that are trying to provide product for the protection of U.S. citizens, but that can’t happen if we continue to buy product from China.”\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Wednesday doubled the state’s daily COVID-19 vaccination goal to 100,000 shots. She cited continuous week-over-week increases in vaccine allotments the state is receiving and an expanded number of providers who can administer doses. She called vaccinations safe, effective and essential to getting the country back to normal. “These new, higher vaccine targets are a testament to what we can do together, and we need to meet them so we can keep rebuilding our economy,” the Democratic governor said in a statement. Michigan is facing a third surge in cases. It had the nation’s second-highest infection rate over the past two weeks. Rates in the Thumb region’s counties – Huron, St. Clair and Sanilac – ranked fourth, fifth and eighth highest in the U.S. Daily deaths are also rising, though they are still well below the peaks of last April and December. Whitmer loosened some restrictions meant to slow the spread of the virus after cases and hospitalizations dropped and amid a constant stream of Republican criticism. During a CNN appearance, she again appeared reluctant to tighten them a third time. “We’re continuing to have robust conversations,” she said. “There’s a lot of push and pull. What we need to do is double down on our masking and get more people vaccinated.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Gov. Tim Walz and former Gov. Tim Pawlenty each received a COVID-19 shot in a bipartisan display aimed at boosting acceptance of the vaccine as eligibility opened up to all Minnesotans 16 and older Tuesday. The Democratic governor and former Republican governor both received doses of the single-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine Tuesday, when the state expanded its eligibility guidelines after a projected increase in its weekly allotment of doses from the federal government. Minnesota eclipsed the milestone of 1 million residents fully vaccinated Tuesday, and more than 1.6 million have received at least one dose. Over the weekend, the state reported its two highest days on record for the number of vaccines administered, and health officials counted over 70,000 people who received a shot in the two days. Walz and Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm said the state will be ramping up outreach efforts to expand access to the vaccine to underserved communities and combat potential vaccine hesitancy across the state. Pawlenty speculated that hesitancy from conservatives may come from a skepticism of the government and government programs but urged that “these vaccines are safe and incredibly helpful, and everyone should get them.”\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Health officials are recommending that churches and other religious organizations continue to hold off on hosting indoor worship services during the coronavirus pandemic, even after Gov. Tate Reeves relaxed regulations on other kinds of social gatherings. “To prevent the spread of COVID-19 and to protect the vulnerable, the safest options continue to be virtual or outdoor services,” the state Health Department said in a news release this week detailing new guidelines for faith-based gatherings and worship. Last month, Reeves, a Republican, rolled back mask mandates on the state level and all capacity regulations for restaurants. As for worship services, health officials say they recommend everyone 65 and older or 16 or older with high-risk medical conditions be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 before attending indoor services. All congregants should wear a face mask at all times during in-person services and Sunday school classes and maintain 6 feet of separation from people who don’t live in the same house as them. People should not gather in close groups while entering or exiting the building and should use hand sanitizer. Singing at services is “a high-risk activity that can quickly spread viral particles,” officials said.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A federal lawsuit seeks a return of the 1% earnings tax paid by people who normally work in the city but instead worked from their suburban homes during the pandemic. The lawsuit filed Monday on behalf of three suburban St. Louis residents seeks class-action status, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. If successful, the lawsuit could cost the city millions of dollars. The plaintiffs’ attorney, Bevis Schock, said last year that he planned to file a class-action lawsuit after St. Louis Collector of Revenue Gregory F.X. Daily issued a policy barring city earnings tax refunds for employees working outside city limits. Thousands of people, particularly white-collar office workers, who are employed at businesses in St. Louis but live outside the city have worked from home since March 2020 to slow the spread of the coronavirus.“The way we view it, you and your company have agreed (to have you) work at home. You’re still utilizing all the computer software that your company provides” from its base in the city, Daly told the Post-Dispatch in June. More than one-third of the city’s general revenue comes from the tax, or about $180 million last year. A city spokesman declined to comment.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: The Lake County-Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes Unified Command Center is hosting two vaccine clinics open to all Lake County and Flathead Reservation residents 16 or older. The clinics, to be held April 10 and April 17 at the Salish Kootenai College Joe McDonald Gymnasium in Pablo, run from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., according to a news release. Appointments are required, with sign-up available at mtreadyclinic.org or 406-745-3525. The Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, which offered COVID-19 vaccines to Lake County teachers a month before they were eligible in Montana, are among many tribes offering vaccines to non-Natives. The Blackfeet Nation is offering vaccines to all Glacier National Park staff and hosted a “street corner clinic” where it vaccinated 103 people. The Indian Family Health Clinic, an Indian Health Service-funded facility, has vaccinated more than 80 non-Native Great Falls educators. Relying on a centralized health care system, personal outreach methods and incentives, Native American tribes’ vaccination efforts have been a huge success. The Blackfeet Nation has vaccinated about 95% of its eligible population on the reservation, and 70% of adults on the Crow Reservation have received at least one dose.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Two health care companies have agreed to settle with the state attorney general’s office on charges of misleading advertising, marketing, distribution and sales of coronavirus antibody testing. Attorney General Doug Peterson alleged in a July complaint that Pivot Concierge Health and Banyan Medical Systems violated Nebraska’s consumer protection law and a federal deceptive trade practices law, according to the Omaha World-Herald. Under a settlement signed last week, both companies must disclose the risks and limitations of coronavirus testing products and comply with the law. Pivot Concierge Health must also pay $25,000 to the state. State attorneys alleged that both companies advertised and sold coronavirus infection and antibody tests from at least March 19 to April 29, 2020, at an Omaha drive-thru clinic.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The world’s two biggest casino companies are bringing vaccines to their Las Vegas Strip employees, with inoculation clinics at the Mandalay Bay resort convention center and the Rio All-Suites Hotel. Easing COVID-19 vaccine availability for thousands of hotel and hospitality workers in the tourism-dependent city comes with the University of Nevada, Las Vegas setting a July 1 date to return to in-person activities and city workers fanning out following the lifting of sports restrictions to reinstall basketball hoops at city parks. MGM Resorts International said Tuesday that it saw vaccinations as “a critically important tool in helping to end the pandemic and accelerate our community’s economic recovery.” Caesars Entertainment Inc. said it will start offering shots Thursday at the Rio for all company workers, with a goal of 10,000 vaccinations in April. It will partner with Albertsons supermarkets to administer up to 2,000 doses per day by appointment only. MGM Resorts – the largest employer in Nevada, with nine major resorts on the Las Vegas Strip – had more than 50,000 workers before closures began in March 2020 to stem the spread of the coronavirus. The company laid off about 1 in 4 of its 70,000 employees nationwide, and not all have returned to work.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Out-of-state college students may not be out of luck, after all, when it comes to getting a COVID-19 vaccine. Gov. Chris Sununu said last week that only New Hampshire residents would be eligible when eligibility expands Friday to include anyone age 16 and over, and out-of-state college students should return to their home states to get vaccinated. But the head of a nonprofit consortium that includes 21 public and private campuses said Wednesday that it is working to change that. Michele Perkins, chair of the council and president of New England College, said colleges recognized the need to prioritize residents, but as the vaccine process unfolds ahead of the original schedule, they are hopeful the state will offer shots to all students who want them. The announcement came hours after Democratic lawmakers and college students held a news conference to object to the governor’s decision. “Vaccinating the student population would save lives and livelihoods,” said Hannah Dunleavy, a student at Dartmouth College. “Clearly, students at Dartmouth are contracting COVID-19 at high rates, and we risk spreading the virus to people in the town of Hanover if we don’t vaccinate students. The virus doesn’t care if we live in New Hampshire nine months out of the year or all year round.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: As the state races to vaccinate its adult population faster than coronavirus variants spread, state statisticians predict that even in their best-case scenario, this summer New Jersey will see thousands more new cases each day compared to last summer. In the more dire predictions under Department of Health models Gov. Phil Murphy presented Wednesday, the state could see a record high of infections, depending on how effectively vaccines work against variant strains, whether New Jerseyans follow public health measures and how quickly they get vaccinated. “These are models, not certainties,” Murphy said. “We can change them with our behavior. It really is that simple.” In the worst-case scenario, the number of people who test positive for the virus each day peaks in mid-May and starts a steady but slow decline. If New Jerseyans don’t follow public health guidelines as strictly during Memorial Day, if variants spread and vaccines only protect against 65% of variant cases, and if 70% of adults are vaccinated by June 15, the peak could produce the highest number of daily cases New Jersey has ever reported. In a moderate-case future, the Garden State could see a lower peak of cases a month earlier, in mid-April.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Organizers are planning for the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta’s return this year, and spectators will likely be allowed, with ticket sales for the annual fall event expected to begin in July. The fiesta’s early morning mass ascensions, fireworks shows and launches of special-shaped hot air balloons attract hundreds of thousands of spectators from around the globe and hundreds of balloon pilots and their crews. Last year’s event wasn’t held because of the coronavirus pandemic. Fiesta spokesman Tom Garrity said Tuesday that the board of directors is committed to following the state’s public health mandates and will have updates on the status of the event each month. The board also plans to identify health measures for pilots and guests by the time tickets go on sale. New Mexico has had some of the nation’s most restrictive rules in place to curb the spread of COVID-19. Despite criticism, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and state health officials have argued that the rules were necessary because of the lack of access to health care in the state and the high numbers of people with existing health conditions that put them at greater risk. Some of the restrictions have been relaxed in recent weeks as more counties have met the state’s benchmarks. But the mask mandate remains in place statewide.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: America’s top dogs won’t have their pack of fans on hand at this year’s Westminster Kennel Club dog show. The club announced Monday that spectators and vendors won’t be allowed because of coronavirus limitations. No tickets will be sold. It’s the latest in a series of pandemic shake-ups to the nation’s most prestigious canine competition. It’s been moved from its longtime February date to June 12-13 and from New York City’s Hudson River piers and Madison Square Garden to an outdoor setting at a riverfront estate in suburban Tarrytown, north of Manhattan. It will be the first time in over a century that Westminster’s coveted best in show prize won’t be awarded at Madison Square Garden, where thousands of dog lovers usually cheer on their favorite breeds and contestants. The 2020 show was held in mid-February, about a month before virus shutdowns began. The show usually also offers spectators a chance to interact with dogs and breeders when they’re out of the ring, a highlight for many showgoers. This time, fans can watch the final rounds from afar on Fox channels. Preliminary rounds – including the agility competition’s early stages June 11 – and an obedience competition will be streamed on Westminster’s website. The club says it’s planning to return the show to New York City next year.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Gov. Roy Cooper on Tuesday announced a three-month extension of the statewide eviction moratorium that had been set to expire at the end of March. The updated executive order came a day after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention directed states to extend protections through June 30. The CDC order applies to all standard rental housing but doesn’t cover those living in hotels, motels or other temporary guest home rentals, nor individuals making more than $99,000 a year. Cooper signed two other orders Tuesday. One directive extends to-go alcohol sales by a month until 5 p.m. April 30, while the other expedites unemployment insurance claim processing. “Even though North Carolina is turning the corner on this pandemic, many are still struggling,” Cooper said in a statement. “These executive orders will help families stay in their homes and help hard-hit businesses increase their revenue.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State officials on Monday announced a new food assistance program for families whose children have been eligible for free or reduced-price school meals during the current school year. The Pandemic Electronic Benefits Transfer program provides EBT cards to eligible families to buy food. They will receive benefits for days that students in the household are learning at home, rather than in a school building. Families do not need to apply for the benefit. Schools are gathering information about which students qualify. Eligible households will receive letters to notify them about the P-EBT benefit, and they will be mailed EBT cards in the coming weeks. The benefit will equal $6.82 for each day a student has been learning through distance instruction. The amount is the current daily federal reimbursement that schools receive per student for providing a free breakfast, lunch and after-school snack.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The lieutenant governor dug in his heels Wednesday on a tweet in which he referred to the coronavirus as the “Wuhan virus,” even as advocates warn such rhetoric is a driving force behind violence against Asian Americans. Republican Lt. Gov. Jon Husted’s tweet Friday marked the second time in a week that Democratic state Sen. Tina Maharath, the first Asian American woman elected to the Ohio General Assembly, heard an elected official call the virus that first emerged in Wuhan, China, the “Wuhan virus,” she said. Maharath said Husted and others are following the lead of former President Donald Trump, who sometimes used overtly racist terms to refer to the virus. “When you say those things, such as attach locations or ethnicities to the disease, it creates racial profiling, and then it turns into xenophobic behavior,” Maharath said. “And when leaders with that kind of power repeat those terms in confidence and double down on it, it leads to more hate crimes.” His intention with the tweet, Husted said in an interview with the Associated Press, was to criticize the Chinese government. “I was just pointing out that this is an international crisis, in my opinion, that the Chinese government is responsible for, and I wanted an independent investigation,” he said. The World Health Organization on Tuesday said it was “extremely unlikely” that the virus emerged accidentally from a Chinese laboratory and was likely spread from animals to humans.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The City Council voted Tuesday to delay for two weeks a vote on whether to lift a mask mandate imposed to curb the spread of the coronavirus. The mandate, which requires face coverings to be worn in buildings open to the public, was established in July and is set to expire April 30. Two council members have proposed ending the mandate early, despite recommendations from city health officials that it remain in place. “Masks have worked throughout the pandemic and are still working,” Dr. Patrick McGough, executive director of the Oklahoma City-County Health Department, and Dr. Gary Raskob, chair of the City-County Board of Health, wrote in a letter Tuesday to Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt. “Getting back to normal is a two-part process, with vaccines and masks working hand-in-hand to keep case counts, hospitalizations, and deaths down, and prevent variant strains of COVID-19 from gaining traction in our community.” State health officials are working to quickly roll out COVID-19 vaccines and on Monday opened up eligibility for all residents 16 and older, but less than one-third of people in the state have received a first dose of the vaccine, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The state House of Representatives returned to action Tuesday after a week of canceled floor sessions due to multiple confirmed COVID-19 cases within the Capitol. Lawmakers began using a computer program to automatically read hundreds of pages of proposed bills after Republicans refused to suspend the full reading of bills before a final vote – a tactic that could add hours to the passage of even simple legislation. The slowdown has been used by the minority Republican Party as frustrations about the priorities of the 2021 session increase. The refusal to back down led to a chilly reaction from Democrats, who called the GOP’s actions “reckless and pointless,” and the coronavirus cases further raised tensions in the Capitol. “They’re also putting the health of all legislators, staff and their families at risk as we’re still fighting a global pandemic,” Democratic Rep. Rachel Prusak, tweeted Tuesday. In an attempt to decrease the COVID-19 risk, lawmakers are working in their Capitol offices as the bills are read and will return to the floor for discussions and voting.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Every adult in the state will qualify for a COVID-19 vaccine starting April 19, and emergency responders, grocery workers and people in other high-risk groups are able to schedule their shots immediately, Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration announced Wednesday in a dramatic expansion of the statewide rollout. Acting Health Secretary Alison Beam said the new timeline is possible because Pennsylvania’s vaccine supply is growing and getting more predictable, and providers across the state report they are ready for a fresh influx of people seeking protection against the coronavirus. The state is racing to vaccinate its population while it contends with a spring surge in coronavirus infections. Pennsylvania is averaging more than 4,000 cases per day – up 60% in two weeks – and hospitals are caring for hundreds more seriously ill patients than they were just 10 days ago. “Our numbers are really, really rising very quickly,” said Val Arkoosh, who chairs the Montgomery County Board of Commissioners. “I’m very concerned about the direction that this pandemic is going.” Despite rising case counts and hospitalizations, Beam said the state is forging ahead with its plan to ease pandemic restrictions on bar seating, restaurant capacity, and indoor and outdoor events starting Sunday.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Gov. Daniel McKee on Wednesday nominated Providence City Council President Sabina Matos as his lieutenant governor. If confirmed by the state Senate, she will be the first person of color in state history to hold the job. About 80 people initially applied for the job, but the Democratic governor said at a news conference that Matos shares his vision. “In selecting a lieutenant governor, I was looking or someone to be a true governing partner,” he said. “Someone who shares my commitment to supporting our 39 cities and towns and our small businesses, and that’s exactly what I found in Sabina. I know that Sabina Matos will help our administration serve all Rhode Islanders as we recover and rebuild from this pandemic.” He noted that she, like him – a former town councilor and mayor in his hometown of Cumberland – rose through the ranks of local politics. Matos, 47, was first elected to the Providence City Council in 2010 and voted president in 2019. Matos said her priorities will be continuing the state’s COVID-19 vaccination efforts, getting the state back to work and children up to speed in the classroom after the pandemic, and addressing what she called the “affordable housing crisis.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Lawmakers are considering a proposal to prevent employers from mandating COVID-19 vaccines for workers. The resolution passed by the state Senate Medical Affairs committee Wednesday says that employers can’t punish or fire their workers for refusing to get the shots. The proposal makes some exceptions for hospitals and other employers working with populations who are especially vulnerable to the coronavirus. Employers could still require quarantines for workers exposed to the virus and provide incentives for employees to get the vaccine. The proposal now heads to the full Senate for a vote. Senators already passed a separate bill that would prevent lawsuits against businesses and other groups by people who contract COVID-19 as long as federal and state health guidelines were being followed.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Anyone over 16 will be eligible for a COVID-19 vaccination starting Monday. Gov. Kristi Noem’s announcement Wednesday followed an uptick in cases statewide. Over the past two weeks, the rolling average number of daily new cases has increased by 34%, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers. But state health officials also reported that 43% of residents have received at least one dose of a vaccine, and about 65% of those people have completed vaccination, which requires two shots in most cases. More than 400,000 South Dakotans will have access to vaccines with the broadening of eligibility next week. Shots will be made available for free through health care providers and at pharmacies statewide. “There will not be the heavy hand of government mandating that you get the vaccine,” Noem said in a video announcement. “Instead, we will do what we always do. We’ll trust our people to do the right thing.” No states have mandated that the general public get a vaccine. The Republican governor credited former President Donald Trump for initiating a vaccine development program, saying Democratic President Joe Biden is “yielding the fruits” of those efforts.\n\nTennessee\n\nManchester: After canceling its 2020 event due to the pandemic, the Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival has revealed its 2021 lineup, filled with familiar names and a few big surprises. Foo Fighters, Lizzo, Tyler the Creator, Tame Impala, Megan Thee Stallion and Lana Del Rey top the bill at this year’s festival, slated for Sept. 2-5 in Manchester. Other big acts include Lil Baby, Run the Jewels, Janelle Monae, Phoebe Bridgers, Julien Baker, deadmau5, G-Eazy, Jack Harlow, Jason Isbell & The 400 Unit and Brittany Howard. Tickets went on sale Wednesday at bonnaroo.com/tickets. Many of the acts on this year’s lineup were originally slated to perform at the canceled 2020 Bonnaroo. This year will mark the first time Bonnaroo hasn’t taken place in June. Bonnaroo said in a press release that organizers “always will be in regular communication with local health and public safety officials and will continue to abide by relevant recommendations.” Gov. Bill Lee also said in a statement: “It’s exciting to see Tennessee stages come back to life in time to celebrate the 20th anniversary of this internationally acclaimed festival. Fans are ready to gather together and celebrate their shared love of music once again. We welcome them back for a full Bonnaroo and what is sure to be a truly unforgettable event!”\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The state opened vaccine eligibility to all adults this week, joining a rapid national expansion as state health officials continue monitoring whether spring break will change a downward trend in coronavirus cases. Texas is receiving more than 1 million new doses of COVID-19 vaccines this week, and shipments are expected to increase in April, said Imelda Garcia, head of the state’s expert vaccine allocation panel. Vaccination rates in Texas have lagged much of the nation. Although officials put some blame on data reporting delays, they acknowledged some appointment slots are going unfilled. “We have heard from some of our providers that demand has definitely decreased over the past couple of weeks,” said Garcia, adding that some unused doses are being transferred to other providers. Texas has administered more than 10 million vaccine doses. Garcia said it’s still too early to tell how spring break affects Texas COVID-19 cases. However, officials are pleased with recent trends, she said. Texas’ seven-day rolling average of new cases did not increase over the past two weeks, going from roughly 4,500 new cases per day March 13 to about 4,000 on Saturday.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Utah Jazz player Donovan Mitchell will give the keynote address for the University of Utah’s 2021 commencement, the school announced Tuesday. The campuswide commencement will take place virtually May 6. In-person college convocations will be held May 5-8. The university said in a statement that Mitchell “is known as a team player and community builder who is passionate about education and social justice.” University President Ruth Watkins said in a statement that Mitchell “shows by example what one person can do to influence the lives of countless others and how to step forward to advocate for change with grace and goodwill.” Mitchell was awarded the offseason NBA Cares Community Assist Award in January for his commitment to advancing social justice and educational access for students of color. Ephraim Kum, president of the university’s student association, said he is “incredibly excited for students to hear from Donovan Mitchell. He has long been one of my favorite players, not just because of his abilities as an athlete, but also for his inspiring leadership, his genuine commitment to our community and his willingness to speak up on social justice issues.”\n\nVermont\n\nNewport: Recent testing at a prison in the city returned no positive results for the coronavirus in inmates or staffers – the first time results were all negative since an outbreak started at the facility in late February, the Vermont Department of Corrections said Wednesday. “We will continue to test the facility and monitor the situation closely, we aren’t in the clear yet, but today is encouraging,” Corrections Commissioner Jim Baker said in a statement of the results from testing Monday. The Northern State Correctional Facility currently has two cases among inmates and three staff cases, the department said. A total of 177 people have been medically cleared to leave isolation, it said. Staffers and inmates will be tested again Thursday.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The Richmond and Henrico health districts have scheduled the first round of Phase 1c-eligible residents for COVID-19 vaccine events. The health districts said in a news release Wednesday that up to 7,500 Phase 1c eligible individuals will receive an email that will allow them so schedule an appointment. Vaccinations for people eligible in Phases 1a and 1b will still be available. The groups of people in Phase 1c are considered essential to the functioning of society or are at higher risk of exposure. They include people who work in fields such as energy, wastewater, construction and food service. Those who work in higher education, transportation and legal services are also eligible. The state began inoculating health care personnel and people living in long-term care facilities in December. It then expanded to people over the age of 65, people with underlying health conditions and some front-line workers who are considered essential. Anyone over age 16 who lives or works in Virginia is expected to be eligible for the vaccine by May 1.\n\nWashington\n\nYakima: Just in time for the asparagus harvest that will employ large numbers of farm workers, the federal government has opened a mass COVID-19 vaccination center in the center of the state’s agricultural region. Washington’s first federal mass vaccination center, at the Central Washington State Fair Park in Yakima, opened Wednesday and will administer close to 1,200 doses per day, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which operates the site along with state and local officials. Vaccine will come to the site directly from the federal government rather than from the state’s weekly allocation. The additional doses will help vaccinate more Washingtonians, including those in rural and agricultural communities that have been particularly affected by the pandemic. COVID-19 has hit Yakima County hard, with high infection and hospitalization rates compared to the rest of Washington. People from racial and ethnic minority groups have accounted for approximately 50% of the county’s coronavirus cases. “We are so appreciative to FEMA and our other federal partners for working with the state to make significant additional resources available to the people of the Yakima Valley,” Gov. Jay Inslee said in a statement. FEMA officials said the center will operate for eight weeks.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice announced 34 previously unreported coronavirus deaths Wednesday. Justice for the first time pinned blame on the Department of Health and Human Resources for a data issue that has led to the late disclosure of more than 200 deaths so far. “Once we got into this situation, our people at DHHR should’ve recognized this issue and moved. They didn’t move, and I’m not happy about that,” the Republican governor said. “I can’t tell you that it is completely over yet, but I surely hope and pray that this is the last” of unreported deaths. Justice said he has ordered the department to implement “a new electronic death reporting system.” Dr. Ayne Amjad, the state health officer, said the new system would be in place “as soon as possible,” but officials are searching for a vendor for the program. Justice and Amjad have previously said batches of unreported deaths, including 165 last month, were a result of hospitals and nursing homes not reporting the fatalities in a timely manner to the state. But Justice was less certain this time. “I don’t really know if it has come from a nursing home or a hospital or within DHHR; I don’t know,” Justice said about the deaths. “But I know they’re just getting to us.” The governor said an internal review didn’t find any purposeful intent to cover up data.\n\nWisconsin\n\nGreen Bay: Dozens of high schools are playing football this spring after opting out of the fall season because of the pandemic. According to the Wisconsin Interscholastic Athletic Association, about 250 high schools played football last fall, but more than 100 are playing this spring, including about 50 games this past weekend. The association’s deputy director, Wade Labecki, said teams will play seven games during the alternate spring season. There’s no postseason because football is set to start again in the fall, Wisconsin Public Radio reports. At Notre Dame Academy in Green Bay, head coach Mike Rader said there are some logistical challenges with playing in the spring. His football squad will have to start sharing its turf with the soccer and lacrosse teams. Rader said athletics has been a helpful outlet after a hard year. “As we started to open things back up a little bit, and we would have kids throwing footballs around to each other and stuff like that, in a lot of cases the high school kids kind of looked like grade school kids because they were just happy to be out there,” he said. Swimming and volleyball are also underway. And safety is the top priority, Labecki said. Wisconsin is in a better place now than in the fall, officials said. Still, Notre Dame is taking precautions including weekly virus testing, Rader said.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The governor is rejecting a call by President Joe Biden for states to reimpose mask orders in response to the coronavirus. Gov. Mark Gordon lifted a statewide mask mandate March 16 that had been in effect since December. Several other Republican governors have done the same. Gordon has no plans to reimpose Wyoming’s mandate but urges people to take personal responsibility to keep communities safe, spokesman Michael Pearlman said Tuesday. Biden and the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday that this is no time to relax safety measures. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky told governors in a call Tuesday that a growing rate of COVID-19 infections nationwide is concerning. New cases in Wyoming have fallen off sharply since December. They’re down to the level recorded last September – about 50 new cases per day, down from a peak of over 600 daily cases. Almost 700 people in the state have died of COVID-19 over the past year, according to the Wyoming Department of Health.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/04/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/11/19/sports-paused-sorority-party-canceled-curfews-eyed-news-around-states/114981446/", "title": "Sports paused, sorority party canceled: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTuscaloosa: A University of Alabama sorority canceled plans for a city-approved party for as many as 600 people following complaints that the huge outdoor bash could spread the new coronavirus as the pandemic worsens nationwide. The Kappa Delta sorority called off its “Farm Party” on Tuesday, hours before the six-hour event was scheduled to begin at a 14-acre site with buses ferrying students to the gathering. The cancellation came after days of complaints and soon after The Daily Beast published a story about the gathering. More than 2,000 new cases of the coronavirus have been added daily over the past week across Alabama as hospitals treat more and more people suffering from COVID-19. Despite the increase, the Tuscaloosa City Council voted 4-2 on Nov. 10 to approve a license that would have allowed for alcohol to be served at the party. Partygoers would be expected to comply with health requirements including masks, and precautions including social distancing recommendations, temperature checks and frequent cleaning would be employed, organizers said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development reported the state has lost more than 3,000 jobs in the oil and gas industry since January because of the coronavirus pandemic and falling prices. Experts said because oil prices are now stagnant, it’s not clear when the jobs may return, Alaska Public Media reports. The demand for oil plummeted in the spring as the virus shut down cities. That was coupled with a price war leading to a surplus of oil on the global market. A key benchmark for oil prices then fell into negative territory for the first time. Labor department data shows there were an estimated 6,900 jobs in Alaska’s oil and gas industry in September, down from 10,000 in January. Job numbers haven’t been so low in more than 30 years, Alaska Public Media reports.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state’s COVID-19 cases are continuing to rise with over 3,000 newly confirmed cases and more than 50 additional deaths. The state Department of Health Services on Wednesday tallied 3,206 new cases and 53 more deaths. Arizona now has seen a case total of 283,102 and a death toll of 6,365. According to the state’s COVID-19 dashboard, the number of hospitalizations is now on par to where it was in June with 1,700 patients. Those include nearly 400 people in intensive care unit beds. The state had approximately 3,500 hospitalizations on a daily basis in mid-July during the peak of last summer’s surge but fewer than 500 some days in late September before the latest rise started. Health officials have said the state’s recent surge is tied to factors including businesses and schools reopening and public fatigue with precautions such as mask-wearing.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state’s top health official and a White House task force on Tuesday warned the state is on the verge of a rapid rise in coronavirus cases, while Gov. Asa Hutchinson rejected the panel’s call to significantly scale back restaurants’ indoor capacity in most of the state. An outbreak among state lawmakers also continued to grow to 12, with a state representative testing positive for the virus. Dr. Jose Romero, the state’s health secretary, issued dire warnings about the state, where COVID-19 hospitalizations continued surging to record-high numbers. “This is like a boulder rolling down a hill. There will come a time where we cannot stop it,” Romero said. “It will continue to escalate and will eventually overwhelm our health care facilities.” Romero’s comments echoed a report from the White House Coronavirus Task Force, which said the state “is on the precipice of a rapid, accelerating increase in cases which will be followed with new hospital admissions.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Los Angeles County imposed new restrictions on businesses Tuesday and is readying plans for a mandatory curfew for all but essential workers if coronavirus cases keep spiking. The county of 10 million residents – the nation’s most populous – has seen daily confirmed cases more than double in the past two weeks to nearly 2,900. Hospitalizations have topped 1,100, a rise of 30% in that period. The county, which for most of the pandemic has had a disproportionately large share of California’s cases, issued new restrictions ordering nonessential retail businesses to limit indoor capacity to 25% and restaurants to 50% capacity outdoors. Restaurants already are not allowed to serve customers indoors. All those businesses must close at 10 p.m. The changes take effect Friday. Additionally, services at salons and other personal care businesses may only be provided by appointment and customers, and staff must wear face coverings. Services such as facials that require customers to remove their face coverings are not permitted. All gatherings must be outdoors and limited to 15 people from no more than three households.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Gov. Jared Polis on Tuesday called a special legislative session to craft a $220 million COVID-19 stimulus package to aid bars, restaurants, tenants, landlords and students. The proposed package includes sales tax relief for restaurants and bars hit hard by capacity limits, funds for child care providers, rental assistance for tenants and landlords, and internet access expansion for students and teachers, Polis said. He cited inaction in Washington on a new coronavirus relief package as one reason for the session. As the state experiences “exponential growth” in new coronavirus cases, with more than 1,300 patients hospitalized, officials are avoiding a full lockdown order, Polis said. Instead, he said, between 10 and 15 counties, including Denver, will enter a “red phase” in the coming days, which means indoor dining and bars will close, and gyms will be limited to 10% capacity. The state has also added a “purple phase” to its COVID-19 dial, which takes into account new cases, positivity rates for testing and hospital capacity. The purple level indicates a county has reached or exceeded its hospital capacity, affecting the quality of care for all hospital patients. None of Colorado’s 64 counties have reached this threshold, but Polis said hospitals are “starting to get stressed.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The commissioner of the state’s Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services has tested positive for the coronavirus. Commissioner Miriam Delphin-Rittmon said in a statement that her symptoms are mild, and she is isolating at home. “I have had limited face-to-face contact with co-workers due to teleworking and I have been in daily contact with the team at DMHAS,” she said in a Tuesday night release. “I am grateful my colleagues in the office have not been exposed.” Delphin-Rittmon is among 160 employees at the department to come down with COVID-19 since March. That is in addition to 87 people living in eight facilities run by the department. There have been 136 cases at Connecticut Valley Hospital, the state-run psychiatric hospital in Middletown. That includes 69 staff members who have tested positive and 67 patients living at the facility. Gov. Ned Lamont remained in quarantine at home Wednesday after his communications director, Max Reiss, tested positive for the virus last week.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The state will soon limit indoor gatherings to 10 people and indoor dining at restaurants to no more than 30% capacity. Gov. John Carney announced the latest round of restrictions Tuesday in response to a recent surge in COVID-19 cases. The new rules go into effect at 8 a.m. Monday. The state is also restricting event venues, including weddings, places of worship, performances, political meetings and funerals. Starting Monday, those venues won’t be allowed to host indoor gatherings at more than 30% capacity. At restaurants, which will still be allowed to have outdoor seating, diners indoors will be required to wear masks until the food is served and whenever servers approach the table. Outdoor gatherings will also be limited to 50 people, though up to 250 people are allowed if it’s preapproved by the Delaware Division of Public Health. Starting two weeks from now, interstate youth sports will also be banned.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: With Moderna releasing positive preliminary results of its COVID-19 vaccine’s efficacy, D.C. Councilmember Mary Cheh shared Tuesday that she is participating in the clinical trial through the National Institutes of Health, WUSA-TV reports. Cheh said participants are not told whether they received the placebo or vaccine. However, she and a friend in the trial have experienced symptoms after both injections. “We both had aches and pains, joint pain, muscle pain, headache, great fatigue ... whoa, it was something,” Cheh said. She said the effects dissipated after about 36 hours. “I’m taking it not just for myself. It’s for others,” she said. “This is something we have to do collectively to defeat this thing.” A self-described “scaredy-cat,” the councilmember said she was nervous at first to sign up for the clinical trial. But she thought taking the vaccine trial was one small way she could help. “I wanted to be part of something to help us get out of this mess which we’re in,” Cheh said. “And, fingers crossed, I hope we can do that sooner than later.”\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: State health officials have reported a steady increase in the number of new coronavirus cases each day over the past month and a half, though the numbers are nowhere near the peak in July. A seven-day average of nearly 6,300 new COVID-19 cases was reported Tuesday, according to Florida Department of Health statistics. That’s up from early October, when the seven-day average for new cases was about 2,200. In mid-July, the state reported a seven-day average of nearly 11,700 new cases. A total of 897,323 people have contracted the virus in Florida, according to state records. The state also tallied another 86 deaths Tuesday. Since the start of the pandemic, 17,861 people in Florida have died from the virus. The number of patients being treated for COVID-19 in Florida hospitals has also risen in recent weeks. The state’s online census of hospitals showed numbers hovering between 2,000 and 2,200 for most of last month, but on Tuesday, there were 3,369 coronavirus patients in hospitals.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state’s current COVID-19 situation only looks good when compared to other states where coronavirus infections are climbing even more steeply. Georgia passed 9,000 confirmed and probable deaths with new deaths reported Tuesday, with the average number of deaths recorded rising in recent weeks. The number of people hospitalized with the respiratory illness has risen more than 40% in the past five weeks. The state ranks 47th among the states for new cases per capita in the past 14 days. But the numbers of new infections, hospitalizations and deaths are all climbing significantly in Georgia. That’s especially true once positive results from rapid antigen tests are included in the state’s case totals, as advised by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The state now has 430,000 cases when those confirmed through molecular tests and those suspected by antigen tests are combined.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: An island mayor is asking Gov. David Ige to consider new rules that would make a second coronavirus test mandatory for all arriving travelers to Kauai and require that everyone has an initial negative test before flying. Kauai Mayor Derek Kawakami made a similar request in October when the state launched its pre-travel testing program that allows travelers to skip two weeks of quarantine if they get a single negative test within 72 hours of their trip to Hawaii. Now Kawakami wants to mandate that all air travelers get a second test three days after they arrive. They would have to remain in quarantine on Kauai during that time. Ige denied Kawakami’s first request for mandatory second tests in October. The governor’s office said the governor was reviewing the new request Tuesday and had no further comment.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Doctors serving Idaho and eastern Oregon spent hours Tuesday trying to sway health districts, city leaders and the public to do more to stop the spread of coronavirus, warning that rationed care is looming in Idaho’s future. But in one public health department, they were met with debunked conspiracy theories and skepticism. It all came on a day when the state saw record-high numbers of new coronavirus cases and COVID-19 deaths, according to the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare: Thirty-five people died of COVID-19 on Tuesday, and 1,781 new cases were reported. Idaho is experiencing severe and unchecked community spread of COVID-19 in much of the state, with more than 85,000 cases statewide and a positivity rate that has increased by nearly 42% in the past two weeks. There were nearly 1,000 new cases reported for every 100,000 residents in the past two weeks, according to numbers from Johns Hopkins University. Unless the community “radically changes,” the number of COVID-19 patients in southwestern Idaho hospitals will double by Christmas and triple by mid-January, Dr. Steven Nemerson with Saint Alphonsus Health Center told Boise Mayor Lauren McLean. “And that’s when we begin to take care of patients in areas of the building that are not used for traditional care – things like conference rooms,” Nemerson said.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Gov. J.B. Pritzker announced new COVID-19 restrictions Tuesday that include capping crowds in retail stores and temporarily closing museums and casinos. The latest rules, which take effect Friday, come as infections and hospitalizations continue to soar. Illinois on Tuesday logged 12,601 new cases and 97 additional deaths. Under the newly announced restrictions, retail stores must lower customer capacity to 25% from the current 50%, though grocery stores will be excluded and can operate at 50% capacity. Gyms will also be capped at 25%, and indoor classes will no longer be allowed. The first-term Democrat stopped short of a stay-at-home order, calling it a last resort. The entire state was under such an order for six weeks last spring at the onset of the virus. “If these numbers don’t start to curve,” he said, “then it is clear that we’re going to have to take more difficult measures and go to a stay-at-home order.”\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Nearly a quarter of the state’s counties are now listed in the highest-risk category of coronavirus spread, and Wednesday’s update from the health department showed a 60% increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations in just two weeks. Health officials also reported 60 more coronavirus deaths, with those added to Sunday’s total making it Indiana’s single deadliest COVID-19 day since the pandemic first hit the state in March. The health department listed 21 of Indiana’s 92 counties in the highest of its four risk levels for coronavirus spread, up from nine counties in the red level last week. Those additional red-level counties include northwestern Indiana’s Lake County, the state’s second-most populous, and Fort Wayne’s Allen County. Gov. Eric Holcomb went into quarantine Tuesday after possible coronavirus exposure. Holcomb cited concerns about the steep increase in COVID-19 patients straining hospital capacity as he announced the reinstatement of crowd limits based on county risk levels last week. Indiana hospitals were treating 3,040 COVID-19 patients as of Tuesday – a nearly 300% increase since late September, wehn Holcomb announced an end to nearly all statewide business and crowd restrictions.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state set a record Wednesday for deaths blamed on the coronavirus as new confirmed cases and the number of people being treated in hospitals remained high. The state Department of Public Health reported 40 deaths and 3,896 confirmed new cases in the past 24 hours. That brings the total number of deaths to 2,064 and the total cases to 194,479. The number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 also continued to increase, with a record 1,527 people being treated. There were 283 people in intensive care units. In the past week, 1 in every 107 people in Iowa was diagnosed with the coronavirus, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University. That’s the third-highest rate in the nation, behind only North Dakota and South Dakota.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly drew stiff criticism from Republican legislators Tuesday for turning down a plan to use part of the state’s share of federal COVID-19 relief dollars to shore up the unemployment trust fund. Kansas has continued to see more than 70,000 claimants drawing on unemployment insurance, not counting those receiving money from an array of new federal programs that have been made available. The fear is that will draw down the trust fund that underrates those claims, with Kelly saying during a State Finance Council meeting Friday that it will be out of money by “early spring.” Twenty states already have encountered that problem and have used low-interest loans from the federal government in an effort to bolster their unemployment coffers. Kansas could do the same, Kelly said, believing that it would be better to prioritize driving out coronavirus relief funds to other entities first. “We will not be the first state to empty its coffers,” Kelly said.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Gov. Andy Beshear announced multiple new restrictions Wednesday as coronavirus cases continue to surge in the state. All public and private K-12 schools will close to in-person instruction starting Monday through the end of the semester. The only exception is for elementary schools in counties outside the red zone, which may reopen Dec. 7 if the school follows all guidelines. Beginning Friday and lasting until Dec. 13, all restaurants and bars will close to indoor dining services. Outdoor dining is still allowed, with some limitations. Gyms will be limited to 33% capacity, with masks required and no group classes or indoor games allowed. Indoor gatherings should be limited to two families, not exceeding a total of eight people. Attendance at wedding and funerals will be limited to 25 people. Beshear announced a $40 million fund to provide assistance to qualifying restaurants and bars affected by the dining room closures. He said that “there will not be a shutdown” in what he described as Kentucky’s counterattack against the pandemic’s third wave.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state’s latest coronavirus spike pushed confirmed cases above 200,000 Wednesday as it grapples with a third virus surge. The Louisiana Department of Health said it had confirmed that 200,982 people living in the state have tested positive for the coronavirus since Louisiana reported its first cases in early March. At least 5,939 residents have died from the virus, according to the health department. Nearly 186,000 people are presumed recovered, but that leaves thousands who could have active infections and be spreading the virus. More than 11,000 additional people in Louisiana have tested positive over the past week, prompting new rounds of worry from Gov. John Bel Edwards and public health officials that the latest swell of cases could threaten Louisiana’s ability to deliver health services. Hospitals aren’t overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients yet, but Edwards cautioned that the current trajectory raises that risk. Louisiana had two prior surges of the coronavirus, the first outbreak in March and April centered in the New Orleans region and a swell in June and July that was statewide. All regions of the state are seeing case spikes this month.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state’s largest hospital is putting in place new visitation restrictions in response to a surge in COVID-19. The number of visitors and the length of visitation hours were being reduced effective Wednesday in most parts of Maine Medical Center. But visitation is not changing for the Barbara Bush Children’s Hospital, pediatrics or obstetrics, officials said. “We understand that support from families is an important piece of healing for our patients,” said MMC President Jeff Sanders. “Our goal is to balance that need for family connection with the importance of reducing density in the hospital to keep all of our patients and care team members safe.” The hospital continues to screen all health care providers, patients and visitors for COVID-19, to require universal masking, and to encourage social distancing and hand-washing. The Maine Center for Disease Control reported four deaths and more than 150 additional infections Wednesday. It’s the second time in little more than a week that four deaths have been recorded in a single day. The seven-day average for daily cases is now 192, the highest to date.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Anne Arundel County’s health officer has recommended that private schools switch to online learning amid the rise in coronavirus cases. Nilesh Kalyanaraman advised the switch in a letter to the schools last week, saying that the county health department does not recommend in-person learning when cases exceed 15 new cases a day per 100,000 people. That threshold was exceeded in the county earlier this month, the Capital Gazette reports. Kalyanaraman wrote that current data shows “COVID-19 cases attributed to exposure in schools” to be low but said that “maintaining low levels of in-school transmissions will become more difficult with the growth in cases we are experiencing, leading to more disruptions in learning.” The letter asked the schools to report by Friday whether they plan to go online, modify their instructions or maintain in-person learning. Kalyanaraman said Tuesday that the county does not have the ability to stop in-person learning, due to an executive order from Gov. Larry Hogan.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Mayor Marty Walsh didn’t rule out shutting down restaurants and other businesses again if the number of coronavirus cases reported in the city continues to rise. The city’s positivity rate for the week ending Nov. 12 was 9.6%, up significantly from summer averages of 1.8% to 2.8%, he said at a City Hall news conference Tuesday. “I don’t want to be standing in front of this podium three weeks from now shutting down restaurants and retail shops and businesses and sports and schools and everything that we’ve done,” Walsh said. “We don’t want to go backwards.” He said an economic shutdown would be a last resort. Walsh also urged people to spend Thanksgiving only with immediate members of their household. The city will start releasing data on six key metrics twice a week in an effort to better track the spread of infections and monitor hospital capacity, he said.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The majority of educators in the state have safety concerns and don’t believe they’ll be able to return to in-person learning in January, according to a study from the state teachers’ union. The survey by the Michigan Education Association found 74% of the responding educators prefer some level of virtual learning now. More than 47,000 educators responded to the survey this month. The union has about 120,000 members. Of those responding, 84% reported safety concerns about a return to full in-person learning, and 68% reported that they weren’t confident schools will be able to return to in-person instruction in January. But 41% of educators reported that remote learning has been somewhat ineffective or not effective at all. Teachers want to be back in school because working alongside students is best, MEA President Paula Herbart said Tuesday in a media conference. However, when it comes to decisions being made in the state, the expertise of educators needs to be utilized more. “Many don’t feel like they’ve been a part of the decision-making process, and they want that to change,” Herbart said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Gov. Tim Walz on Wednesday imposed four weeks’ worth of new COVID-19 restrictions as the spread spiked to an all-time high, shutting down bars, restaurants and fitness centers, while pausing social gatherings and organized amateur sports. The announcement came on a day when Minnesota recorded a record 67 new COVID-19-related deaths, pushing the state’s toll to 3,010. The Minnesota Department of Health also reported 5,102 confirmed new cases, raising the total to 242,053. State officials said they expected to top 300,000 cases sometime next week. The governor said in a televised address that it made a difference when Minnesotans endured a lockdown last spring and that they need to take a pause again to protect a health care system that is at a breaking point, with staff are now increasingly falling ill because of community spread. Beginning Friday at 11:59 p.m. through Friday, Dec. 18, in-person social gatherings with others outside one’s own household are prohibited. Bars and restaurants are limited to takeout and delivery service only. Retail businesses, child care centers, salons, and places of worship can stay open with proper precautions under current restrictions. Schools will continue to operate with a mix of in-person, distance and hybrid learning.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state Department of Health reported 1,593 new coronavirus cases Wednesday, one of the highest single-day totals since the pandemic began. The health department said Mississippi, with a population of about 3 million, has reported more than 137,390 confirmed cases and at least 3,601 deaths from COVID-19 as of Tuesday evening. That’s an increase of 20 deaths from the day before. The deaths occurred between Aug. 4 and Nov. 17 and were identified later using death certificates. Meanwhile, newly confirmed cases among students have nearly doubled in a week’s time, according to data released by the health department. The number of students who tested positive for the coronavirus increased from 579 from Nov. 2 through Nov. 6 to more than 1,000 from Nov. 9 to Nov. 13. Last week, schools reported 70 outbreaks, which means more than three cases were reported within a confined setting over the course of two weeks. “You see that things are really starting to heat up,” State Epidemiologist Dr. Paul Byers said Tuesday during a virtual briefing with reporters.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: The union representing St. Louis teachers is calling for a statewide mask mandate, a proposal that also has the backing of Missouri’s two largest teacher organizations. The interim president of the American Federation of Teachers St. Louis Local 420, Ray Cummings, said in a statement late Monday that it’s time for Republican Gov. Mike Parson “to follow science and the advice of health care professionals” in issuing a mask mandate. Outside St. Louis, Missouri teachers are largely represented by the Missouri National Education Association or the Missouri State Teachers Association. Contacted Tuesday, MNEA spokesman Mark Jones said the union “certainly would support a statewide mask mandate.” MSTA spokesman Todd Fuller said the association supports following science and the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The state’s hospitals are filling fast with COVID-19 patients. The health department’s COVID-19 dashboard on Tuesday cited 2,454 hospitalizations, down 71 from Monday but still seven times the number of patients who were hospitalized in July.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Gov. Steve Bullock on Tuesday expanded a mask mandate statewide and announced other restrictions as COVID-19 infections continue to surge and strain hospital resources. Beginning Friday, masks must be worn in public statewide. The mandate had been in place for counties with four or more active coronavirus cases and already applied to all but two counties as of Tuesday. Restaurants, bars, casinos and breweries will be limited to 50% capacity and must close by 10 p.m. Gatherings can’t exceed 25 people if social distancing isn’t possible, but Bullock urged people to avoid getting together with more than 15 people. The limits do not apply to schools and places of worship. Bullock said an additional $75 million in federal coronavirus relief funding would be available for businesses that agree to enforce the mask and physical distancing requirement. In addition, $25 million in supplemental unemployment benefits will be available, paid at $200 per week for eligible workers, beginning next week and lasting four weeks.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: More cities are passing mask mandates as the number of virus cases continues to surge across the state, but Gov. Pete Ricketts continues to reject the idea of a statewide mandate. Kearney and Beatrice passed mask requirements Tuesday to join Lincoln and Omaha as Nebraska cities that require people to wear masks. Several other cities, including Grand Island and Hastings, are also considering approving mask rules, according to the Omaha World-Herald. “In my heart of hearts this is something we need to do to defeat this. COVID is something you don’t want to mess with,” Kearney Mayor Stan Clouse said before the City Council voted unanimously to enact the mask ordinance. Kearney’s rule will go into effect Monday and last at least through Feb. 23. Statewide, masks are required at businesses where employees and customers are in close contact for more that 15 minutes, such as at salons and barbershops, but Ricketts continues to resist requiring them in all circumstances.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Surging COVID-19 cases in the metro area have prompted the Clark County School District to postpone consideration of a resumption of partial in-class instruction and to instead continue with remote learning through at least the end of the calendar year. District Superintendent Jesus Jara announced Monday that teachers and staff will continue to work at home through Dec. 18, when the first semester ends. A reopening plan will be presented to the district board in early January, he said. The board last week voted to postpone until Dec. 10 consideration of a hybrid learning mode. The district has used remote learning since mid-March, but officials have been discussing since the summer how to safely reopen for in-person learning. The recent proposal drew criticism from the teachers unions that cited lack of clarity on personal protective equipment, testing and contact tracing.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Holding New Hampshire House sessions remotely would not violate a constitutional provision about what constitutes a quorum, the state Supreme Court said Tuesday. The House has been meeting at the University of New Hampshire to allow for greater social distancing during the coronavirus pandemic, but Democrats voted in September to ask the court to weigh in on the possibility of remote sessions. Opponents argued that doing so would violate other provisions of the state constitution, particularly one guaranteeing public access to government. The court, however, limited its answer to the narrow question regarding quorum requirements. “As long as the requisite number of representatives is ‘present,’ either in person or virtually, meaning that the requisite number is ‘at hand’ and ‘not absent,’ ” the provision is satisfied, the court wrote. House Speaker Steve Shurtleff, D-Concord, called the opinion a “victory for common sense and safety.” But he won’t be speaker for long. Republicans regained control of both the House and Senate in this month’s elections.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNew Brunswick: Rutgers is a clinical trial site for the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson’s Phase 3 clinical research study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Janssen’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate, the university announced. Rutgers said it will enroll as many as 2,000 participants from the university community and throughout New Jersey. Study participants who meet the eligibility requirements for the study will be randomly selected to receive a single dose of the potential vaccine or a placebo, according to Rutgers. Diverse participants are critical in a coronavirus vaccine trial to ensure effectiveness for populations often underrepresented in research, said XinQi Dong, director of the Institute for Health, Health Care Policy, and Aging Research. Dong is the co-lead investigator directing community recruitment for the Johnson & Johnson trial.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: As New Mexico experiences a rise in deaths and infections related to the coronavirus, education and child welfare officials are working to locate 12,000 students who have stopped attending public school and haven’t notified the state about their next move. A total of 21,000 students have disenrolled since the spring, including those who have notified schools of a transfer to home schooling, private school or another school out of state. New Mexico’s student enrollment has declined for years because of an aging, flat population, but the apparent exodus recorded this fall is much higher than before. On Tuesday, the state reported a record 2,112 known new cases of the virus, bringing the total case count above 67,000. Officials also reported a record-high 28 deaths in a single day. The death toll now stands at 1,264. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham took to Twitter on Tuesday to tell residents to “shelter in place.”\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who has frequently overruled Mayor Bill de Blasio on major decisions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, said during a news conference Wednesday that the city has the authority to shut things down if it wishes. Cuomo predicted a “tremendous spike” in coronavirus cases after Thanksgiving as he pleaded with people not to be lulled into a false sense of safety over the holiday. “Your family sounds safe, doesn’t it? Your home sounds safe. Your dining room table at Thanksgiving sounds safe,” Cuomo said at a state Capitol briefing. “No, you won’t be safe. It’s an illusion.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Gov. Roy Cooper and public health officials unveiled a new alert system Tuesday that will encourage counties with high levels of coronavirus transmission to more aggressively enforce statewide health guidelines and punish noncompliant businesses. Dangled over the counties’ heads is a big stick: the possibility of the state placing greater restrictions on them. Leaders in over half of the state’s counties, including 10 deemed to have “critical community spread,” are now being encouraged to pass ordinances levying fines against residents and businesses not complying with public health directives. They include the statewide mask mandate Cooper enacted months ago to combat COVID-19, as well as gathering limits. The 10 “critical” counties, mainly in rural areas, and 44 others with “substantial” spread also are being asked to consider cutting off alcohol sales earlier than the current 11 p.m. deadline statewide. And churches in those counties are advised not to hold any indoor in-person gatherings of more than 10 people. The Democratic governor warned of further restrictions if counties don’t heed the state’s advice.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Sanford Health is opening a new COVID-19 unit in the city, a move the hospital’s president called a “wake-up call” as beds become increasingly scarce because of the explosion of coronavirus cases in the state. The 20-bed unit at the former Bismarck Surgical Associates building is expected to open next week, according to the health care system. President Michael LeBeau said the $1 million facility is part of Sanford’s “surge” plan. “It is a wake-up call for us, and I think it should be a wake-up call for the community that the delivery of care is starting to get outside the norm,” LeBeau told the Bismarck Tribune. North Dakota has seen record numbers of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in recent weeks. Sanford had six available beds Tuesday, including one in intensive care, according to state health data. However, LeBeau said the numbers can change “almost hourly.”\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Residents of the capital city and the surrounding county should stay at home as much as possible and not have guests inside their homes, including on Thanksgiving Day, according to an advisory stay-at-home order issued Wednesday by public health directors. People living in Columbus and Franklin County are also advised to avoid traveling in and out of state, based on the order by Columbus Health Commissioner Dr. Mysheika Roberts and Franklin County Health Commissioner Joe Mazzola. The order includes a recommendation that people forgo “having guests in their homes during the upcoming holiday season.” Exceptions would be for essential needs such as medical care, groceries, medicine and food pickup, according to the order. It follows an increase in the local seven-day average of COVID-19 cases from 143 on Oct. 1 to 742 on Nov. 15. Local positivity rates have also jumped 12.5% as of last week. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases across Ohio has risen over the past two weeks from 3,343 new cases per day Nov. 3 to 7,280 new cases per day Nov. 17, according to an Associated Press analysis of data provided by the COVID Tracking Project.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The number of hospitalizations due to the coronavirus surpassed 1,400 on Wednesday for a new daily record, and the number of total cases increased by more than 3,000, the Oklahoma State Department of Health reported. There were 1,434 people hospitalized, 53 more than the previous one-day record set Tuesday. The seven-day rolling average of new cases in the state has risen from 1,159.6 per day Nov. 3 to 2,607.3 per day, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The health department reported 3,017 new cases and 26 additional deaths for totals of 161,425 cases and 1,570 deaths since the pandemic began. The seven-day rolling average of daily deaths in the state has declined slightly, from 14.6 to 13.3, based on the Johns Hopkins data. There were 29,823 active cases Wednesday, an increase of 1,016 from the day before, according to the health department.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Gov. Kate Brown made her statewide two-week “freeze” official Tuesday with an executive order that makes the measures enforceable by law. The freeze will take effect starting Wednesday and aims to limit group activities and slow the spread of COVID-19 in Oregon, where cases have reached a record high. As part of the freeze, social gatherings cannot exceed six people. Restaurants are limited to takeout only, while gyms and fitness centers, museums, pools, sports courts, movie theaters, zoos, gardens, aquariums and venues will be closed. Grocery stores, pharmacies and retail stores are limited to a maximum capacity of 75%. All of the freeze measures are enforceable by law. Workplace violations should be reported to Oregon OSHA and restaurant violations to OSHA or OLCC. In the past, social gathering limits were “self-enforced.” Now, if caught violating this restriction, a person can be cited, fined or arrested, though Oregon State Police released a statement saying the agency would “continue to follow an education first approach,” keeping criminal citations “a last resort.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nYork: As COVID-19 continues to spread, some central Pennsylvania hospitals are implementing restrictions on visitors. As of Tuesday, WellSpan Health is no longer allowing visitors in its hospitals, according to a statement from the health network. Forecasting at WellSpan Health projects the number of patients in its hospitals this winter will exceed the summer surge, when COVID-19 cases overwhelmed medical centers statewide. “We do have the flu season and COVID-19 colliding now over the next few months, and whether or not all of our health systems in our region will have the capacity to deal with both, I think, is a question,” WellSpan Health President and CEO Dr. Roxanna L. Gapstur said during a press conference last week. WellSpan’s eight are treating about 180 coronavirus patients – more than triple the number of patients in April. Statewide, 2,575 patients are hospitalized with COVID-19, with 558 patients in intensive care units. On Tuesday, Pennsylvania reported 5,900 new cases, for a total of 275,513 cases in the commonwealth.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: It will be nearly impossible for the state to make it through the rest of the year without additional restrictions to help control the spread of the coronavirus, Gov. Gina Raimondo said. “It’s safe to say that there are going to have to be some changes in order for us to safely make it through the holidays,” the Democratic governor told WPRI-TV on Tuesday. Her biggest concern is shutting down businesses again, something she doesn’t want to do. “I am going to do everything I can to avoid that or put it off as long as possible, but I may not have an option given the trend that we are on,” she said. She also welcomed the news that Rhode Island is one of four states partnering with Pfizer for its U.S. COVID-19 Immunization Pilot Program. She said she reached out to Pfizer and asked if Rhode Island could be part of the program. “There’s a ton of planning that goes into the process of getting everybody vaccinated, so it means we have a bit of a leg up on that planning because we are starting to work closely with the company already,” she said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: State Attorney General Alan Wilson said he placed himself in quarantine Tuesday after finding out he was near someone who tested positive for the coronavirus. Wilson said he feels fine and has no symptoms but will take the precaution to isolate himself to follow federal health guidelines. The Republican first elected attorney general in 2010 said he will work from home. Wilson’s statement did not specify with whom the attorney general was in close contact. COVID-19 cases in South Carolina are rising again after an outbreak this summer. The seven-day average number of new daily cases is above 1,400 for the first time since early August. During the pandemic’s first peak in July, the average was more than 1,900 new cases a day. Lt. Gov. Pamela Evette announced she had COVID-19 back in September.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The city reversed course and passed a 60-day mask mandate Tuesday after enforcement was removed from the ordinance and medical groups said hospitals exceeded capacity dealing with COVID-19 patients. The Sioux Falls City Council voted 6-2 to approve the measure Tuesday night. But the council said violations of the requirement, which applies to retail businesses and public buildings, will not carry any penalty. Sioux Falls Mayor Paul TenHaken, who cast a tie-breaking vote against a mandate last week, said prior to Tuesday night’s vote that he was ready to get behind the requirement after the state’s largest physicians’ organization and a hospital system came out in support. Councilor Greg Neitzert, who voted against the ordinance, told the audience that his “yes” votes on amendments were to make the ordinance “as weak and ineffectual as I can” in case it passed and should not have been taken as a vote of support. “I want to neuter this,” he said. He warned that the ordinance would be toothless and an empty gesture. “We’re going to put this in place, and it’s not going to work,” Neitzert said before the vote.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: As health experts ring alarm bells at surging virus case numbers, Tennessee is one of just 14 states poised to head into the holiday season without a statewide mask mandate. Gov. Bill Lee also has vowed he will not impose business restrictions or issue guidance on how families should gather for next week’s Thanksgiving holiday amid the ongoing pandemic. The Republican has remained steadfast that he’s open to all options for battling COVID-19, reiterating for weeks that he hasn’t ruled anything out. However, Lee has thus far refused to adopt recommendations like other GOP governors who have begrudgingly implemented some sort of limited mask requirement in the face of skyrocketing virus numbers. Lee, instead, has left the mask requirement question up to Tennessee’s counties. Lee’s administration has also spent months encouraging Tennesseans to take “personal responsibility” in their actions to prevent the spread of the virus. When asked what happens if people don’t heed that advice, Lee has maintained that personal responsibility is the only path to curbing the spread.\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso: The crush of the coronavirus surge has the city sending its non-COVID-19 cases to hospitals elsewhere, officials said Tuesday. El Paso confirmed 994 new coronavirus cases and 13 new deaths Tuesday, and Austin Mayor Steve Adler confirmed that Austin-area hospitals are receiving non-coronavirus patients from overwhelmed hospitals in the border city. In a Facebook Live update Monday night, Adler said that El Paso was in a “world of hurt” and that numbers in Dallas, San Antonio and Houston were “scarier than ours, and our numbers are scary enough by themselves.” El Paso’s health care systems became overwhelmed even after the state sent additional medical resources, Adler said. Meanwhile, officials in Harris County, where Houston is located, appealed to the public to forgo gatherings with anyone beyond their immediate household during the holiday season in an effort to help stop the virus’s spread. On Tuesday afternoon, Harris County sent out an emergency text alert to all 4.7 million of its residents asking them to cancel their holiday gatherings and get tested.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Several prominent community leaders have joined together to address the state’s high COVID-19 rates and overwhelmed health care system. On Tuesday, Gail Miller from the Larry H. Miller Group of Companies, Ryan Smith from Qualtrics, Marc Harrison from Intermountain Healthcare, and Keith McMullin from Deseret Management Corporation unveiled a new public service announcement and social media campaign titled “All In.” The campaign features videos of the leaders calling on people to wear their masks, maintain social distance, and otherwise comply with a statewide order issued by Gov. Gary Herbert to follow best practices and prevent spreading the coronavirus. The videos will air on local TV stations and on a variety of social media platforms. Billboards and other signage will also be used.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state is expanding testing as part of a broader move to help combat the spread of the coronavirus. Gov. Phil Scott said Tuesday that the state will be opening five new testing sites by the end of the week in Burlington, Middlebury, Waterbury, Rutland and Brattleboro. Officials hope to have a total of 14 new testing sites up and running by the end of the month. The goal is to locate testing sites within a half-hour drive of all Vermonters, said Human Services Secretary Mike Smith. The hours of the testing locations will be expanded to make them more convenient for more Vermonters, and the state also hopes to increase the capacity to 30,000 tests a week, he said. The increased testing comes as Vermont is trying to tamp down a surge in coronavirus cases.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: After the coronavirus pandemic forced months of online-only learning, some school districts had high hopes for bringing students back for some in-person classes before the end of the year. But with COVID-19 cases surging, the state’s largest school systems have hit the brakes on reopening plans. School officials in Virginia Beach, Henrico County and Fairfax County announced Monday that they’re pausing their plans for in-person classes, citing increased virus spread in their communities. The decisions came three days after Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam announced new statewide coronavirus restrictions, including limiting gatherings to 25 people and prohibiting alcohol sales at dining and drinking establishments after 10 p.m. The number of new virus cases in Virginia has steadily increased over the past month. As of Tuesday, the state health department has reported more than 206,000 cases since the pandemic began, with at least 3,835 deaths.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The state Department of Health has reported 2,589 additional COVID-19 cases and 23 more deaths, setting another new record. The previous record was set Sunday with 2,519 cases, The Seattle Times reports. The state has set multiple new records in the past week. The update brings the state’s totals to more than 134,000 cases and 2,571 deaths. That means 1.9% of people diagnosed in Washington have died. State health officials also reported that 9,573 people have been hospitalized in the state because of the virus, with 55 new hospitalizations since Monday. Health officials also said Tuesday that a deadly outbreak of the coronavirus among residents and staff at Josephine Caring Community in Stanwood has grown to 99 cases. The 99 cases – split about evenly between residents of the long-term care facility and staff – is an increase from 94 reported over the weekend. Seven people have been hospitalized, including five who have died, Dr. Chris Spitters, Snohomish County’s health officer, said in a Tuesday briefing.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The coronavirus has infected 260 inmates at McDowell County Corrections, by far the largest outbreak at a state prison. The state reported numbers Tuesday showing six more people were confirmed positive. Gov. Jim Justice said Monday that 28 staff members also were sick. He said the facility was on lockdown, and state data shows 136 people are quarantined there for possible exposure. In total, 57 employees across the state’s prisons and jails currently have the coronavirus. There are eight other active cases among inmates outside of McDowell.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state’s prisons have experienced the highest single-day spike in coronavirus cases since the pandemic began. The state Department of Corrections reported 808 new cases among inmates Monday, bringing the number of active cases to 2,063. Six prisons have big outbreaks of more than 100 active cases among prisoners. They include New Lisbon Correctional Institution with 362 cases, Fox Lake Correctional Institution with 360, Oshkosh Correctional Institution with 258, Racine Correctional Institution/Sturtevant Transitional Facility with 250, Taycheedah Correctional Institution with 140 and Dodge Correctional Institution with 135. Among staff, a total of 1,470 corrections employees have self-reported testing positive for the virus, with 338 of those active Monday, the State Journal reports. Despite cases continuing to rise, the prisons’ death count at 10 hasn’t changed since Nov. 3.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: Eight people have submitted applications for a vacant House seat after Gillette Republican Rep. Roy Edwards died from COVID-19 on Nov. 2, the day before the general election. Chris Knapp, Tom Murphy, Thomas Rothenbuehler, Nichole Shelstad, Joshua Dillinger, Joel Marquiss, Terry Sjolin and Kimberly Zehner have put their names forward as potential replacements, The Gillette New Record reports. Applicants must be Republican, at least 21 years old and a resident of House District 53, which includes Gillette, to be qualified, officials said. The Republican precinct committee is scheduled to select three finalists Thursday. The finalists’ names will then be forwarded to the Campbell County Commission, which will select Edwards’ replacement. Edwards is one of three Wyoming state lawmakers whose coronavirus diagnoses have been made public.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/09/09/cast-blues-wedding-dress-scare-rhino-escape-news-around-states/118789038/", "title": "Cast of Blues, wedding dress scare, rhino escape: News from ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nHuntsville: The state attorney general’s office is trying to revive its lawsuit over the removal of a Confederate monument from outside a courthouse in the city. The state claimed in court documents that a judge shouldn’t have dismissed the suit just because someone anonymously paid a $25,000 fine that was owed by Madison County for removing the statue nearly a year ago, WHNT-TV reports. Attorney General Steve Marshall’s office contends the county should be required to pay the penalty itself. A judge scheduled a hearing for Friday afternoon on the state’s bid to reinstate the lawsuit. The state sued the county last year seeking a $25,000 penalty that’s mandated under a state law that makes it illegal to remove or alter monuments. Madison County asked a judge to end the state’s suit after someone deposited $25,000 into a court account to pay the fine Aug. 27. The county says the money isn’t from taxpayers or Madison County but hasn’t said where it came from. Circuit Judge Claude Hundley dismissed the suit, but the state argues it needs to know who paid the fine to end the case. It also says the judge still needs to rule on its claim that Madison County broke the law by moving the monument, erected in 1905 by the United Daughters of the Confederacy, to a city-owned cemetery.\n\nAlaska\n\nNewtok: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the pace of moving residents from a community threatened by erosion to another village, officials said. Money also has been an issue. Nine homes in the new village of Mertarvik that were started last year remain unfinished, and no one has moved from Newtok to Mertarvik since 2019, KYUK Public Media reports. Newtok had an estimated 220 residents last year. “We couldn’t get any cabinets because of this COVID thing,” said Phillip Carl, Newtok acting tribal administrator. Patrick LeMay, who is leading the building effort in Mertarvik, said shortages for materials have persisted. “We got 48 lights that are trapped somewhere in Tennessee floods, to finish the lighting. There’s a shortage of fire extinguishers in the nation,” LeMay said. “The supply chain has been a disaster.” Many of the workers building homes in Mertarvik are Newtok residents. LeMay said three workers from Newtok contracted COVID-19 in August. Many remaining laborers chose to stop working due to concerns about an outbreak, KYUK reports. Newtok recently experienced its biggest outbreak since the pandemic began, with 32 residents testing positive for the coronavirus last month. About 42% of its population is vaccinated. Meanwhile, Carl said Newtok has lost over 100 feet of its coast since April.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: State Attorney General Mark Brnovich said Tuesday that Tucson’s vaccine mandate for its employees is illegal, giving the city 30 days to repeal it or risk losing millions of dollars in state funding. Democratic-led Tucson has repeatedly clashed with the state’s Republican leadership over the city’s aggressive efforts to control the spread of COVID-19. City Manager Michael Ortega said he put the mandate on hold while Tucson develops its legal position in response to the attorney general’s decision. Brnovich, who is running for U.S. Senate in a crowded Republican primary, cited a state law approved this summer that bans local governments from mandating vaccines for employees, though it doesn’t take effect until later this month. He also cited an August executive order signed by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey. “Adhering to the rule of law in Arizona is not optional,” Katie Conner, a spokeswoman for Brnovich, told reporters. Tucson Mayor Regina Romero suggested Brnovich’s decision was motivated by his Senate campaign. “This report reads more as a campaign speech filled with political commentary rather than a fact-based legal opinion,” the Democratic mayor said in a statement. City officials are reviewing their options, Romero said, and the next step will have to be decided by her and City Council.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state reported 38 new deaths from COVID-19 on Tuesday as the capital city launched a new incentive program to boost vaccinations. The Department of Health said the state’s death toll from the pandemic now totals 7,108. The state reported 583 new coronavirus cases, and COVID-19 hospitalizations rose by eight to 1,228. Arkansas ranks 10th in the country for new cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The state’s top health official has warned he expects to see a surge in cases following the Labor Day weekend, and Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Tuesday said he expected an increase as well. “We have fewer cases from the Labor Day weekend, but we’ll see the effects of the holiday weekend later this week and into the next,” Hutchinson tweeted. Little Rock launched its incentive program tied to vaccination clinics it is holding, starting Saturday at the Southwest Community Center. Those who get shots at these clinics will receive a $50 VISA Rewards Card from U.S. Bank for both their first and second doses of vaccine received at a participating clinic. Those who provide proof of having gotten a first vaccine dose elsewhere and choose to get their second dose at a participating clinic, or those who receive a single-dose vaccine at a participating clinic, can receive a $100 Rewards Card.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Lawmakers have moved to make the state the first to outlaw “stealthing,” which is removing a condom without permission during intercourse. Legislators sent Gov. Gavin Newsom a bill Tuesday adding the act to the state’s civil definition of sexual battery. It makes it illegal to remove the condom without obtaining verbal consent. But it doesn’t change the criminal code. Instead, it would amend the civil code so that a victim could sue the perpetrator for damages, including punitive damages. Democratic Assemblywoman Cristina Garcia has been pushing for the legislation since 2017, when a Yale University study said acts of stealthing were increasing against women and gay men alike. Her original bill attempted to make it a crime. But legislative analysts said at the time that the act could already be considered misdemeanor sexual battery, even if it isn’t specifically referenced in the criminal code. Even so, the analysts said it is rarely prosecuted, if only because of the difficulty in proving that a perpetrator acted intentionally instead of accidentally. Analysts this year said Garcia’s bill would remove any ambiguity in civil law. Garcia said the act can cause long-term physical and emotional harm to its victims.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The city has closed Civic Center Park, one of its historic landmarks that has become a hot spot for homeless people to camp, because of safety and public health concerns, city officials said in a statement Tuesday. City officials said the park and surrounding areas have become a “hotspot for violence, crime, drug sales and substance misuse, jeopardizing the public’s ability to safely enjoy one of Denver’s treasured outdoor spaces.” Officials cited concerns about rodents, disease spread, impacts on water quality, discarded needles and other drug paraphernalia in a statement in which Mayor Michael B. Hancock said conditions had reached a “tipping point.” “This cannot and will not be allowed to continue,” Hancock said. The park was closed to the public starting Wednesday. Officials called it temporary but did not provide an exact date for its reopening. The city said it plans to restore the park’s greenery and historical stone structures that have been damaged by graffiti and fires and will require professional restoration. The park faces the state’s Capitol building and Lincoln Park, which was fenced off last summer after the city cleared a large camp of homeless people who were living there. Officials had cited health and safety concerns for issuing Lincoln Park’s cleanup, also referred to as “homeless sweeps” by local housing advocates.\n\nConnecticut\n\nBridgeport: An independent investigator will look into allegations of racial discrimination within the police department including unfair discipline of Black officers and a hostile work environment, city officials said. The probe is in response to claims against acting Police Chief Rebeca Garcia made by the Bridgeport Guardians, a group that represents minority officers on the force, Hearst Connecticut Media reports. City Council President Aidee Nieves said Bridgeport will be hiring an outside attorney to review the allegations. The Guardians, however, are continuing to insist that federal government officials investigate the department. Davon Polite, president of the Guardians, said there are concerns that city officials will hire a lawyer who will produce the results they want. “A federal investigation is the only way to get an impartial, fair investigation,” Polite said. The Guardians and the local NAACP branch recently requested federal oversight of the department and an investigation, alleging a widespread pattern of racial discrimination within the agency. The Guardians accuse Garcia of subjecting minority officers to disparate treatment and a hostile work environment. The group has called for her removal. The city police union voted no confidence in Garcia in March.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A Chancery Court judge ruled protests may continue outside the house of Delaware Deputy Attorney General Mark Denney, denying the state’s request for a temporary restraining order. The proposed restrictions, made by the state Department of Justice after it perceived threats against the agency’s Division of Civil Rights and Public Trust head, sought to keep protesters 300 feet from Denney’s home. Demonstrators would also have to notify New Castle County Police at least 24 hours before they protested. In making her ruling Tuesday, Chancellor Kathaleen St. J. McCormick said there was not enough for her to go on to issue a temporary restraining order. She attributed that to the speed at which the proceedings were brought to her on Sunday of Labor Day Weekend. But she said the motion to expedite the proceeding could move forward. A date for the next hearing was not provided. Keandra McDole Ray, one of the people targeted by the motion, viewed the ruling as a positive outcome for demonstrators, who have been protesting that Denney “do his job” in the matter of Lymond Moses – a 30-year-old man killed during a Jan. 13 interaction with New Castle County Police in Wilmington.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: One of the biggest rock bands in the world will take the stage at D.C.’s 9:30 Club on Thursday night as the final part of the venue’s reopening week celebration, WUSA-TV reports. The club, which had been teasing a surprise musical guest for a few weeks, posted on social media Wednesday that the Foo Fighters had been tapped to help welcome fans back. This won’t be the first venue Dave Grohl and company have helped to reopen from long pandemic-induced closures. Back in June, the band reopened New York’s Madison Square Garden with a little help from D.C. native Dave Chappelle. But the 9:30 Club has a special connection to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame band’s leader. As a teenager, Grohl played drums in a band called Dane Bramage at the 9:30 Club. “As a kid growing up in the D.C. punk rock scene, your first show at the 9:30 Club might as well have been Royal Albert Hall or Madison Square Garden,” Grohl told the Washington Post in a 2010 article celebrating the venue’s 30th anniversary. The 9:30 Club is one of several D.C. venues requiring proof of vaccination against COVID-19 or a negative coronavirus test within 72 hours of an event.\n\nFlorida\n\nIslamorada: A 148-year-old Florida Keys lighthouse could get a new life now that a community organization is poised to take ownership and begin a massive preservation project. U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland has approved a recommendation from the National Park Service that Islamorada-based Friends of the Pool Inc. be granted ownership of Alligator Reef Lighthouse under the National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act. The nonprofit announced the approval Tuesday. “Alligator Reef Lighthouse has stood since 1873,” project organizer Rob Dixon said. “It’s an important part of Islamorada’s local history. It’s our Statue of Liberty and needs to be saved.” Dixon said the restoration project is likely to take five to seven years and cost up to $9 million. “We’re going to need a lot of fundraising help and a lot of technical help,” he said. Friends of the Pool hosts an annual 8-mile swimming race to the offshore lighthouse and back to fund collegiate scholarships. The effort to save the lighthouse and start the “Swim for Alligator Lighthouse” event was conceived by Larry Herlth, a local metal artisan who created detailed replicas of Alligator Reef Lighthouse and other Keys lighthouses. “The six lighthouses off the Florida Keys are the biggest collection of iron piling lighthouses anywhere in the world,” Herlth said. “The history is just phenomenal.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A metro-area school district is switching to virtual learning, after two school bus drivers and a bus monitor died from COVID-19 in recent weeks. The 9,700-student Griffin-Spalding County school system, on the southern fringe of suburban Atlanta, made the announcement late Monday, citing a disruption in student transportation. Districts across Georgia are struggling to line up enough drivers and monitors to keep buses running. In Savannah, some bus drivers staged a sickout for the second day Tuesday after a similar protest Friday. At least 210,000 Georgia students in 54 districts and charter networks have had their school schedules disrupted because of COVID-19. Some districts have taken days off, some shifted to every-other-day schedules, and some sent home individual schools or grades. That’s over 12% of Georgia’s 1.7 million public school students. The number of COVID-19 patients in hospitals remains above 6,000, the highest level since the start of the pandemic. The number of newly reported deaths continues to rise sharply, with Georgia currently averaging more than 80 deaths a day, totaling more than 23,000 since the pandemic began. More than 34,000 coronavirus cases have been reported among children ages 5-17 in the two weeks ended Sept. 2, state Department of Public Health data shows.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A resort in the famed tourist mecca of Waikiki will be the first in the state to require proof of COVID-19 vaccination for all employees and guests. Starting Oct. 15, ’Alohilani Resort will require its employees, patrons and guests to show proof they’re fully inoculated. The requirement will also apply to the six other Waikiki properties owned or operated by Highgate, a real estate investment and hospitality management company. It’s the right thing to do as Hawaii grapples with a surge in coronavirus cases and hospitalizations because of the highly contagious delta variant, said Kelly Sanders, senior vice president of operations at Highgate Hawaii. There were an average of 706 newly confirmed infection cases per day across Hawaii between Aug. 30 and Sept. 5 across Hawaii, according to the state Department of Health. Hawaii’s vaccination rate was 64%. “So I think we will be the safest hotel in Hawaii, at least for now,” Sanders said Wednesday. “And hopefully that helps our business and doesn’t hurt our business.” John De Fries, president and CEO of the Hawaii Tourism Authority, called the move a step in a the right direction and said he hopes other hotels follow suit.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state’s move to “crisis standards of care” is allowing some hospitals to ration health care as they struggle with an onslaught of coronavirus patients, and officials are warning the procedures could spread statewide. But the main hospital affected by the designation was already operating under extreme conditions, officials said. “Unfortunately we haven’t been really at our normal standards for some time,” said Dr. Robert Scoggins, the chief of staff for Kootenai Health, the largest hospital system in the northern half of the state. The Coeur d’Alene facility has had to move patients into a conference center, “doing things that were not normal – way outside of normal – at times,” Scoggins said. Newly confimed coronavirus infection cases are surging, and Idaho has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the U.S. At Kootenai Health, some patients are treated in converted lobbies and hallways. Urgent surgeries are on hold, and critical patients must often wait long periods of time for intensive care beds, Scoggins said. “Almost every day at this point we are having cardiac arrest from patients when their oxygen levels dip too low, and we can’t supply them with enough oxygen,” he said. An entire floor of the hospital has been turned into a COVID-19 ward, meaning medical staffers must put on full protective gear before they enter the floor.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Former U.S. Sen. Adlai Stevenson III has died at his home on Chicago’s North Side. He was 90. His son Adlai Stevenson IV, who confirmed the Illinois Democrat died Monday, said his father had dementia. Before his health declined, Stevenson kept active organizing presentations and speakers for the Adlai Stevenson Center on Democracy in Libertyville, Illinois. He also worked on the family farm in Hanover, Illinois, raising cattle, growing corn and hay for their feed, and chopping wood. “He just faded away,” his son said. Stevenson ran for governor of Illinois twice, losing his 1982 run by just 5,074 votes to Republican Gov. Jim Thompson – the closest election for governor in modern Illinois history. Stevenson was the great-grandson of former Vice President Adlai Stevenson, who served in the role for the second of President Grover Cleveland’s nonconsecutive terms. His father, Adlai Stevenson II, was a former Illinois governor and two-time presidential candidate. When running for the Senate, where he was first elected in 1970 to serve out the remainder of the late Sen. Everett Dirksen’s term, the third Stevenson asked then-Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley for advice. “My advice to you is don’t change your name,” Daley told him, the Chicago Sun-Times reports. Stevenson was reelected in 1974 but decided not to run again in 1980.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The Indiana Secured School Safety Board has approved more than $19 million in state grants, marking a third consecutive year the General Assembly has allocated funds for school safety investments. The awards will allow the board to fund projects proposed by 392 schools in their applications to the Secured School Safety Grant program. The program issues matching grants for school resource officers and law enforcement officers in schools, active event warning systems, firearms training for teachers and staff, threat assessments, and other safety technology and support services. Schools then match those funds at a certain level, based on average daily membership of the school district, the total amount of the project or what the request covers. “Hoosier students and staff should be able to go to school with the confidence and comfort of knowing they are safe and protected from harm. This program represents the state’s commitment to that mission,” Gov. Eric Holcomb said in a statement. The allocation of funds for the fiscal year includes roughly $13.4 million for school resource officers, $4.9 million for safety equipment, $642,000 for student and parent support services programs, $43,000 for active event warning services, and $6,200 for training.\n\nIowa\n\nMarshalltown: The city’s public schools will become the new owners of the historic Orpheum Theater for the basement-bargain price of $1. Marshalltown Community School District Board of Education on Tuesday unanimously approved a letter of intent to buy the theater on Main Street, the Times-Republican reports. The school district will pay the current owners, Iowa Valley Community College District, $1 for the building at closing. The closing date has been set for June 16 or sooner. The school board also approved a $20,000 purchase of a parking lot immediately east of the theater. The Orpheum closed last year amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Iowa Valley Community College District Chancellor Kristie Fisher said her school views the sale as more of a transfer of property from one school to another, and she’s proud the theater will remain an educational facility. “We knew it was a great community asset and so important to the greater Marshall County community that we wanted to make sure we were maximizing it,” Fisher said. She said that while the $1 sale doesn’t appear to be a money-maker for the community college district, it will save the institution the costs of operating the theater, freeing up funds for other priorities. The downtown Orpheum Theater was built in 1948.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: After months of advocacy by activists, the City Council has voted to establish a board to advise the council and city staff on environmental concerns, climate change and economic vitality. The council voted unanimously Tuesday to support Wichita’s Sustainability Integration Board, which will advise in such areas as reducing emissions and finding economic growth that is environmentally friendly. The council had listened to 27 Wichita citizens during the past six months who spoke about climate change concerns, The Wichita Eagle reports. As currently planned, the board will have 14 members and meet quarterly. Some of the advocates and some council members said the board was too big and should meet more often. The board will be able to create its own bylaws and procedures, including determining how often members meet. “I think this is a great first step forward, and I don’t think we should let the perfect be the enemy of the good,” Mayor Brandon Whipple said.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Republican lawmakers took initial steps Tuesday to block statewide mask mandates, showing their preference for local decision-making on the issue as they reconvened for a special session to assert their dominance in shaping Kentucky’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In a daylong burst of action, a Senate committee advanced a measure to nullify the state school board’s requirement that anyone in a public K-12 school wear a mask. The bill would leave it up to local school boards to decide face-covering policies for their districts. A House panel advanced another bill to prevent the governor from issuing any new statewide orders requiring mask-wearing. Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear previously used a mask mandate to combat the coronavirus’ spread. He lifted it but has said he would have reinstituted a requirement to counter a recent COVID-19 surge if he still had the authority. The session marks a dramatic power shift in coronavirus-related policymaking in the Bluegrass State. Since the pandemic hit Kentucky, Beshear mostly acted unilaterally in setting statewide virus policies, but the state Supreme Court shifted those decisions to the Legislature in a landmark ruling. Dozens of school districts have paused in-person learning because of virus outbreaks as the state sets records for new cases and hospitalizations.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: State health officials said Tuesday that they are revoking the licenses of nursing homes that evacuated residents to a warehouse where seven died amid deteriorating conditions deemed too squalid to be safe after Hurricane Ida. The seven homes – all owned by one person – “clearly failed to execute their emergency preparedness plans to provide essential care and services to their residents,” Department of Health Secretary Courtney Phillips said in a statement. Authorities found some nursing home residents lying on mattresses on the floor, without food or clean clothes, and detected strong odors of urine and feces throughout the warehouse, located in the town of Independence. Piles of trash were on the floor. Water entered the building, and generators at least temporarily failed, according to officials. Health department lawyer Stephen Russo called the conditions “inhumane.” State health officials and Attorney General Jeff Landry have launched investigations into the deaths. A police official said the Tangipahoa Parish warehouse was equipped to handle 300 to 500 people but ultimately took in more than 800. Officials said the owner, Bob Dean, failed to contact them for help and threw inspectors from the agency off the property when they arrived to review the conditions onsite after receiving reports of problems.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The late founder of the Greater Portland Immigrant Welcome Center has become the first Black Mainer to be inducted in the state’s Franco-American Hall of Fame. Alain Jean Claude Nahimana, who died at age 49 last year, was one of three people inducted posthumously during the ceremony Tuesday at the Maine State House. The son of a Burundi ambassador who fled political turmoil, Nahimana was educated in Burundi and Switzerland before moving to Maine in 2010. He served as the president of the Burundi Community Association and as coordinator of the Maine Immigrant Rights Coalition before launching the immigrant welcome center. There were a dozen inductees, including former House Speaker John Martin, of Eagle Lake, and state Sen. Susan Deschambault, of Biddeford. Dignitaries who attended the event included the French ambassador to the United States, Phillippe Etienne, along with Senate President Troy Jackson and House Speaker Ryan Fecteau. Gov. Janet Mills, who studied abroad for a year in Paris as a college student, delivered remarks in both French and English. She noted that more than a third of Maine residents have a Franco heritage.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A commission on congressional and state legislative redistricting has announced 12 public hearings. Ten of the hearings will be held in different parts of the state. The first will be Sept. 20, and the last is scheduled for Nov. 18. There also will be two statewide virtual hearings. The panel, which includes leading Democrats who control the General Assembly as well as two Republican legislative leaders, will draw maps for the state’s eight congressional districts as well as the 188 seats in the Legislature, based on new census data. Maryland’s current congressional map has been criticized as having some of the most gerrymandered and oddly-shaped districts in the nation. In a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans 2-1, Democrats hold a 7-1 advantage in its U.S. House delegation. Karl Aro, the former executive director of the Maryland Department of Legislative Services who is chairing the commission, said the geography should look “prettier” this time in how the maps are drawn. He noted that in the past “things have gotten pretty free-hand-drawing like.” Aro said he’s hopeful people will not feel like their communities have been “carved 16 different ways.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A shortage of bus drivers in the city’s public schools has been raising concern among parents who fear some students could be left behind when the district starts a new year Thursday. Acting Mayor Kim Janey and Superintendent Brenda Cassellius have told families to expect significant delays or bus cancellations, but details were not being provided to families until Thursday morning, The Boston Globe reports. The shortage is so severe that a union for bus drivers last week urged the district to postpone the start of classes. The district’s bus fleet was short more than 60 drivers at the time, and few had been added by this week. Families and advocates worry some students could end up stranded at home or at bus stops Thursday. The Boston Special Education Parent Advisory Council has raised concerns about students who need special education services including door-to-door transportation or individual bus monitors. “I honestly don’t know what to expect now and am concerned for families that don’t have the work flexibility, income, or resources to secure alternative transportation,” said Roxi Harvey, who chairs the council.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Wednesday proposed spending $200 million in federal pandemic relief funding to replace lead water pipes across the state, where aging underground infrastructure was exposed by Flint’s disaster. The plan, if approved by the Legislature, would set aside $20 million to replace all the lines in Benton Harbor in five years. The majority-Black city in the state’s southwestern corner has been exceeding the federal lead limit since 2018. That year, Michigan began enforcing the nation’s strictest rules for lead in drinking water in the wake of the crisis in Flint, another impoverished city with a majority-Black population. The regulations will result in replacing every lead service pipe statewide by 2041 unless a utility can show regulators it will take longer. The proposal would expand upon a water plan Whitmer announced nearly a year ago, including $102 million to replace lead service lines in disadvantaged communities. In June, Republicans who control the Senate unveiled a $2.5 billion water infrastructure proposal that would be funded primarily with federal COVID-19 aid. Their plan includes $600 million for pipe replacements, triple what the governor is seeking. Whitmer said more money is needed to replace all pipes but noted an infrastructure agenda pending in Congress.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: A prominent GOP donor who is charged with multiple counts of sex trafficking is now being sued by an underage girl who says he used her for sex acts, then offered her money to keep her from talking about it. The lawsuit filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court alleges that Anton Lazzaro’s attorneys offered $1,000 in hush money to the girl and her parents to keep them quiet and asked them to sign a nondisclosure agreement. The girl’s father refused and instead went to law enforcement, said their attorney, Jeff Anderson. The lawsuit, which also lists the girl’s parents as plaintiffs, alleges Lazzaro used his “power, wealth, influence, connections, and resources to recruit children … so that he could prey on them. When it became clear that Lazzaro had committed serious crimes, he attempted to coerce his victims and their families into keeping silent.” Lazzaro, 30, was charged in August with five counts of sex trafficking of minors, one count of attempted sex trafficking of a minor, one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors and three counts of obstruction. His attorney has said he is being falsely accused. St. Thomas University student Gisela Castro Medina, 19, the former chairwoman of the school’s Republican Party chapter, also faces criminal charges for allegedly recruiting girls for Lazzaro.\n\nMississippi\n\nHattiesburg: An exhibit about blues legends and juke joints is opening soon, designed to appeal to the eyes, hands and ears. A Cast of Blues will be on display starting Saturday and running through Oct. 9 at the Historic Eureka School in Hattiesburg. It features 15 resin-cast masks of blues legends and photographs of blues performers and juke joints made by Mississippi artists. Sharon McConnell-Dickerson created the resin-cast masks, and the photographs were taken by Ken Murphy. McConnell-Dickerson, who is visually impaired, said the casts are like 3-D photographs for people who are blind. “It captures the flesh, muscle, bone, hair and subtle expressions of emotion,” she said. “I wanted to discover the faces behind the music I love, so I went to Mississippi to map out the visages of the real Delta blues men and women.” The exhibit features Braille labels, a music playlist and a closed-captioned film about the Cast of Blues project. Visitors are encouraged to touch the masks, McConnell-Dickerson said. Among the artists spotlighted are Bo Diddley and Bobby Rush. The exhibit is also accompanied by the 2008 documentary film “M for Mississippi: A Road Trip through the Birthplace of the Blues.”\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Several people have been treated in emergency rooms after taking the anti-parasitic drug ivermectin, even as experts warn of dangerous side effects and a lack of proof that it helps treat COVID-19. Dr. Steven Brown told KMOV-TV that cases of ivermectin toxicity have occurred at Mercy hospitals across the state. “People who are relying upon ivermectin and remaining unvaccinated are under a tremendous false sense of security,” Brown said. “I have seen people with ivermectin toxicity in the emergency room from taking the animal formulation. I’ve seen people who relied on ivermectin to prevent themselves from getting COVID who are on ventilators and who have died.” This week, the American Medical Association and two pharmacist groups urged physicians, pharmacists and other prescribers to warn patients against using ivermectin, a decades-old drug used to killed worms and other parasites in humans and animals. Large studies are underway in the U.S. and overseas to determine if the drug has any effect on preventing or reducing the effects of COVID-19. Ivermectin has been promoted by GOP lawmakers, conservative talk show hosts and some doctors, amplified via social media to millions still resistant to vacines. It has also been widely used in some other countries such as India and Brazil.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state’s Republican attorney general is asking a court to dismiss a lawsuit filed by Planned Parenthood last month seeking to block four new laws that would restrict access to abortion in the state. The laws, set to take effect Oct. 1, would ban abortion after 20 weeks of gestation; restrict access to abortion pills; require abortion providers to ask patients if they would like to view an ultrasound; and prohibit insurance plans that cover abortion procedures from being offered on the federal exchange. The lawsuit filed in Yellowstone District Court names Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen as a defendant. The state is represented in the case by the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian legal group. The state asked Tuesday for the court to reject Planned Parenthood’s request to block the laws before they take effect, saying the laws will “help minimize the medical risks” during pregnancy. But medical experts and abortion advocates broadly dispute that the new laws would make the procedure safer. The suit claims the laws violate the Montana Constitution, which protects access to abortion before the fetus is viable, generally at 24 weeks gestation. It says the laws will reduce the number of locations where abortion services are offered and threaten providers with civil and criminal penalties.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A segment of the Henry Doorly Zoo was cleared out and visitors were warned to remain inside buildings after a 5,000-pound rhinoceros briefly escaped its enclosure, officials there confirmed. The incident happened Tuesday afternoon, when zookeepers spotted an Indian rhino named Jontu outside his enclosure grazing on grass in an area adjacent to the rhino barn that’s not open to the public, the Omaha World-Herald reports. Visitors were asked to leave the area or shelter in buildings, and the zoo’s carousel and aviary were cleared of guests as a precaution. Dan Cassidy, the zoo’s vice president of animal management, said staff quickly pulled in trucks to serve as a barricade around the area to keep the rhino from wandering and used apples and leafy greens to lure him back in the barn. In all, the rhino was outside the enclosure for about 40 minutes, Cassidy said. The animal never showed any signs of aggression while outside the barn, and the public was not in danger, Cassidy said. Vets were on hand with tranquilizer guns to be used as a last resort if needed. Zoo officials believe Jontu used his nose to push open a latch on a door that wasn’t locked properly. Cassidy said staff will critique the process of corralling the rhino and are considering changing the lock on the door from which he escaped.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The president of the school board for metro Las Vegas says she’s received death threats since the district approved a requirement for employees to get COVID-19 vaccinations. Clark County School District Board of Trustees President Linda Cavazos said on Twitter that the threats had “very disturbing images” but that she and her colleagues were continuing to do their jobs, KVVU-TV reports. “We have no time for hate,” she said. The district board voted Sept. 1 for a vaccination requirement that the district superintendent will draft and implement. The district hasn’t yet released details of the mandate. As approved by the board, the plan will include a process for requesting accommodations for medical conditions or for sincerely held religious beliefs. Amid talk of a protest against the mandate, the district said Tuesday that staff member absences were about double from the day after Labor Day in 2019. The district said the callouts accounted for less than 5% of the CCSD workforce and noted that staff could have called out for a variety of reasons.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nStratham: A family that lost a nearly 185-year-old barn on their farm that’s been the backdrop for political events for Republican politicians has sunflowers in the spot for now and recently celebrated a grand reopening. The fire burned down a four-story, 80-foot-long barn at the Scamman Farm in Stratham in May. “It’s just so beautiful, and we’ve been getting a lot of phone calls through the summer asking if they can come take photos in the sunflower patch,” farm manager Sue Fernholz said. “It shows that there’s beauty in life after tragedy.” Fernholz said the sunflowers were planted to pay tribute to the sister of a family friend who died last year. The farm, which reopened last week, also features corn mazes, hayrides, pumpkin patch and other attractions. The family still plans to rebuild the barn once two other buildings are repaired. “We’re going to take the winter to figure out what our needs are (for the new barn),” Kirk Scamman said. Former Presidents George W. Bush and his father, George H.W. Bush, had visited the farm. Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, launched his campaign there, and Republican Scott Brown announced his U.S. Senate run there in 2014.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nFair Lawn: One school district is getting creative with ways to allow students to get mask-free fresh air during the day. The Fair Lawn district has set up 32 tents at its 10 schools for outdoor lunch, and at Fair Lawn High School, two additional tents are available for outdoor classes, said Superintendent Nicholas Norcia. The first day of school last Friday had a delayed start because of flooding, and the schools have been closed this week until Thursday for the Rosh Hashana holiday. The principals will be working with teachers to determine a schedule for outdoor classrooms so that everyone can get a chance to use them, Norcia said. On Friday, Norcia visited a few schools. “The students were excited to be outside in beautiful weather, eating lunch,” he said. “They were having the best time ever, and it was so great to see.” As of now, the schedule will allow for half the students to eat lunch outside while the other half are inside, and they will rotate. While in the tents, students don’t need to wear masks, Norcia said. Meanwhile, some school districts along the Jersey shore have been lifting mask mandates, citing excessive heat and insufficient air conditioning in classrooms.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: An expansion of nonmerit scholarships to college and greater spending to safeguard abandoned oil wells in the state are among the governor’s new spending priorities, amid a windfall in income linked to federal pandemic relief and petroleum production. September marks the outset of the Legislature’s grueling budget-writing process for the year beginning July 1, 2022. Several executive agencies overseen by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham are making the case for expanded services. Lujan Grisham spokesman Tripp Stelnicki said Tuesday that the inclination is to “aim high” and “make the most of the opportunity we have to finish the work of rebuilding state government services after so many years of forced austerity.” The Human Services Department is suggesting a $100 million spending increase on Medicaid and related mental health services alone, for total annual general fund spending of $1.26 billion on the program. State income for the coming fiscal year is expected to outpace routine annual spending obligations by $1.4 billion, or 19% of annual general fund spending obligations. That leaves lawmakers more money than ever before to spend on education, roads, public safety and other government programs.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The remains of two people who died in the Sept. 11 terrorist attack at the World Trade Center were positively identified this week, as officials continued the difficult and heart-wrenching task of returning victims to their families. The announcement came days before the 20th anniversary of an attack that killed nearly 3,000 people when hijacked commercial jets flew into the twin towers, struck the Pentagon and crashed into a Pennsylvania meadow. “No matter how much time passes since Sept. 11, 2001, we will never forget, and we pledge to use all the tools at our disposal to make sure all those who were lost can be reunited with their families,” said Dr. Barbara A. Sampson, the chief medical examiner of the city of New York. Technicians in the medical examiner’s office have been working for years to match thousands of body fragments recovered from the World Trade Center rubble with known victims but haven’t been able to extract useable DNA in many cases. The identifications announced Tuesday were the first since October 2019. One set of remains was linked to Dorothy Morgan, of Hempstead, New York, who was a broker for Marsh & McLennan. Officials also matched remains recovered in 2001, 2002 and 2006 to a single victim, whose family asked that his name be withheld.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: President Joe Biden approved a request Wednesday for federal funds to be made available to residents of western North Carolina who saw major flooding last month due to Tropical Storm Fred. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper sought the emergency declaration for federal assistance to seven counties nearly two weeks ago. “This federal disaster declaration will help provide assistance for Western North Carolina communities to rebuild stronger and smarter, and I appreciate the president’s approval of our request,” Cooper said in a statement. The storm claimed the lives of six people in Haywood County, caused major damage to more than 200 homes and led to nearly $19 million in estimated damages to public infrastructure. The Cruso community was among those hardest-hit by the flooding. Wednesday’s approval from Biden and the Federal Emergency Management Agency frees up money to residents of Buncombe, Haywood and Transylvania counties. State, tribal and eligible local governments and certain nonprofit organizations also qualify for federal funds on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work performed in the three areas, as well as Avery, Madison, Watauga and Yancey counties.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: State health officials took to an internet town hall Tuesday to promote certain treatments for COVID-19 and discourage use of an anti-parasitic medicine. Ivermectin has a limited scope for human treatment, sometimes prescribed for worms, scabies and head lice. It is more popular in veterinary form as a treatment for parasitic infections and infestations in cows and horses. North Dakota health officials say data on ivermectin sickness is limited, and poison control has only documented a couple of such cases. But Dr. Joshua Ranum of West River Regional Medical Center said the stories are out there. “The ivermectin issue is interesting,” Ranum said. “We of course live out in farm and ranch country. I’ve had a lot of people tell me that the cows didn’t get their full dose of ivermectin because some of it accidentally went down the hatch.” The veterinary form of ivermectin has high concentrations of the drug because of the high body mass of horses and cows. Adverse effects in humans include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, decreased consciousness, confusion, hallucinations, seizures, coma and death. There are better and safer options, according to Ranum and state Health Department spokesman Kirby Kruger. They pointed to monoclonal antibody drugs, steroids and antivirals like remdesivir.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Republican lawmakers plan to unveil their version of a newly drawn map of legislative districts Thursday morning, with a vote planned later in the day on a final version, the state Senate president said. The Ohio Redistricting Commission, charged with drawing a map good for as long as 10 years, missed its Sept. 1 deadline, triggering an extension until the middle of the month. Senate Democrats submitted their proposed map last week. The map to be presented Thursday morning was created by House and Senate Republicans, said Senate President Matt Huffman, R-Lima. Some of the GOP map is almost identical to the Senate Democrats’ version, he said. The commission will vote on a final version of its proposed map Thursday afternoon, Huffman said. The commission held nine public hearings around the state earlier this month looking for input on a new map, which is meant to end the current gerrymandered maps. Voters approved constitutional amendments in 2015 and 2018 that created a new process for drawing both state legislative and congressional district maps this year and set up the independent commission. Creating a 10-year map requires a majority vote of the commission, including both Democrats. Creating a four-year map requires a simple majority without both Democrats.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt has removed the only two physicians from the board that oversees the state’s Medicaid agency, just a week after the board voted 7-1 to delay implementing rules on Stitt’s plan to privatize some Medicaid services. Dr. Jean Hausheer said Tuesday that both she and Dr. Laura Shamblin, an Oklahoma City pediatrician, were informed Saturday by a staffer in the governor’s office that they were being removed from the governing board of the Oklahoma Health Care Authority. Hausheer, an ophthalmologist from Lawton, said neither she nor Shamblin was told why they were being removed, and Stitt spokeswoman Carly Atchison didn’t immediately respond to questions about his decision. “The governor has my cellphone number … it is kind of odd that he didn’t contact me himself,” Hausheer said. “I’m going to presume it was because of our last board meeting.” Hausheer and Shamblin were among seven members of the board who voted last week to delay implementing rules on Stitt’s plan to outsource case management for some Medicaid recipients to private insurance companies. Stitt’s managed care proposal has faced bipartisan opposition in the Legislature and was ruled unconstitutional in June by the Oklahoma Supreme Court.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Because of new guidance, city officials may need to exempt the police bureau from an order that all employees be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 or risk losing their jobs. The city attorney’s office said Tuesday that the order requiring police to be inoculated is now legally dubious because of new guidance from the Oregon Health Authority, Oregon Public Broadcasting reports. Under state law, local municipalities can only issue vaccine mandates for police officers if a federal or state rule requires it. The city believed Gov. Kate Brown’s vaccination mandate issued last month for state health care workers covered officers because they receive some medical training. But the new guidance related to Brown’s vaccine mandate said law enforcement was “probably not” subject to the governor’s orders, as providing medical care was “likely not a fundamental part of their job.” The city’s police union previously said a vaccine requirement would lead to mass resignations. The Portland Police Bureau has said it does not track vaccination rates for its officers. The city as of Tuesday had not publicly announced any change in policy regarding the vaccination mandate. Multnomah County, like Portland, has ordered all employees to be vaccinated by Oct. 18, including the sheriff’s office.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A statewide mask mandate for schools went into effect Tuesday, with some districts in open defiance of the Wolf administration, while GOP leaders in the state House planned to come back to Harrisburg early to mount a legislative response. The state health secretary’s order that students, staff and visitors at K-12 schools and child care facilities are required to wear masks while indoors, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status, has provoked outrage from some parents, students and school board members who say the decision should remain local. Some districts faced anti-mask protests as students returned to class after the long Labor Day weekend. Meanwhile, the Tamaqua Area School Board in Schuylkill County flouted the mask mandate by voting to keep face coverings optional. The superintendent of Hamburg Area School District in Berks County said masks would remain optional pending the outcome of a special school board meeting to discuss the statewide mandate. Late Tuesday, the board voted 5-3 to adhere to the Department of Health order and require masks, WFMZ reports. In central Pennsylvania, the Central York School Board expressed disdain for the mask mandate and said it would give a “grace period” for students to come into compliance.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Local police organizations are questioning Mayor Jorge O. Elorza’s judgment after he hired a civilian with no experience in law enforcement to be the city’s first-ever police major instead of considering the Black officers who applied for the position. Elorza chose Michael Stephens, who has no experience in law enforcement, aside from graduating from the citizens academy in 2016. Stephens was a recreation director and NCAA referee before his appointment as police major, The Boston Globe reports. The National Association of Black Law Enforcement Officers Chairman Charles Wilson said the mayor’s decision in appointing a civilian without experience over qualified Black law enforcement officers was demeaning. Stephens is also Black. Stephens will manage oversight on police training and be responsible for the recruitment and training of police recruits. According to Wilson, three Black officers applied for the major’s position. The mayor chose Elorza instead. Providence City Council President John Igliozzi proposed that the mayor change the job title from police major to public safety community-police liaison because of the backlash from the police organizations.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Authorities shut down a road for more than an hour Tuesday to investigate a bomb threat that turned out to be a wedding dress, Charleston Police said. Someone who saw a woman cram an oversized package into a mailbox called 911, Charleston Police spokesman Charles Francis said in a statement. Officers responded and determined the package contained a wedding dress that a woman was trying to return by mail, Francis said. The road was reopened after more than an hour. The statement did not say if the wedding dress was damaged.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The City Council has capped the number of retail stores that can sell medical marijuana at five. The council signed off Tuesday night on a proposal coming from Mayor Paul TenHaken’s office. But council members halved the $100,000 license fee that City Hall wanted and will allow the licenses to be sold on the secondary market. “The Sioux Falls City Council, by making a license worth $50,000 and transferrable, has just made dispensary licenses into liquor licenses,” Drew Duncan, a Sioux Falls attorney and lobbyist for clients in South Dakota’s gambling and alcohol industry, said via social media following the 7-1 vote. A new liquor license in Sioux Falls costs about $200,000, but a state-set cap on the number of them has driven up the price on the secondary market to $300,000 or higher. TenHaken and supporters of barring the transfer of dispensary licenses worry that allowing them to be sold on the secondary market will give them an artificial value, just as has happened with liquor licenses. But the majority of the council decided without allowing a license to be owned outright, the city’s medical marijuana rules would unduly restrict a retailer’s ability to grow their business.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A panel has approved $65 million in state incentives for Oracle Corp. as the company plans to bring 8,500 jobs and an investment topping $1 billion to the fast-growing capital city over the coming decade. The State Funding Board’s approval of the FastTrack grant came during a meeting Tuesday. In April, Nashville Mayor John Cooper’s office announced that the Austin, Texas-based computer technology company plans to build the new campus with 1.2 million square feet of office space. Documents show the jobs will have an average salary of $110,000. Oracle paid $254 million for 60 acres and is offering $175 million upfront for public infrastructure, including a pedestrian bridge over the Cumberland River, environmental cleanup, a sewer pump station and a riverfront park, the mayor’s office has said. Half of Oracle’s future property taxes – which the company estimates will be roughly $18 million annually when the project is fully built – would reimburse the company for the upfront investment, without interest payments, with the other half going into the city’s general operating fund, Cooper’s office has said. The move would surpass the expansion of Amazon, which in 2018 announced it would bring 5,000 jobs through a $230 million investment.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: Gov. Greg Abbott on Tuesday defended a new state law banning most abortions that also does not provide exceptions for cases of rape or incest, saying it does not force victims to give birth – even though it prohibits abortions before many women know they’re pregnant. Abbott, a Republican, said Texas would strive to “eliminate all rapists from the streets” while taking questions during his first press conference since the law took effect last week. The comments drew new criticism from opponents of the biggest curb on abortion in the U.S. since the medical procedure was legalized a half-century ago. The Texas law prohibits abortions once medical professionals can detect cardiac activity, which is usually about six weeks into a pregnancy. Though abortion providers in Texas say the law is unconstitutional, they say they are abiding by it. “His comments are confusing to me because they certainly do not seem to reflect the realities of this law,” said Amy Jones, the chief executive officer of the Dallas Area Rape Crisis Center. Recent surveys by the U.S. Department of Justice found that most rapes go unreported to police. “Certainly it is in our mission statement to work to end sexual violence – that is why we exist – but we are also very aware that that is an aspirational goal that yes, we do believe that this is a preventable crime, but it if it were that easy, rape would no longer exist,” Jones said.\n\nUtah\n\nBrian Head: In the midst of record tourism statewide, Gov. Spencer Cox helped park staff and charity partners break ground Tuesday on a new visitor center at Cedar Breaks National Monument. The center has been a decade in the making, built with a combined $6 million in funds from fees, donations, and funding from Iron County, the National Park Service, the Zion Forever Project charity and organizations. Superintendent Kathleen Gondor did a “happy dance” as she opened the groundbreaking ceremony near the popular Point Supreme overlook, which is currently closed to the public because of the construction. “It’s just going to give us that sense of place instead of a bunch of pullouts along the road,” she said, echoing a sentiment that Cedar Breaks is a “drive-thru” park. Cox said there was “every right to be excited,” and he was glad to see partnerships work as visitation soars in the lesser-known park. “So many people even in Utah don’t know about it, still,” he said. “Americans are rediscovering America, and Utahns are rediscovering Utah.” But with increased visitors comes an increased responsibility to make sure those visitors have a good experience and recreate responsibly, something Cox said he hopes the visitor center will help people to do.\n\nVermont\n\nWaterbury: Three state troopers who are accused of being involved in a scheme to create fraudulent COVID-19 vaccination cards have resigned, state police said Tuesday. Troopers Shawn Sommers and Raymond Witkowski resigned Aug. 10, a day after a fellow trooper told supervisors about the alleged scheme. Trooper David Pfindel resigned Sept. 3 following further investigation, according to a state police news release. The three ex-troopers are suspected of having varying roles in the making of fraudulent vaccination cards, according to the release. “The accusations in this case involve an extraordinary level of misconduct – a criminal violation of the law – and I could not be more upset and disappointed,” Col. Matthew T. Birmingham, director of the Vermont State Police, said in the release. “If these allegations are proved to be true, it is reprehensible that state troopers would manipulate vaccination cards in the midst of a pandemic, when being vaccinated is one of the most important steps anyone can take to keep their community safe from COVID-19.” Sommers and Witkowski both joined the Vermont State Police in July 2016. Pfindel was hired in January 2014, police said. Federal authorities are investigating the allegations.\n\nVirginia\n\nDanville: A part of southside Virginia that has relatively lower rates of vaccination against COVID-19 is seeing increasing interest in the shots. The Danville Register & Bee reports that it appears the most recent surge in infections has spurred more residents to roll up their sleeves in the Pittsylvania-Danville Health District. Data from the Virginia Department of Health shows that inoculations jumped about 50% in August compared to July. Nearly two-thirds of the almost 5,700 shots were first doses. “Numbers of vaccinations are increasing as of late, which we welcome and consider a positive step by the community,” Dr. Scott Spillmann, director of the local health district, told the newspaper. “We ask everyone who is not yet fully vaccinated to do so as soon as possible.” Southside Virginia trails the rest of the state when it comes to vaccination rates. As of Friday, 51% of adults in Danville were fully inoculated. In Pittsylvania County, 47% of adults were fully vaccinated. Statewide, more than two-thirds of adults have received a full COVID-19 vaccine series. Meanwhile, Danville and Pittsylvania County combined are seeing about 52 new coronavirus infections a day because of the delta variant.\n\nWashington\n\nLongview: A recent increase in COVID-19 deaths has overwhelmed a southwest Washington county’s storage capacity, prompting the coroner to ask the commissioners to declare an emergency to allow the county to bring in a refrigeration trailer. Cowlitz County commissioners agreed Tuesday to the request to help expand capacity until the new morgue is ready for staff to move into in about a month. The Daily News reports Cowlitz County Health and Human Services data for the past week is incomplete, but at least eight county residents died due to COVID-19 between Aug. 31 and Sept. 6. The residents ranged in age from their 40s to 90s, and seven of the residents had been hospitalized. Coroner Tim Davidson said the morgue and the county’s funeral homes are maxed out on capacity, and they are “being creative” to maintain cold storage. All together, the facilities can typically hold 45 bodies and right now have about 65, he said. “We’re just doing our best that we can to preserve the dignity of the deceased from this point forward until they can be processed for their families,” Davidson said. The morgue can hold 10 bodies but is currently “way above that,” using gurney tables in the cooling rooms to handle the increase, he said. The new morgue under construction will be able to hold 50 in cold storage.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nFayetteville: The state’s largest annual festival will require most people in attendance to wear masks when Bridge Day is held this fall amid the coronavirus pandemic in America’s newest national park. Tens of thousands of people typically show up on the third Saturday of October to watch parachutists, zip liners and rappellers on the 876-foot-high New River Gorge Bridge in Fayetteville. Masks will be required at the festival regardless of vaccination status, and social distancing must be observed whenever possible, the Bridge Day Commission said in a statement. People come from across the world to attend the event. Festivalgoers typically line the center of the 3,000-foot-long bridge shoulder-to-shoulder trying to get a good look at parachutists catapulting themselves off the nation’s third-highest bridge. Exceptions to the mask mandate include those at the time of their participation – be it in the air, during a 5-kilometer run, while rafting in the New River or on a zip line. But they’ll have to mask up before and after, the statement said. Social distancing will be next to impossible on the crowded bridge itself, but organizers said it will be required on the festival’s perimeters. Bridge Day is the only day of the year the bridge is open to pedestrian traffic. The pandemic forced last year’s event to be canceled.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A new report suggests people are buying dramatically more alcohol as the COVID-19 pandemic drags on. Revenue from state excise taxes on alcohol during the fiscal year that ended June 30 totaled $73.8 million, up almost 17% from $63.3 million the previous year, according to preliminary data from the state Department of Revenue cited in the report from the nonpartisan Wisconsin Policy Forum. If the preliminary data holds, the increase would be the biggest proportional increase the state has seen since 1972, the report said. The rise in alcohol tax collection exceeded 2.4% in only one year between 2009 and 2020, the report said. Alcohol excise taxes in Wisconsin are based on the volume sold, not price. Beer is taxed at about 6.5 cents per gallon. Wine is taxed at 25 cents per gallon if it has an alcohol content of 14% or less. The report did not examine sales tax revenue on alcohol. Most states have seen a bump in alcohol tax revenues during fiscal year 2021. The report said increased alcohol consumption is “perhaps unsurprising” given rising stress related to personal health, job losses, school challenges and a lack of leisure activities during the pandemic.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Wyoming Supreme Court Justice Michael K. Davis plans to retire in January, opening the way for Gov. Mark Gordon to make his first appointment to the high court. Davis plans to retire Jan. 16 after a decade on the state’s highest court, Chief Justice Kate M. Fox said in a statement Tuesday. Davis served as chief justice for three years, stepping down from that role July 1. He was a state district judge for four years before being named to the Supreme Court. He previously was an attorney in private practice. He graduated with honors from the University of Wyoming law school in 1980. Former Gov. Matt Mead, a Republican, named all five current justices over his two terms in office. Gordon, also a Republican, will choose the next justice from a list of three names submitted to him by the state Judicial Nominating Commission. The commission plans to accept expressions of interest from qualified people through Oct. 1. Wyoming requires Supreme Court justices to be at least 30, “learned in the law,” a judge or attorney for at least nine years, a U.S. citizen and a Wyoming resident for at least three years.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/07/20/fire-ants-elvis-presley-lake-flash-flood-rescue-news-around-states/117579112/", "title": "Fire ants, Elvis Presley Lake, flash flood rescue: News from around ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Alabama is turning to social media to encourage more people to get vaccinated against COVID-19. The Department of Public Health announced a TikTok contest to encourage young people to get vaccinated before the start of the school year. The contest is for people ages 13 to 29. To participate, contestants should submit a TikTok video showing themselves getting vaccinated or include a creative message explaining, “This is why I got vaccinated.” All videos must tag @alcovidvaccine, #getvaccinatedAL and #ADPH. Winners will be determined based on creativity, originality and popularity measured by the numbers of likes and shares. The videos should be submitted by Aug. 6. Advertising professionals and department staff will select four winners who will each receive a $250 Visa gift card. Winners will be announced Aug. 13 on the @alcovidvaccine TikTok account and promoted on Department of Public Health social media. Complete contest rules, information and guidance about COVID-19 can be found www.alabamapublichealth.gov/covid19vaccine/tiktok.html.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Alaska had about 17,000 more jobs last month than it did in June 2020, with most industries seeing gains over that period but still falling below prepandemic levels, a report released by the state labor department showed. The state had about 30,600 fewer jobs last month than in June 2019, according to the report. Industries hit hard during 2020 saw big gains in the new report, the department said. For example, there were 4,500 more jobs in leisure and hospitality last month than a year earlier and 4,200 more in the trade, transportation and utilities sector. However, there were 11,300 fewer jobs in leisure and hospitality last month than in June 2019 and 6,300 fewer in trade, transportation and utilities, according to the report. Health care employment and construction were up from June 2020 and equaled their June 2019 numbers. Manufacturing, which the department said is mainly seafood processing, had 1,200 more jobs last month than a year earlier and 100 fewer than in June 2019.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Gov. Doug Ducey announced he’s using $101.1 million of federal relief funding to launch a new program to encourage more tourism spending in the state and help the hospitality industry recover from the pandemic. The Visit Arizona Initiative will use the American Rescue Plan money to help the tourism sector of the state’s economy to prosper and “continue to recover from the effects of the pandemic,” Ducey said in a statement. Examples of planned funding uses include destination and travel marketing, local programs and events, state park improvements, Arizona State Fair marketing and a workplace initiative for the hospitality industry. Ducey’s move to bolster the tourism industry followed his announcement that he was tapping federal cash from the American Rescue Plan to refill the state unemployment insurance trust fund.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith:The Arkansas Department of Agriculture has added Sebastian, Logan, Prairie and White counties to a state quarantine to try and prevent the spread of fire ants. The designation means people cannot remove any of the following items from the quarantine zone without treating them: nursery stock with soil or potting media, grass sod, baled hay stored in contact with the soil, baled straw stored in contact with the soil, as well as soil and used soil-moving equipment. There are 43 counties in the quarantine, according to the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture. Paul Shell, a plant inspection and quarantine program manager with the Arkansas Department of Agriculture, estimated that fire ants have been present in the state since the 1980s. Fire ants spread naturally through flight but can also spread when people move soil. Fire ants can inflict painful stings multiple times and can cause allergic reactions including anaphylactic shock.\n\nCalifornia\n\nPetrolia: A 5.1 magnitude earthquake struck off the northern California coast late Saturday. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the earthquake just before midnight was about 7.5 miles west of Petrolia in Humboldt County and 35 miles southwest of Eureka. The depth was just over 18.5 miles. The shaking could be felt as far south as San Francisco and as far east as beyond Yuba City, according to reports submitted to the USGS. Further details weren’t immediately available.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: The north end of Denver International Airport’s terminal is about to become unrecognizable when the Hensel Phelps construction firm begins building new security checkpoints as the Great Hall improvements reach Phase 2. Plans call for three escalators to move people from the new sixth-floor security station directly to the train platform. Improvement should be functioning by the beginning of 2024, said outgoing airport CEO Kim Day, who retired Friday after 13 years at the helm. Phase 1 included expanding the number of gates by 39, adding four additional restrooms and improving the check-in stations for Southwest, United Airlines and Frontier Airlines. The new check-in points are now on Level 6, above the existing TSA security checkpoints. Hensel Phelps took over for the previous general contractor, which was fired two years ago after delays and cost overruns. The new security area is to include “state of the art” screening technology, new line processes and streamlined procedures, Day said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nStamford: Former Major League Baseball player and manager Bobby Valentine has raised about $300,000 for his independent campaign for mayor of Stamford since announcing his bid in May, including donations from former President George W. Bush and other high-profile Republicans. Bush gave $500 to Valentine’s campaign, Hearst Connecticut Media reported Saturday, citing financial disclosures. Bush was managing partner of the Texas Rangers in 1992 when the team fired Valentine as manager. Valentine, a Stamford native, also received $1,000 maximum contributions from Anthony Scaramucci, who briefly served as White House communications director for former President Donald Trump, and Linda McMahon, former administrator of the Small Business Administration under Trump and former chief executive of Stamford-based World Wrestling Entertainment. The $300,000 in individual contributions is more than the two Democrats running for mayor raised during the first half of this year, the records showed. Democratic Mayor David Martin has collected more than $78,000 in individual donations as he seeks a third term, and state Rep. Caroline Simmons has raised nearly $140,000.\n\nDelaware\n\nDewey Beach:The city has opted to triple its police department’s liability insurance, noting a rise in civil rights lawsuits. The Dewey Beach Town Council voted recently to increase the coverage from $1 million to $3 million, the News Journal reported. “I think it’s prudent for the town to consider upping the amount to protect us, so, God forbid, something happened we wouldn’t have to liquidate any town assets,” said Police Chief Sam Mackert during a July 9 council meeting. Mackert said he has been watching other towns across the country pay settlements far beyond Dewey Beach’s policy limit. The town has a total budget under $4 million. The increase in coverage will lead to a hike in its premium. The town already had some money budgeted for it and will use funds from its real estate transfer tax to help make up the difference, the newspaper reported. “You hope and pray that you never have to use it,” Commissioner Paul Bauer said. “But better safe than sorry.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:The Golden Triangle Business Improvement District told WUSA9-TV last week that small businesses could receive multiple months of free rent as part of a new program to help the area recover from a high number of vacant office and retail spaces. The Golden Triangle area stretches 44 square blocks from Dupont Circle to Pennsylvania Avenue. A spokesperson for the Golden Triangle Business Improvement District said the area encompasses 34 million square feet of office space and can attract almost 90,000 workers a day. However, the pandemic brought closures and forced many of the workers to work remotely. Buildings that usually bustled with activity had only about 8% occupancy for months, according to BID data, and pedestrian counts were down 90%. Over a year after the pandemic spread to the district, the group said the Golden Triangle has 122 vacant office and retail spaces. By fall, the spokesperson said the group hoped to get the area back on track to where it once was before businesses and workers left.\n\nFlorida\n\nNew Smyrna Beach: A man is facing animal cruelty and other charges after investigators said he attacked and seriously wounded a dog with a machete. An affidavit by a Volusia County sheriff’s deputy said Richard Nelson, 46, injured the dog during a confrontation earlier this month outside a New Smyrna Beach home. Nelson is also charged with falsely telling deputies he acted in self-defense when the dog attacked him first. Nelson was arrested Friday and released on his own recognizance the next day, court records showed. No attorney is listed to speak for Nelson, who authorities said has no fixed address. According to the affidavit, Nelson and the dog had issues in the past. Initially, Nelson told investigators the dog ran at him unprovoked and bit him, leading to his decision to use the machete. Video evidence, however, showed that Nelson stood up aggressively when the dog approached, striking the dog several times with the machete as he chased the animal around the yard, the affidavit said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nWarner Robins: A thriving Black community established in the 1940s for African American workers at Robins Air Force Base has been commemorated with a historic marker. The new plaque in Warner Robins – unveiled last month – celebrates the Jody Town Community, a segregated neighborhood that became a hub for Black life in the area before an urban renewal plan in the 1970s led to its destruction, The Telegraph newspaper reported. Johnson-Granville recalled going to an ice cream shop in the neighborhood and learning how to sew and bake cookies with her Girl Scout troop there. The Dodgers scouted players at a park where the Warner Robins Jets baseball team played, she said. But an urban renewal project in the 1970s supported by a federal grant displaced residents and brought down buildings. The neighborhood disappeared. Johnson-Granville called the marker “a symbol of what our ancestors did in the past.” The marker is the latest addition to the Georgia Civil Rights Trail, an initiative led by the Georgia Historical Society that aims to commemorate key events during the Civil Rights movement.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: A federal judge ruled Maui County must get permits to operate injection wells that environmental groups said are polluting the ocean. Several environmental groups filed a lawsuit in 2012 over the injection wells, saying effluent from the Lahaina Wastewater Reclamation Facility was entering the ocean and damaging coral reefs and sea life. The groups pointed to studies that traced the discharge from two wells to the ocean. In a ruling Thursday, U.S. District Judge Susan Oki Mollway sided with the environmental groups and ordered Maui County to “obtain a permit under the Clean Water Act consistent with the analysis established by the Supreme Court,” The Maui News reported. Maui county officials had refused to settle the case and brought it to the Supreme Court in 2019. The Supreme Court in April 2020 ruled that injection wells fall under the Clean Water Act. The county argued that treated wastewater from injection wells did not require permits under the Clean Water Act because the discharge did not go directly into the ocean.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Anti-government activist Ammon Bundy has asked a judge to throw out his conviction for trespassing at the Idaho Capitol and acquit him instead because he said the state’s trespassing law should not be applied to public property. Idaho’s courts, like many states, allow defendants to ask the judge for an acquittal within several days of a jury verdict. The move is seldom made, however, and rarely successful. It stems from Bundy’s arrest on Aug. 25, 2020, after he refused to leave an auditorium in the Statehouse after officials ordered it to be cleared. Officers also said he went limp and refused to stand up and put his hands behind his back. Officers ultimately wheeled him out of the Capitol building on a swivel chair. The arrest came during a special session of the Idaho Legislature that was called so lawmakers could address issues related to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIllinois\n\nMarion: Authorities in southern Illinois are investigating after skeletal remains were found at a wildlife refuge. The Williamson County Sheriff’s Office was working with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Illinois State Police and the county coroner. The remains were found Thursday at the Crab Orchard National Wildlife Refuge, according to a news release. No further details were released. The roughly 44,000-acre refuge includes hardwood and pine forests, croplands, grasslands rolling hills and several lakes.\n\nIndiana\n\nCharlestown:Hundreds of people turned out for an auction at a former Indiana wildlife center where the ex-proprietor and his ex-wife were found to have violated the Endangered Species Act by taking and wounding animals, including tigers and lions. A federal judge in June ordered Timothy Stark and his ex-wife, Melissa Lane, to pay more than $700,000 to People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals for attorney fees from the group’s successful lawsuit against the pair. Stark gained attention last year as one of the people in the Netflix true-crime series “Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness.” Along with volunteers, he operated the Wildlife in Need center in southern Indiana for more than 20 years. They showed off hundreds of exotic animals at the roadside center, charging admission of $25 or more. On Saturday, more than 7 acres of land, several buildings and a four-bedroom frame home were up for sale, the Indianapolis Star reported. Personal property including a Polar King walk-in freezer and refrigerator, trucks, trailers and ATVs also were auctioned.\n\nIowa\n\nShenandoah: The Pella Windows & Doors company plans to shift more window production to its southwest Iowa factory and hire 120 additional workers in Shenandoah. Company officials said they plan to move production of their wooden double-hung windows to Shenandoah from a factory in Macomb, Illinois, according to The Des Moines Register. The Iowa Economic Development Authority agreed to give the company a forgivable $200,000 loan to help pay for the move. In return, the company said it plans to spend $5.6 million on equipment for the new lines, and the new jobs will pay at least $20.58 an hour, state officials said. The city of Shenandoah is also providing a $40,000 forgivable loan. Pella already employs about 300 people at the plant in Shenandoah. That will grow to more than 400 once the change is made.\n\nKansas\n\nManhattan: Kansas State University will require that first-year students to live on campus starting in the fall of 2022. The university said in a news release the requirement aims to enhance student success. Thomas Lane, vice president for student life and dean of students, said data showed the university’s first-year students who live on campus have higher grade-point averages, stay in school in higher numbers and graduate faster. The retention rate for freshmen who lived on campus in the fall of 2018 was 87.6%, compared to 79.9% for those who did not. For the fall of 2019, the university found that 5% more first-year students who lived on campus stayed in school than those who lived off campus. Kansas State will join all other institutions in the Kansas Regents system, with the exception of the University of Kansas, in requiring freshmen to live on campus. Students can apply for an exemption to the policy.\n\nKentucky\n\nCadiz: A riverboat stuck in Lake Barkley for more than a week was freed Friday, the U.S. Coast Guard said. The American Jazz, with 120 passengers and 54 crew members, became stuck on a sandbar last week while on a seven-night cruise between Memphis and Nashville, Tennessee, according to its operator, American Cruise Lines. The passengers were moved off the ship and transported to a Nashville hotel on July 9. The boat was not damaged. The boat was left in full reverse for about three hours Friday while a towing vessel pushed on it, and after taking a break, the boat worked itself free around 3:20 p.m., said Lt. Phillip Baxter of the Coast Guard in Paducah. The American Jazz’s hull was being inspected to make sure there was no damage or water going in before sending it on its way, Baxter said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Bagpipes played as an honor guard carried the flag-draped casket bearing the body of former Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards down the steps of Louisiana’s towering state Capitol on Sunday and loaded it onto a horse-drawn carriage for transport to his funeral site. The four-term former governor died at his home in Gonzales on July 12 at age 93 after placing himself in hospice care following bouts with respiratory illness. His body lay in honor Saturday at the Capitol, where members of the public were allowed to file by. The Southern University marching band was part of a procession that carried the body from the 34-story Capitol built in the 1930s, on a nearly mile-long route to the Old State Capitol, a 19th Century structure, where a private funeral ceremony for Edwards was held. Among the speakers was current Gov. John Bel Edwards – no relation – who praised Edwards as a consensus builder and deal-maker who modernized state government and worked hard to fund education and the state’s charity hospital system.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The percentage of Maine teenagers and 12-year-olds who have had at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine has exceeded 50%. Maine has been ahead of most of the country in vaccinating residents against COVID-19. The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday that about 51% of the state’s 12- to 19-year-old residents have had at least one dose, and about 47% have had a final dose. The rollout of vaccines to teens and adolescents has been much slower nationwide. Only about 14% of the U.S. population that is under 18 has had a first dose of the vaccine, according to data from the Mayo Clinic. In Maine, the percentage of the total population that is under 20 and has had at least one dose is about 22%, the Maine CDC reported. That includes people too young to receive a vaccine. More than two-thirds of Maine’s population old enough to receive a COVID-19 vaccine has received a final dose. That is one of the highest percentages in the country.\n\nMaryland\n\nHagerstown:Point Broadband, an internet provider based in Georgia, is expanding its a fiber optic network to the Hagerstown area. The company, which acquired Hagerstown Fiber a little more than a year ago, will offer internet and telephone service for homes and businesses. Clint Wiley, general manager of Point Broadband in Maryland, said part of the work has already started. Wiley, who owned Hagerstown Fiber, said the company had started building a fiber optic network in the city before being acquired by Point Broadband. “That initial build was successful. ... We’re obviously building from where we are in Hagerstown outwards,” he said, referring to a map of the planned coverage area, which stretches from the Pennsylvania state line south to Williamsport, and from just west of Hagerstown east to Smithsburg. It includes communities such as Maugansville, Halfway and Funkstown.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority is working with Boston and several other area communities to build nearly 5 miles of bus lanes and make other upgrades along crucial transit corridors, transportation officials said. The projects are designed to boost bus speed and reliability and in turn support economic growth as the region eases public health restrictions put in place during the coronavirus pandemic, the MBTA said in a statement. The work is also being done in Lynn, Brookline, Malden, Revere, and Somerville. “These quick-build projects aim to address transit delay on some of the region’s most congested roadways in order to improve bus travel time and reliability, and move more people more efficiently to support economic recovery and public health,” the T’s statement said.\n\nMichigan\n\nMackinaw City: A bomb scare closed the bridge connecting Michigan’s two peninsulas for about three hours on Sunday afternoon, authorities said. Law enforcement notified the Mackinac Bridge Authority of the threat and the bridge was closed in both directions at about 2:15 p.m., the authority said in a tweet. The Michigan State and Mackinaw City police investigated. Nothing was found after an “extensive search,” the authority said, and the bridge was reopened shortly after 5 p.m. The more than 26,300-foot structure is the longest suspension bridge in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nMinnesota\n\nEly: Superior National Forest officials said they are expanding their closure order for the popular Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness north of Ely because of the threat of wildfires burning across the Canadian border. The newly expanded order, which took effect Sunday, includes 12 more BWCA entry points and the area around Lac la Croix, in addition to the areas around Crooked and Iron lakes that had been included. It now stretches east nearly to Basswood Lake, west nearly to Crane Lake, and south to the Echo Trail, Minnesota Public Radio News reported. Authorities said wildfires burning unchecked just across the border in Ontario’s Quetico Provincial Park could cross into the BWCA. Forest Service officials said the new order is meant to give campers time to leave the area. The closure order will last at least seven days, or until the fire danger has subsided.\n\nMississippi\n\nTupelo: A lake named for the king of rock ‘n’ roll is closed for repairs and could reopen in the spring of 2024. Elvis Presley Lake has been drained and the entrance to it is locked, the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reported. Dennis Riecke, fisheries and environmental coordinator with the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries & Parks, said plans include an inspection of the drain structure and installation of a rack to prevent logs from getting caught in the drain pipe. They also include the addition of fish attractors or brush piles in the shoreline areas and the addition of gravel beds to provide spawning sites for bass and bluegill. The state in recent years also temporarily closed Trace State Park Lake and Lake Lamar Bruce for improvements. Both are open again.\n\nMissouri\n\nFredericktown: A flash flood in rural eastern Missouri led to a water rescue of two people after their vehicle became stranded in fast-rising water. Heavy rain on Friday prompted a quick rise of the St. Francis River in Madison County. KFVS-TV reported that the water came up so quickly that both people were forced to stand on top of the vehicle to escape drowning. A Missouri State Highway Patrol marine operation trooper, R.A. Walker, and Madison County Emergency Management Director Dean Stevens were able to navigate the flooding waters and rescue the victims.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Extreme heat descended on parts of the U.S. northern Rocky Mountains on Monday, as authorities struggled to contain dozens of wildfires burning in a region parched by prolonged drought and blanketed with dangerous smoke. Record-setting temperatures were forecast for much of eastern Montana and portions of northern Wyoming. Billings, Montana’s largest city, was expected to hit 106 degrees Fahrenheit, topping a record set 61 years ago. Glasgow was forecast to reach 108. The heat will linger through Thursday, the National Weather Service said. Red flag warnings for high-fire risk were issued across almost all of Montana and Idaho and portions of northeastern and western Wyoming. More than two dozen new fires broke out across the three states Sunday, further straining firefighting resources stretched thin by a high number of early summer fires. Thunderstorms rolling through Monday night will bring winds that could fan wildfires and lightning that could spark new ones, according to the weather service.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: City officials are defending their actions to remove a homeless encampment that had been set up in a wooded area. Officials said concerns from residents nearby prompted an investigation by Lincoln Fire and Rescue and the Lincoln-Lancaster County Health Department. Jon Carlson, the mayor’s deputy chief of staff, told the Lincoln Journal Star that conditions were found to be dangerous for those who were living there. Carlson said dead trees, dry brush, wood, grills, propane tanks and gas cans created a fire threat. Health officials also determined conditions were unsanitary. But some homeless advocates said it was unjust to demolish a community people made for themselves. About 20 people attended a protest and sought to raise donations to help those affected by the demolition.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Some Las Vegas resorts and casinos are again requiring employees to wear masks, a response to a recommendation issued by regional health officials amid rising COVID-19 case rates. The Southern Nevada Health District on Friday recommended that all people, regardless of whether they’ve been vaccinated, wear face coverings in public settings such as stores, malls, casinos and events. The district’s recommendation isn’t a mandate but local media outlets reported that it prompted properties such as Westgate Las Vegas, The Venetian and Las Vegas Sands to impose masking requirements for employees. Some properties also posted the district’s recommendation at entrances and offered complimentary masks to visitors. Nevada Resort Association President Virginia Valentine said the district’s guidance was “ an important reminder that masks are effective in reducing spread.” Restrictions affecting casinos and other venues were lifted in May when the state fully returned pandemic control measures to counties.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nMilford: Hitchiner Manufacturing has installed a 510-kilowatt solar array at one of its facilities in Milford. The array will produce more than 625,000 kilowatt-hours of renewable energy every year at a cost of less than $0.04 per kilowatt-hour, the company said in news release Friday. This will save Hitchiner more than $3.5 million over the array’s lifespan, and reduce Hitchiner’s carbon footprint by more than 665,000 pounds annually, the company said. One of the major hurdles in deciding to make the investment was the state’s high electrical costs, the company said. Hitchiner needs to “develop competitive and reliable sources of commercial energy so that businesses, and manufacturers in particular, can grow the state’s economy,” John Morison III, Hitchiner’s chairman and CEO, said. Hitchiner worked with ReVision Energy on the installation.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nSpringfield Township: A small tornado touched down in New Jersey over the weekend leaving behind a trail of damaged trees, the National Weather Service said. According to forecasters, a line of thunderstorms produced the EF-1 twister about a mile from the Burlington County Fairgrounds on Saturday night. It is estimated the tornado was packing winds of 80 to 90 mph. The tornado followed a narrow path of nearly 8 miles, damaging trees north of Columbus-Jobstown Road, snapping tree limbs on Island Road, uprooting a tree on Juliustown-Georgetown Road and causing additional scattered tree damage before the twister dissipated near the Ocean County border. No injuries were reported. The weather service determined a tornado was responsible after surveying the damage on Sunday.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: New Mexico plans to convert two privately run state prisons in rural areas into facilities operated by the Department of Corrections, the agency said. The department said Friday that it will take over operations of the Northwest New Mexico Correctional Center in Grants and the Guadalupe County Correctional Facility in Santa Rosa by November, the Santa Fe New Mexican reported. The facility in Grants is operated by CoreCivic, which is headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee, and the facility in Santa Rosa is operated by Geo Group, which is based in Boca Raton, Florida.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: Mayor Bill de Blasio said he does not plan to reinstate a city-wide mask mandate even as COVID-19 cases increase, opting instead to focus on vaccinating more residents. There have been calls for New York City to follow the lead of Los Angeles County, which announced last week that it will require masks be worn indoors amid a sharp increase in virus cases. But De Blasio insisted vaccinations are a better strategy for the nation’s most populous city. There are 4.8 million city residents with at least one vaccine dose, the mayor said. The daily number of COVID-19 cases in the city has increased since mid-June, though the caseloads are nowhere near the pandemic’s peak this past winter. The 628 confirmed and probable cases recorded citywide Thursday, the most recent day available, compares to 241 on July 1. The number of virus cases has been rising around the country, many of them the highly transmissible delta variant. City health officials said the variant makes up about 7 in 10 cases they sequence.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheboro: At the same time the North Carolina Zoo is seeing a huge increase in visitors compared with last year, it’s struggling to find staff to keep all of its exhibits open. “Like just about every other business out there, we’re having difficulty finding applicants,” Diane Villa, director of communications and marketing for the Asheboro zoo, told The Courier-Tribune. Most attractions are open, but certain features like an obstacle course and feeding activities have remained closed, the newspaper reported. Villa said 20 people recently turned out for a job fair with dozens of open positions. She said the zoo is partnering with other organizations that hold job fairs and is advertising locally to try to find applicants. Many of the jobs at the zoo are part time, temporary and pay about $10 to $12 per hour.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nTowner: A California man rode his bicycle to North Dakota to celebrate his mother-in-law’s 90th birthday. Brian Gonsalves, who lives in the San Diego area, isn’t new to long-distance bicycle rides. The X-ray technician rode to Georgia in 2018, a trip totalling 2,709 miles. As a survivor of a 2016 bicycle accident, he used that journey to celebrate his 50th birthday and raise money for Scripps trauma services. “I had a laparotomy, resection of my pancreas, and splenectomy that night,” Gonsalves said of the crash. “Two years later, my employer gave me time off to ride across America. I hope to encourage people to do what they love.” With his wife, Dorreen Drader-Gonsalves, providing his mobile support, he started the 2,143-mile trip from California on June 18 and made it to the International Peace Garden on July 11. From there, they drove the 65 miles to Towner for Beverly Lynch’s birthday party, the Minot Daily News reported. “It’s a beautiful country to ride across,” Gonsalves said. He said the minute he entered North Dakota the roads became “smooth as glass,” unlike some other areas.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: A dog that had been missing for five days is back home after it was found trapped between two concrete walls in a nearby home’s garage and freed by firefighters using a saw and sledgehammer. The homeowner called the Cincinnati Fire Department on Sunday after hearing the dog’s cries. Firefighters discovered Gertie had fallen down a crevice and was trapped between the walls. The dog had escaped from its home on July 13 and its owners had put up missing posters across the neighborhood. A video posted on Facebook showed firefighters using the tools to create an opening in the wall to pull Gertie to safety after about 10 minutes. The dog wagged its tail after being rescued. “It was just so sweet, just wagging that little nub tail, and she was just so, she was so excited,” Gertie’s owner, Connie Frick, told WXIX-TV.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Oklahoma reported more than 550 new coronavirus cases Monday as daily cases of the illness continued the upward trend they have charted over the past two weeks. The State Department of Health said the state recorded 557 cases of COVID-19 on Monday, bringing the total number of cases since the pandemic began to 466,733. The rolling average number of daily cases over the past two weeks has increased by 336, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University. Oklahoma has seen about 155 cases per 100,000 people in the past two weeks, which ranks 11th in the country for per capita cases. According to Johns Hopkins, about 46.2% of Oklahomans have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and 39.5% of the population is fully vaccinated.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:Oregon’s salmon license plate, first introduced in 1998, is getting an updated, more colorful look, available Sept. 1. Fans of classic salmon license plate who want it on their vehicle have until Aug. 31 to get to the Oregon DMV to register for one. The original plate, designed by Newport artist Herb Goblirsch, was first introduced by the Oregon Watershed Enhancement Board and Oregon Parks and Recreation department in 1998, becoming one of the state’s earliest custom plate designs. Revenue from the specialty plate has contributed more than $8 million into salmon recovery, helping protect and restore native salmon habitats, according to the release announcing the new design, The new design comes from Gretchen Kirchner, an amateur artist and former graphic designer for the watershed board. Kirchner drew inspiration from her 16 years in Oregon and the state’s beaches, forests, mountains and valleys and she worked with OWEB biologists to accurately represent the salmon’s details. More information about the new salmon license plate, auction rules and eligibility, is available at orsalmonplates.com. Registration fees and ordering information are available on the DMV website.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Pennsylvania smashed its record for gambling revenue, state regulators said Monday, reporting nearly $3.9 billion in the last fiscal year as every category of wagering showed growth in one of the nation’s largest casino and gambling states. The rebound comes after pandemic-related shutdowns helped knock casino revenue down significantly. The nearly $3.9 billion from 14 operating casinos, fantasy sports operators and truck stops for the fiscal year ending June 30 beat the previous high, two years ago, by about 17% and last year’s take by more than 40%, according to figures from the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board. Revenue in casinos from slot machines, at just below $1.9 billion, and from table games, at $721 million, remains lower than record highs in previous years. Online casino gambling grew to nearly $900 million in just its second year, and sports betting grew to $309 million in just its third year. Pennsylvania legalized both as part of an aggressive gambling expansion in 2017.\n\nRhode Island\n\nJamestown:A Rhode Island man is planning a 19-mile swim from Block Island to Jamestown on July 31 to raise money for a nonprofit that works to keep oceans clean. Ben Tuff’s grueling swim will raise money for Clean Ocean Access. Just two years ago, he swam 23 miles around Conanicut Island to raise more than $54,000 for the organization, The Newport Daily News reported. Tuff is director of admission at Rumsey Hall School in Connecticut and a former triathlete who grew up in Jamestown. To keep safe, he will wear a shark-repellent device. About 6 feet long, the device will trail behind him. It can be a burden, but Tuff said it will provide peace of mind during a stretch of the swim when he won’t be able to see land. Two boats and a paddle boarder will trail him during the swim. He estimated the swim will take one to two hours more than his Jamestown around-the-island swim in 2019 that lasted 9 hours, 11 minutes, but much depends on currents.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Starting on Oct. 1, 2024, nurseries in South Carolina will be prohibited from selling Bradford Pear and Callery pear trees, according to the Post and Courier. The trees are known for their early spring white flowers. But they also are known as one of the weakest structural trees in existence, with branches that commonly break after 10 to 15 years and a short life expectancy of 20 to 30 years. The ban affects the Bradford pear and any other tree grown from the Pyrus calleryana rootstock. State lawmakers and the state’s Crop Pest Commission approved the ban after an advisory panel added the tree to the State Plant Pest List. The Bradford pear was introduced to the United States in the 1950s. Although technically sterile, its fruit can cross pollinate with any other variety of pear tree and produce Callery pear trees, said David Coyle, assistant professor of Forest Health and Invasive Species at Clemson. He has started a program to encourage people to cut down and replace Bradford pears.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nWatertown: The Department of Game, Fish and Parks is weighing how to proceed on beaver hunting in the Black Hills and the state. The idea for a hunting ban came up recently when the Game, Fish and Parks Commission discussed a proposal to create a year-round beaver hunting season across the state, with hunting only allowed in portions of the Black Hills not owned by the U.S. Forest Service from Nov. 1 to April 30. “By creating one statewide beaver season (with the exception of the Black Hills) that is year-round, it simplifies this regulation and allows landowners in eastern South Dakota the ability to remove beavers that are causing damage,” the proposal stated. Keith Fisk, the agency’s program administrator, said he receives at least 500 beaver complaints on an annual basis, the Black Hills Pioneer reported. “There are a number of landowners out there that would take advantage of this opportunity to remove some of those problem beavers whether it is them practicing that or someone they know willing to come and help them out,” Fisk said. But Commissioner Travis Bies said the Black Hills does not have problems with beavers, and the population has been greatly decreased. Bies called for a study of the beaver population, a suggestion that prompted the commission to table the proposal to its September meeting.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Tennessee officials said state tax revenue continued to exceed projections in the latest monthly report. The Tennessee Department of Finance and Administration said revenue for June were $1.9 billion, which is $372.3 million more than the budgeted monthly revenue estimate and $321.1 million more than June 2020. That represents a growth rate year-over-year of 20.9%. The revenue also represents a monthly growth rate of 18.6% compared to June 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic. The revenue reflects taxable sales activity from the month of May. On an accrual basis, June is the eleventh month in the 2020-2021 fiscal year. Year-to-date revenues were $2.8 billion more than projections.\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso:A section of east El Paso received more than 3 inches of rain within an hour Sunday night, the National Weather Service said Monday. The largest amount of rain – 3.28 inches – was recorded in the Eastwood area along Montwood drives between McRae Boulevard and Yarbrough Drive, according to a NWS rain totals map. The next-largest rain totals were 2.46 inches near Vista Del Sol and Yarbrough Drive and 2.07 inches near the El Paso Community College Valle Verde campus. Other areas of El Paso received less than a half-inch to more than 1 inch of rain Sunday night as thunderstorms moved through the region. Flash flooding was reported in parts of El Paso, where 1 to 2 inches of rain had fallen earlier in the night. Drivers were cautioned not to enter flooded roads. There were reports of vehicles stuck and partially submerged in high water in several parts of the east side, including off Lee Treviño Drive and McRae Boulevard. There also was high water impacting traffic in the area of Interstate 10 and Piedras Street.\n\nUtah\n\nSpringdale:Zion National Park has set a record for visitors in a month. National Park Service data showed the park saw nearly 676,000 visitors in June, topping the number during the same period in 2019 by a wide margin, the Spectrum newspaper reported. In June 2019, the park saw 595,000 visitors. The number dipped in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic to about 377,000 visitors. “We far surpassed our record,” Superintendent Jeff Bradybaugh told the Springdale Town Council. Two other Utah parks, Canyonlands National Park and Capitol Reef National Park, saw their busiest June ever, with nearly 110,000 and 190,000 visitors respectively. Arches National Park temporarily delays entry almost daily now because of high visitation volumes but the official data hasn’t been released for June. Utah parks have seen visitation rise steadily over the past decade, with some parks seeing their average annual attendance nearly double.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Celebrations were held at Amtrak stations across Vermont on Monday to mark the return of passenger rail service to the state. The Vermonter train and the Ethan Allen Express resumed passenger service Monday. The service was suspended last year at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Amtrak offered $1 fares at each Vermont station to include Brattleboro, Bellows Falls, Windsor, White River Junction, Randolph, Montpelier, Waterbury, Essex Junction and St. Albans. The Vermonter train runs between New York City and St. Albans. The Ethan Allen Express runs between Rutland and New York. The southbound Vermonter was a few minutes late when it arrived in Montpelier on Monday. There were scores of people there waiting for it getting ice cream from a food truck and listening to a band that was set up under a tent.\n\nVirginia\n\nSpotsylvania: A massive Virginia solar plant that drew a flood of opposition when it was first proposed is now more than half completed and sending electricity into the power grid. The first phases of the Spotsylvania Solar Center are generating 259 megawatts each day, providing power for some of the companies that bought the rights to the energy, the Free Lance-Star reported. Among them are Apple, Microsoft and the University of Richmond, which contracted to receive the electricity credits from the facility in rural western Spotsylvania County. The remaining portion of the solar facility should be online by the fall, Helen Humphries, a spokeswoman for AES Corp., told the newspaper. The plant is on track to become one of the largest in the U.S., with about 1.8 million panels generating 484 megawatts a day.\n\nWashington\n\nKitsap:The Central Kitsap School District plans to start building a new facility on the campus of Olympic High School to replace Fairview Middle School in 2022. The district’s board members approved its Long-Range Facilities Plan, which includes the replacement of Fairview Middle School, in a board meeting last Wednesday. The long-term facilities plan provides a 40-year roadmap for the replacement and modernization of facilities in Central Kitsap, according to a document provided by the district. Having been meeting regularly with the district’s general contractor, Skanska, Central Kitsap School District will have some conceptual drawings of the new facility in August or September, Newell said in the board meeting. The new facility on the Olympic High campus will accommodate about 750 students, the same number of students which Fairview Middle School currently has, the district’s spokesperson, David Beil, said. The construction is estimated to cost $65 million, with $48.5 million coming from the federal government and $16.5 million from the state, according to a document provided by the district.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: Jean Dean, the first woman to serve as mayor of Huntington, has died. Dean died Saturday morning, her son Justin Gibson told the Herald-Dispatch. Her health had been deteriorating, he said. Dean served from 1993 to 2000. Before that, she was director of administration and finance, a position similar to a city manager. “She considered it a great honor to serve the people,” Gibson said. Current Mayor Steve Williams called Dean a “graceful giant.” Her vision, determination and graceful countenance set a foundation on which we continue to benefit, Williams said in a statement. Gibson said his mother was willing to work with representatives in Congress, local business leaders and residents to support the city. Funeral arrangements were pending Sunday.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Wisconsin’s two medical schools are collaborating on a study addressing health disparities in the state. The University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health and the Medical College of Wisconsin will use $3 million in endowment money to measure and recommend solutions for health inequities, which have been underscored by the coronavirus pandemic. The Wisconsin Collaborative for Healthcare Quality is a consortium of state health systems and hospitals. The collaborative in 2020 found low rates of colon cancer screening and HPV vaccination in some rural areas and low rates of childhood vaccinations and depression screening in some urban neighborhoods. Blacks in Wisconsin have higher rates of cancer and sexually transmitted diseases than other groups, and poorer outcomes for stroke, diabetes and asthma, stemming in part from more poverty and less education, according to the state Department of Health Services, the State Journa l reported.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Dusty Campbell completed a 285-mile rollerblade journey from Jackson to Salt Lake City on July 4 in just 47 hours and raised $15,200 for the Wounded Warrior Project, a nonprofit that helps veterans recover from mental and physical injuries. With those service members in mind, Campbell rollerbladed through two nights, resting only for three 30-minute naps. He was still on his wheels at 4:20 a.m. on July 4, with about 50 miles left to go. When he first set off from Town Square in Jackson, there wasn’t much fanfare. The stagecoach driver gave him a tip of the hat, and some tourists vaguely noted the size of his wheels. The symbolism of the location was noted, though, in Instagram live videos that showed the rollerblader in front of the veteran memorial in the center of the square. “In my mind there’s no greater cause,” Campbell said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/11/23/social-distance-skating-kid-governor-virtual-toy-drive-news-around-states/115031428/", "title": "Social-distance skating, kid governor: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMobile: Despite a surge in COVID-19 cases, state Superintendent Eric Mackey said he wants schools to return to in-person class after Thanksgiving holidays. “We will do everything we can to avoid widespread closures of physical schools,” Mackey told WALA-TV. The state’s COVID-19 school dashboard was updated Friday to show nearly 2,300 cases last week in public schools compared to about 1,600 the prior week. Cases have more than doubled in two weeks. While a statewide switch to virtual learning is off the table, the state superintendent said individual schools could switch to all virtual learning as a last resort. Two school systems – in Hoover and Huntsville – announced Friday that at least some of their classes would be going to hybrid schedules after Thanksgiving because of rising virus numbers. Mackey said schools that close often have to shut down because too many teachers are exposed and told to quarantine.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The acting mayor has left the door open for new orders if coronavirus cases continue to rise. “I am not planning to take any action this week, but we are monitoring the situation closely,” Acting Mayor Austin Quinn-Davidson said in a statement Wednesday. “We will not allow our hospitals to become overrun.” The announcement comes as the city and state have experienced a substantial increase in coronavirus cases in recent weeks. Dr. Anne Zink, the state’s chief medical officer, told reporters Thursday that it is has become difficult for hospitals to provide adequate care to everyone who needs it due to an increasing amount of coronavirus patients. The state reported its highest number of current COVID-19 hospitalizations with 129 patients Wednesday, according to the state Department of Health and Social Services. Quinn-Davidson urged residents to stay home, wear a mask and celebrate the Thanksgiving holiday responsibly.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Health officials reported 4,331 new COVID-19 cases Sunday with seven additional deaths, pushing the state’s totals to 299,665 cases and 6,464 deaths since the pandemic started. It was the third time in four days Arizona reported more than 4,000 new coronavirus cases. Previously, the state last topped 4,000 new cases in July during a summer surge that made the state a national hot spot after Gov. Doug Ducey relaxed business closings and stay-home restrictions. Arizona’s outbreak lessened in August and September after local governments implemented masking mandates and Ducey instituted restrictions on some businesses. The virus surged again last month and into this month. State and public health officials cite school and business reopenings and public weariness with anti-virus precautions. The Arizona Department of Health Services has recommended holding Thanksgiving celebrations outside along with masks and social distancing.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state’s COVID-19 hospitalizations climbed to a new high Friday as the Arkansas Supreme Court suspended jury trials in response to the latest spike in coronavirus cases. The Department of Health reported 36 more people were hospitalized with the respiratory illness, bringing the state’s total hospitalizations to 935. The state’s probable and confirmed virus cases rose by 2,061 to 141,916. By Sunday, hospitalizations had declined slightly to 922. The state’s high court suspended jury trials that have not yet begun because of the surge in cases until Jan. 15. Justices said courts can move forward with other proceedings, including arraignments and hearings, either in person or over videoconference. On Thursday, Gov. Asa Hutchinson ordered bars, restaurants and clubs that serve alcohol to close by 11 p.m. That earlier closing time began Friday and is in effect through Jan. 3.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: A majority of Californians are under a nighttime curfew as surging coronavirus cases threaten to swamp health care systems, and the state’s largest county warned that an even more drastic lockdown could be imminent. The newest restrictions require people to stay home from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. unless they are responding to an emergency, shopping for groceries, picking up takeout or walking their dogs. The monthlong curfew could be extended if rapidly worsening trends don’t improve. Authorities say the focus is on keeping people from social mixing and drinking – the kinds of activities that are blamed for causing coronavirus infections to soar after dipping only a few months ago. The curfew applies to 41 of the state’s 58 counties that are in the “purple” tier, the most restrictive of four state tiers allowing various stages of economic reopening. Those counties encompass 94% of the nearly 40 million people living in the most populous U.S. state. California as a whole has seen more than 1 million infections, with a record of almost 15,500 new cases reported Friday.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: State lawmakers will convene Nov. 30 in a special session to craft a relief package for businesses, restaurants, bars, child care providers, landlords, tenants, public school students and others suffering under the coronavirus pandemic. Gov. Jared Polis set the date in an executive order issued late Thursday. He also told The Washington Post on Thursday that he is seeking relief totaling between $300 million and $400 million. On Tuesday, he had proposed a $220 million package for a special session. Polis wants lawmakers to adopt sales tax relief for restaurants, bars, other businesses and cultural venues affected by capacity limits; allocate funds for child care providers and rental assistance for tenants and landlords; and expand broadband and Wi-Fi internet access for students and teachers displaced from the classroom. Meanwhile, many Colorado counties adopted more restrictions on business and individual gatherings Friday.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state is reopening health care centers dedicated solely to treating COVID-19 patients amid a resurgence of the coronavirus across the state, including in nursing homes and assisted living facilities, a state Department of Public Health spokesperson said Friday. A coronavirus “recovery center” in Meriden reopened last week to serve up to 30 patients, and there are now plans to reopen one in Torrington with another 30 beds in the near future, department spokesperson Av Harris said. The two facilities were among several around the state that opened earlier in the pandemic but later closed as virus rates dropped over the summer. The reopenings come as Connecticut on Friday surpassed 100,000 positive coronavirus tests since the pandemic began and as public and private schools saw a 70% increase in positive student tests compared with the week before.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The seven-day average daily coronavirus case count in the state has topped 400 for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic began. Delaware on Saturday reported 504 new positive cases, one day after reporting a record-high 649 cases, later amended to 651. The 504 cases reported Saturday, through data recorded at 6 p.m. Friday, marked the second-highest daily case count of the pandemic. The rolling seven-day average of daily cases is up to 417.4. Hospitalizations due to complications from COVID-19 increased by two to 172, with 29 of those patients listed in critical condition. The increase in daily cases comes as more tests than ever are being conducted in Delaware. There is a two-day lag on full testing data from the state, but the state reported that it performed a pandemic-high 9,939 tests Wednesday. The average number of tests being performed per day is over 6,000, also the highest since the pandemic began.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The National Cherry Blossom Festival is scheduled to take place March 20-April 11 with a new format that organizers say is meant to honor the tradition of the festival while prioritizing health and safety during the pandemic, WUSA-TV reports. “Designed to incorporate both virtual and personal experiences, the festival will present a series of entertaining hybrid events and community outreach programs,” the festival’s organizers said in a press release Wednesday. The festival’s organizers announced last month that the 2021 parade, scheduled for next spring, was officially canceled. Organizers say most of next year’s events will be free and open to the public, including a one-hour nationally syndicated television show; 20 large, vibrant cherry blossom sculptures displayed in dozens of locations throughout the city; and locally curated community experiences that focus on music, cuisine and visual arts presentations.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: One of the state’s U.S. senators announced Friday that he has tested positive for the coronavirus, one of more than 9,000 people newly diagnosed in the state. It was the second straight day Florida logged more than 9,000 new cases of the virus, according to figures provided by the state Department of Health. Over the past week, Florida averaged more than 7,390 newly reported cases per day, an increase from about 2,250 at the start of October. U.S. Sen. Rick Scott announced he had tested positive for the coronavirus and was isolating at home with “very mild symptoms.” Scott, 67, had been quarantining at home all week after coming into contact with someone who subsequently tested positive. His office said he had “multiple negative rapid tests earlier in the week,” but a test he took Tuesday came back positive Friday morning. Scott, a Republican, said he was “feeling good” despite the mild symptoms and would be working at his home.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: U.S. Sen. Kelly Loeffler is quarantining after receiving mixed results from recent coronavirus tests, a day after she campaigned with Vice President Mike Pence and U.S. Sen. David Perdue in the state’s hotly contested twin Senate races. The Georgia Republican took two rapid COVID-10 tests Friday morning that came back negative, a spokesperson for her campaign said in a statement Saturday night. She received another test Friday evening, and the results came back positive, the statement said. Loeffler tested again Saturday morning, and the results were inconclusive. Her campaign said she doesn’t have symptoms. Loeffler is following CDC guidelines and informing those with whom she was in direct contact, the statement said. Loeffler appeared at a campaign event with Pence and Perdue in Georgia on Friday. She has held several rallies in recent weeks with crowds packed into close quarters and many audience members not wearing masks.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The Honolulu Police Department said it would cancel special coronavirus enforcement units after allegations of overtime abuse from its officers. Department leaders were told that 59 officers on the coronavirus enforcement team had been flagged in an audit for overtime violations, according to an internal memo. The Nov. 10 memo said officers worked a substantial amount of hours “in excess of explicit instructions,” Hawaii News Now reports. The enforcement of coronavirus violations will now be made by on-duty patrol officers. At least 10 officers logged 200 or more hours of overtime over a five-week period. Records show two officers recorded more than 300 hours of overtime from Sept. 27 to Oct. 31 – or about 60 hours of overtime each week. The unit’s responsibilities included checking in on quarantine violators and citing people for not wearing masks. The officers also responded to 911 complaints for potential violations.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state’s unemployment rate has dropped to 5.5% as about 5,400 nonfarm workers regained jobs in October, officials said Friday. The Idaho Department of Labor said that about 864,000 Idaho residents are employed and that about 50,000 are looking for work as the surging coronavirus pandemic continues hampering the economy. The unemployment rate for October fell from September’s 6.1%. Officials said seven industry sectors saw some job gains, led by leisure and hospitality with an increase of 4.9%. Nonfarm jobs are at about 763,000. Officials said that’s the first time since last spring’s pandemic-related job losses that nonfarm jobs equaled or exceeded levels from the previous year. Meanwhile, Idaho is quickly approaching 90,000 coronavirus infections, Johns Hopkins University reported. Through Thursday, the virus had killed 835 residents.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Deaths from COVID-19 in the state topped 100 Friday for the third day in a row. The Illinois Department of Public Health reported 126 fatalities related to COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, along with 13,012 newly confirmed infections. The recent weeks’ soaring numbers prompted Gov. J.B. Pritzker to reimpose harsher restrictions on social interaction. So-called Tier 3 mitigations took effect statewide Friday. Illinois turned around a record 116,000 tests in a 24-hour period ending Friday, but officials have said that more testing alone cannot account for the swelling numbers. They can be seen in an overworked health care system that sees no impending relief. There were 6,111 people hospitalized with about 1,200 in intensive care and 604 on ventilators, which represents a 24% increase from just a week earlier.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The number of COVID-19 patients being treated at the state’s hospitals remained above 3,000 for the fourth straight day Friday, health officials reported Saturday. Indiana hospitals were treating 3,168 COVID-19 patients as of Friday, the Indiana State Department of Health said in its daily statistics update. That’s the largest number of COVID-19 patients since the state began releasing public reports on coronavirus hospitalizations last spring. The state agency also added 40 more coronavirus-related deaths to Indiana’s pandemic toll, raising those deaths to 5,246, including confirmed and presumed coronavirus infections. Another 6,983 Hoosiers have been diagnosed with COVID-19, the department also reported, boosting the number of Hoosiers with known coronavirus infections to 289,183. Gov. Eric Holcomb reinstated crowd limits this month and has appealed for people to abide by the statewide mask mandate.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Demonstrators are demanding that Gov. Kim Reynolds do more to stem the spread of the coronavirus as cases surge. More than a dozen of them gathered Friday in front of the governor’s Terrace Hill mansion to deliver 800 report cards that gave her an “F” grade in COVID-19 mitigation and protecting Iowans. Reynolds didn’t accept the cards directly, but an Iowa State Patrol officer said he would pass them along to her. The demonstration was organized by Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement. “She’s been a total failure in her inability to show leadership and to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in the state of Iowa,” said Cherie Mortice, Iowa CCI Action Fund Board President. “She needs to stand up, and she needs to represent the everyday needs of Iowans today.” The state reported a total of 2,159 COVID-19-related deaths as of Saturday, an increase of 32 deaths in 24 hours. The number of confirmed cases also rose by 3,627 to 206,660.\n\nKansas\n\nMission: Hospitals across the state are buckling as coronavirus cases swell, leading many schools to scale back in-person learning and one county to intensify plans for a possible field hospital. The state’s seven-day average of new cases stands at 2,718, nearly four times higher than it was a month ago. “Case increases are the worst we have seen since the pandemic began,” Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly told local officials and legislators during a call Friday as the state’s seven-day averages for new hospitalizations and deaths jumped to record highs. “Our hospitals are overwhelmed with coronavirus patients. Health care workers are burned out.” In Topeka, high hospitalization figures have area officials looking more intensely into turning an events center into a potential location for a field hospital that could house overflow COVID-19 patients, said Errin Mahan, acting director of Shawnee County Emergency Management.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: State Attorney General Daniel Cameron has joined a private school in a lawsuit against Gov. Andy Beshear, arguing that a school closure order violated not only state law but also the First Amendment. Last week, the Democratic governor announced that most public and private K-12 schools must stop in-person classes starting Monday. Middle and high schools will be required to remain in remote instruction until January. Elementary schools may reopen Dec. 7 if the county in which they are located is not in the “red zone.” The order was issued to help curb the spread of COVID-19. According to news reports, Cameron and Danville Christian Academy on Friday asked a federal court to issue a temporary restraining order that would block Beshear’s order from being implemented. In response, Beshear’s office said Cameron “should stop playing politics and instead help Kentuckians understand what it takes to defeat this virus.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state will run out of federal coronavirus money before it pays out grants to all eligible small businesses and local government agencies seeking dollars from COVID-19 aid programs created by Gov. John Bel Edwards and lawmakers. Officials running the programs told the joint House and Senate budget committee Friday that they received more applications than the dollars available. The funding comes from $1.8 billion in direct coronavirus aid that Louisiana received from Congress. The Democratic governor and majority-Republican Legislature spent more than half the money to fill gaps in the state budget. About $855 million remaining was split by lawmakers among several assistance programs. Nearly $525 million was earmarked to reimburse local government agencies’ virus-related expenses. Another $260 million was steered to small-business grants. And $50 million was set aside for one-time payments to front-line workers who stayed on the job in the pandemic’s early days. The remaining $20 million was set aside to pay for administrative expenses to run those programs.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state will dedicate more than $6 million to help residents who can’t pay their rent because of the coronavirus pandemic, Gov. Janet Mills said Friday. The use of federal coronavirus relief funds will extend Maine Housing’s COVID-19 Rental Relief Program through December, said Mills, a Democrat. States around the country, including Maine, need Congress to approve more relief soon, Mills said. “In the meantime, I will do all I can to keep people secure in their homes this holiday season,” she said. The state has dedicated more than $28 million in federal relief funds to the rental aid program since April. The announcement came as the recovery of jobs in the state appeared to slow. Unemployment in Maine fell to 5.4% in October, the Maine Department of Labor said Friday. That was a decline of less than a percentage point from September’s rate.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Lawmakers renewed criticism Friday of Gov. Larry Hogan’s April procurement of 500,000 COVID-19 tests from South Korea after The Washington Post reported the first batch was flawed and never used, but the governor defended the tests. Hogan told the Associated Press the first batch of tests he purchased with great fanfare from South Korea had to be replaced. “We brought the tests in,” Hogan said. “When they first got back, the FDA changed the emergency use authorization at the last minute, so we had to switch out and upgrade to a different set of tests, which we then brought in. There’ve been no problems with these tests whatsoever.” It was unclear to what Food and Drug Administration change Hogan was referring. The Post reports Hogan spent about $9.5 million in state funding on the initial tests. The Republican governor then quietly paid a South Korean company $2.5 million for 500,000 replacement tests, the newspaper reports. Lawmakers say they still don’t have the answers they have been looking for, after months of asking the administration.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: State health officials added New Hampshire and Maine on Saturday to the list of states where travelers must quarantine or provide a negative coronavirus test if entering or returning to Massachusetts. The two join 46 other states to be designated high-risk by Massachusetts’ Department of Health. The agency says states are included on the list if they average more than 10 new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 residents. Hawaii and Vermont are the only states still considered low-risk that are exempt from the travel rules, which authorities have said can result in a $500-a-day fine for noncompliance. Massachusetts’ seven-day rolling average of daily new cases has risen over the past two weeks from about 1,447 on Nov. 6 to 2,550 on Friday, according to Johns Hopkins University. The state’s seven-day rolling average of the positivity rate has also risen over the past two weeks from 1.88% on Nov. 6 to 3.18% on Friday.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A judge on Friday declined to halt a three-week ban on indoor dining in the state that is one of the most recent coronavirus restrictions imposed by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s administration. The state health department, meanwhile, reported a new daily high of confirmed COVID-19 cases, 9,779, and 53 additional deaths as the virus continued to spike. In his ruling, U.S. District Judge Paul Maloney in Kalamazoo said a restraining order halting the indoor dining ban wouldn’t be appropriate, especially when the state hasn’t had a chance to respond to the lawsuit. The Michigan Restaurant & Lodging Association, which has thousands of members, is suing to try to stop the indoor dining ban that began Wednesday. The group said that restaurants can take further steps to reduce coronavirus risk without cutting off customers and that its members were being unfairly treated compared to other businesses. But the judge wasn’t swayed.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: State health officials on Sunday reported 7,219 new coronavirus cases, lifting the total number of positive tests to more than 270,000 since the start of the pandemic. Officials confirmed 40 deaths due to complications from COVID-19 in the last day, for a total of 3,241 fatalities. Minnesota’s death count is the 24th-highest in the country overall and the 29th-highest per capita at 58 deaths per 100,000 people, according to statistics filed Saturday by Johns Hopkins University researchers. There were about 1,568 new cases per 100,000 people in Minnesota over the past two weeks, which ranks seventh in the country for new cases per capita. One in every 120 people in the state tested positive in the past week. Numbers released Saturday show health care workers have accounted for 20,018 positive cases.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: An annual holiday toy drive at the state’s only children’s hospital is going virtual this year to limit the spread of coronavirus. Children’s of Mississippi is asking that donors purchase from online wish lists of toys from Amazon and Walmart instead of the usual policy of dropping off toys in person at the hospital in Jackson. “This will keep our community safer and will ensure contactless delivery of toys that will brighten the holidays for our patients and their families,” said Jen Hospodor, director of community partnerships at the University of Mississippi Medical Center. Children’s of Mississippi, the pediatric arm of UMMC, provides a gift bag to every child 18 or younger during the holidays. Gifts have been selected based on age and interests. Toys are needed all year long, for patients hospitalized on their birthday and for incentives acknowledging healthy behavior or completing a treatment, said child life specialist Tiffany Key.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: The recent exponential growth of coronavirus cases in the state and the threat of overwhelmed hospitals on Thursday finally pushed a suburban and rural county near St. Louis to require face masks. Franklin County’s mask order took effect Friday and expires Dec. 20, Presiding Commissioner Tim Brinker announced in an email. The mandate is notable because local officials had resisted requiring masks in what Brinker described as “freedom-preserving” Franklin County. But that resistance changed after Republican Gov. Mike Parson’s administration issued a public health warning Thursday and extended the state of emergency in Missouri through March. Parson said more new cases were reported in October than during the first eight months of the pandemic in Missouri, and new cases in November have already surpassed October. Hospitals have warned that they’re struggling to maintain adequate staffing.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Faith leaders across the state have signed a pledge to encourage people to stay home and safe and to prioritize remote worship services during the upcoming holidays amid a spike in COVID-19 cases. “The lesson of this pandemic is that we are all interconnected and dependent on each other,” wrote Rabbi Francine Roston of Glacier Jewish Community/B’nai Shalom in Flathead Valley. “We can remain connected and worship without risking illness and death this winter, protecting each other and protecting our dedicated healthcare workers.” Roston said people of faith must trust medical experts and caregivers along with a higher power and should reduce contacts with anyone beyond their household to remain safe. The pledge is based on one promoted by the Wisconsin Council of Churches. More than 35 religious leaders had signed the pledge by midday Friday, as Montana health officials announced 1,475 new coronavirus cases.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Gov. Pete Ricketts acknowledged Friday that state officials should have moved more quickly to interview people who contracted the coronavirus in recent weeks so they could warn others who may have been exposed. Ricketts said the recent surge in virus cases created a backlog of people who needed to be called, and officials in his administration didn’t add workers to help with the extra workload. “The simple answer is we didn’t do our job,” Ricketts said. The state now has a backlog of 2,600 people who still need to be contacted. Some people who tested positive recently have waited more than a week for one of the state’s “contact tracers” to ask where they’ve been and whom they might have infected, part of a broader effort to slow the virus’s spread. Ashley Newmyer, chief data strategist for the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services, said agency officials hope to work their way through the backlog by the end of this week.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: About 1,500 employees in the state’s largest school district could lose their jobs if students do not return to in-person instruction this school year, according to a staffing report. The Clark County School District Board of Trustees requested the report to determine the potential effects of remaining in a distance learning model throughout the 2020-2021 academic year. No decision on that has been made. Chief Financial Officer Jason Goudie said the cuts would apply to about 1,480 positions “directly connected to the physical presence of students in the school buildings,” including 700 custodians, 650 bus drivers, 100 transportation support employees and 30 school police officers. The district could save about $13.5 million in the reduction of custodial staff, about $12.5 million in the transportation staff cuts, and about $1.5 million in law enforcement and safety cuts.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nAuburn: The state’s schoolchildren have elected a new “Kid Governor” whose platform was inspired by depression he experienced during the coronavirus pandemic. Charlie Olsen, a fifth grader at the Auburn Village School, said in a campaign video that he wants to address the issue of children’s mental health by organizing fundraisers to pay for treatment, create a social network that promotes positivity and develop a mentoring system called C.A.S.T., which stands for Children’s Awareness Support Team. “I became depressed during the COVID lockdowns, and so did a lot of my friends,” he said. “We all felt so alone, but you don’t have to do this alone.” Kid Governor is a statewide civics program for fifth graders. The nominees run on platforms addressing community issues and work with classmates to create campaign videos explaining how they would approach their issue.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The mayor said in a radio interview that he’ll ask residents to stay home for 10 days starting next week, right before Thanksgiving, in response to a rising number of COVID-19 cases. Mayor Ras Baraka made the announcement during an interview on WBGO-FM. He said beginning Wednesday, city residents should shelter in place and only go outside if absolutely necessary. “We are going to lock the city down. We want people to shelter in place for 10 days. Don’t go outside if you don’t have to. Don’t mingle with other people if you don’t have to,” Baraka said in the radio interview Thursday. “Stay with your family in your immediate household. This thing has been hitting families, so a lot of these families should be isolating themselves with their family anyway.” It wasn’t immediately clear how the city of 280,000 would enforce the new restrictions, particularly for the Thanksgiving holiday.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: With hospitals facing a capacity crunch because of the coronavirus outbreak, the state on Friday opened an alternate care facility for COVID-19 patients in a renovated former hospital. The state Department of Health said the Gibson Medical Center will only serve recovering coronavirus-positive adults who don’t require acute care. The facility won’t have an emergency hospital, intensive care unit or surgical suite, the department said in a statement. “It is strictly a step-down care facility for patients referred from other providers,” department spokeswoman Marisa Maez said in an email. Initially, the facility will use two floors to provide 25 beds for patients needing nursing care and an additional 25 beds for isolation or quarantine. Another two floors are available to reach a maximum capacity of 180 beds, the department said.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The Rockefeller Center ice-skating rink is open in a limited way but on time for the holidays. The iconic, sunken rink in midtown Manhattan welcomed skaters Saturday afternoon as part of a tradition dating to the 1930s, according to the Rockefeller Center website. The rink is operating at reduced capacity, with skate time limited to 50 minutes. Masks are required as a further pandemic safety measure. The website says there’s legend that the rink was inspired by “a Depression-era skate salesman who demonstrated his product by skating on the frozen water of the Rockefeller Center fountain.” It officially opened as a “skating pond” on Christmas Day 1936. It was supposed to be temporary but grew so popular that it became a permanent fixture for the holiday season. Another seasonal fixture, the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree, went up the previous weekend and will be lighted Dec. 2.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: The state continues to add coronavirus cases at heightened rates, identifying 3,688 new cases Friday. The figure from the Department of Health and Human Services chalks up as the third-highest number ever and the sixth time new daily cases have topped 3,000 since numbers first hit that mark Nov. 11, continuing a steep upward trend that started in September. Thursday’s 4,296 cases were the most daily new cases for North Carolina, surpassing the previous record set Nov. 14 by more than 400 and marking the third time that record has been broken since Veteran’s Day. According to the latest data from the state, North Carolina has logged a total 328,846 cases since the start of the pandemic and 4,979 deaths. Hospitalizations also continue to rise, up more than 400 so far this month to a total 1,571 reported Thursday by the state.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: With November on track to become the state’s deadliest month from COVID-19, Gov. Doug Burgum on Friday asked North Dakotans to stay home on Thanksgiving and not to celebrate the holiday with people outside their households to help slow the rampant spread of the coronavirus and preserve the state’s hospital capacity. “These gathering can be dangerous, if not deadly, for those who are vulnerable,” Burgum said during his weekly COVID-19 update at the state Capitol. State health officials on Sunday reported 19 new hospitalizations due to the coronavirus, putting the number of patients requiring treatment in medical facilities back over the 300 mark. The update showed 1,150 positive coronavirus tests in the last day. There were about 2,412 new cases per 100,000 people in North Dakota over the past two weeks, which ranks first in the country for new cases per capita, according to the COVID Tracking Project.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state’s unemployment rate fell in October from the previous month but remains above levels from the same time a year ago before the coronavirus pandemic, the state said Friday. The number of workers unemployed in Ohio in October was 324,000, down from 469,000 in September, according to the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services. The agency said Ohio’s unemployment rate for October was 5.6%. That’s down from 8.3% in September but still higher than October 2019, when the unemployment rate was 4.1%. The economy continues to show signs of weakness. On Thursday the state said initial unemployment compensation filings for the week ending Nov. 14 were 14% higher than the previous week. Ohio’s economy is largely open, although a 10 p.m.-to-5 a.m. curfew that went into effect Thursday restricts some businesses from staying open late. Major cities under stay-at-home advisories include Akron, Cleveland, Dayton, Columbus and Toledo.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Efforts to slow the spread of the coronavirus are “too little, too late,” and hospitalizations in the state are likely to continue rising, a University of Oklahoma medical center doctor said Friday. OU Health Dr. Dale Bratzler said anything to mitigate the virus’s spread helps, but it will take two to three weeks for restrictions to reduce infections, and hospitalizations will likely reach 2,000 to 3,000 during that time. On Thursday, Gov. Kevin Stitt implemented measures including mask mandates in state buildings and closing bars and in-person restaurant service at 11 p.m. The number of reported cases increased by 3,406 on Sunday, and the number of deaths from the virus increased by 10, the Oklahoma State Department of Health reported. The department reported 1,446 people were hospitalized. That was down from the one-day high of 1,505 hospitalizations reported Saturday.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The Oregon Restaurant & Lodging Association is seeking a court order from a federal judge to block Gov. Kate Brown’s “two-week freeze” that bans dining in restaurants in response to a spike in COVID-19 cases. The association, which represents 10,000 food service and 2,000 lodging businesses across the state, argues the new restrictions will cause devastating effects for its members and their employees, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. The association and the public policy group Restaurant Law Center filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Portland on Friday, two days after the governor’s new executive order took effect. The order expected to last at least through Dec. 2 limits social get-togethers to no more than six people from no more than two households and limits restaurants to takeout and delivery only.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A divided state House on Friday passed a Republican-backed proposal to make it harder to sue schools, health care providers and others over COVID-19 claims. The 104-to-98 vote sent the bill to the desk of Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf. All House Democrats were opposed, joined by five moderate Republicans. It would make it more difficult to establish liability when someone is exposed to the coronavirus during a governor-declared disaster emergency. Supporters said entities providing services to the public during the pandemic should not also face the prospect of expensive or even ruinous litigation, while opponents said the bill would remove a valuable protection for the public. The Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry welcomed the vote, calling the legislation’s provisions targeted, temporary and narrow in scope.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Rhode Islanders who lost their jobs or had their wages significantly reduced during the pandemic will be able to qualify for $1.83 million in federal rental assistance designated to the state, U.S. Sen. Jack Reed announced Friday. Reed said the aid comes via the federal Housing Choice Voucher program, which helps low-income seniors, families and people with disabilities find safe and stable rental housing. Program participants pay 30% of their income toward rent, and the voucher helps make up the difference, Reed said. The aid comes on top of a $2.5 million Housing Choice Voucher program allocation the state received in August as part of the federal coronavirus aid package. Rhode Island’s seven-day rolling average of daily new cases has risen over the past two weeks from 500 on Nov. 6 to about 925 on Nov. 20, according to Johns Hopkins University.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nNorth Charleston: As Thanksgiving week begins, the state’s chief medical school is joining with the Charleston airport to give free coronavirus tests. The testing site will be open Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday from 1:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. at the fourth floor of the daily parking garage at the Charleston International Airport, according to the Medical University of South Carolina. Officials said they aren’t giving rapid-result tests, so people shouldn’t get tested the day they plan to fly out of the airport. The results will take a day or two. Airport employees, people who don’t plan to fly over the Thanksgiving holiday and anyone else seeking a COVID-19 test are also welcome to get tested, officials said. On Friday, Gov. Henry McMaster introduced a new recommendation for the holiday week, continuing his emphasis on personal responsibility by wearing masks and washing hands. “Get tested before turkey,” he said Thursday.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The head of one of the largest regional health systems in the Midwest has told his employees he has recovered from COVID-19 and is back in the office – without a mask. Sanford Health’s president and chief executive, Kelby Krabbenhoft, said in an email Wednesday that he believes he’s now immune to the disease for “at least seven months and perhaps years to come” and that he isn’t a threat to transmit it to anyone, so wearing a mask would be merely for show. The email from Krabbenhoft, who is not a physician, comes as hospitals throughout the region, including in his own network, are struggling to keep up with some of the country’s worst surges of coronavirus patients. And it comes at a time when mask-wearing remains a politicized issue in many states. Sanford Health, based in Sioux Falls, has 46 hospitals and more than 200 clinics concentrated in South Dakota, North Dakota, Minnesota and Iowa. It employs nearly 48,000 people.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state would no longer prohibit parents from refusing vaccinations of their children under a proposal that’s been filed as COVID-19 cases continue to rise ahead of the GOP-dominant Statehouse’s upcoming legislative session. Tennessee law currently allows parents to refuse to immunize their children as long as the state is “in the absence of an epidemic or immediate threat of an epidemic.” Other sections of Tennessee statute allow parents to deny immunizations of their kids “except where the medical examination, immunization or treatment is necessary for the protection of the health or safety of others.” These exceptions would be removed according to the legislation, allowing parents to opt out of school-required vaccinations during the coronavirus pandemic. The bill also would give parents the option to cite “right of conscience” as a reason not to immunize their children.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The state surpassed 8,000 hospitalized coronavirus patients Friday for the first time since a deadly summer surge as doctors amplified pleas to keep Thanksgiving gatherings small. Texas reported more than 11,700 new cases Friday, the second-highest daily total of the pandemic. More than 8,100 virus patients were hospitalized, the most since early August. The Texas Hospital Association, the industry group representing more than 500 hospitals, issued a new appeal for families to keep holiday gatherings “very small” as doctors and nurses struggle to keep up with rising caseloads. “They are tired and emotionally drained. They are worried about their own families,” the organization said in a statement. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has ruled out another shutdown and accused local leaders of not enforcing restrictions already in place.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state’s prisons on Friday reported two more inmates who have died after testing positive for the coronavirus, as hospitals reach a breaking point with rising hospitalizations ahead of Thanksgiving weekend. Six inmates have died throughout the pandemic, and there are 780 active cases in the Utah prison system, said Jim Hudspeth, deputy director of the Department of Corrections. Across the state, 1 in 141 people was diagnosed with COVID-19 in the past week, and the state is ranked ninth in the country for new cases per capita, according to data from Johns Hopkins. Gov. Gary Herbert said Thursday that there are only 45 open intensive care unit beds throughout the entire state. There were 533 people hospitalized for COVID-19 in Utah on Friday, and referral center ICU beds reached 93.8% occupancy statewide, according to state data.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Gov. Phil Scott and the state health commissioner reiterated calls Friday for Vermonters to follow new COVID-19 restrictions, including not gathering with other households and avoiding travel. They said they have seen very concerning growth in coronavirus cases in the state, as well as four deaths in the past two weeks, after months without a fatality. “I cannot stress this enough. We need people to limit their contacts with others,” Scott said during his virus briefing. He urged Vermonters to take a look at the state’s case numbers, rising hospitalizations and deaths and at states around the country that are exceeding their hospital capacity. “Also think about the Vermonters we’ve lost,” he said. “They were grandmothers, grandfathers, moms, dads, husbands wives and friends.” Such deaths are increasing because the amount of virus in the community is rising and getting into facilities that care for seniors, he said.\n\nVirginia\n\nChesapeake: Ninety inmates have tested positive for the coronavirus at a jail in the city. The Virginian-Pilot reports the city’s sheriff’s office reported the outbreak at the Chesapeake Correctional Center after widespread tests. Three inmates, six deputies and two contractors had initially tested positive Nov. 12. In response, Sheriff Jim O’Sullivan ordered all inmates in the known affected areas to be tested. People who have tested positive are being quarantined and monitored. The jail’s daily population averages 985 inmates. At the jail in the neighboring city of Virginia Beach, about 100 inmates and five staff members were reported to be positive the week before last.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Gov. Jay Inslee on Friday announced $135 million in grants, loans and other assistance to help businesses and workers hurt by new restrictions he imposed through mid-December in response to a rising number of coronavirus cases across the state. At a news conference, Inslee said businesses would be able to apply for $70 million in grants, as well as $30 million in loans, to help offset the business restrictions that took effect last week, including the closure of fitness facilities and gyms, bowling centers, and movie theaters, as well as the requirement that restaurants and bars be limited to takeout and outdoor dining. Those restrictions come after businesses had started to regain activity as restrictions from the initial stay-at-home order issued in March were loosened in May. The economic package also includes $20 million in rental assistance and $15 million in utility payment assistance for those with low income.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A man has been charged with threatening Gov. Jim Justice and his staff over restrictions meant to keep people from getting infected and dying during the coronavirus pandemic. Steven Long, 49, was arrested Thursday night and charged with terroristic threatening, news outlets report, citing a statement from West Virginia State Police. Troopers received a complaint Wednesday about a tweet that was deemed a possible threat, according to a criminal complaint filed in Kanawha County Magistrate Court. The tweet complains about policies implemented by Justice, West Virginia State Medical Director Anye Amjad and West Virginia COVID-19 Czar Clay Marsh, and in retaliation, it “calls for ‘LynchMob Justice’ and the public execution of all three government officials,” Cpl. Benjamin Wood wrote in the criminal complaint. Long told troopers he was exercising his First Amendment right to free speech with the tweet, the complaint said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: The state has surpassed 3,000 COVID-19 deaths, adding about a third of that tally in November. The state Department of Health Services reported 51 deaths Saturday, bringing the state’s death toll to 3,005 since the pandemic began. It took Wisconsin about five months from the beginning of the pandemic in March to hit 1,000 deaths Aug. 11. By Halloween, the state had reached its second 1,000 deaths. There were 6,224 new cases reported by the state Department of Health Services on Saturday. Health officials reported 380 people had died since the previous Sunday, making it the deadliest week of the pandemic. Gov. Tony Evers has cited a model from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation that projects Wisconsin could reach nearly 8,000 deaths by March 1 if the state continues on this path. The model predicted the state would pass 3,000 deaths Friday. It was only a day off.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Gov. Mark Gordon has announced new limits on indoor and outdoor public gatherings but has not implemented a statewide mask mandate as coronavirus cases continue to surge across the state. The Republican governor and state health officer Dr. Alexia Harrist said Thursday that public gatherings will be limited to 25 people or fewer without restrictions. Indoor gatherings will be limited to 25% capacity with social distancing, and outdoor gatherings will be limited to 50% capacity with social distancing. The new order goes into effect Tuesday, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Nearly all of the county health officers in the state have called for a mask mandate as virus cases, hospitalizations and deaths have substantially increased in recent weeks. Gordon also decided not to implement any curfews or temporarily close down any businesses, as some governors in other states have done.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/05/13/beckoning-tourists-evangelical-outreach-vaccine-sweeteners-news-around-states/116175936/", "title": "Beckoning tourists, evangelical outreach: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: With the state’s jobless numbers already nearing pre-pandemic levels and competition on the rise in a changed job market, the search for hospitality workers may not end with Alabama’s participation in federal supplemental unemployment benefits. Some who lost jobs in the industry “went off and found a job that has more … dependable wages,” said Jacqueline Allen, spokeswoman for state workforce development agency AIDT. “Everybody who basically wants a job right now has a job.” That’s My Child youth nonprofit founder Charles Lee said every member of his teens-to-work training program now graduates with a job, and the phone keeps ringing with employers asking for more. Meanwhile, he said federal relief payments and jobless benefits have changed people’s outlook on what’s possible. “It’s the most money some people have ever seen,” Lee said. “I think it’s just whoever is willing to go up to that $15 is going to get that workforce.” Transportation and child care issues were complicated by the pandemic, too. Child care alone is pricey in the best of times, if it’s available at all. Sam Addy of the Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Alabama estimated better access to child care could bring 120,000 more people into the state’s labor force.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The runoff race for mayor remained too close to call after Tuesday’s election, with the two candidates separated by only about 100 votes and thousands of ballots still uncounted. Preliminary election results showed Forrest Dunbar leading opponent Dave Bronson by a slim margin, garnering 50.08% of the votes tallied thus far, Anchorage Daily News reports. The election was on track for a record number of votes cast. An unknown amount of ballots cast in person Tuesday, left in secure ballot boxes throughout the city or postmarked by Election Day continue to arrive. As more ballots arrive, it’s likely that turnout will eclipse the city’s last record in the 2018 race for mayor. While technically nonpartisan, the mayoral race has been heated, fomenting partisan divisions among residents who disagree over how the city should move forward. The two candidates take starkly contrasting approaches to issues like the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, the homelessness crisis and the city’s economy. Bronson has criticized Anchorage’s public health measures and restrictions on businesses and targeted Dunbar over the city’s handling of homelessness. Meanwhile, Dunbar has largely supported the city’s pandemic policies, saying that without them, more people would have died from COVID-19.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Gov. Doug Ducey’s order last month rescinding the mask mandate for schools inflamed and confused the debate over face coverings, as many parents incorrectly interpreted it as a “masks off” directive. Ducey’s action tossed the decision to school administrators, putting them in the driver’s seat on mask policy. For many, it has been a hot seat. “It’s been pretty wild,” said Deb Dillon, president of the Prescott Unified School District board. Prescott opted to make mask usage voluntary last month but reversed itself May 4 after a coronavirus outbreak. The Prescott meeting was orderly, in contrast to earlier events in southern Arizona, where anti-mask protesters crowded into lobbies outside the board meetings of the Vail and Tanque Verde districts, demanding to speak. Both meetings were canceled. The protesters at Vail held a mock election to appoint themselves school officials. That led to incorrect accounts that circulated nationwide that their complaints had scared the official board members into quitting. The Arizona School Boards Association issued a statement condemning actions that threaten school board members. “Too often this year they have been treated as faceless bureaucrats who are optimal targets to release rage and frustration over the circumstances of the pandemic,” the statement said.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Tuesday formed a panel to come up with ways to spend the $1.5 billion the state is receiving from the latest federal coronavirus relief package. The Republican governor formed a 15-member steering committee for the state’s share of the $1.9 trillion relief measure that became law in March. Hutchinson formed a similar committee for the coronavirus relief money that was approved last year. The panel will be made up of eight Cabinet members and three members each from the state House and Senate. “We have to be methodical about this and not rushed,” Hutchinson told reporters. The U.S. Treasury Department on Monday issued broad guidance on how the relief funds can be spent. Hutchinson said he believed the priority for the state’s share of the relief spending should be capital investments, citing broadband and cybersecurity as two areas he’d like funded with the additional money. “It needs to be investments we can make that do not incur long-term spending and indebtedness of the state,” Hutchinson said. Because Arkansas’ unemployment rate is not significantly higher than its pre-pandemic level, the state is eligible to receive just half of its $1.5 billion allotment immediately, with the rest being provided one year later.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLong Beach: The city is offering tickets to the Aquarium of the Pacific as an incentive to overcome resistance to COVID-19 vaccinations. Long Beach will give two aquarium tickets to anyone receiving their first dose of Pfizer or Moderna vaccine or a single dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine at city-run vaccination sites, the city said Tuesday. The offer runs through Saturday. “While we have made tremendous strides in vaccinating 60% of eligible Long Beach residents and 96% of our seniors, we know that vaccine hesitancy for some is real,” Mayor Robert Garcia said in a statement. “We are going to do everything we can to encourage folks to get vaccinated, and that includes incentives.” The Aquarium of the Pacific is one of the Los Angeles region’s major attractions, drawing about 1.7 million visitors annually. A regular adult general admission ticket costs $36.95. City Health and Human Services Director Kelly Colopy said the recent slowdown in vaccinations in California includes Long Beach, and officials are looking for innovative solutions.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: Some health officials have warned that continued high numbers of COVID-19 hospitalizations point to the pandemic not being over yet despite the state’s average infection rate decreasing by nearly a third since April. Colorado was averaging 1,731 newly confirmed coronavirus cases each day in late April – the most since Jan. 19 – but the numbers have fallen nearly every day since then, The Gazette reports. The state has averaged 1,182 newly confirmed cases over the past week, health officials said. “Colorado is heading in a positive direction again, and vaccination coverage is almost certainly playing a key role in this decline,” said Glen Mays, chair of the Colorado School of Public Health’s department of health systems. But Elizabeth Carlton, who also works for the department, said there are more worrying metrics, including hospitalizations. Carlton said the state was averaging about 100 new hospital admissions from COVID-19 daily since April 28, but that figure has risen to more than 650 as of Monday. Carlton said the metric means the “the number of people developing severe COVID-19 in Colorado doesn’t appear to be declining right now.” Some researchers said infection control efforts have fallen, and the time people spend away from home is rising, meaning current trends could continue.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Nursing home workers continue to struggle with severe staffing shortages, a lack of protective equipment and low pay during the coronavirus pandemic, according to a report released Monday, days before planned employee strikes across the state. The report also accuses nursing home owners of failing to follow federal guidance on the use of protective equipment and having inadequate infection control, testing and quarantine procedures during the pandemic. It alleges state officials haven’t done enough to oversee nursing homes and hold them accountable. The report, titled “We Were Abandoned: How Connecticut Failed Nursing Home Workers and Residents During the COVID-19 Pandemic,” was written by Yale Law School students for the Service Employees International Union’s District 1199 New England, which represents about 5,000 nursing home workers in Connecticut. “These workers risk their lives and the lives of their loved ones back home to care for these residents in unsafe conditions and for low pay,” Yale student Aaron Bryce Lee said at a news conference Monday. “The state must make the financial investments necessary to improve compensation, benefits and staffing levels.” Workers at 33 nursing homes are ready to strike beginning Friday if demands for better wages, benefits and staffing aren’t met.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Delaware State University will cancel more than $700,000 in student debt for recent graduates who “faced financial hardship during the COVID-19 pandemic,” the school announced Wednesday. The average eligible student will qualify for about $3,276 in debt relief, the school said. The funds, which will total $730,655, became available through the federal government’s latest coronavirus relief package. More than 200 students qualify, according to the university. A spokesperson for the school, Carlos Holmes, said most students should already know if they’ve qualified, but they can check with financial aid. School President Tony Allen said the debt reduction is consistent with the school’s initiatives to keep student debt manageable. “We haven’t raised our tuition in over six years; we issue every incoming student an iPad or a MacBook; we are replacing traditional textbooks with less expensive digital editions, and our Early College High School saves the average family of nearly $50,000 in college expenses,” he said in a statement. “Our students don’t just come here for a quality college experience. Most are trying to change the economic trajectory of their lives for themselves, their families, and their communities. Our responsibility is to do everything we can to put them on the path.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Residents face a Friday deadline to apply for a local program to help those who have fallen behind on their mortgage because of the pandemic, WUSA-TV reports. The Home Saver Program, offered by the D.C. Housing Finance Agency, has $4 million on the table to aid families in need, said Christopher Donald, executive director and CEO of the agency. “You’ve got to be a resident of the District of Columbia,” Donald said. “If they own a home here, and it’s their primary residence, and they’re behind on their mortgage, they’re either unemployed or underemployed, they can get up to 16 months of assistance, up to $60,000.” Money is also available through the Restore Program for people who have returned to work but need a boost to get out of the red. “The assistance does cover delinquent condo fees and HOA fees,” Donald said. The money comes in the form of a grant, so it doesn’t have to be paid back, and there is no income requirement to apply. Relief is also available for small landlords who have taken a financial hit during the pandemic.\n\nFlorida\n\nPensacola: Hot dogs, hamburgers, minor league baseball and COVID-19 shots are coming together. This week at Blue Wahoos Stadium, adult ticket buyers are eligible to receive the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine at several games. The shots were distributed Tuesday and will also be available at games Saturday and Sunday. J&J’s vaccine requires only one dose. Shots will be available to eligible fans for free, with no appointment necessary. “The Blue Wahoos’ mission statement is to improve the quality of life in our community, so when we had the opportunity to partner with the Florida Department of Health, it was a no-brainer for us,” said Donna Kirby, the team’s vice president of operations. “We thought, ‘Absolutely.’ What great fun to have fans back for baseball, to be able to provide them with vaccinations if they so choose.” A total of 500 doses will be administered at the ballpark on a first-come, first-served basis. They will not be divvied up over the course of the three games, Kirby said, so there is a possibility that all 500 shots could be administered before the end of the three-game stretch. To get in the spirit, team President Jonathan Griffith will receive his shot during the seventh-inning stretch of Saturday’s game.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Twelve-year-old Jane Ellen Norman is looking forward to a little more freedom in her life and a possible return to summer camp after getting her first dose of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine Tuesday, one day after U.S. regulators expanded its use to children her age through 15. Georgia is one of the first states to open up the shots, Reuters reports. Being able to see her friends without staying far apart and worrying they might get sick was top of mind for Jane Ellen after her shot at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in downtown Atlanta. “I hope they all get vaccinated,” the sixth grader said. Jane Ellen’s mom, English Norman, said she scheduled an appointment for her daughter and 14-year-old son immediately after hearing about the FDA authorization. She said her kids have been good about wearing masks, washing their hands and staying socially distant, but they’ve still been very anxious about leaving the house. “I think it’s exciting that now their anxiety can start to lessen and they can feel safe,” she said. Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock said Monday that the authorization brings the country “closer to returning to a sense of normalcy and to ending the pandemic.” For Jane Ellen, that means a chance to go back to her summer camp, which was canceled last year as the pandemic raged. “I’m excited to go there and see all my camp friends,” she said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The chief executive of a company accused of defrauding banks of money meant to assist businesses affected by the coronavirus pandemic pleaded not guilty Wednesday. Martin Kao, CEO of Martin Defense Group LLC, formerly known as Navatek LLC, is charged with bank fraud and money laundering. Authorities say he defrauded banks of more than $12.8 million through the Paycheck Protection Program, which Congress authorized to provide emergency financial assistance through forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and other expenses. Kao transferred more than $2 million into his own personal accounts, according to an indictment. Investigators talked to an executive and a former employee who said the company wasn’t affected by the pandemic, court documents said. Authorities describe his company as a “research, engineering, design, and innovations company that specializes in novel systems for the Department of Defense and other partners in academia and other scientific fields.” During a brief arraignment via telephone Wednesday, defense attorney Michael Green entered the not guilty plea on behalf of Kao.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state is moving into a new stage of Gov. Brad Little’s coronavirus reopening plans and lifting restrictions on the size of gatherings. Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Director Dave Jeppesen made the announcement Tuesday, noting that the state’s health care system isn’t strained and that plenty of vaccine is available for interested residents. “Eighty-three percent of hospitals are operating as normal, and there’s no hospital in the state that has a resource limitation going on,” Jeppesen said during a news conference. In November and December, some hospitals were intermittently turning away people or sending them elsewhere because they didn’t have enough healthy staffers or available beds to admit them. In Stage 3 of the reopening plan, gatherings were supposed to be limited to 50 or fewer people, though political, religious, educational and health care events were exempt from the restriction. The current move to Stage 4 means there is no limit on gatherings, though public health officials are encouraging people to follow guidance from federal and local health agencies on how to gather safely. Face coverings are still recommended at times when physical distancing is difficult, and people and businesses should continue to follow physical distancing and sanitation recommendations, Jeppesen said.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Capitalizing on the availability of vaccines, cabin fever and an imminent easing of pandemic restrictions, Gov. J.B. Pritzker on Wednesday launched a $6million advertising campaign to promote road-trip tourism and revive Illinois’ devastated hospitality industry. The “Time for Me to Drive” campaign makes use of a play on words from the 1978 song “Time for Me to Fly” by REO Speedwagon, a rock band that got its start in Champaign. The campaign will focus on attracting visitors from within Illinois and from surrounding states to hundreds of sites where they can enjoy Chicago architecture, southern Illinois wineries, hiking in state parks, restaurants throughout the state, and Springfield’s Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum. “More and more travelers are ready to get back out there,” Pritzker said at a news conference at the presidential library. “Recent surveys show that half of Americans plan to travel this summer, and half of them intend to drive. ... After an incredibly difficult year in which the pandemic kept us all close to home and staying apart, lifesaving vaccines are bringing us back to life and heading toward a summer of fun and venturing out.” More than 60 potential driving itineraries are available online at enjoyillinois.com.\n\nIndiana\n\nFishers: The Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra is bringing back its popular Symphony on the Prairie performances, a year after the pandemic forced the cancellation of the long-running outdoor concert series. Officials announced Monday that this year’s Kroger Symphony on the Prairie season will begin June 25 with the symphony’s rendition of songs by the Beatles performed for an audience on the grassy lawn at suburban Indianapolis’ Conner Prairie. A series of other performances will be held throughout the summer at the venue in Fishers, just north of Indianapolis, with the last performances set for early September. Tickets go on sale May 24. This year’s concerts will be different after last year’s shows were canceled for the first time in the events’ 40-year history due to the threat that the coronavirus posed to musicians, staff and patrons. The symphony plans to sell only up to 4,000 tickets – or 50% of the venue’s capacity – for the first concerts to help patrons maintain social distance. The dance floor in front of the performance stage will also be closed, and there will be limits on table rentals and reserved seating. People will also have to wear masks when entering the venue, on pathways, in restrooms, and when they wait in line for food and drinks.\n\nIowa\n\nIndianola: Simpson College won’t require students, staff or faculty to get vaccinated before the fall semester, but it also plans to hold off on returning to normal campus operations until most have gotten their COVID-19 shots. The college’s crisis management team, led by Heidi Levine, vice president for student development and planning, and Simpson President Marsha Kelliher’s leadership cabinet, announced the decision on the college’s online COVID-19 dashboard last week. According to the announcement, the team hopes to see 80% of the campus community vaccinated before transitioning to a “Green” operating phase, but it also plans to strongly encourage everyone on campus to get vaccinated. Some colleges across the country have recently announced vaccine requirements, “but that is still the minority of colleges,” Levine said, adding that Grinnell College is the only Iowa college of which she’s aware that plans to require students to be inoculated by August. Grinnell College officials announced the requirement last month but said students will be able to request an exemption for medical or religious reasons.\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: The families of 16 students have sued two suburban Kansas City school districts, arguing their children should be allowed to attend school during the pandemic without wearing masks. “The parents are terribly, terribly upset. There’s a groundswell of dissatisfaction,” said their attorney, Linus Baker. The Kansas City Star reports the lawsuit against the Blue Valley and Olathe school districts in Johnson County argues students should be granted individual exemptions to mask mandates. The parents contend masks are interfering with their children’s ability to learn. Districts offer medical exemptions, generally for students with special needs or disabilities. They also relax mask rules for students during some sports and other activities. Two parents already have medical exemptions but are suing to seek reimbursement for the costs to obtain them. Both districts have fielded challenges since the Legislature passed a bill that empowers parents to fight COVID-19 restrictions. But their school boards have so far upheld their mask mandates. District officials have argued that the mandates cannot be repealed under the new law because they were enacted last summer. The law requires individuals to contest them within 30 days.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state government will receive more than $2.1 billion from the latest round of federal coronavirus aid – a smaller-than-projected amount due to the commonwealth’s improving economic performance, Gov. Andy Beshear said Monday. The U.S. Treasury announced state allocations based on a formula that included each state’s share of the nation’s unemployed from October through December 2020, Beshear said. Kentucky performed better than expected during that period, he said. As a result, its allotment will be $2.18 billion, down from an initial estimate that state government would receive $2.44 billion, he said. “In other words, Kentucky has recovered stronger than the federal government anticipated, faster than most, and it impacted a little bit on the dollars that will be available to us,” the Democratic governor said at a news conference. Beshear has pointed to a recent series of upbeat economic developments – from record sales tax collections to a credit rating agency’s upgraded assessment of the state’s financial outlook – in touting Kentucky’s prospects as more people get COVID-19 vaccines. He has used the economic news to try to deflect criticism from some prominent Republicans calling for a much faster pace in lifting remaining virus restrictions.\n\nLouisiana\n\nShreveport: New research being done at LSU Health Shreveport offers an up-close view of how SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, can spread to the brain. The study helps explain the alarming array of neurological symptoms reported in some patients with COVID-19 and reveals clues as to why some patients suffer severe neurological effects, while others experience none at all. The researchers, working with colleagues at Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha in Spain, report evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can infect both neurons, the nerve cells that power the brain, and astrocytes, the cells in the brain and spinal cord that support and protect neurons. “Our findings suggest that astrocytes are a pathway through which COVID-19 causes neurological damage,” said Dr. Ricardo Costa, a postdoctoral fellow at LSU Health Shreveport and the study’s first author. “This could explain many of the neurologic symptoms we see in COVID-19 patients, which include loss of sense of smell and taste, disorientation, psychosis and stroke.”\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state is rolling out free fishing licenses, baseball tickets and L.L. Bean gift cards to encourage more residents to get vaccinated before the end of the month, Gov. Janet Mills announced Tuesday. The Democratic governor unveiled the public-private program, “Your Shot to Get Outdoors,” during a virtual discussion President Joe Biden hosted with several governors. The items include up to 5,000 hunting licenses, fishing licenses, Maine Wildlife Park day passes and state park day passes, along with up to 10,000 $20 L.L. Bean gift cards and up to 5,000 Portland Sea Dog tickets and passes for Oxford Plains Speedway. “Whether you’re an angler or a hunter, a baseball fan or a racing fan, or someone who just all-around enjoys being outside, now is a great time to protect yourself from COVID-19 and take to the outdoors,” Mills said. The program led by the Maine Department of Health and Human Services comes as the number of COVID-19 vaccinations administered dipped to less than 63,000 last week, down from a peak of more than 125,000 doses in the first week that eligibility opened to all adults. The state hopes the new program along with federal approval of a COVID-19 vaccine for younger teenagers will encourage more vaccinations.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: Seeking a big comeback after a pandemic-decimated 2020, city officials are hoping a new ad campaign will remind Americans of just why they love visiting the resort for summer vacation. About this time last year, Ocean City was reopening its hotels, beach and Boardwalk after COVID-19 forced closures. Despite reopening for the 2020 summer season, the pandemic wreaked havoc on Ocean City, causing businesses and the town to lose millions. This May, hotels, as well as the beach and Boardwalk, are all open, and “the pathway to the summer much brighter than it was last year,” Ocean City Mayor Rick Meehan said. This year’s ads offer a relatively traditional message, reminding viewers of the memories they’ve made at the beach and encouraging them to come make new ones. In one commercial, heartfelt music plays as a narrator reminds viewers that the 10 miles of beach in Ocean City aren’t “just made of sand and water; it’s made of memories.” That message has been carefully crafted since the end of last year, said Jessica Waters, the city’s acting tourism director. The two ads, “10 Miles of Memories” and “Ocean Calling,” were developed to focus on the “simple moments” and memories people create at the beach.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: While there was a slight increase in the overall number of confirmed and suspected opioid-related drug overdose deaths in the state in 2020 amid the coronavirus pandemic, overdose deaths among Black men soared by almost 70%, health officials said Wednesday. There were 2,104 confirmed and suspected opioid-related overdose deaths in the state last year, a 5% increase over the prior year, according to a report from the Department of Public Health. Among Black, non-Hispanic males, the confirmed opioid-related overdose death rate increased 69%, from 32.6 to 55.1 per 100,000 people – the highest increase of any ethnic or racial group in 2020. “The disparities in overdose trends among Black men underscore the need to continue our public health-centered, data-driven approach to the opioid epidemic that is disproportionately impacting high-risk, high-need priority populations,” Public Health Commissioner Dr. Monica Bharel said. Battling opioid use was complicated by the coronavirus pandemic, but Massachusetts is among the states with the smallest increases in all drug overdose deaths last year, officials said. “Both the COVID-19 pandemic and the opioid epidemic have underscored the importance of supporting disproportionately impacted communities,” Republican Gov. Charlie Baker said in a statement.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Health officials on Wednesday urged primary care physicians to enroll to administer COVID-19 vaccines, as the state prepared to quickly begin vaccinating 12- to 15-year-olds following U.S. authorization. “The most important thing we can do right now is to make vaccines available for whenever someone is ready,” Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, the state’s chief medical executive and chief health deputy, said during a news conference. “We know that patients trust their doctors, and when they are ready to get vaccinated, we want you to have vaccine on hand.” She encouraged doctors to check whether their patients have been vaccinated and ask if they have any questions. About 55% of Michigan residents ages 16 and older have been inoculated. The push to make doses available in physicians’ offices will complement the state’s focus on taking mobile clinics to places such as churches and vaccinating people who are homebound. Dr. Srikar Reddy, president-elect of the Michigan Academy of Family Physicians, said it is time to shift attention to residents who are hesitant about the vaccine and to the newly eligible children. “It only makes sense to visit your family physician to get vaccinated and to get your teenager vaccinated, too,” he said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The state government will get about $200 million more than it was expecting under President Joe Biden’s coronavirus relief package, and Democratic Gov. Tim Walz expressed hope Monday that new guidelines for how states can spend the aid might help speed up the slow pace of negotiations over Minnesota’s next budget. The legislative session is due to adjourn next Monday, but the governor and leaders of the divided Legislature have yet to agree on target numbers for a dozen broad spending bills at the core of the state’s next two-year budget, which is expected to come in at about $50 billion. Walz told reporters that at least they now know how Minnesota can and can’t spend its $2.8 billion in federal relief. “The clarification from Treasury is huge,” he said. “That’s what we’ve been waiting on.” Republican leaders said the new federal guidance clears the way for Minnesota to exempt Paycheck Protection Program loans and extended unemployment insurance benefits from state taxes, which have been GOP priorities this session. Democrats have sought to cap the PPP exemption so that larger, profitable companies would pay taxes on forgiven loans.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state will stop accepting supplemental unemployment benefits from the federal government next month, Republican Gov. Tate Reeves said Monday. Reeves said the weekly supplement of $300 per person was intended to help people “who are unemployed through no fault of their own” because of the coronavirus pandemic. “After many conversations over the last several weeks with Mississippi small business owners and their employees, it has become clear that the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) and other like programs passed by the Congress may have been necessary in May of last year but are no longer so in May of this year,” Reeves wrote on Facebook. He said he’s directed the Mississippi Department of Employment Security to tell the federal government that the state will opt out of the additional federal unemployment benefits June 12, the earliest date allowed by federal law. Without the federal supplement, the maximum weekly unemployment benefit in Mississippi is $235, according to the department. “It has become clear to me that we cannot have a full economic recovery until we get the thousands of available jobs in our state filled,” Reeves wrote. A 40-hour-per-week job at the minimum wage of $7.25 an hour would pay $290 a week before taxes are taken out.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: State lawmakers pushed back Wednesday against local coronavirus restrictions, passing legislation limiting the duration of public health orders that have shut down businesses and schools and limited how many people can gather. The legislation would limit emergency orders restricting businesses, churches, schools or gatherings to 30 days, unless extended by the local governing body. It would take effect immediately upon Gov. Mike Parson’s signature, meaning it could affect pandemic restrictions still in place in St. Louis County or other jurisdictions. It also would affect any future local health orders. “We want to be able to get this enforced as soon as possible,” said House Speaker Pro Tem John Wiemann, R-O’Fallon, who handled the bill. The House and Senate passed the legislation by overwhelming votes and with little discussion. Lawmakers have complained repeatedly during this year’s session about local pandemic restrictions that they say infringe on individual liberties and the ability to earn a living. The bill would allow local governing bodies to halt public health orders at any time by a majority vote. It also would prohibit cities and counties that receive public funds from requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccination to use public accommodations or transportation systems.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state is sharing COVID-19 vaccines with Canadian truck drivers from neighboring Alberta. About 2,000 truck drivers from the province who transport goods from Canada to the U.S. are eligible to be vaccinated at a highway rest stop near Conrad through May 23, according to a memorandum of understanding signed between the state and the Canadian province. “By working together and taking this critical action, we keep our trade channels open between Montana and Alberta,” Gov. Greg Gianforte said in a statement. The border between Canada and the U.S. has been closed to all but essential traffic since last spring. “Alberta depends on trade with our American neighbors and this program will ensure our goods get to market while stopping the spike of COVID-19,” Alberta Premier Jason Kenney said in a statement. The province has reported record numbers of new COVID-19 cases this month. A similar program to vaccinate truck drivers from Canada began in North Dakota last month. The announcement came after the Blackfeet tribe in northern Montana gave about 1,000 doses of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to their relatives and neighbors across the border last month.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A sweeping bill that would shield businesses and local governments from coronavirus-related lawsuits won initial approval from state lawmakers Tuesday, despite complaints that senators haven’t done enough for workers who were at risk. Lawmakers advanced the proposal, 39-3, through the first of three required votes. The measure would bar pandemic-related lawsuits against businesses or governments as long as they were following federal public health guidelines. At least 29 other states have enacted laws addressing the issue, including 12 that are similar to the Nebraska proposal, said state Sen. Tom Briese, of Albion, the measure’s sponsor. He said Nebraska businesses face the threat of “needless, unwarranted” lawsuits from the pandemic if lawmakers don’t pass legal protections. The proposal has strong backing from Nebraska businesses, hospitals, schools, counties and cities. Organizations representing Nebraska trial attorneys and public school teachers opposed it. Some senators also criticized the bill because they said lawmakers haven’t done enough to help on-the-ground workers who faced the pandemic directly, risking their own health. Lawmakers this year have rejected paid sick-leave requirements for businesses and additional coronavirus protections for meatpacking workers.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Gambling giant MGM Resorts International on Wednesday joined a growing number of Las Vegas Strip casinos with state regulatory approval to open casino floors at 100% capacity and no person-to-person distancing requirement. The company said the Nevada Gaming Control Board granted its waiver for nine properties based on its workforce vaccination rate. “We will continue working to vaccinate as many people as possible and remain vigilant with health and safety protocols,” company CEO & President Bill Hornbuckle said in a statement. Approval applies to casino floors at the Bellagio, ARIA, MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay, Mirage, New York-New York, Luxor, Excalibur and Park MGM. Three-foot distancing and 80% occupancy restrictions remain at restaurants, swimming pools and other non-gambling areas. Masks are still required. Clark County lawmakers with jurisdiction over Las Vegas-area businesses have approved plans to allow 100% occupancy once 60% of eligible county residents get a vaccine shot. As of Tuesday, the figure was 47%. Southern Nevada Health District Chief Health Officer Dr. Fermin Leguen said the county might not reach the threshold by June 1, given lagging demand.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The Prouty, an annual event to raise money for cancer research, is allowing some in-person participation this year, its 40th, after going virtual last summer because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Prouty combines cycling, walking and other events to raise funds for the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Norris Cotton Cancer Center. This year, in-person options include golf July 9 in Grantham, a 20-mile cycle July 10 in Hanover and a 5K walk July 11 in Hanover. Designated start times will be assigned to small groups to meet capacity restrictions. Local health guidelines and enhanced safety protocols will be followed. People can participate in activities virtually between June 1 and July 10. “The Prouty has always been about hope, and this year’s hybrid model is a stepping stone to a return to normalcy from the pandemic,” said Jacklynn Rodriguez, executive director for the Friends of the Norris Cotton Cancer Center. Since its inception in 1982, The Prouty has raised more than $50 million to support cancer research and patient and family support services.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNew Brunswick: For the second year in a row, Rutgers University will host virtual commencement ceremonies for graduates of its New Brunswick, Newark and Camden campuses. However, the school announced Tuesday that it will commend the graduates of 2020 and 2021 with in-person celebrations this fall. A notice on the university’s website asks students to save dates for their campus’s events: Rutgers New Brunswick and Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences on Oct. 22-23, Rutgers Newark on Nov. 8-10 and Rutgers Camden on Dec. 1-4. “While we had hoped to bring you together sooner, the continuing public health emergency associated with the pandemic prevented us until now,” said a statement signed by University President Jonathan Holloway and each school’s chancellor. Details on the events will be posted to the university’s website at a later date. “We are excited that Rutgers will have the opportunity this fall to bring you together in person and salute you for your accomplishments,” the announcement said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: A year after holding only drive-thru graduations, the school district for the state’s second most populous city has scheduled in-person graduation ceremonies at the district’s soccer stadium for its six high schools over two days later this month. Las Cruces Public Schools scheduled ceremonies May 21 for Onate and Mayfield high schools and Arrowhead Park Early College High School and on May 22 for Las Cruces and Centennial high schools and Rio Grande Preparatory Institute. Each graduating senior can invite up to 16 ticketed people, with the limit set due to the COVID-19 pandemic plus construction-related traffic in the area of the Field of Dreams stadium. Social distancing and mask-wearing will be required for all attendees while inside the venue. “I do want to thank all the graduates for their continuous resilience throughout this whole pandemic and really doing the best that they can,” interim Superintendent Ralph Ramos said. “We want to have this ceremony.” Ramos said the district is looking into ways to celebrate the class of 2020, which didn’t have a normal graduation.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: State regulators will soon draft rules that will require employers to protect workers from airborne infectious disease. A new state law tasks state labor and health officials with coming up with minimum workplace standards around things like the availability of personal protective equipment, social distancing and quarantine requirements. Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed the bill into law last week. Employers will have to come up with safety plans that comply with the yet-to-be written state standards and provide them to workers. Employers who don’t comply could face fines. Workers could also sue for up to $20,000 from employers who don’t follow safety standards or retaliate against workers for reporting noncompliance. The law was intended to help people like Maritza Ovalles, who has worked in the nail salon industry for over two decades but left her job when the COVID-19 pandemic struck and left her exposed in a workplace that she said lacked adequate health and safety protections. “When the pandemic began, the level of risk of not having proper protections was life or death,” said Ovalles, who advocates for better working conditions as a member of the NY Nail Salon Workers Association.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: Public health officials across Western North Carolina are asking the public to get involved as they work to identify the most pressing health needs for the next three years, such as impacts from COVID-19, cancer or infant mortality. National research firm PRC will conduct phone surveys with 300 Buncombe County residents through June, a confidential survey asking about residents’ health status, behaviors and experiences, according to a statement announcing the start of data collection. The 20-minute surveys will go to randomly selected households, but even folks who don’t get the call can take the survey online at www.buncombecounty.org/publichealth. Buncombe County Public Health Director Stacie Saunders urged residents to take part. “If you receive the call to participate, please do lend your voice to the survey,” she said in the release. “This is your opportunity to help us identify health priorities in our community.” Buncombe is joining 17 other counties this year in the regional community health assessment, WNC Healthy Impact, a collaboration with hospital organizations, public health departments and other community partners.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The United Tribes Technical College International Powwow and associated events will return late this summer after a year’s hiatus due to the coronavirus pandemic. However, the Tribal Leaders Summit that’s traditionally held at the Bismarck Event Center before the outdoor powwow has been called off for a second year. The Bismarck Tribune reports this year’s powwow will be the weekend of Sept. 10-12, starting with the grand entry Friday night and continuing through Sunday. Associated events will include Powwow Youth Day that Friday, a golf tournament Friday, a three-day softball tournament and a three-day youth basketball tournament beginning Friday, and the Powwow Thunderbird Run on Saturday. The powwow put on by the five American Indian tribes in North Dakota typically brings about 10,000 people to Bismarck and boosts the area economy by more than $4 million, according to the college. It attracts dancers from dozens of tribes across the U.S. and Canada and awards more than $100,000 in prize money. It’s considered one of the top powwows in the nation. United Tribes uses proceeds to fund student scholarships.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: State lawmakers have passed changes to ensure that if Kroger is allowed to sell flowers during a pandemic, the local florist can, too. Senate Bill 134, also known as the Business Fairness Act, passed the Ohio Senate 31-0 on Wednesday. The measure would prevent Gov. Mike DeWine’s administration from closing small businesses while their larger competitors remain open, assuming everyone can follow the same safety guidelines. “I would argue you are safer in a small business where you may be the only customer in that business at that time,” Sen. George Lang, R-West Chester, said on the floor Wednesday. The disparity came to light in March 2020 when DeWine’s state health department closed a slew of businesses to prevent the spread of COVID-19 but allowed groceries, pharmacies and other businesses to remain open. The result: Wal-Mart and Kroger stayed open, while the local jeweler had to close. “The playing field must be level,” said Chris Ferruso, a lobbyist for Ohio’s National Federation of Independent Business. “The government should not be picking winners and losers.” And small businesses were among the losers last year. A survey of National Federation of Independent Business members found 1 in 3 closed because of COVID-19 orders.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A new state law that creates a sales tax exemption for the University Hospitals Authority and Trust will grant OU Health funding to train more medical professionals. The law recently approved by the Legislature and Gov. Kevin Stitt restores a sales tax exemption that will allow the health system to train 160 additional nursing graduates and nurse practitioners annually and 70 additional medical residents within three years. State lawmakers and University of Oklahoma officials said the law will help address Oklahoma’s nurse and physician shortage and improve medical care across the state. Oklahoma has 40% fewer nurses per capita than the national average, said OU College of Nursing Dean Julie Hoff. “These nurses will soon be on the front lines of health care, allowing our facilities to increase their staffing levels and making it easier for everyone in the state to get the care they need,” she said. The state is 46th in the nation for physicians per capita, OU President Joseph Harroz Jr. said at a news conference Tuesday.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Gov. Kate Brown on Tuesday announced statewide and county COVID-19 vaccination targets, with the hope of reopening the state’s economy. Most statewide restrictions will be lifted when 70% of residents 16 and older receive their first vaccine dose, Brown said. In addition, counties will be eligible to move into the “lower risk” category when 65% of the area’s eligible population is vaccinated. “We still have some work to do to reach our 70% goal, but I am confident we can get there in June and return Oregon to a sense of normalcy,” Brown said. “We each play a part.” Currently, more than half the state’s eligible population has received a first dose. “For the first time since the start of the pandemic, we’ll be able to say the virus no longer controls the timelines in our lives – we will if enough Oregonians make the choice to get vaccinated,” said Pat Allen, the Oregon Health Authority’s director. Counties with 65% of their 16-and-up population inoculated will be eligible for the “lower risk” category, which permits indoor gatherings of 10 people or outdoor gatherings of 12 people. Restaurants, gyms and indoor and outdoor entertainment can open up to 50% capacity. Benton and Hood River counties have already vaccinated more than 65% of adult residents and are ready to move to the lower risk category May 21, unless they opt out.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state is allowing more people at indoor and outdoor events. Beginning Monday, occupancy limits will be increased to 50% of capacity for indoor events, up from 25%, and to 75% for outdoor events, up from 50%. “As more Pennsylvania adults get vaccinated and guidance from the CDC evolves, we can continue to move forward with the commonwealth’s reopening efforts,” Gov. Tom Wolf said in a statement Tuesday. The state has previously announced that nearly all pandemic restrictions will go away on Memorial Day, including capacity limits on bars, restaurants and other businesses, as well as indoor and outdoor event gathering limits. The state’s mask mandate will remain until 75% of adults are fully vaccinated. Statewide, about 45.6% of people 18 and older had been fully vaccinated as of Tuesday, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In Philadelphia, meanwhile, city officials announced pandemic restrictions will be eased beginning later this month and will go away almost entirely June 11. Starting May 21, retail stores and offices will no longer have to operate at reduced capacity, and the city is lifting its rule that bars and restaurants can only serve alcohol with food. Capacity limits on gyms, exercise classes and theaters will be eased, as well as for catered events.\n\nRhode Island\n\nPawtucket: With no baseball team in town, McCoy Stadium is being put to good use with the opening of a vaccination clinic at the site on Wednesdays. The drive-up, walk-up site will be open every Wednesday from 5 p.m. until 8 p.m., according to a statement from the city. Residents can make an appointment for a COVID-19 shot at the state’s vaccine signup portal, but people without an appointment are also welcome and encouraged, city officials said. The goal is to make getting vaccinations as convenient as possible. “We want to make sure that everyone has the opportunity to get a vaccine,” Pawtucket Public Health and Equity Leader Elizabeth Moreira said. “We believe that opening this site gives everyone another great option for vaccination appointments later on in the day.” The clinic will be run in partnership with the Rhode Island National Guard and Rhode Island Medical Reserve Corps Disaster Medical Assistance Team. The coronavirus testing site at the stadium will continue operating.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state’s public schools chief on Wednesday said the governor had no legal basis for allowing parents to opt their children out of wearing masks in schools, writing that Gov. Henry McMaster is “inciting hysteria and sowing division” as the school year ends. In guidance sent to state education superintendents Wednesday, education officials said the agency could find “no legal grounds” for the governor to set aside a policy instituted by another constitutional officer, under his or her own powers and not due to an emergency declaration. On Tuesday, the Republican governor issued an executive order letting parents opt their children out of wearing masks in public schools, citing widespread COVID-19 vaccine access for adults across the state. In response, education officials said state Superintendent Molly Spearman had opted to rescind a face-covering policy, with the exception of a federally instituted school bus mask mandate, “rather than wage a debate over constitutionality that would pit elected officials, students, and families against one another.” Guidance had required that students, teachers and staff wear face coverings while entering school buildings, moving through hallways and other instances where social distancing is not possible or optimal.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: The South Dakota Department of Health said Wednesday that the state has crossed the 50% threshold for the percentage of adults fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Health officials say more than 304,000 residents have received their shots. “I want to take this opportunity to thank all South Dakotans who have chosen to get their COVID-19 vaccine– protecting themselves, their family and their community,” Secretary of Health Kim Malsam-Rysdon said. “Vaccines are safe and are the quickest way out of this pandemic.” State health officials began Phase 2 of South Dakota’s vaccination plan April 5. It made vaccines available to all residents age 16 and older, in addition to any eligible person who had not been inoculated in the first phase. Parents, schools and vaccine clinics are rushing to begin inoculating younger children after U.S. regulators this week endorsed Pfizer’s vaccine for those as young as 12, a decision seen as a breakthrough in allowing classroom instruction to resume safely around the country. A handful of cities started offering shots to children ages 12 to 15 less than a day after the Food and Drug Administration gave the vaccine emergency use authorization for that age group.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: As she oversees the state’s response to the pandemic, Dr. Lisa Piercey knows getting back to normal may hinge on her ability to convince Christians and conservatives to get vaccinated. Piercey, 43, Tennessee’s top health official, is navigating a crisis of vaccine hesitancy that runs rampant in the rural swathes of the Volunteer State. “Being the hands and feet of Jesus is the way to go,” said Piercey, a 2019 appointee of Gov. Bill Lee. “They might not do it for themselves, but they should do it to help other people.” She said her office is unleashing a media campaign aimed partly at the people who are most hesitant, and she is reaching out to faith leaders to convince those residents on the virtues of vaccination. “It’s their pastor they trust,” Piercey said. And she’s confident the approach will work because she is one of them. An evangelical Christian farm girl from West Tennessee, Piercey said she doesn’t believe in evolution and struggles with the timelines of dinosaurs and man, but she still wears a mask around other people and has strict vaccination rules in her family. On May 20, the mother of four’s triplets will turn 16. “On that morning, they will get the vaccine first and their driver’s licenses second,” Piercey said.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: With the coronavirus pandemic not yet licked, some activities will look a little different again this summer, including dips in the city’s beloved, “68-degrees-year-round” watering hole, Barton Springs Pool. Starting later this month, anyone planning a swim at Barton Springs will need to make an advance reservation online. Two-hour time slots will help the pool “to manage capacity for the safety of staff and guests,” according to the city’s website. Those who have purchased a season pass, are older than 80, are city employees, or are veterans or active military members will be allowed to enter the pool without a reservation, but that won’t apply to anyone accompanying them. At this time, Barton Springs Pool is not accepting group reservations. Reservations can be made on a city website. A reservation fee will cost Austin residents $2 if they’re between 1 and 11 years old, $3 for those 12-17, $5 for all adults and $2 for anyone over 61. For nonresidents, it’s $4 for those 1-11, $5 for those 12-17, $9 for all adults and $5 for anyone over 61. All payments must be completed online ahead of time. Those with a seasonal swim pass will also not need to reserve a spot ahead of time before visiting Barton Springs. Passes went on sale earlier this week.\n\nUtah\n\nRoy: A resident has said a hacker stole her personal information and swapped out her banking information to steal about $400 of weekly unemployment benefits. “I feel like being robbed at gunpoint would’ve been better than what’s going to happen now,” said Heidi Howell, who lost her job in March and had her identity and unemployment check stolen. Howell told KUTV-TV that she is now waiting to find out if she can still claim the unemployment check. She also froze her credit reports, filed a police report and changed her bank account numbers. Kevin Burt, director of the Utah Unemployment Insurance Division, said this is the first case he’s seen among 450,000 people seeking benefits in the state during the coronavirus pandemic. He believes the hacker got her login information from another website. “Make sure that you have a secure password,” Burt said. “I think that helps quite a bit – that’s different than your other passwords that you use for more casual online interactions.” Howell said she used a unique password and is not sure how someone gained access. Burt said the state has not seen much of a rise in hacks to the unemployment system, although fraud is up nationwide because of the historic volume of claims being filed.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: A community group of members of the state’s minority populations is working to make sure as many of those residents as possible are vaccinated against COVID-19. The Vermont Health Equity Initiative said it will be providing vaccinations for those who are Black, indigenous and people of color through July 10. Clinics are being offered with support from the Vermont Department of Health and the City of Burlington. So far, the initiative has collaborated to deliver more than 2,800 total doses of the vaccine. The group said that as of Monday, about 70% of white, non-Hispanic Vermonters in Chittenden County had received at least one dose of the vaccine, while 58% of minority members had received at least one dose. The clinics were established in an effort to close the racial gap in vaccinations to protect the larger community and in response to the city of Burlington’s declaration of racism as a public health emergency in July 2020. “We’re offering an in-person experience that has been missing for vaccinations for these members of our community,” said Belan Antensaye of the Racial, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging Department of the city of Burlington and the Vermont Professionals of Color Network.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Restaurants and drinking establishments will be able to seat up to 100 patrons indoors and a maximum of 250 guests outdoors starting May 15, Gov. Ralph Northam recently announced, but establishments say they may not be able to accommodate more guests due to a shortage in workers. Eric Terry, president of the Virginia Restaurant, Lodging & Travel Association, estimated about 100 Richmond restaurants closed in 2020 but said there have been minimal closures this year. Many restaurants are likely nearing 80% of their pre-pandemic revenue levels, according to Terry. While full recovery for the industry is underway, Terry said the biggest revenue factor is a restricted labor force. “I was on the phone yesterday with two restaurant operators who said they are having to close two days a week because they can’t get enough staff,” he said. The new limit will double the number of indoor guests allowed as of April 1. Restaurants may return to selling alcohol past midnight, and dining room closures between midnight and 5 a.m. will no longer be required. Northam has said all restrictions will be lifted June 15 if the number of new COVID-19 cases remains low and vaccinations rise. But restaurants with limited staff will not be able to accommodate diners at full capacity, Terry said.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Authorities say schools in the state won’t consider a requirement to mandate COVID-19 vaccines in schoolchildren until a vaccine is fully approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA on Monday signed off on emergency use of the Pfizer vaccine in 12- to 15-year-olds. The state’s secretary of health, Umair Shah, said Tuesday that more than 370,000 Washington teens and adolescents are in that age group. Vaccines undergo rigorous review before they’re fully approved, but the FDA can allow use under so-called emergency use authorization in instances when vaccines meet certain criteria and there are no approved alternatives. The Seattle Times reports that until a COVID-19 vaccine is formally approved, officials from the Washington State Board of Health – the board that oversees state vaccine policies – say they won’t consider adding it to the list of required immunizations. “The board would not require a COVID-19 vaccine for school entry until it’s approved by the FDA and recommended by Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices,” Kelie Kahler, spokesperson for the board, wrote in an email, referring to a committee housed within the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that sets national vaccine guidance.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Democratic U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin is joining first lady Jill Biden and actor Jennifer Garner during a visit to the state Thursday. Biden’s office announced Wednesday that she and Manchin will arrive at Yeager Airport in Charleston before joining Garner at a COVID-19 vaccination center and delivering remarks at Capital High School. A previously announced visit to Arnoldsburg Elementary School in Calhoun County has been scrubbed due to a coronavirus quarantine in the school district. Biden and Manchin will then visit with members of the West Virginia National Guard and their families at the airport before departing, the first lady’s office said in a statement. Garner grew up in Charleston. She has previously testified before Congress in support of education programs for preschoolers in poverty.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Native Americans are struggling to overcome increased drug abuse related to the COVID-19 pandemic, a tribal leader said in the annual State of the Tribes address. Speaking to Assembly lawmakers at the state Capitol on Tuesday afternoon, Lac du Flambeau President John Johnson Sr. said increased drug abuse has claimed those most vulnerable during the public health crisis. “The flow of drugs into the Northwoods has escalated during the pandemic, as mental health, economic and social challenges exert growing pressure on our people and families,” Johnson said. He said Gov. Tony Evers’ budget proposal for a regional mental health center in northern Wisconsin is “a crucial building block and a foundation of dismantling the scourge of drugs,” Wisconsin Public Radio reports. Evers has proposed investing more than $150 million in mental health services, including more than $25 million over the next two years for regional crisis centers, training and other services. Republican state lawmakers have stripped hundreds of proposals from the governor’s budget. Johnson also said tribes continue to face harassment and racism as they defend their federal treaty rights to hunt, fish and gather. He specifically highlighted harassment of those spearfishing in northern Wisconsin.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The governor has announced that the state will end its participation in federal supplemental benefits intended to address high unemployment across the U.S. caused by the pandemic. Republican Gov. Mark Gordon said Tuesday that the decision will end the weekly $300 payments starting June 19 and no longer expand eligibility to people who previously could not collect benefits, such as self-employed residents, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. The Wyoming Department of Workforce Services reported last month that the unemployment rate in the state was 5.3% in March – below the national 6% rate. “Wyoming needs workers; our businesses are raring to go,” Gordon said. “I recognize the challenges facing Wyoming employers, and I believe it’s critical for us to do what we can to encourage more hiring.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/05/13"}, {"url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/arizona-health/2020/02/28/coronavirus-arizona-updates-virus-travel-safety-more/4903384002/", "title": "LIVE Arizona coronavirus updates: New cases, closures, advisories", "text": "Arizona Republic\n\nThe spread of a highly contagious coronavirus has had wide-ranging global impacts, including in the financial markets and government travel policies.\n\nTHE LATEST: This blog has moved.

Trump announced Sunday he would extend social distancing guidelines through April 30.\n\nAmericans abroad urged to come home\n\nMarch 31: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is making his advice to U.S. citizens still overseas during the coronavirus crisis simple: \"Americans who wish to return home from abroad should so immediately and make arrangements to accomplish that,\" he stressed during a Tuesday briefing.\n\nWhile Pompeo said his repatriation task force remains committed to bringing all Americans home, he said the window to do so is closing.\n\n\"We do not know how long the commercial flights in your countries may continue to operate,\" he said as airlines have already slashed international service. \"We can't guarantee the U.S. government's ability to arrange charter flights indefinitely where commercial options no longer exist.\"\n\nIn the meantime, he urged Americans to register with their nearest embassy or consulate or do so online via STEP, the State Department's Smart Traveler Enrollment Program.\n\nAt-home coronavirus tests halted despite progress\n\nMarch 31: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration abruptly shut down sales of at-home coronavirus test kits earlier this month but some companies say they haven’t given up.\n\nThe scarcity of tests in general, coupled with consumers' desire to take control, makes the idea both intriguing and controversial.\n\nCritics say home tests may be unreliable, might delay necessary treatment and could soak up scarce resources. Proponents say at-home test kits could save money and resources – and in the near future could play a critical role in tracking COVID-19.\n\nThe FDA leaped into action on March 20 when several startup companies started selling or preparing to sell at-home kits.\n\nIn strong language, the agency called at-home test kits “fraudulent.”\n\nFeds launch inquiry of 4 lawmakers who sold off stock\n\nMarch 30: Federal authorities are reviewing the stock sales of four lawmakers just before the market slide triggered by the coronavirus outbreak, a person familiar with the matter said Monday.\n\nFinancial disclosure statements indicated that Sens. Richard Burr, R-N.C.; Jim Inhofe, R-Okla.; Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga.; and Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.; their spouses or advisers sold large chunks of stock around the time lawmakers received behind-the-scenes briefings about the severity of the coronavirus, which has claimed more than 2,900 lives in the USA.\n\nThe senators denied any wrongdoing, and Burr asked the Senate Ethics Committee to review his transactions involving up to $1.6 million. The federal inquiry, which was in its early stages, was first reported by CNN.\n\nGov. Ducey issues stay-at-home order\n\nMarch 30:Gov. Doug Ducey on Monday issued a statewide \"stay-at-home\" order to slow the spread of the new coronavirus, preventing Arizonans from leaving their residences except for food, medicine and other \"essential activities.\"\n\nThe directive, which also allows for outdoor exercise, will take effect at the close of business Tuesday and apply through at least April 30.\n\n\"Already, things have shut down to a large degree,\" the Republican leader said at an afternoon press briefing, with Department of Health Services Director Dr. Cara Christ at his side. \"They're going to shut down even further.\"\n\nDucey indicated he did not consider the mandate a \"shelter-in-place\" order, however, saying that phrase is reserved for nuclear attacks or active shooter situations.\n\n\"Our goal here is to protect the lives of those we love most and to ensure the health care system has the capacity to provide them with the care and comfort they deserve,\" he said. \"We want people to stay at home.\"\n\nArizona schools closed for the rest of the school year\n\nMarch 30: Gov. Doug Ducey has extended the closure of all Arizona schools through the end of this school year.\n\nIn a joint statement Monday with Superintendent of Public Instruction Kathy Hoffman, Ducey wrote that the decision was made to align with guidance from the federal government.\n\n\"These efforts are crucial, and we recognize that schools are making every effort possible to continue providing instruction during closures,\" they wrote in the statement.\n\nOn Friday, Ducey signed legislation to allow students to finish the school year from home.\n\nThe plan mandates that schools offer classes in an alternative format, presumably online, so students could finish out the school year from home. It also includes provisions to ensure seniors in high school graduate.\n\nGov. Ducey holds 2 p.m. press conference\n\nSummer Olympics to kick off in July 2021\n\nMarch 30: Less than a week after announcing that the Summer Games in Japan would be postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic, organizers have decided on a new start date of July 23, 2021, according to an International Olympic Committee spokesman. The closing ceremony will be held on Aug. 8. The Tokyo Olympics had previously been set to start almost exactly one year earlier, running from July 24 through Aug. 9.\n\nArizona coronavirus cases now surpass 1K, with 20 deaths\n\nMarch 30: Arizona cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, now number more than 1,000, with 20 known deaths, new numbers posted by the Arizona Department of Health Services on Monday show.\n\nThe total identified cases in Arizona is 1,157, according to the latest state figures, with every one of the state's 15 counties now recording at least one case.\n\nThat's an increase of confirmed 238 cases, or 26%, since Sunday.\n\nArizona's new coronavirus cases increase to 912; deaths rise to 16\n\nMarch 29: The number of identified new coronavirus cases in Arizona rose to 912 on Sunday — a roughly 17% increase from the day before, according to data released by the Arizona Department of Health Services.\n\nThe number of reported deaths related to COVID-19 also increased by one to a total of 16 on Sunday.\n\nMore than 2,000 coronavirus patients have died in U.S.\n\nMarch 28: Just one day after the U.S. surpassed 100,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, the nation witnessed another grim figure: More than 2,000 COVID-19 patients have died.\n\nTesting continues to expand across the nation, and the U.S. is seeing daily spikes in the number of reported cases. Nearly 500 coronavirus-related deaths were reported Saturday, up from 1,544 confirmed deaths 24 hours earlier, according to Johns Hopkins University's data dashboard.\n\nThe death toll was 2,010 Saturday shortly after 6 p.m. ET. That number is expected to rise steadily in the coming days and weeks, and health officials say the number of cases is likely higher due to lack of testing. Nearly 18,000 new cases were reported on both Wednesday and Thursday, according to Johns Hopkins.\n\nMore than 120,000 cases have been reported in the U.S.\n\nCases have been reported in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands. New York has reported the most deaths, followed by Washington, New York and Louisiana, according to Johns Hopkins.\n\nFDA authorizes 5-minute coronavirus test the size of a toaster\n\nMarch 28: CHICAGO – A five-minute, point-of-care coronavirus test could be coming to urgent care clinics next week, and experts say it could be \"game-changing.\"\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued Emergency Use Authorization to Illinois-based medical device maker Abbott Labs on Friday for a coronavirus test that delivers positive results in as little as five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes, the company said.\n\nThe company expects the tests to be available next week and expects to ramp up manufacturing to deliver 50,000 tests per day.\n\nDays before closing, Caesars Entertainment said 3,200 workers would lose jobs\n\nLAS VEGAS – Four days before closing nine hotel-casinos along the Las Vegas Strip to slow the spread of COVID-19, Caesars Entertainment notified state officials that 3,200 workers would lose their jobs, according to documents obtained by the Reno-Gazette Journal, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nIn a March 14 letter to the Nevada Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation, the company announced the cuts would happen the following day.\n\n\"Given the unknown certainty surrounding COVID-19,\" wrote Servando Lara, Caesars' director of labor relations, \"we are unable to make a determination as to whether the layoff will be temporary or permanent.\"\n\nOne day after the letter arrived, Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak ordered that all non-essential businesses across the state shut down to arrest the spread of COVID-19.\n\nArizona COVID-19 deaths up to 15; reported cases rise to 773\n\nMarch 28: Arizona's death toll related to the new coronavirus rose to 15, according to data released by the Arizona Department of Health Services on Saturday morning.\n\nThe number of reported cases around the state also rose to 773.\n\nAs of Friday, there were 13 deaths and 665 reported cases around the state. Cases grew from Friday to Saturday by roughly 16%.\n\nOn Saturday, Pima County announced an additional coronavirus-related death, bringing the county total to five.\n\nThe man was a hospice patient between the age of 18 and 40, the county said.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear whether the Pima County death was one of the two additional deaths announced by the state Saturday morning.\n\nMaricopa County reported a growth of 53 cases, with 96 of the 452 cases in the county requiring hospitalization.\n\nMember of Alhambra school community infected\n\nMarch 28: Alhambra Elementary School District announced Friday that someone who attended the school's non-sponsored trip to Magic Mountain has tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nThe news was shared via an email to parents from Richard Stinnett, the school's principal. The email did not reveal whether the infected person was a student or other party.\n\nStinnett relayed in the email that the trip took place from March 6-8, more than two weeks removed since the person in question received their positive test. School has not been in session since the trip, Stinnett wrote.\n\nStill, the email communicated that the infected person is recovering at home while quarantined and that no other cases have been linked to this case.\n\nDisney World, Disneyland to stay closed indefinitely\n\nMarch 27: Citing an \"increasingly complex crisis,\" Disneyland and Disney World are going to stay closed \"until further notice\" due to the coronavirus pandemic, the Walt Disney Company said Friday.\n\nThe company's decision dashes hopes that the fabled theme parks would reopen by next month, as had been previously announced. Earlier this week, Universal Orlando Resort and Universal Studios Hollywood announced they were extending their closures through April 19.\n\nFor Disney, the concern was about making sure park-goers and employees aren't exposed to the virus.\n\n\"While there is still much uncertainty with respect to the impacts of COVID-19, the safety and well-being of our guests and employees remains the Walt Disney Company’s top priority,\" the company said in an email statement. It said the decision was \"in line with direction provided by health experts and government officials.\"\n\nTrump signs $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus intended to halt economic meltdown\n\nMarch 27: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump signed a $2 trillion bipartisan stimulus package Friday that is intended to address the threat of economic disaster posed by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nTrump signed the measure – the largest stimulus in U.S. history – in the Oval Office hours after it was approved by the House of Representatives, an unusually rapid approval that underscored dire warnings of a recession as companies began to lay off workers and U.S. consumers hunkered down in their homes to avoid spreading the virus.\n\n\"I want to thank Democrats and Republicans for coming together and putting America first,\" Trump said at the signing.\n\nWhile the president’s signature ended the legislative effort on Capitol Hill, it marked a beginning to the government’s work managing the crisis. Now the Trump administration must rapidly pump hundreds of billions of dollars into the economy in the form of direct payments, loans and grants to hard-hit industries such as the airlines.\n\nThe stimulus package will provide $1,200 checks to many Americans – and more for families – while making available hundreds of billions of dollars for companies to maintain payroll through the crisis. It significantly expands the nation’s unemployment safety net and it directs a huge infusion of cash to hospitals and other medical facilities on the front line of fighting the pandemic.\n\nMarkets rallied in recent days on the news that Republicans and Democrats had reached a deal on the stimulus, recovering some of the staggering losses of the past several weeks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average remained down Friday in midday trading.\n\nHouse approves historic coronavirus package, sending $2 trillion bill to Trump’s desk\n\nMarch 27: WASHINGTON – The House voted to pass a $2 trillion coronavirus relief package – the largest emergency aid bill in history – that will offer $1,200 checks to Americans, extensive unemployment benefits for those out of work and financial relief to businesses and the health care industry hard-hit by the worsening crisis.\n\nThe House’s vote allows the bill to head to President Donald Trump’s desk for final approval. Trump has signaled he will sign the bill.\n\nThe vote comes one day after the U.S. reached two grim milestones, becoming the country with the most coronavirus cases in the world and reporting a record 3.28 million workers who applied for unemployment benefits in one week – the highest number in history since the Department of Labor started tracking data in 1967. The massive package aims to offer a financial lifeline to Americans and businesses that are hurting while also offering reassurance to the markets, which have been battered by fears that shutdowns related to the pandemic could throw the economy into a deep recession.\n\nUS neglected its medical stockpile, whistleblowers say\n\nMarch 27: A secretive cache of medical supplies to save Americans from deadly disasters for years lacked the funding to prepare for a pandemic as widespread as the coronavirus, former managers of the stockpile told USA TODAY.\n\nOverseen by a cadre of scientists, disease specialists and others at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Strategic National Stockpile houses roughly $8 billion in inventory for rapid deployment to anywhere in the nation in under 12 hours.\n\nBut its inadequate supply of ventilators, respiratory masks and other personal protective equipment will leave critical shortages for U.S. hospitals scrambling to respond to the mounting coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe stockpile had just 16,600 of the breathing machines and an estimated 12 million N95 masks at the start of the pandemic – not enough for the country, USA TODAY reports.\n\nThe latest: US COVID-19 count\n\nUS passes Italy, China as nation with the most confirmed cases of COVID-19\n\nMarch 26: The U.S. surged past China and Italy to become the planet's most infected nation Thursday, a stark milestone in the coronavirus era - and a reminder of its deadly, culture-changing effects on American life.\n\nThe Johns Hopkins University dashboard showed the U.S. with 82,404 COVID-19 infections as of 6 p.m., ET, moving past Italy (80,589) and China (81,782). More than 1,100 people have died in the U.S.\n\nPart of the reason for the nation's top ranking is cause and effect: The U.S. has drastically ramped up its testing protocols in order to identify infected people and those who may be carriers of the virus. As testing has increased, so has the number of confirmed cases.\n\nWatch: Trump speaks on coronavirus\n\nMarch 26: On a day when jobless claims smashed a record and U.S. deaths surged past 1,100 as the coronavirus tightened its grip on America, the prospect of a stimulus package soon becoming reality helped propel a third consecutive stock market rally Thursday.\n\nThe Labor Department, in announcing the unemployment claims numbers for last week, said what Americans already knew – that layoffs hit the hospitality and food service industries particularly hard. Other industries that struggled included health care and social assistance, arts, entertainment and recreation, transportation and warehousing, and manufacturing industries, Labor said.\n\nCongress was trying to supply a ray of hope. The House is scheduled to take up a Senate-passed, $2 trillion emergency aid proposal Friday. Swift passage was expected – after an initial hangup, the package flew through the Senate on Wednesday night by a vote of 96-0. President Donald Trump has expressed a willingness to sign the measure.\n\nDow posts best 3-day gain since 1931\n\nMarch 26: U.S. stocks notched their first three-day rally in six weeks Thursday on hopes that Congress will quickly approve a coronavirus rescue package for the economy while the outbreak in China shows signs that it has been largely contained.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1,351.62 points, or 6.4%, to close at 22,552.17. The blue-chip average has advanced 21.3% over the past three days, its biggest three-day gain since 1931. Those gains helped push the Dow back into bull market territory after ending its 11-year historic run this month.\n\nThe Standard & Poor’s 500 added 6.2% to finish at 2,630.07. It has gained 17.6% over the past three days, its best percentage gain since 1933.\n\nThe gains came even as data revealed a record number of Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week after a wave of layoffs from the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nArizona coronavirus cases top 500, with 8 known deaths\n\nMarch 26: Confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, topped 500 on Thursday, with eight known deaths, state numbers show.\n\nIdentified cases now total 508 across the state. Maricopa County has just shy of 300 cases.\n\nThe level of community spread, as listed on the state health department’s website, went from moderate to “widespread.” Community spread means the patient had no history of traveling to regions of the world affected by new coronavirus, and also had no known contact with anyone infected by it.\n\nHere's the difference between shelter-in-place and quarantine, and what police can enforce\n\nMarch 26: On March 19, California Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered all 40 million people in the state to shelter in place as health officials battle the new coronavirus. Two days later, Illinois Gov. J. B. Pritzker ordered his state's 12.7 million residents to also shelter in place.\n\nSince then, millions of people across at least 20 states have been given orders to shelter in place, restricting them from leaving their homes except to go to work if they can't work from home, get food or see a doctor.\n\nBut Arizona, with a population of seven million, isn't one of them.\n\nCongress on track to add $600 per week to jobless checks\n\nMarch 26:The U.S. Senate approved an additional $600 a week in jobless benefits for laid-off workers on Wednesday as the number of people applying for help nationwide hit an all-time weekly record of 3.28 million because of the economic carnage of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nArizona also set a new one-day record this week for the number of jobless claims filed.\n\nBenefits currently are capped at $240 a week in Arizona, the second-lowest amount in the nation. The change would increase the figure to $840 per week for people laid off because of the outbreak.\n\nJobless claims surge to 3.3M\n\nMarch 26: Layoffs are skyrocketing as the coronavirus upends the U.S. economy.\n\nThe number of Americans filing initial applications for unemployment benefits jumped nearly twelvefold to a record 3.28 million last week, the Labor Department said Thursday, offering the most vivid evidence yet of the outbreak's widespread damage to the economy.\n\nThe total was well above the 1.5 million claims economists had forecast, according to the median estimate of those surveyed by Bloomberg.\n\nIllnesses from coronavirus could peak in April with hospitalizations topping out in May, health officials say\n\nMarch 25: Arizona's governor and top health official on Wednesday shared mixed updates on the state's new coronavirus response, reporting a sizable increase in testing but warning of continued medical supply shortages as the virus spreads.\n\nIf infections continue at their current pace, illnesses would peak in April and hospitalizations would peak in May, state Health Director Dr. Cara Christ said at a Wednesday press briefing.\n\n\"Arizona is still in the opening stages of its COVID-19 outbreak, and the number of cases within the state will increase significantly,\" Christ said.\n\nArizona could be short 13,000 beds in treating coronavirus patients\n\nMarch 25: The new coronavirus pandemic could leave Arizona short 13,000 hospital beds for sick patients, a top health official said Wednesday.\n\nThe state's modeling has shown if there's a big wave of illness here — what state officials emphasize is a worst-case scenario — it would hit in mid- to late April, with a high rate of hospitalizations in May, Dr. Cara Christ, the Arizona Department of Health Services director, told reporters during a news briefing with Gov. Doug Ducey.\n\n\"We must continue to increase our bed capacity. With a potential surge of COVID-19 patients, we expect it to be above and beyond our current capacity of beds,\" she said.\n\nSenate passes historic $2 trillion stimulus package\n\nMarch 25: The Senate approved its largest emergency aid package in modern history that will offer $2 trillion to help Americans, hospitals and businesses weather the effects of the coronavirus. The vote late Wednesday night was 96-0.\n\nThe bill will now go to the House for approval before it’s sent to President Donald Trump for his signature.\n\nHouse Majority Leader, Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., announced that the House will vote on the $2 trillion bill Friday, and that they will convene at 9 a.m.\n\n\"We expect the bill to pass by voice vote,\" he said.\n\nAmong the provisions offered in the measure are one-time $1,200 checks to individuals, $367 billion in loans and grants to small businesses, over $130 billion for hospitals and community health centers and financial help to airlines and other industries hit hard by the virus.\n\nU.S. death toll surges past 1,000\n\nMarch 25: The U.S. death toll was at 1,031 late Wednesday afternoon after eclipsing 600 on Tuesday. Globally, more than 21,000 people have been killed by the virus, according to the Johns Hopkins University data dashboard.\n\nGov. Ducey to hold press conference at 2 p.m. Wednesday\n\nMost Americans to get $1,200 checks\n\nMarch 25: People earning less than $75,000 per year will get $1,200 checks under the stimulus agreement. Married couples earning less than $150,000 will get $2,400 and children will be worth another $500 each under the deal. The final language is still being crafted, but the package includes $367 billion for small businesses, $500 billion for loans to larger industries, $100 billion for hospitals and the health care system and $600 more per week in unemployment benefits for those out of work.\n\nSenate Minority leader Chuck Schumer said the goal is to ensure that every worker who is laid off or furloughed can pay their bills.\n\n\"And because so many of them will be furloughed rather than fired, if they have benefits, they can continue, and – extremely important – they can stay with the company or small business,\" he said.\n\nIdentified cases in Arizona now top 400, with 6 known deaths\n\nMarch 25: Coronavirus cases in Arizona continue to rise, with 401 identified cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, reported by the state Wednesday.\n\nMohave County reported its first identified case, which means the county will start restricting businesses. Maricopa County reported it now has two cases in people under age 18.\n\nIdentified cases have increased by 23% since Tuesday morning's numbers update from the state. The percentage increase was lower Wednesday than it was on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nOn Tuesday, there were at least 326 identified cases and five known deaths reported by the state in its morning numbers update. The state's database now reflects the sixth death, which was announced by Coconino County late Tuesday.\n\nThree known deaths have occurred in Maricopa County, according to county data, as well as one in Pima County and one in Coconino County. It is unclear in which county one of the deaths happened. Coconino County's first known death related to COVID-19 was announced on Tuesday.\n\nNew symptom of COVID-19?\n\nMarch 24: A loss of a sense of smell or taste may be a symptom of COVID-19, medical groups representing ear, nose and throat specialists have warned.\n\nCiting a growing number of cases around the globe, the American Academy of Otolaryngology – Head and Neck Surgery and ENT UK each issued warnings about patients who tested positive for the new coronavirus with the only symptom being a lost or altered sense of smell or taste.\n\n\"Anecdotal evidence is rapidly accumulating from sites around the world that anosmia and dysgeusia are significant symptoms associated with the COVID-19 pandemic,\" the American Academy of Otolaryngology – Head and Neck Surgery wrote in a statement.\n\nAnosmia is the loss of smell while dysgeusia is an altered sense of taste.\n\nTrump sets Easter as possible date to lift restrictions\n\nMarch 24: President Trump said Tuesday that he would like to have the government restrictions on travel and social gatherings eased by Easter, which comes on Sunday, April 12.\n\n“We’re going to be opening relatively soon,” Trump said during a Fox News town hall Tuesday. “I'd love to have it open by Easter ... It's such an important day for other reasons but I'll make an important date for this too.

Separately, a military strike tore through two apartment blocks in a town west of Kyiv.\n\nAs the rockets hit Kyiv on Tuesday, a 40-mile Russian convoy of tanks, armored vehicles and towed artillery was headed toward the Ukrainian capital, according to satellite images from Maxar Technologies.\n\nHowever, a US official said the convoy has been stalled due to fuel supply issues. The Russian advance on Kyiv remains \"basically... where it was yesterday\" according to a senior defense official, who also said there were signs that they were running out of food.\n\nWhile Ukraine mounts a defense against the Russian onslaught, some 677,000 people have fled the country in \"less than a week,\" with 150,000 fleeing in the last 24 hours alone, according to the United Nations.\n\nThe UN has also raised concerns for the millions of people still in the country, with UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths saying this is the \"darkest hour\" for the people of Ukraine.\n\n\"Families with small children are hunkered down in basements and subway stations or running for their lives to the terrifying sound of explosions and wailing sirens,\" he said in a statement.\n\nIn his State of the Union speech Tuesday, US President Joe Biden said President Vladimir Putin \"badly miscalculated\" when he invaded Ukraine and announced a ban on Russian aircraft from US airspace which he said would further isolate Russia and squeeze its economy.\n\nHe reiterated that US forces would not deploy to the Ukraine -- instead, they were deployed to Europe to defend America's NATO allies \"in the event that Putin decides to keep moving west.\"\n\nIn an exclusive interview with CNN and Reuters from a bunker ahead of the speech, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reiterated calls for the US and NATO to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine or put boots on the ground, saying \"I do believe that leaders do have to support democratic countries and they have to help them.\"\n\nAsked if he felt Ukraine was wasting its time by talking with Russia, he said: \"We'll see.\" On Monday, Ukrainian and Russian officials met for the first time since Moscow began their assault last week.\n\nBiden and Zelensky held a 30-minute phone conversation on Tuesday.

The UN says that at least 102 civilians have been killed across the country and 304 injured, though those figures are likely to underestimate the true toll.\n\nUS officials also warned that the sheer breadth of Russian firepower could overwhelm Ukrainian resistance.\n\nRussia's military is far bigger and more powerful than Ukraine's by just about every measure, but Ukraine's allies, including the European Union, are scrambling to send more weapons into the country to aid its defense.\n\nOn Tuesday, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko warned that \"the enemy is on the outskirts of the capital,\" but the Ukrainian military is \"preparing to defend Kyiv.\"\n\n\"Fortifications and checkpoints have been built at the entrances to the city.

The picturesque city has instead become ground zero for displaced Ukrainians. Hundreds of thousands of them have flooded into the city in search of relative safety, with many using it as a stopping point before making their way to the Polish border about 43 miles (70 kilometers) away.\n\nBut Russia's war is moving closer to the cultural hub. Russian forces fired more than 30 missiles at Yavoriv military training ground on Sunday, according to Lviv's military administration. Located between Lviv and the Polish border, the military base has held joint drills with NATO and Western military personnel, including the United States.\n\nA witness, who was on the base when the strike happened, told CNN of hearing a \"sudden clap\" from a bomb shelter, adding that the explosion craters were 10 meters deep and there are fears people are under the rubble.\n\nLocal authorities say 35 people were killed and 134 injured at the military base, in what Ukraine's Minister of Defence Oleksii Reznikov described as a \"terrorist attack\" on peace and security \"near the EU-NATO border.\"\n\nThere were no reports of foreign nationals among the casualties so far, say Ukraine defense officials. The strike came the day after Russia launched a missile attack in the northeastern city of Lutsk, only 70 miles from the Polish border.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Sunday that it was only a matter of time before Russia's military assault on Ukraine expanded to members of NATO -- unless the alliance installs a no-fly zone in Ukraine.\n\n\"Last year, I made a clear warning to NATO leaders that if there were no tough preventive sanctions against Russia, it would start a war,\" Zelensky said in a video address Sunday posted to his Facebook page. \"Now, I repeat again, if you do not close our sky, it is only a matter of time before Russian missiles fall on your territory. NATO territory. On the homes of citizens of NATO countries.\"\n\nUS national security adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN that the strikes on Lviv were a sign that the war was not going to plan. Russian President Vladimir Putin \"is frustrated by the fact that his forces are not making the kind of progress that he thought that they would make against major cities, including Kyiv, that he is expanding the number of targets, that he is lashing out, and that he is trying to cause damage in every part of the country,\" Sullivan said.\n\nAmbulances are seen traveling to and from the Yavoriv military base on March 13, 2022.\n\nA senior US official told CNN Sunday that Russia has asked China for military assistance in Ukraine, including drones.

The southern city of Kherson, which is occupied by Russian forces, saw the biggest protest since the invasion on Sunday. Hundreds of demonstrators flocked to the streets to protest against suspected Russian plans to turn the southern Ukrainian oblast into a breakaway republic.\n\nResidents of Kherson turned out en masse on Sunday, March 13, in the largest protest the city has seen since the invasion began and it came under Russian occupation.\n\nWaving Ukrainian flags, the protesters chanted anti-Russian slogans, filled with expletives about Putin, according to videographer Artem Ivanov, who is on the ground in Kherson.\n\nIhor Kolykhaiev, the mayor of Kherson, said in a video posted on Facebook Sunday that mass protests show \"Kherson is Ukraine\" and insisted that he retains administrative control of the city.\n\nBut the mayor also said that the city had been cut off from humanitarian aid and was running out of resources. He said that the city \"can't receive a humanitarian cargo here, food is finishing in the stores, we are running out of gas, we only have diesel oil left at the gas stations. We are running out of the medications and insulin.\"\n\n\"Our main weapon is unity,\" he added.\n\nIn recent days, at least one Kherson regional council official warned that occupation forces were laying the groundwork for the \"Kherson People's Republic.\" If true, the move would mirror Moscow's establishment of two Russian-backed breakaway states in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region.\n\nPutin recognized the independence of those two territories in the days leading up to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine as part of his pretext to launch an assault on the country.\n\nSchool demolished by Russian strike\n\nRussia's air offensive on Sunday also bore down on heavily populated areas around the country. Nine people were killed in a Russian bombardment in Mykolaiv Sunday, local officials said. The strategic southern city has resisted Russian occupation and impeded an apparent push towards the major port of Odessa to the west.\n\nA school in the village of Zelenogai, about 10 miles (16 kilometers) east of Mykolaiv, was demolished by a Russian military strike, Mykolaiv regional administrator Vitali Kim said.\n\nKim said that the military strike left several people either dead or in critical condition. \"Some people got under the rubble and we are evacuating them,\" Kim said.\n\nMissiles also destroyed an airport in the western Ukrainian city of Ivano-Frankivsk, while the northern city of Chernihiv was struck for the third night in a row, hitting a high-rise building, the regional head, Vyacheslav Chaus, said.\n\nIn the eastern region of Luhansk, much of which is now occupied by Russian forces, the head of the regional administration, Serhiy Haidai, said there had been \"massive shelling\" of several towns, including Kreminna and Rubizhne, which had prevented buses from leaving with civilians.\n\nThe Ukrainian military thwarted an attempt by Russian military vehicles to cross the Irpin River on a pontoon bridge near Hostomel, a new satellite image from Maxar Technologies shows.\n\nThe bridge first appeared in satellite imagery from Maxar on March 10, appearing to have been destroyed. An additional photo, published on social media on March 13, also shows the pontoon bridge destroyed, in addition to nearby Russian military vehicles.\n\nUkrainian forces in Kyiv's suburb of Irpin have so far repelled the Russian forces' attempted advance towards the Ukrainian capital city. With the main bridge crossing the Irpin River having been destroyed by the Ukrainians, the river poses a significant obstacle for the Russian military.\n\nAlso on Sunday, Ukraine's National Energy Company Ukrenergo completed repair work and resumed power supply to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, the company announced. The plant's electrical system was damaged during a Russian attack on March 9. Later on Sunday, the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a statement that the staff at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant are so tired they have stopped carrying out the repair and maintenance of safety-related equipment.\n\nAs the devastation mounts, Zelensky said the key task Sunday is to get the humanitarian convoy that is traveling towards the besieged city of Mariupol to its destination. Mariupol has been under siege for more than a week. Much of the city is without power and water.\n\nMariupol's city administration confirmed Sunday night that the convoy was still stuck some 50 miles to the west.\n\nAs the city waits, officials said it had suffered 22 bombing attacks in the last 24 hours and \"to date, 2,187 Mariupol residents have died from attacks by Russia.\"\n\nUkraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said that nine of the 14 evacuation routes declared Sunday had allowed civilians to escape fighting. About 3,950 people were rescued in the Kyiv region and 1,600 were able to escape from the Luhansk region in the east of the country, according to Vereshchuk.\n\n\"The city of Mariupol was subjected to shelling and aerial bombardment all day long,\" Vereshchuk said. \"The humanitarian cargo remained blocked in the city of Berdyansk halfway to the occupied city.\"\n\nNew round of talks\n\nUkrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podoliak said Sunday that the next round of Russian-Ukrainian talks will take place on Monday, via video link.\n\n\"Again. Negotiations go non-stop in the format of video conferences,\" Podoliak said on Twitter. \"Working groups are constantly functioning. A large number of issues require constant attention.\"\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian state news agency RIA earlier on Sunday that the talks would continue on Monday.\n\nPodoliak said earlier Sunday that he believed that talks in the next few days will \"achieve concrete results.\"\n\n\"Our proposals are on the table. They are very tough. Among them, the withdrawal of troops, the ceasefire,\" Podoliak said in a video posted on Twitter.\n\nThis comes after Leonid Slutsky, a Russian delegation member for talks with Ukraine, said \"significant progress\" has been made in negotiations with the Ukrainian delegation since the beginning of talks, Russian state news agency RIA reports.\n\nTalks between Ukraine's and Russia's top diplomats last week in Turkey, however, yielded no discernible progress.\n\nIn Russia, authorities continue to violently repress all dissent. Riot police arrested more than 658 people in 35 Russian cities on Sunday, as the number of those detained grows, according to an independent human rights group, OVD-Info.\n\nImages of brutal arrests have flooded social media showing people dragged off the streets by Russia's riot police. OVD-info also reported cases of house searches of human rights activists, police officers stopping people on the street to check through bags, as well as phone records.\n\nAccording to the monitoring group, more than 5,000 people have been arrested across Russia for participating in anti-war protests since last weekend and over 14,633 protesters have been detained in dozens of cities since the start of the invasion on February 24.", "authors": ["Tim Lister", "Mohammed Tawfeeq", "Olga Voitovych", "Simone Mccarthy", "Tara John"], "publish_date": "2022/03/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/08/24/ukraine-russia-invasion-live-updates/7882528001/", "title": "Russian attack kills 22 on Ukraine's Independence Day", "text": "Editor's note: This page recaps the news from Ukraine on Wednesday, Aug. 24.

Zelenskyy initially said about 50 people were wounded but his office later reduced the number to 22. Five passenger rail cars were hit.\n\nThe assault came four days after a car-bomb blast outside Moscow killed a hardline commentator who was the daughter of a Russian ultranationalist, prompting calls for revenge. Ukraine denied involvement in the bombing.\n\nBesides being the 31st anniversary of Ukraine's independence from the Soviet Union, Wednesday also marked six months since the war began. Kyiv officials had banned large public gatherings this week and told government employees to work from home in anticipation of a Russian missile strike amid the elevated tensions.\n\nIn addition, the U.S. issued a security alert citing “information that Russia is stepping up efforts to launch strikes against Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure and government facilities in the coming days.”\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Zelenskyy delivered a fiery speech pledging to drive the occupiers out of his battered country as he stood among burned-out Russian tanks in downtown Kyiv.\n\n\"Donbas is Ukraine.

A number of journalists are heard reacting to the strike.\n\nAs the scene begins clearing, someone is seen pulling the Ukrainian soldier away. Other soldiers run across the street and appear to be checking the condition of a number of individuals on the ground.\n\n\"Medic,\" someone is heard repeatedly screaming.\n\nPhotographs from the Associated Press showed bodies on the ground covered by sheets, with suitcases standing upright nearby. CNN has determined the civilians were killed in the Russian military strike seen in the video.\n\nThe Kyiv Regional Military Administration appealed to international organizations for help in resolving a growing humanitarian crisis.\n\n\"Thousands of people found themselves in isolation, because of direct hostilities, and in some places for 5-6 days they survive without electricity, water, food, medical help and means of subsistence. They are in direct danger,\" it said.\n\nThe Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said Sunday that more than 360 civilians had been killed in Ukraine since Russia's invasion began, while acknowledging that the real figure is likely \"considerably higher.\" CNN cannot independently verify the casualty numbers. The UN also reports more than 1.5 million refugees have fled Ukraine since February 24.\n\nEvacuation corridors closed\n\nIn the country's southeast, hopes that a second attempt to open up safe evacuation routes for civilians in Mariupol and Volnovakha might succeed -- after a first effort failed on Saturday -- were dashed within hours.\n\nThe governor of the Donetsk region, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said on Facebook on Sunday that the planned \"evacuation convoy with local residents was never able to leave Mariupol today: the Russians began to regroup their forces and heavy shelling of the city. It is extremely dangerous to evacuate people in such conditions.\"\n\nKyrylenko added that a convoy carrying humanitarian aid from the central city of Zaporizhzhia, three hours from Mariupol, \"has not yet reached its destination and is currently on its way.\"\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) also said Sunday's planned evacuation in Mariupol had failed.\n\n\"Today, our team began opening up the evacuation route from Mariupol before hostilities resumed. We remain in Mariupol and are ready to help facilitate further attempts -- if the parties reach an agreement, which is for them alone to implement and respect,\" the ICRC said on Twitter.\n\n\"People in Mariupol and in other places across #Ukraine are living in desperate situations. They must be protected at all times. They are not a target. People urgently need water, food, shelter. The basics of life. We need safety guarantees to be able to bring them aid.\"\n\nUkrainian lawmaker Inna Sovsun claimed Sunday that Russian forces had damaged a gas pipeline in southeastern Ukraine, leaving hundreds of thousands of people without heat in bitter temperatures.\n\n\"Donetsk-Mariupol gas pipeline was damaged by #Russian occupants. Now, more than 750,000 of people are left without any heat, while it's still often below 0°C (32 degrees Fahrenheit) outside,\" Sovsun said on Twitter.\n\nSeparately, television and radio broadcasts have been knocked out in Ukraine's second largest city, Kharkiv, after Russian military strikes, according to the Regional Administration.\n\nIn a post on Facebook Sunday, the Regional Administration said \"repeated shelling\" of the TV tower in Kharkiv had knocked out broadcasting capabilities.\n\nRussia has fired a total of 600 missiles since the invasion of Ukraine began, a senior US defense official told CNN on Sunday, and has committed approximately 95% of its amassed combat power inside Ukraine.\n\nEarlier Sunday, heavy shelling was reported to the west and northwest of Kyiv. The impact of explosions was heard by CNN teams in Kyiv and in rural areas to the southwest.\n\n\"They (Russian troops) captured Hostomel and Bucha yesterday (Saturday). The Russians entered there,\" said Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser in the Ukrainian President's Office, referring to two suburbs northwest of Kyiv. \"They have injured many children and do not allow to evacuate them, despite numerous appeals at the highest state level to provide a 'green corridor' from Bucha and Irpin. There are many children in the basements.\"\n\nArestovych described the situation as a \"catastrophe,\" adding that discussions were going on \"at the highest level with international humanitarian institutions, through mediators with the Russians\" in order to find a way out for those who are trapped.\n\nSeveral children have died, according to Ukraine's Ministry of Health.\n\nSeparately, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned Sunday that Russia was preparing to bomb the Black Sea port city of Odessa in southern Ukraine and said the airport in Vynnytsia, in the west of the country, had been destroyed by a rocket strike.\n\nIn an address broadcast on Facebook, Zelensky said: \"Russian people always used to come to Odessa and they only knew warmth and generosity and what's now? Artillery, bombs against Odessa. This will be a war crime. This will be (a) historic crime.\"\n\nIn a separate message, Zelensky again appealed for a no-fly zone to be imposed over Ukraine, following the destruction of Vynnytsia's airport.\n\n\"They continue to ruin our infrastructure our life, which we have built, and our parents, and grandparents, many generations of Ukrainians. We repeat every day -- close the skies over Ukraine,\" he added.\n\nUS and European officials have been discussing how the West would support a government in exile helmed by Zelensky should he have to flee Kyiv, Western officials told CNN.\n\nThe discussions have ranged from supporting Zelensky and top Ukrainian officials in a potential move to Lviv in western Ukraine, to the possibility that Zelensky and his aides are forced to flee Ukraine altogether and establish a new government in Poland, the officials said.\n\nWestern officials have been wary of discussing a government in exile directly with Zelensky because he wants to stay in Kyiv and has so far rejected conversations that focus on anything other than boosting Ukraine in its fight against Russia, two Western diplomats said.\n\nCalls for more support\n\nAs the Russian invasion continues, Zelensky has reiterated his pleas for US and NATO assistance in establishing a no-fly zone over Ukraine -- a move which could prevent Russian forces from carrying out airstrikes against the country.\n\nJUST WATCHED 'This war is for all the world': Zelensky says war is over democracy and freedom Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH 'This war is for all the world': Zelensky says war is over democracy and freedom 04:35\n\nBut there are fears such a move could be seen as an escalation, with Russian President Vladimir Putin warning on Saturday he would consider countries imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine as \"participants in a military conflict.\"\n\nZelensky has repeatedly asked NATO and Western officials to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine, but both say they oppose such a move.\n\nIn an impassioned call to US lawmakers Saturday, Zelensky also encouraged Eastern European nations to provide Ukraine with fighter jets, stressing they were needed to defend against Russian aggression.\n\nOn the call, Zelensky said if the West won't impose a no-fly zone they should give Ukraine planes.\n\nA White House spokesperson confirmed the United States is working with Poland on the possibility of Warsaw providing fighter jets to Ukraine. Some Biden administration officials privately fear that this move could be viewed by the Russians as an escalation, US officials say.\n\nMeanwhile, a multinational effort to send weapons to Ukraine is running at top speed at an undisclosed airfield in Eastern Europe, a defense official said. The US European Command is at the heart of the operation, and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley met last week with troops and personnel to examine the weapons shipments activity, the official said.\n\nSince the invasion, 14 countries have sent security assistance to Ukraine, a senior US defense official said Friday, some of which had rarely sent such substantial equipment before.\n\nPutin claimed Saturday that Russia had almost completed the destruction of Ukrainian air defense systems, and added that Western sanctions were the \"equivalent of a declaration of war.\"\n\nSpeaking to CNN's Jake Tapper on Sunday , Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that the US has seen \"very credible reports of deliberate attacks on civilians\" in Ukraine that would be considered a war crime.\n\nHe added that the US is working with its allies in Europe to look into the possibility of banning Russian oil imports in an effort to further punish the country for its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.", "authors": ["Tim Lister", "Josh Pennington", "Luke Mcgee", "Radina Gigova"], "publish_date": "2022/03/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/23/europe/ukraine-independence-day-kyiv-display-intl/index.html", "title": "Ukraine's Independence Day darkened by deadly missile strike - CNN", "text": "Kyiv, Ukraine (CNN) Ukraine's Independence Day, which on Wednesday marked the 31st anniversary of when the country voted to break with the Soviet Union , has been a more somber affair this year, with officials attending memorials. The day was darkened by a missile strike on an eastern Ukrainian train station which killed at least 22 people -- fulfilling warnings by Ukrainian officials.\n\nWhile previous years have been marked by celebrations and parades, Wednesday's commemoration comes exactly six months after Russia's invasion of the country began.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky marked the day with an emotional address that spoke of the Russian invasion as a new independence day -- the day Ukraine had to fight for its freedom, rather than simply voting for it at the ballot box.\n\n\"A new nation emerged on February 24 at 4 a.m. Not born, but reborn. A nation that didn't cry, didn't scream, didn't get scared. Didn't run away. Didn't give up. Didn't forget,\" Zelensky said Wednesday.\n\nHe added: \"Every new day is a new reason not to give up. Because, having gone through so much, we have no right not to reach the end. What is the end of the war for us? We used to say: Peace. Now we say: Victory.\"\n\nAcross the country, Ukrainians paid tribute to those who have been killed in military action since the invasion began. Foreign leaders, such as UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson , also visited Kyiv.\n\nIn the capital, Zelensky and first lady Olena Zelenska visited the Memory Wall of Fallen Defenders of Ukraine. In the Western city of Lviv, visibly emotional family members of fallen soldiers attended a ceremony at the memorial, the Field of Mars.\n\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and his wife Olena visit the Memory Wall of Fallen Defenders of Ukraine in Kyiv on August 24.\n\nBut Zelensky had also warned that Russia might step up efforts to launch attacks, including missile strikes, on \"infrastructure facilities or state institutions\" around the holiday. The US government joined the chorus of concern, telling Americans on Tuesday to leave the country immediately.\n\nOn Wednesday, those fears appeared to play out. Yuri Sak, an adviser to Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov, told CNN that Russia conducted \"missile strikes across Ukrainian territory.\"\n\n\"In other major cities of Ukraine, even those which are far away from the battlefield, there have been explosions, there have been missile strikes,\" Sak said, adding that Kyiv had at least eight air raid sirens on Wednesday.\n\nThe Chaplyne train station in the eastern Dnipropetrovsk Oblast was hit in a strike, killing at least 22 people and wounding 50 more, Zelensky said later on Wednesday. An 11-year-old was among those killed in the strike.\n\n\"Chaplyne is our pain today. As of this moment, there are 22 dead, five of them burned in the car. A teenager died, he was 11 years old, a Russian rocket destroyed his house,\" Zelensky added.\n\nAt least 50 people were injured in the strike at Chaplyne train stateion in eastern Ukraine. CNN could not independently verify this image.\n\n'Not that easily scared'\n\nIn lieu of a parade, wrecked and captured Russian military vehicles, including tanks, were placed on Khreshchatyk, Kyiv's main street, as a testament to Moscow's failed attempt to capture the capital in the early weeks of the war.\n\nOn the eve of Independence Day, crowds of people were seen in Khreshchatyk, inspecting the display. Some children crawled up the rusty metal carcass of a tank, while others posed for pictures by the mangled vehicles.\n\nLiubov, who asked for her last name to not be published, said she turned up to show the \"scrap metal parade\" to her 8-year-old son, Illia.\n\nAs Illia climbed on a Russian combat vehicle, Liubov described the parade as \"symbolic,\" saying \"a lot of people in Kyiv (have forgotten) about war, so I think this is a good reminder.\"\n\nLiubov says she won't leave Kyiv despite the risk of a Russian attack.\n\nHer husband, who is fighting on the front line, has implored her to leave the capital for their summer home 50 kilometers (31 miles) away, she said. But she has refused to go.\n\nEven if \"there are massive missile strikes on Kyiv (on Wednesday), we will not leave,\" she said, explaining she has an emergency bag at home, with enough clothes and overalls \"in case of radiation pollution ... in case of missiles. We are not that easily scared by them anymore.\"\n\n\"I don't feel festive about (Independence Day), I rather feel sad,\" she added. \"Because I understand what is going on and my husband and brother are on the front line.\"\n\nHolding a Ukrainian flag, another onlooker told CNN she also has relatives fighting against Russia.\n\n\"My father is on the front line, a lot of my relatives are on the front line ... so tomorrow is not a celebration per se, but honoring and feeling independence, because this time it will feel differently than for the previous 30 years,\" said Daria, 35, who declined to give her last name.\n\nFamily members of fallen soldiers attend a ceremony at the memorial, the Field of Mars.\n\nInternational solidarity\n\nUS President Joe Biden marked Ukraine's Independence Day Wednesday by reiterating the US' commitment to Ukraine with a new $2.98 billion investment in security assistance.\n\n\"This will allow Ukraine to acquire air defense systems, artillery systems and munitions, counter-unmanned aerial systems, and radars to ensure it can continue to defend itself over the long term,\" Biden said in a statement Wednesday.\n\n\"Today is not only a celebration of the past, but a resounding affirmation that Ukraine proudly remains -- and will remain -- a sovereign and independent nation,\" Biden said, adding that the US \"looks forward to continuing to celebrate Ukraine as a democratic, independent, sovereign and prosperous state for decades to come.\"\n\nIncluded in the security assistance package is VAMPIRE counter-unmanned aerial system -- or counter-drone system -- that uses \"small missiles essentially to shoot missiles out of the sky,\" Department of Defense Undersecretary for Policy Dr. Colin Kahl told reporters later on Wednesday.\n\nDignitaries and families attend a ceremony for the fallen soldiers of Ukraine on the Field of Mars on Wednesday in Lviv.\n\nWorld leaders joined Biden on Wednesday in pledging continuing support for Ukraine.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Johnson met with Zelensky during his visit. He announced a $66 million aid package for Ukraine, telling the country that it \"can and will win\" the war against Russia.\n\nPortugal's Foreign Minister João Gomes Cravinho was also among foreign leaders in Kyiv.\n\nIn Brussels, a giant Ukrainian flag was unrolled on Grand-Place during an event attended by President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen.\n\nIn a Twitter message on Wednesday, President of the European Council Charles Michel said: \"Your future is our common future. And it's why we want to support you as much as we can to protect and to defend your independence, your sovereignty and your territorial integrity. We are with you.\"\n\n'It's tearing me apart'\n\nOn Kyiv's Khreshchatyk on Tuesday, many who spoke to CNN shared worries about a possible Russian attack on Wednesday.\n\nAfter six months of conflict that have sent Ukraine's economy into a tailspin and disrupted almost every part of daily life, the weariness was tangible.\n\nDaria is also worried about an attack on Independence Day.\n\n\"I don't feel festive about tomorrow, not in a festive mood,\" said 29-year-old Oleksii, explaining that he is worried about missiles being fired on the capital.\n\n\"My hatred for Russians has grown so big that it's tearing me apart,\" said Anna, 68, who declined to give her surname for safety reasons.\n\nThe clinic that she works in has told her to work remotely for the next few days. \"I've worked (throughout) the war ... sometimes getting home under shelling,\" she said.\n\nShe described Russian President Vladimir Putin as unpredictable, like \"a monkey holding a grenade.\"\n\n\"He says one thing, does something different and nobody can guess what's actually on his mind,\" she said.", "authors": ["Tara John", "Yulia Kesaieva"], "publish_date": "2022/08/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/21/europe/ukraine-war-status-intl/index.html", "title": "Donbas: It's nearly three months since Russia invaded Ukraine ...", "text": "Photos: Russia invades Ukraine Graves of fallen soldiers in Lychakiv Cemetery, Lviv, as Ukrainians celebrate Independence Day, and mark the six month anniversary of the Russian invasion, on August 24.

Follow here for the latest updates on the attack in Kyiv on Saturday, Feb. 26.\n\n***\n\nRussian forces closed in on Kyiv in the early hours of Saturday, but dawn brought limited clarity about how far the invading troops had penetrated into the Ukrainian capital, where President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had vowed defiance through the night.\n\n\"We must survive this night,” Zelenskyy – who told Ukrainians earlier that Russia has marked him as “target No. 1” – said in a video message before morning arrived in Kyiv.\n\nAs Saturday began, Zelenskyy tweeted that he had started “a new day on the diplomatic frontline” with a conversation with French President Emmanuel Macron, with “weapons and equipment from our partners” on the way.\n\nBut the danger remained far from over to the former Soviet republic. Photos from Ukraine detailed destruction by Russian troops and bombs, with Ukrainian citizens huddled in underground bomb shelters or trying to flee their country to safety, carrying family members and what possessions they could. Authorities in Kyiv described fighting in the streets and urged residents to seek shelter.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden was slated to meet with his national security team on Saturday morning; the U.S. and other nations have imposed sanctions on Russia and on its president, Vladimir Putin, in the hopes that the economic price will force Russia from its current path.\n\nZelenskyy government:What happens if Kyiv falls? What would a government in exile look like?\n\nDawn breaks in Kyiv\n\nAs dawn broke in Kyiv, it was not immediately clear how far the soldiers had advanced. Skirmishes reported on the edge of the city suggested that small Russian units were probing Ukrainian defenses to clear a path for the main forces.\n\nBut the swift movement of the troops after less than three days of fighting further imperiled a country clinging to independence in the face of a broad Russian assault, which threatened to topple the democratic government and scramble the post-Cold War world order.\n\nThe street clashes followed fighting that pummeled bridges, schools and apartment buildings, and resulted in hundreds of casualties.\n\n-- The Associated Press\n\nDelta ends Russian partnership\n\nDelta has withdrawn its codeshare services operated in conjunction with Russian national airline, Aeroflot, effective immediately. Codeshare allows one airline to sell seats on flights operated by other airlines\n\n\"We have removed our code from Aeroflot-operated services beyond Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport and removed Aeroflot’s code from Delta-operated services from Los Angeles and New York-JFK,\" Delta said in a statement.\n\nDelta does not operate services to Ukraine or Russia.\n\n-- Craig Harris\n\nUS Dept of State warns Americans in Russia to stay away from protests\n\nThe U.S. Department of State early on Saturday warned Americans in Russia to “avoid demonstrations and any demonstration-related activities” because of the possibility of widespread arrests.\n\n“According to social media sources, there have been calls for demonstrations throughout Russia, including in major cities such as Moscow and St. Petersburg, in opposition to the unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces against Ukraine,” the State Department noted in an online alert.\n\n“The U.S. Embassy reminds U.S. citizens that the Department of State’s Travel Advisory level for Russia is at “Level 4: Do Not Travel” for reasons including harassment against U.S. citizens, harassment by Russian government security officials, and the arbitrary enforcement of local law,” the statement added.\n\n-- Luciana Lopez\n\nZelenskyy and Macron speak\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy tweeted early Saturday morning that he and French President Emmanuel Macron had spoken by phone.\n\n\"A new day on the diplomatic frontline began with a conversation with @EmmanuelMacron. Weapons and equipment from our partners are on the way to Ukraine. The anti-war coalition is working!\" Zelenskyy tweeted.\n\n-- Luciana Lopez\n\nBlinken, South Korea foreign minister speak\n\nSouth Korean Foreign Minister Chung Eui-yong spoke with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Saturday to discuss the two allies’ cooperation over the Russia-Ukraine crisis, including Seoul’s participation in a U.S.-led economic pressure campaign against Moscow.\n\nSeoul’s Foreign Ministry said Chung and Blinken reaffirmed the allies’ “strong condemnation” of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and they urged Russia to immediately cease its takeover attempt.\n\nBlinken thanked South Korea for its support of Ukraine and its willingness to participate in international sanctions against Russia, the ministry said.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nBetter trained, better equipped:What you should know about Russia and Ukraine's militaries\n\n'I need ammunition, not a ride'\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was asked to evacuate Kyiv at the behest of the U.S. government but turned down the offer.\n\nZelenskyy said in response: “The fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride,” according to a senior American intelligence official with direct knowledge of the conversation, who described Zelenskyy as upbeat.\n\nInvading Russian forces closed in on Ukraine’s capital on Saturday, in an apparent encircling movement after a barrage of airstrikes on cities and military bases around the country.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nMore:Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukraine's actor president, prepares for his greatest role yet\n\nSecond Russian transport plane shot down\n\nA second Russian Ilyushin Il-76 military transport plane was shot down near Bila Tserkva, 50 miles (85 kilometers) south of Kyiv, according to two American officials with direct knowledge of conditions on the ground in Ukraine.\n\nOn Friday, Ukraine’s military said it had shot down a Russian military transport plane with paratroopers on board.\n\nAccording to a statement from the military’s General Staff, the first Il-76 heavy transport plane was shot down near Vasylkiv, a city 25 miles south of Kyiv. The Russian military has not commented on either incident so far, and the reports could not be immediately verified.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nFighting in the streets of Kyiv\n\nKyiv officials are warning residents that street fighting is underway against Russian forces, and they are urging people to seek shelter.\n\nThe warning issued Saturday advised residents to remain in shelters, to avoid going near windows or on balconies, and to take precautions against being hit by debris or bullets.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nPresident refuses to flee, urges Ukraine to 'stand firm'\n\nRussian troops stormed toward Ukraine’s capital early Saturday as explosions reverberated through the city and the president urged the country to “stand firm” against the siege that could determine its future. He refused American help to evacuate, saying: “The fight is here.”\n\nHundreds of casualties were reported in the fighting, which included shelling that sliced through a Kyiv apartment building and pummeled bridges and schools. There also were growing signs that Russia may be seeking to overthrow Ukraine’s government, which U.S. officials have described as Russian President Vladimir Putin’s ultimate objective.\n\nThe assault represented Putin's boldest effort yet to redraw the world map and revive Moscow’s Cold War-era influence. It triggered new international efforts to end the invasion, including direct sanctions on Putin.\n\nAs his country confronted explosions and gunfire, and as the fate of Kyiv hung in the balance, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appealed for a cease-fire and warned in a bleak statement that multiple cities were under attack.\n\n“This night we have to stand firm,” he said. \"The fate of Ukraine is being decided right now.”\n\n'Hands off Ukraine!' Russian protesters, celebrities risk arrest to denounce Putin's war\n\nZelenskyy was urged to evacuate Kyiv at the behest of the U.S. government but turned down the offer, according to a senior American intelligence official with direct knowledge of the conversation. The official quoted the president as saying that “the fight is here\" and that he needed anti-tank ammunition but “not a ride.”\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nBattle for Ukrainian capital reportedly intensifying, with explosions seen and heard in Kyiv\n\nRussian forces have reportedly moved in closer to Kyiv early Saturday morning, and explosions were seen and heard in parts of the capital suggesting an escalation of fighting with Ukrainian defenders, according to CNN.\n\nThe cable network reported that operations by Ukrainian forces to repel the Russian advance were intensifying in the early morning hours of Saturday, Kyiv time, not long after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiyy warned that the battle could be over by morning.\n\n\"This night will be very difficult, and the enemy will use all available forces to break the resistance of Ukrainians,\" Zelenskyy said in a late-night video message Friday that was widely circulated on Twitter.\n\n\"This night we have to stand ground,” Zelenskyy said, surrounded by members of his national security team. “The fate of Ukraine is being decided right now.\"\n\nCNN teams in the capital reported hearing loud explosions to the west and south of the city. And Ukraine's State Service of Special Communications said clashes were underway in an eastern suburb as Russian forces appeared to be closing in on Kyiv from at least three sides.\n\nEarlier Saturday morning, the State Service of Special Communications reported: “Explosions in Kyiv. What is known? The enemy is trying to attack CHP-6 near Troieschyna. The Armed Forces give battle. Resistance continues in Vasylkiv, where enemy troops are trying to land.”\n\n-- Josh Meyer\n\n'It is at its worst tonight'\n\nKonstantin Novikov is a yoga teacher living outside of Kyiv who is one of several residents who shared what life has been like the past few days. shared his Friday.\n\n\"They just started shooting. It's scary, you don't know where it's going to go.\n\n10 min ago there was a lot (of shooting); many rockets . It's silent now, and we are waiting. We will go down with a neighbor to the entrance to the first floor and we will sit there. It seems safer.\"\n\n...\n\n\"I have my car downstairs full of gas. I put my documents, money and some stuff in a little bag. In any moment i can take my bags, my cats, and run away if it is too scary to stay. ... Maybe I will go to the center of Ukraine. Somewhere where it is more safe. Mostly people are going to western Ukraine like Lviv. But right now I can only go through Kyiv because it is blocked any other way. Either by Russian troops on one side, or (on another road) the bridge was blown up to keep Russian troops from going over the road to Kyiv. So, I have only one way out from my city.\"\n\nUnclear if Japan to join in Russia sanctions\n\nJapanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi says he spoke with his U.S. counterpart, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, on the phone Saturday and agreed they must respond to Russian invasion of Ukraine properly to prevent it from becoming “a wrong lesson” because of its potential influence in Asia and the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nHayashi declined to comment if Japan plans to join the United States, Britain and the European Union in imposing sanctions on Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. He said Japan will closely stay in touch with other Group of Seven members and the international society while watching the development.\n\nUkrainian soldier on Snake Island tells Russian officer 'go (expletive) yourself' before being killed\n\nHayashi told reporters that he and Blinken reassured their commitment to work closely with the rest of the international society. They agreed that it is necessary to respond to Russia properly and to absolutely reject the unilateral act to change the status quo and not leave “a wrong lesson.”\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nRussian troops march on\n\nThe Russian military said Friday it had encircled the cities of Sumy and Konotop in northeastern Ukraine, but was “taking steps to ensure civilians’ safety.”\n\nDefense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Russian forces have so far knocked out 211 Ukrainian military installations, including 17 command centers, 19 air defense missile systems, 39 radar units, 67 tanks and six warplanes. The Russian military also said it seized a strategic airport outside Kyiv, allowing it to quickly build up forces to take the capital.\n\nLate Friday, the Russian military said it has taken over Melitopol, a city near the Azov Sea. The claim could not immediately be independently verified.\n\nMeanwhile, a senior U.S. defense official said it’s estimated that Russia has now launched more than 200 missiles into Ukraine and some have hit residential areas, although it was unclear if they were deliberately targeted.\n\nBut U.S. defense officials believe the Russian offensive has encountered considerable resistance and is proceeding slower than Moscow had envisioned.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nMapping and tracking Russia's invasion of Ukraine\n\nUkraine’s military reported shooting down an II-76 Russian transport plane carrying paratroopers near Vasylkiv, a city 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of Kyiv, an account confirmed by a senior American intelligence official. It was unclear how many were on board. Transport planes can carry up to 125 paratroopers.\n\n\"We must survive this night”\n\nThe U.S. and its European allies moved to sanction Russian President Vladimir Putin Friday as Russia's military pushed further into Ukraine in an invasion that threatened to topple its democratic government.\n\nThe White House announced the new sanctions after President Joe Biden met with fellow NATO heads of state to discuss the mounting crisis.\n\nUkrainian officials reported at least 137 deaths on their side and claimed hundreds on the Russian one. Russian authorities released no casualty figures. Bridges and schools have been damaged in the shelling, which also sliced through a Kyiv apartment building.\n\nAs Russian troops neared the capital, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy vowed to stay and fight - and beckoned his fellow countrymen to do the same.\n\n“You can not give up the capital,\" he said in a video message. \"We must survive this night.”\n\nThe crisis has roiled the globe since Putin, in the pre-dawn hours of Moscow on Thursday, announced in a televised address that he was launching a military operation against Ukraine.\n\nInternational backlash followed swiftly, with sanctions by the United States and a host of other countries. Biden said the new economic measures would \"limit Russia's ability to do business in dollars, euros, pounds and yen to be part of the global economy.\"\n\nBut, so far, those sanctions appear to have had little effect on Russia's attempt to take over the one-time Soviet Republic that has expressed a desire to someday join NATO.\n\n• MOUNTING DEATH TOLL: Zelenskyy announced that 137 Ukrainian soldiers and civilians have been killed with hundreds more wounded.\n\n• WHERE IS THE FIGHTING?

Could it be the start of WWIII? Here's what we know\n\nA NEW COLD WAR?: How historians view Russia's invasion of Ukraine\n\nRussia vetoes UN Security Council resolution that it stop attacking Ukraine; China abstains\n\nAs expected, Russia vetoed a UN resolution on Friday evening demanding that Moscow stop its attack on Ukraine immediately and withdraw all troops. U.S. officials said they knew Moscow would oppose the measure but that they wanted to highlight Russia’s isolation within the international community.\n\nThe vote was 11 in favor, with Russia voting no. China, along with India and the United Arab Emirates, abstained.\n\nThe vote was delayed for two hours as the United States and Albania, co-sponsor of the resolution, worked behind the scenes to shore up support for the resolution among wavering nations, including Brazil.\n\n“A line has been crossed, and this council cannot remain silent,” said Brazil’s Ambassador Ronaldo Costa Filho. He said his government was “gravely concerned” about Russia’s military action.\n\nChina’s decision to abstain was seen as a diplomatic victory for pro-Ukrainian forces, given its history of using its veto power alongside ally Russia.\n\n-- Josh Meyer and Associated Press\n\nRussia-Ukraine explained:Inside the crisis as US calls Russian movements an invasion\n\nUkrainian President vows to stay and fight advancing Russian troops in Kyiv\n\nAs Russian troops advanced on Ukraine’s capital of Kyiv Friday evening, President Volodomyr Zelenskyy appealed for a cease-fire and warned in a video statement that multiple cities were under attack and intent on seizing the capitol.\n\n”The night will be harder than the day,” Zelenskyy said on the video, which was widely circulated on Twitter.\n\n“At night they will storm,” he said in the message to Ukrainians. “You can not give up the capital. We must survive this night.”\n\nBiden administration spokeswoman Jen Psaki confirmed Friday afternoon that U.S. officials believe Putin intends to try to take the capital and oust the government.\n\nThe explosions and gunfire in Kyiv fueled further fears of wider war in Europe and triggered new international efforts — including direct sanctions on President Vladimir Putin by the U.S., UK, European Union and Canada — to make Moscow stop.\n\n-- Josh Meyer\n\nU.S. to sanction Putin, other Russian officials\n\nThe United States is slapping sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin and some of his deputies in retaliation for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki said Friday the new sanctions will target Putin, Russian Foreign Minister Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and members of Russia’s national security team.\n\nThe announcement follows a decision by the European Union earlier Friday to freeze the assets of Putin and Lavrov, along with other sanctions.\n\nThe United States already has hit Russia with sanctions that will impact multiple sectors of the Russia economy. But Ukraine has argued that a tougher economic response is needed and has asked for additional defense assistance.\n\n--Michael Collins and Joey Garrison\n\nThe enigma of Vladimir Putin:What do we really know about Russia's leader?\n\nUkraine's ambassador to US: Very concerned about Chernobyl\n\nOksana Markarova, Ukraine’s ambassador to the U.S., voiced concern Friday that Russia took control of the Chernobyl power plant – site of the worst nuclear disaster in history – and took 92 staff members as hostages.\n\n“We are very concerned that the Chernobyl shelter is under threat of any type of random attack by the Russian federation,” Markarova told reporters in Washington.\n\nMore broadly, she said Ukraine armed forces destroyed 80 Russian tanks, 10 planes, seven helicopters and 516 armored vehicles. She blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin for casualties.\n\n“As a result of Mr. Putin’s decision to send Russians to kill Ukrainians, 2,800 of Russian soldiers will not be going back to Russia,” she said.\n\nMarkarova said she wasn’t able to say what it would take for Putin to abandon the attack, but that Ukraine sought territorial integrity not just of its eastern provinces, but also Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014.\n\n“We are ready for peace talks, but we are not ready for capitulation or surrender,” Markarova said.\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nWarner warns tech companies about Russian disinformation efforts\n\nSen. Mark Warner is urging U.S. tech companies on Friday not to let their platforms be misused by Russian influence operations in the Kremlin’s war on Ukraine.\n\nThe Virginia Democrat who chairs the Senate intelligence committee, sent letters Friday to Alphabet, Meta – formerly known as Google and Facebook – as well as Reddit, Telegram, TikTok, and Twitter alerting them to malicious “information warfare” activities by Russia and Russia-linked entities.\n\n“As this conflict continues, we can expect to see an escalation in Russia’s use of both overt and covert means to sow confusion about the conflict and promote disinformation narratives that weaken the global response to these illegal acts,” Warner wrote.\n\nIn his letter to YouTube parent company Alphabet, Warner said his staff observed YouTube ads on Thursday monetizing content regarding the conflict in Ukraine from RT, Sputnik and TASS, which he described as malign actors affiliated with the Russian government.\n\n“Unfortunately, your platforms continue to be key vectors for malign actors – including, notably, those affiliated with the Russian government – to not only spread disinformation, but to profit from it,” Warner said.\n\n- Josh Meyer\n\nHundreds of casualties reported amid bombing damage, destruction\n\nAs the fighting intensified in Ukraine Friday, government officials offered competing assessments of the death toll.\n\nUkrainian officials reported at least 137 deaths on their side and claimed hundreds on the Russian one. Russian authorities released no casualty figures.\n\nU.N. officials reported 25 civilian deaths, mostly from shelling and airstrikes, and said that 100,000 people were believed to have left their homes, estimating up to 4 million could flee if the fighting escalates.\n\nBridges and schools have been damaged in the shelling, which also sliced through a Kyiv apartment building. After 8 p.m. in Ukraine, a large boom was heard near Maidan Nezalezhnosti, the square in central Kyiv that was the heart of the protests which led to the 2014 ouster of a Kremlin-friendly president. The cause was not immediately known and smaller repeated blasts could be heard in the distance.\n\n–Associated Press\n\nTrevor Reed's parents fear Russian attack on Ukraine will thwart son's release from Moscow prison\n\nThe parents of a former Marine imprisoned in Moscow worry the global outrage over Russia’s attack on Ukraine could hurt their chances of getting their son released at a moment when he is suffering from serious health problems.\n\nTrevor Reed’s parents, Joey and Paula Reed, told the Dallas Morning News their son called his Moscow lawyers to tell them he was running a fever. He had prolonged exposure in December to another prisoner with tuberculosis and was coughing up blood, according to U.S. embassy spokesman Jason Rebholz. Trevor Reed had been diagnosed with COVID-19 last May.\n\nAs a Marine, Reed served as a presidential guard and provided security at Camp David during the Obama administration.\n\nBut Reed was arrested in Moscow in August 2019 after allegedly being involved in a drunken fight at a party. He’s serving a nine-year sentence on charges the U.S. ambassador called “absurd.” U.S. officials have said Reed and another former Marine, Paul Whelan, were imprisoned potentially to be used as bargaining chips for the release of Russian spies.\n\nPresident Joe Biden said Thursday diplomatic talks with Russia have been ruptured by Moscow's massive military attack on Ukraine.\n\nPaula Reed told the Dallas Morning News the remarks were “like the exclamation point” to know “it’s going to be that much more difficult to get Trevor home.”\n\n-Bart Jansen\n\nUkrainian minister offers pay hike for soldiers\n\nUkraine Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov announced Friday that the country’s armed forces would receive a 30% salary increase, along with monthly bonuses, while Ukraine is battling a Russian invasion that threatens its survival as a free democracy.\n\n“Together with the Cabinet of Ministers, the Ministry of Finance and the relevant parliamentary committee, we managed to find the expected financial resources and raise the salaries of Ukrainian defenders to the national average,” Reznikov said in a statement. “This is only the first step. We continue to work. Glory to Ukraine and its defenders!”\n\nThe pay hike will go into effect March 1.\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nZelenskyy says he and Biden discussed tougher sanctions\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he spoke with President Joe Biden on Friday about strengthening sanctions against Russia and other steps to retaliate for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\n“Strengthening sanctions, concrete defense assistance and an anti-war coalition have just been discussed with @POTUS,” Zelenskyy wrote on Twitter, thanking the U.S. for its strong support” of Ukraine.\n\nThe White House confirmed that Biden spoke with Zelenskky for 40 minutes but provided no other details.\n\nThe United States and Europe have already hit Russia with sanctions that will impact multiple sectors of the Russia economy. Ukraine has argued that a tougher economic response is needed and has asked for additional defense assistance.\n\nIn response, the European Union agreed Friday to freeze the assets of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov along with other sanctions.\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nZelenskyy posts video pledging continued defense\n\nUkraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy posted a short video just after midnight local time with other leaders of his country proclaiming their continued defense against the Russian invasion.\n\nHis defiance came as Russian troops pushed toward the capital Kyiv, and as questions swirled on social media about whether leaders had begun fleeing.\n\n“We are all here,” said Zelenskyy, who was surrounded by a handful of leaders. “Our military is here, citizens are here. We are all here defending our independence, our state and it will be so further. Glory to our defenders, glory to Ukraine!\"\n\nHe was joined by Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal and adviser Mykhailo Podoliak among other officials.\n\n\"Glory to heroes!\" the men said as the video ended.\n\n– Bart Jansen and Karina Zaiets\n\n'We are all here' Ukrainian President Zelenskyy shares message from Kyiv\n\nEU to freeze assets on Vladimir Putin, Sergey Lavrov - Latvian official\n\nThe European Union agreed to freeze the assets of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov along with other sanctions, according to Latvia's foreign minister.\n\nThe move is intended to ratchet up financial pressure on Putin to back off Ukraine and would add to other sanctions levied against Moscow from governments including the United States.\n\nLatvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics said in a tweet on Friday that the EU's foreign ministers “adopted the 2nd sanctions package” and added that “the asset freeze includes President of Russia and its Foreign Minister.”\n\nHe said the EU plans to prepare another package of sanctions.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nUS official: Russian forces advance but not as quickly as anticipated\n\nRussian forces continue to invade Ukraine along three routes, including from the north toward Kyiv, although a senior U.S. Defense Department official said Russian momentum toward Kyiv has slowed in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe U.S. official declined to say how many Russian troops were on the ground in Ukraine now, but estimated it was about one third of the combat force that Russia had massed before the attack. Russian President Vladimir Putin had deployed more than 150,000 troops on Ukraine’s border prior to the invasion.\n\nThe official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence findings, told reporters Friday the U.S. had information suggesting that Moscow had expected a faster advance on Ukraine's capital. The official declined to say how the Pentagon had made that assessment, but Russia has not yet captured any major population centers.\n\nRussia has failed to dominate Ukrainian air space, the official said. Ukraine continues to fly warplanes that are attacking Russian forces. Ukraine also retains missiles for air defense.\n\nIn southern Ukraine, the Russians have made an amphibious attack, landing thousands of troops, the official said.\n\nElsewhere in the south, a battle is being fought for the Kakhovka hyrdo-electric plant that provides energy to Crimea and southern Ukraine. Russia has launched cyberattacks there, the official said.\n\n-Tom Vanden Brook\n\nUkraine pressures Europe to ban Russia from SWIFT\n\nUkraine’s foreign minister ramped up the pressure on European leaders on Friday to kick Russia out of the SWIFT financial system in retaliation for its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe United States and Europe already have hit Russia with sanctions that will impact multiple sectors of the Russia economy. But some European leaders have been reluctant to boot Russia from SWIFT, a global messaging system connecting thousands of financial institutions around the world.\n\nUkraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba took to Twitter to urge those holdouts to reconsider, citing their past statements that a conflict like World War II should never be allowed to happen again.\n\n“To some European leaders who are still hesitant: each year at commemorative events you say ‘Never again,’” he wrote. “The time to prove it is now. Russia is waging a horrific war of aggression in Europe. Here is your ‘never again’ test: BAN RUSSIA FROM SWIFT and kick it out of everywhere.”\n\nKuleba said he spoke Friday with Secretary of State Antony Blinken about the need for the U.S. to use its influence to persuade hesitant European leaders to ban Russia from SWIFT.\n\n-Michael Collins\n\nZelenskyy says Ukraine is fighting Russia ‘alone’\n\nUkraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Friday Ukraine is fighting Russia “alone,” in an apparent criticism of the U.S. and other western allies, as he pushes for a stronger international response to Russia's invasion of his country.\n\n“This morning, we are defending our state alone, as we did yesterday,” he said in an address to Ukrainians. “The world’s most powerful forces are watching from afar. Did yesterday’s sanctions convince Russia?”\n\nBiden has vowed that he won’t send U.S. troops to Ukraine to fight Russia, though he has sent American forces to shore up NATO's eastern flank.\n\nBiden announced a second round of U.S. sanctions announced Thursday, but it did not include the harsh step of cutting Russia from the SWIFT financial system, which connects banks worldwide.\n\n--Joey Garrison\n\nKremlin open to talks if Ukraine stops fighting\n\nThe Kremlin said Friday it is ready to hold talks with Ukrainian officials, but only after Ukrainian forces stand down. The conditional offer came as Russian forces bore down on Ukraine's capital, Kyiv.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russian President Vladimir Putin is ready to send a delegation to Belarus to meet with Ukrainian officials. This came after Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he is willing to discuss a non-aligned status for the country, which would essentially mean dropping the country's bid to join NATO.\n\nHowever, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Ukraine must put down its arms before any talks happen, according to Russia's state controlled TASS News Agency.\n\nCharting Russia's invasion in maps\n\nRussian military forces invaded Ukraine at roughly 9:30 p.m. ET on Wednesday (4:30 a.m. on Thursday in Ukraine), using missiles, troops, tanks and aircraft.\n\nThe invasion has targeted major cities and military sites, with the attacks coming from all different directions, according to Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said. Russia has fired more than 100 missiles.\n\nSee where Russia's forces are moving\n\nEmergency spending for Ukraine likely to reach billions, US senator says\n\nCongress may need to approve at least $10 billion in emergency spending to support Ukraine and for other needs, Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., said Friday.\n\nCoons, a close ally of President Joe Biden who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters his estimate may be on the low side because it doesn’t include what may be a “robust” request from the Pentagon.\n\n“There is strong enthusiasm to provide ongoing resupply and training and whatever other covert and overt support is necessary and appropriate for the Ukrainian resistance,” he said.\n\nCoons, who also heads a subcommittee in charge of humanitarian aid, said he’s confident billions of dollars will be needed to support the likely millions of refugees expected to flee Ukraine for nearby countries.\n\n“It would be a wild guess on my part,” he said, “but I would be supportive of an emergency supplemental of at least $10 billion, perhaps more, to meet these vital national security and humanitarian needs.”\n\n--Maureen Groppe\n\nUkrainian official: Kyiv residents should make Molotov cocktails\n\nUkraine's Defense Ministry urged Kyiv's residents Friday to stay inside and prepare Molotov cocktails to defend their capital as Russian troops and tanks were on the verge of entering the central part of the city for the first since President Vladimir Putin launched his assault on Ukraine.\n\n\"Neutralize the enemy,\" Ukraine's Defense Ministry tweeted as Kyiv continued to be hit by apparent Russian airstrikes that have damaged apartment buildings and forced thousands into bomb shelters. Air raid sirens rang out through the night and into the early morning.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is continuing to plead with western leaders to unveil harsher sanctions on the Kremlin, saying “If you don’t help us now, if you fail to offer a powerful assistance to Ukraine, tomorrow the war will knock on your door.”\n\nUkraine claims that more than 1,000 Russian troops have already been killed, though British officials have put the Russian death toll at half that.\n\n-Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nWhat is SWIFT? How could banning Russia from it impact the country?\n\nPresident Biden on Thursday announced a raft of new sanctions against Russia after its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBut one move the president didn’t announce: kicking Russia out of the SWIFT financial system.\n\nBiden said removing Russia from the international SWIFT financial system is still on the table but that European allies had resisted that step. The SWIFT system shifts money between banks around the world. Removing Russia would block Moscow from most international financial transactions, including profits from oil and gas production that are the lifeblood of Russia’s economy.\n\nMore:What is SWIFT? How could banning Russia from the banking system impact the country?\n\nRussia bans British flights from airspace\n\nRussia’s civil aviation authority has banned U.K. flights to and over Russia in retaliation against the British government’s ban on Aeroflot flights.\n\nRosaviatsiya said that all flights by the U.K. carriers to Russia as well as transit flights are banned starting Friday.\n\nIt said the measure was taken in response to the “unfriendly decisions” by the British authorities who banned flights to the U.K. by the Russian flag carrier Aeroflot as part of sanctions over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\n- Associated Press\n\nPope Francis makes unprecedented visit to Russian embassy\n\nPope Francis went to the Russian embassy in Rome on Friday to personally express his concern about the war in Ukraine, in an extraordinary papal gesture that has no recent precedent.\n\nPopes usually receive ambassadors and heads of state in the Vatican. For Francis to travel a short distance to the Russian embassy outside the Vatican walls was a sign of his strength of concern about Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nVatican officials said they knew of no such previous papal initiative.\n\nVatican spokesman Matteo Bruni confirmed the pontiff wanted “clearly to express his concern about the war.” Pope Francis was there for just over a half-hour, Bruni said.\n\nFrancis has called for dialogue to end the conflict and has urged the faithful to set next Wednesday as a day of fasting and prayer for peace in Ukraine.\n\nBut he has refrained from publicly calling out Russia, presumably for fear of antagonizing the Russian Orthodox Church, with which he is trying to build stronger ties.\n\nRockets strike Kyiv in `horrific’ attack\n\nRussia has launched a “horrific” rocket strike on Kyiv, Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, tweeted Friday.\n\nThe capital hasn’t experienced an attack like that since 1941, when Nazi Germany invaded, he said.\n\n“Ukraine defeated that evil and will defeat this one,” Kuleba tweeted. “Stop Putin. Isolate Russia. Severe all ties. Kick Russia out\" of everywhere.\n\n-- Maureen Groppe\n\nRussian invasion advances on Kyiv; civilians spent night in bomb shelters\n\nRussian troops appeared to be advancing on Kyiv at the start of the second day of the Kremlin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAmid a fast-moving and difficult-to-verify situation, Ukraine's Defense Ministry tweeted early Friday that some Russian troops had broken through to several northern districts on the outskirts of the capital. However, Ukraine's military also said it was resisting the advance on multiple fronts.\n\nThe apparent development comes as thousands of civilians spent the night in bomb shelters, typically underground subway stations, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged his citizens to do all they can to resist Russia's assault. Zelenskyy has vowed to remain in Kyiv with his family and he appealed to Russia for a ceasefire.\n\nSome 137 Ukrainians, a mixture of soldiers and civilians, died in the fighting on Thursday, Zelenskyy said. Britain's Defense Secretary told his country's media Friday that Russia has lost about 450 military personnel.\n\nThe U.S., Europe and Japan have all unveiled sanctions on key Russian banks, airlines and associates of President Vladimir Putin. Later Friday, NATO leaders will convene an emergency meeting by video link to discuss the deteriorating security situation.\n\n- Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nEU plans more sanctions with 'massive consequences'\n\nBRUSSELS — A senior European Union official says the 27-nation bloc intends to slap further sanctions on Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nEU Council president Charles Michel tweeted Friday: “Second wave of sanctions with massive and severe consequences politically agreed last night. Further package under urgent preparation.”\n\nMichel announced the move after a call with Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nMichel said Kyiv “is under continued attack by Russian forces” and called on Russia to immediately stop the violence.\n\nRussia stripped of Champions League final as UEFA shifts match to Paris\n\nLONDON - Russia was stripped of hosting the Champions League final by UEFA on Friday with St. Petersburg replaced by Paris after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe men's final will still be held on May 28 but now at the 80,000-seat Stade de France after the decision by UEFA's executive committee.\n\n\"UEFA wishes to express its thanks and appreciation to French Republic President Emmanuel Macron for his personal support and commitment to have European club football’s most prestigious game moved to France at a time of unparalleled crisis,” European football's governing body said in a statement. \"Together with the French government, UEFA will fully support multi-stakeholder efforts to ensure the provision of rescue for football players and their families in Ukraine who face dire human suffering, destruction and displacement.\"\n\nUkraine president: Russia has marked him ‘target No. 1’\n\nZelenskyy said Thursday he remains in the Ukraine capital of Kyiv, and intends to stay there, even as Russia has made him its top quarry.\n\n“The enemy has marked me as target No. 1, my family as target No. 2,” Zelenskyy said in an address to Ukrainians. “They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state.”\n\nAsked about Zelenskyy’s safety, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the U.S. is in touch with him and are working to provide him support.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nContributing: Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/02/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/26/europe/ukraine-russia-invasion-sunday-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Ukraine-Russia delegations to meet for talks Monday", "text": "Kyiv, Ukraine (CNN) A Ukrainian delegation will meet with a Russian delegation on Monday for talks on the Ukraine-Belarus border following assurances from Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko.\n\nThe announcement came Sunday as Ukrainian forces engaged in fierce fighting with Russian troops in multiple cities across Ukraine.\n\nRussia is facing universal condemnation and increased sanctions from Western powers over Moscow's unprovoked assault on Ukraine, now in its fourth day.\n\nUkraine's Deputy Interior Minister Evgeny Yenin said the talks would take place Monday morning local time.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had earlier said he would be willing to hold talks with Russia but not in Belarus, pointing out that Russian military actions are being launched from that country.\n\nOn Sunday, Zelensky said in a brief televised statement that he doesn't expect much from the meeting.\n\n\"I will say frankly, as always: I do not really believe in the result of this meeting, but let them try. So that no citizen of Ukraine would have any doubt that I, as president, did not try to stop the war when there was even a small chance,\" Zelensky said.\n\nUkraine has said its air force shot down a cruise missile launched at Kyiv on Sunday from Belarus. Belarus is an ally of Russia and has played an important role in Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nZelensky's office said Lukashenko had called his Ukrainian counterpart on Sunday. \"The politicians have agreed that the Ukrainian delegation will meet with the Russian delegation without preconditions on the Ukrainian-Belarusian border, near the Pripyat River,\" Zelensky's office said.\n\n\"Aleksander Lukashenko has taken responsibility for ensuring that all planes, helicopters and missiles stationed on the Belarusian territory will remain on the ground during the Ukrainian delegation's travel, meeting and return.\"\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin ordered his country's deterrence forces -- which include nuclear arms -- onto their highest state of alert on Sunday.\n\n\"Top officials in leading NATO countries have allowed themselves to make aggressive comments about our country, therefore I hereby order the Minister of Defense and the chief of the General Staff to place the Russian Army Deterrence Force on combat alert,\" Putin said in a televised meeting with top Russian defense officials.\n\nPutin also said the Western sanctions placed on Russia were unlawful.\n\n\"The only reason his forces face a threat today is because they invaded a sovereign country, and one without nuclear weapons,\" said the official. \"This is yet another escalatory and totally unnecessary step.\"\n\nAs the fighting continues, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians have fled their homes and dozens of civilians have been killed, according to UN figures\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told a briefing that Putin's order to put Russian deterrent forces on alert was a \"direct threat to us\" and an effort to raise pressure on the Ukrainian delegation at Monday's scheduled talks.\n\nKuleba indicated that Ukrainian officials are willing to \"listen to what Russia has to say\" but will not give in to pressure. \"We will tell them what we think of this,\" he said. \"And what we are ready to discuss is how to stop the war and the occupation of our territories. Full stop.\"\n\nKuleba said that, according to Ukrainian intelligence, even people within Putin's inner circle do not agree with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, \"because they understand the detrimental, the damaging, the devastating consequences this conflict will have for Russia itself.\"\n\nFighting in Kharkiv, missiles in Kyiv\n\nEarlier Sunday, residents of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, awoke to find the city still firmly under Ukrainian control, despite two massive explosions some 30 kilometers, or about 18 miles, south of the city lighting up the sky overnight.\n\nAnd fighting broke out on the streets of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, after Russian forces entered the city, Oleh Synehubov, the head of the Kharkiv Regional State Administration, said Sunday. \"Do not leave your shelters!\" he posted on Facebook, warning civilians not to go out on the streets.\n\n\"Intensive exchanges of rocket artillery overnight have been followed by heavy fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces in Kharkiv,\" an assessment by the UK's Ministry of Defence said.\n\nUkrainian forces had managed to deter the Russians from entering the northeastern city -- home to about 1.4 million people -- for the past three days. The city, which sits less than 20 miles south of the Russian border, was approached by Russian forces shortly after the invasion began.\n\nBut despite being far better equipped, Russia has failed to take control of key cities, as ordinary Ukrainians and reservists join efforts to defend their homes and families.\n\nOthers are fleeing the conflict. The United Nations estimates as many as 368,000 Ukrainians are now refugees.\n\nThe UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said late Saturday that the United Nations \"reports at least 240 civilian casualties, including at least 64 people killed\" in the fighting in Ukraine. Damage to civilian infrastructure has deprived hundreds of thousands of people of access to electricity or water, the statement added.\n\nIn a video message Sunday, Zelensky accused Russian troops of targeting civilians, including children, and called for an international investigation into the conflict.\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense has previously said it is targeting only military infrastructure, saying in a statement: \"The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation do not strike cities and towns, they take all measures to save the lives of civilians.\"\n\nBut Zelensky rejected this, saying: \"They lied when they said they would not target civilian population. Since the first hours of the invasion, Russian troops have been hitting civilian infrastructure.\"\n\nUkraine is \"documenting their crimes,\" he said, adding: \"This is terror.\"\n\nRussian offensive failing, Ukrainian PM says\n\nUkrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Saturday that Russia's offensive was failing and it was now deliberately attacking civilian infrastructure, including kindergartens, residential blocks and \"buses with children\" -- actions he labeled as \"war crimes.\"\n\n\"The Russian government doesn't understand they are not fighting only with the government, in fact they are fighting against the entire Ukrainian people,\" he added.\n\nRussian troops are facing a determined and highly-motivated Ukrainian resistance, resulting in significantly slower progress than Kremlin military planners had first anticipated, according to an assessment issued by Britain's Ministry of Defence late Saturday. After encountering strong resistance in Chernihiv, Russian forces were now bypassing the area to prioritize \"the encirclement and isolation of Kyiv,\" another British assessment said Sunday.\n\nRussia is facing unexpected difficulties supplying its forces , and is experiencing heavier losses in personnel, armor and aircraft than expected, two senior United States officials with direct knowledge told CNN.\n\nThe US continues to see Russian forces facing \"stiff resistance\" and their momentum has slowed in the northern part of Ukraine, a senior US defense official told reporters Sunday, citing fuel shortages and logistical issues.\n\nThe official noted that the Russians are having a \"little bit more success\" in the south, and would learn from their logistical issues and find ways to overcome them.\n\nUkrainian Maj. Gen. Borys Kremenetsky told reporters Saturday that Ukraine had captured around 200 Russian soldiers, some of whom were just 19 years old. They were not trained at all and were badly equipped, he said. CNN has not been able to independently verify this.\n\nOn Sunday, Russian authorities acknowledged a number of deaths and injuries in Ukraine for the first time since the beginning of the invasion.\n\n\"Russian servicemen are displaying courage and heroism in fulfilling combat tasks in the special military operation,\" Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said. \"Unfortunately, there have been deaths and injuries among our comrades.\"\n\nWithout providing precise numbers, Konashenkov also noted that the losses suffered by Russian troops were \"considerably lower\" than those by Ukrainian forces.\n\nRussia has yet to establish air supremacy over Ukraine, one US official said, as the Ukrainian Air Force and air defense systems fight for control of the airspace. Without uncontested control of the skies, it becomes more difficult for an army on the move to see and strike targets from the air.\n\nSo far these challenges have prevented the quick overthrow of major Ukrainian cities, including the capital, which US officials were concerned could play out in a matter of days. The city of Kharkiv near Ukraine's border with Russia also has not fallen to invading forces -- despite officials worrying that could happen on the first night of an invasion.\n\nA NATO official agreed that Russian forces were having problems.\n\n\"They lack diesel, they are proceeding way too slow and morale is obviously an issue,\" said the official.\n\nAsked whether Russians are likely to intensify their efforts, the official said they have no choice. \"They are way behind schedule,\" the official said. \"This is getting out of hand for them, every additional day is very painful.\"\n\nBut the Russians on Sunday countered reports of its military stalling, claiming the cities of Kherson and Berdyansk \"were completely blocked\" by Russian forces, and the city of Henichesk and the Chornobayivka airfield near Kherson, also known as Chernobayevka, had both been brought under control.\n\nMaj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, the Russian Ministry of Defense spokesperson, said a Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile regiment surrendered in the Kharkiv region and 471 Ukrainian servicemen were captured.\n\nCNN could not immediately verify those claims.\n\nUkrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov said on Sunday that checkpoints would be set up across the country to detect Russian troops and make their movements more difficult.\n\nAccusations of war crimes\n\nConcerns are now growing that Russia may look to deploy indiscriminate battlefield weaponry in civilian areas in an attempt to decisively crush Ukrainian forces.\n\nA CNN team spotted a Russian thermobaric multiple rockets launcher south of Belgorod, Russia, near the Ukrainian border early Saturday afternoon.\n\nThermobaric weapons have been used in Chechnya, with horrifying consequences, according to Human Rights Watch, and their use has been condemned by number of non-governmental organizations.\n\nThere is no evidence that thermobaric weapons have been used in the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nJUST WATCHED Russia moves in heavy flamethrower weapon Replay More Videos ...

Yet the blue-and-yellow flag of Ukraine still hangs from its buildings. There was glib talk of the Ukrainian state being \"decapitated;\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky still proclaims defiance.\n\nIf, as Putin asserted, Ukraine was not a real country, it would surely have collapsed by now. But even with 150,000 Russian troops inside its borders, according to US assessments, they control at most about 10% of Ukraine.\n\nTraveling around Ukraine in the three weeks before the invasion, it seemed many people were in denial. \"We are certain there will be no war,\" was the refrain -- in Mariupol, Zaporizhzia and Kyiv. The Ukrainian government also played down the build-up of Russian forces, anxious not to panic its citizens and the markets.\n\nThen, on February 24, it was as if a switch had been flicked. Overnight, denial became defiance.\n\nNow the refrain is: \"I'm going to war. It's my land.\"\n\nSerious defenses and countless checkpoints have popped up around Kyiv. Ukrainian forces -- to the surprise of many observers -- have been nimble and effective against Russian armor that has struggled to make progress. Small, mobile units that know the territory have cut down Russian convoys. The anti-tank weapons acquired mainly from the US and UK have left smoking hulks on roads across the country. Turkish-made attack drones have been deployed to precise effect.\n\nIn the few areas occupied by Russian forces -- even those that are predominantly Russian-speaking -- crowds of hundreds have hurled abuse at bewildered Russian soldiers . They have built mountains of tires to defend their towns and painted over street signs.\n\nNot that the Ukrainians have the upper hand. They can't defeat a vastly superior Russian force, but the evidence so far suggests that -- fortified by weapons and other help flowing across the border from Poland -- they may yet deny Putin victory.\n\nThe longest fortnight\n\nA British Prime Minister once observed that a week is a long time in politics. The two weeks of this conflict seem like an eternity, in terms of how they have changed the world.\n\nFour Ukrainians I was sitting with in Kyiv looked on in horror during the early hours of February 24, as Putin's address announcing a \"special military operation\" was broadcast on Russian television -- imagining that the freedoms they had come to enjoy were about to be crushed.\n\nMinutes later, the sky lit up as ballistic missiles slammed into Boryspil airport outside Kyiv. Russian forces poured across the border, from Crimea, Belarus and western Russia.\n\nAnd then, not exactly nothing, but nothing overwhelming. The supposedly awe-inspiring 40-mile column of Russian troops driving in from Belarus sat still, going nowhere -- more trucks than tanks. Ukraine's venerable air defenses did a better-than-expected job in taking out cruise missiles and Russian fighter jets.\n\nAnd crucially, Russian efforts to seize bridgeheads to the north and south of Kyiv in the first days of the campaign failed.\n\nEven in the south of the country, where Russian units have met less resistance, they have yet to take the port of Mariupol -- half an hour's drive from the border.\n\nIn explaining the invasion, Putin argued that Ukraine would otherwise become a platform for the West to invade and destroy Russia. He may have miscalculated the likely response to his attempt to swallow a country that, in his dark rewriting of history, had no right to exist.\n\n\"In taking this extraordinary gamble, he seems to have failed to recall the events that set in motion the end of the Russian empire,\" write Liana Fix and Michael Kimmage in Foreign Affairs.\n\n\"The final Russian tsar, Nicholas II, lost a war against Japan in 1905. He later fell victim to the Bolshevik Revolution, losing not just his crown but his life. The lesson: autocratic rulers cannot lose wars and remain autocrats.\"\n\nPerhaps lulled by the anemic Western response to the annexation of Crimea in 2014, Putin underestimated the galvanizing effect of his \"war of choice.\"\n\nNATO itself has rarely seemed so focused, a far cry from the carping that characterized the alliance during Donald Trump's presidency. Truckloads of anti-tank weapons have trundled to Ukraine's border.\n\nBefore this invasion, as a raft of international sanctions against Russia was debated, even hawks could only dream of cutting off Russian institutions from the international banking system, hunting down the assets of Russian oligarchs, ending or reducing imports of Russian oil and gas and mothballing the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. All have now happened.\n\nUkrainians demonstrate in Kherson on March 5, to protest Russia's occupation.\n\nOne company after another, from McDonalds to Zara to Apple, has severed links with the country -- depriving Russians of the consumer goods they had come to love since the end of communism. The ruble is worth less than half what it was in mid-February.\n\nOutmaneuvered on the battlefield, the Kremlin has also taken a beating in the court of public opinion -- not that that has ever bothered Putin. Zelensky, comic actor turned President, has risen to the challenge with pithy defiance and direct demands for a no-fly zone.\n\nAs speculation swirled about how Zelensky might be evacuated from Ukraine, he said he needed ammunition -- not a ride. He recorded an almost cheeky video message from the Presidential Palace, saying he wouldn't hide.\n\nZelensky -- and Ukraine's resilience in the face of overwhelming odds -- has struck a chord across the world. Football stadiums across Europe have been decked in the Ukrainian colors, the Eiffel Tower has shone blue and yellow. The seemingly endless flow of video messages from Zelensky has brought crowds to the streets of Prague and Tbilisi and drawn standing ovations in the British and European parliaments.\n\nJUST WATCHED People around the world join rallies in support of Ukraine Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH People around the world join rallies in support of Ukraine 01:38\n\nBy contrast, Putin has seemed isolated, snapping at subordinates, recording wooden rambling speeches or surrounding himself with Aeroflot flight attendants.\n\nThe great question now is whether a furious Russian leader, despite asserting that the \"operation\" continues to schedule, doubles down with the vast arsenal at his disposal: ballistic and cruise missiles, devastating rocket systems and thermobaric bombs. Will he turn Kyiv into another Grozny, the Chechen capital razed to the ground during his first year in power?\n\nCIA Director William Burns assessed Tuesday that Putin is \"determined to dominate and control Ukraine,\" and predicted an \"ugly next few weeks\" with \"scant regard for civilian casualties,\" in the face of opposition from the Ukrainian people.\n\nThursday's talks in Turkey between the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers may give us the first clue as to whether there is an alternative to those ugly weeks.\n\nThe Kremlin has demanded that Ukraine recognize Russian sovereignty in Crimea, annexed in 2014, the independence of two puppet republics in eastern Ukraine and the country's neutrality.\n\nUkraine has said no, though Zelensky now seems to acknowledge that Ukraine's dream of joining NATO, enshrined in its constitution, may be even more distant than it was before. For its part, Moscow appears to have dropped its demand for what it has called the de-Nazification and de-militarization of Ukraine -- its absurd phraseology for regime change.\n\nIn the meantime, the daily suffering of Ukrainian civilians goes on. Some are killed in missile strikes that flatten apartment buildings, others caught by those less-then-precise artillery attacks. The number is already in the many hundreds, but there is no official toll.\n\nTwo million have fled the country altogether -- overwhelmingly women and children.

However, Ukrainian forces continue to defend the neighboring city of Lysychansk, which is coming under growing Russian artillery and rocket attacks.\n\nOn Sunday, the head of the neighboring Donetsk region's military administration, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said Russian forces were gathering for fresh assaults in the region, nearly half of which is under Ukrainian control.\n\n\"We are now witnessing the accumulation of manpower, heavy armored vehicles and artillery in the direction of Sloviansk,\" Kyrylenko said on Ukrainian television.\n\n\"The enemy is using its well-known tactics, trying to move closer to our line of defense in order to fire artillery at the cities. Enemy artillery is already reaching certain parts of Sloviansk. This is another confirmation that people should evacuate.\"\n\nThroughout the offensive in the east, Russian forces have used intense artillery and rocket bombardment ahead of trying to take ground. They are attacking areas of Donetsk from three directions.\n\nKyrylenko said there had been a missile strike and rocket attacks on Kurakhove, a town on the southern front line in Donetsk that has been a target of Russian attacks for more than two months.

But this guy's passionate.\"\n\n\"There's obviously a double standard,\" Williams said, adding that she actually finds tennis \"more exciting\" when players get emotional due to the rigid culture around the game. \"So, if (male tennis players) want to have these attitudes, I'm all for it. Just don't say I can't either.\"\n\nAmong other double standards, she shared that since having her daughter Olympia, 4, she's always asked how she maintains \"mom/work balance.\" \"My husband (Alexis Ohanian), he talks about this all the time.

The focus ends up being on how it looks instead of how it feels.\"\n\nThe South Africa tour in September and October 2019, which was largely a success, was heavily covered by the world media at the time but the nursery fire incident was not reported.\n\n\"And part of the humanizing and the breaking through of these labels and these archetypes and these boxes that we’re put into is having some understanding on the human moments behind the scenes that people might not have any awareness of and to give each other a break,\" Meghan said.\n\nBuckingham Palace:Duchess Meghan bullying investigation findings to remain private\n\nSerena Williams talks excitement for retirement\n\nWilliams added that as a \"perfectionist\" herself and a longtime tennis player, giving herself a break from tennis was something she \"struggled with.\" It wasn't until consulting several people, including Prince Harry who tried \"to knock some sense into me,\" that she made the decision to retire.\n\nDespite the hesitancy, she told Meghan: \"I'm really looking forward to it. I can't wait to wake up one day and literally never have to worry about performing on such a high level and competing.\"\n\n\"Tennis was chosen for me and I loved that choice and I couldn't have made a better choice, right? So I was really happy that that happened. But now, for the first time in my entire life, I'm choosing to do something,\" Williams reflected. \"I'm making a different choice. One, to stop doing what I love and two, hopefully, have more kids and to focus on other things.\"\n\nIn case you missed it:Sports icons Serena Williams, Simone Biles, Venus Williams among USA TODAY Women of the Century\n\nMeghan wrapped up the podcast by saying ambitious women tend to be targeted under the guise that they \"somehow deserve whatever gets thrown at you however disproportionate or unfair it may be.\"\n\n\"Sometimes ambition in women also seems to suggest that you aren't afraid of anything. But as you heard Serena say, of course, fears still exist. … And maybe that's the point.

But on Monday they voted overwhelmingly in favour of escalating the action with a full walkout set to begin on 5 September.\n\n‘Years and years of abject neglect’\n\n“Quite simply, this strike has been years in the coming,” said BBC home and legal correspondent Dominic Casciani.\n\nUltimately coming down to cuts to pay and legal aid – where barristers represent defendants who could not otherwise afford a lawyer – the CBA said: “It is a decision to which we have been driven after years and years of abject neglect of the criminal justice system and the cynical exploitation of our time, effort and goodwill by successive governments determined to deliver justice on the cheap,” Reuters reported.\n\nCBA vice-chair, Kirsty Brimelow QC, told BBC Breakfast the action was a last resort after barristers “have had to endure collapses in their income and underfunding” that have meant their income has decreased by nearly 30% since 2006.\n\nAccording to The Lawyer, while at the top end 2% of barristers take home over £1m per year, nearly 12% earn less than £30,000. This is particularly true of criminal barristers, who according to the CBA make an average annual income after expenses of just £12,200 in the first three years of practice, driving 22% of junior criminal barristers to leave the profession since 2016.\n\nThe Guardian said this means barristers are being paid “less than the minimum wage for court hearings when travel and hours spent preparing are factored in – and not at all when hearings are cancelled”.\n\nAlthough the government has accepted an independent review’s recommendation to inject an extra £135m a year into the criminal legal aid sector, the CBA argued the increase in fees under the deal will “not be sufficient to retain enough criminal barristers to keep the wheels of justice turning”.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/26/politics/biden-student-loan-debt-forgiveness-complications/index.html", "title": "Student debt: Biden is considering canceling some. Here's why it ...", "text": "Washington (CNN) President Joe Biden is considering canceling some federal student loan debt, suggesting a once pie-in-the-sky idea is closer than ever to becoming reality.\n\nBut while some Democrats argue that the President should immediately erase large amounts of student loan debt for 43 million Americans with the stroke of his pen, the implications of such a significant policy move are complicated.\n\nThere are upsides and downsides.\n\nOn the one hand, student debt cancellation could deliver financial relief to millions of Americans, helping them buy their first homes, start businesses or save for retirement -- all investments that may take a back seat to pay off student debt. Loan forgiveness could also help narrow the racial wealth gap, some experts say.\n\nBut broad student loan forgiveness would also shift the cost -- likely hundreds of billions of dollars -- to taxpayers, including those who chose not to go to college or already paid for their education. Loan cancellation could also add to inflation while doing nothing to address the root of the problem: college affordability.\n\n\"This is a pretty complex issue,\" Education Secretary Miguel Cardona told MSNBC's Symone Sanders earlier this month when she pressed him on why broad student debt cancellation hasn't happened yet.\n\nBorrowers currently hold $1.6 trillion in outstanding federal student loan debt, more than Americans owe in either credit card or auto loan debt. About 54% of borrowers with outstanding student loan debt owed less than $20,000 as of March 2021, according to the College Board . About 45% of the outstanding debt was held by the 10% of borrowers owing $80,000 or more.\n\nPrior to the pandemic, thousands of borrowers had their Social Security checks Compared with other kinds of debt, it's extremely difficult to discharge student loans in bankruptcy. Prior to the pandemic, thousands of borrowers had their Social Security checks garnished because their student loans were in default.\n\nafter August 31, and the White House has indicated that the President will decide whether to cancel some student debt by then -- just months before the midterm elections. Federal student loan payments and interest accrual have been frozen since March 2020 due to a pandemic-related pause that Biden has extended several times. Payments are set to resume after August 31, and the White House has indicated that the President will decide whether to cancel some student debt by then -- just months before the midterm elections.\n\nStudent loan debt cancellation won't lower the cost of college\n\nA one-time cancellation of federal student loan debt would do nothing to bring down the cost of college for future borrowers or those who already paid for their degrees.\n\n\"Forgiving debt does not affect college affordability at all,\" said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a conservative think tank, and former director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n\nIn fact, it might even drive up the cost of college, he said. If prospective students have reason to believe that a future president may cancel their debt, they may be more willing to borrow more money -- and colleges, in turn, may decide to charge more for tuition and fees.\n\n\"It creates this moral hazard and sets up an expectation that debt may be forgiven in the future,\" Holtz-Eakin said.\n\nBiden has acknowledged that college affordability is a problem and called for making community college free -- but that move would require an act of Congress. The proposal was cut from the Biden-supported Build Back Better bill, which passed the House but stalled in the Senate.\n\nAn economic boost? Or higher costs for all?\n\nA lot of borrowers say that having less student debt hanging over their heads could help ease the pain of rising inflation.\n\nIf Biden cancels some student loan debt, it's true that some borrowers will owe less money on a monthly basis and in turn, have more money in their pockets. But more consumer spending could add fuel to an already overheated economy.\n\n\"It's a situation where what's good for individuals is not necessarily good for society,\" said Beth Akers, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, where she focuses on the economics of higher education.\n\n\"In reality, it probably wouldn't move the needle drastically in either direction. But the downside for cancellation got a bit worse since we entered this inflationary period,\" Akers added.\n\nOne reason the economic impact may be modest is because borrowers generally pay back their student loans over time. They wouldn't receive a lump sum of money if some of their debt is canceled. They would instead be required to pay less money each month toward their student loan payments.\n\nCommittee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated that canceling all $1.6 trillion in federal student loan debt would increase the inflation rate by 0.1 to 0.5 percentage points over 12 months. But Biden has suggested he would cancel report from the nonpartisanCommittee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated that canceling all $1.6 trillion in federal student loan debt would increase the inflation rate by 0.1 to 0.5 percentage points over 12 months. But Biden has suggested he would cancel less than $50,000 per borrower.\n\nThe cost of canceling student loan debt would add to the deficit -- transferring the cost from borrowers to all taxpayers. The White House has suggested Biden is considering canceling $10,000 per borrower, but excluding those who earn more than $125,000 a year. Under those parameters, student loan debt cancellation would cost at least $230 billion, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget\n\nHelping poorer households as well as high-earners\n\nThere are certainly many low-income Americans who are struggling to pay off their student loan debt. But it's not easy to target loan forgiveness to those who need it the most and exclude borrowers with higher salaries.\n\nMany economists argue that canceling student loan debt would disproportionately benefit higher-wealth households, like those of doctors and lawyers, because those borrowers tend to have more student debt after attending graduate school.\n\nAn income threshold that cuts off borrowers who earn more than $125,000 a year could help make sure a bigger proportion of the relief goes to low-income borrowers.\n\nMatthew Chingos, vice president of education data and policy at the Urban Institute, has estimated the share of forgiven debt by income group if Biden canceled $10,000 of student loan debt for borrowers earning less than $125,000 a year.\n\nAbout 16% of the canceled dollars would go to the poorest households earning less than $25,000 a year.\n\nRoughly one-quarter of the relief dollars would go to those earning between $26,000 and $44,000, and another quarter to those earning between $71,000 and $122,000.\n\nOne-third of the relief would go to households with total incomes between $45,000 and $70,000 a year.\n\nStudent debt cancellation would help close the racial wealth gap, experts say, because Black students are more likely to take on student debt, borrow larger amounts and take longer paying them off than their White peers.\n\nstudent debt.\" \"Canceling student debt is one of the most powerful ways to address racial and economic equity issues. The student loan system mirrors many of the inequalities that plague American society and widens the racial wealth gap,\" wrote dozens of Democratic lawmakers in a March letter to Biden urging him to cancel \"a meaningful amount ofstudent debt.\"\n\nBut the impact on the racial wealth gap could be muted by the fact that there are also fewer Black college students than White college students. Chingos' model found that 62% of the canceled student loan dollars would go to White borrowers while 25% would go to Black borrowers if Biden canceled up to $10,000 for those earning less than $125,000 a year.\n\nPlus, most Americans don't have student loan debt at all. Roughly 80% of households below the $125,000 threshold don't have student loan debt and would not see a benefit if Biden takes new action, according to Chingos.\n\nSome loan forgiveness programs already exist, but they don't always work\n\nThere are already federal student loan repayment programs that exist to help borrowers who are struggling to make their payments or were victims of for-profit college fraud.\n\nMost federal student loan borrowers are eligible for loan repayment plans that tie their monthly payment amount to their income and family size, known as income-driven repayment plans. There are a variety of plans, but generally they cap payments at 10% of a borrower's discretionary income. After 20 or 25 years of payment, depending on the specific plan, the remaining student loan debt is forgiven.\n\nalways work the way they should. A recent Meanwhile about 7,700 loans in repayment may have already been eligible for forgiveness. But the programs are messy and don'talways work the way they should. A recent Government Accountability report found that few people have qualified for forgiveness under an income-driven repayment plan. The Department of Education had approved forgiveness for a total of 157 loans as of June 1, 2021.Meanwhile about 7,700 loans in repayment may have already been eligible for forgiveness.\n\nThe federal government also offers a student loan forgiveness plan for public sector workers who make 10 years of qualifying monthly payments. But the program, known as Public Service Loan Forgiveness, has also had problems that prevented people from qualifying.\n\nand the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program that are The Biden administration has made changes to both the income-driven repayment programand the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program that are bringing millions of borrowers closer to debt forgiveness.\n\nThere is also a government forgiveness program for borrowers who enrolled at schools that shut down while they were enrolled or fell short of delivering the education the institutions promised. The Biden administration has been chipping away at a backlog of forgiveness claims filed under this program, known as borrower defense to repayment.\n\nAltogether, as of June 1, the Department of Education has approved $25 billion in student loan debt forgiveness for 1.3 million borrowers under Biden.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.", "authors": ["Katie Lobosco"], "publish_date": "2022/05/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/08/25/rnc-live-melanie-trump-mike-pompeo-speak-second-night-republican-convention/3433672001/", "title": "Republicans sought to strike a hopeful tone on Day 2 of their ...", "text": "Refresh often for updates throughout Day 2 of the RNC.\n\nWASHINGTON – Republicans sought to strike a more hopeful tone during the second night of their national convention Tuesday, featuring members of President Donald Trump’s family – including first lady Melania Trump – and placing an emphasis on the less controversial aspects of the president’s first term.\n\n“It has been inspiring to see what the people of our great nation will do for one another, especially when we are at our most fragile,” the first lady said in an address from the Rose Garden where the president joined a live audience watching and -- in a rare occurrence during the pandemic -- applauding her remarks.\n\nThe first lady focused much of her speech on what she described as the American spirit to overcome crisis, from COVID-19 to natural disasters. She steered widely clear of both policy arguments and political attacks on Democrat Joe Biden.\n\n“The common thread in all of these challenging situations is the unwavering resolve to help one another,” Melania Trump said in address that also touched on mental health and addiction with a weight few others have given to those issues.\n\nThat softer approach was set before the first lady walked onto the podium in the historic garden that was recently renovated under her direction. Unlike the convention’s opening night, most speakers Tuesday focused their fire on Biden’s policies – particularly his desire to roll back Trump’s tax cuts on high earners -- rather than on dark premonitions of “socialism” or the “destruction” of suburbs.\n\n“Americans are going back to work,” said Larry Kudlow, one of Trump’s top economic advisers. “There’s a housing boom. There’s an auto boom, a manufacturing boom, a consumer spending boom.”\n\nSpeakers sought to tout the progress made confronting the economic crisis without offering proposals for dealing with the current dramatic increase in unemployment. Many featured speakers, including the first lady, discussed the coronavirus in broad terms, arguing that the president “would not rest” until a vaccine or therapy had approved to treat the illness.\n\nLara Brown, director of George Washington University’s Graduate School of Political Management, noted that some Republicans spoke as if COVID-19 was already in the past and the economy had already recovered.\n\n\"Both of those descriptions about the present moment and near future seem disconnected from the reality that most Americans are experiencing,\" Brown said.\n\nThe Republican convention started Tuesday with a recognition of the high-profile shooting in Wisconsin of Jacob Blake, a Black man shot in the back by police in an incident that has aired for days on cable news. The convention’s opening prayer, offered by a Las Vegas minister, called for “healing and comfort” for Jacob Blake.\n\nTrump himself made two remarkable appearances: Formally pardoning Jon Ponder, a Las Vegas man who helps ex-prisoners re-enter society, and leading a naturalization ceremony for five new U.S. citizens. Both highly unusual events were criticized by Democrats as a questionable use of presidential authority during a political event.\n\nLiz Mair, a Republican strategist and Trump critic, wondered if the president delayed the pardon so that it would coincide with the convention.\n\n\"The main thing I find troubling is that Trump knew Jon Ponder, knew his story, knew of his good works, and didn’t get around to pardoning him until today,\" she said.\n\nBut they also set a far different message than Trump’s usual rhetoric on immigration: Trump’s proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, a centerpiece of his 2016 campaign, was barely raised at all. Neither were his efforts to limit legal immigration through unilateral changes to asylum and visa programs.\n\n\"Congratulations,” Trump told the group in a video the White House released hours before it played during the convention telecast. “Great going.\"\n\nConvention speakers touted the tax cut law Trump signed in 2017, the recent agreement between the United Arab Emirates and Israel. The convention featured a video noting the number of women Trump had appointed to top jobs in the White House, including the current and previous two White House press secretaries.\n\nThe night was not entirely devoid of harsh criticism of Biden. Former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, in particular, used her remarks to attack the former vice president's son Hunter for his business dealings in Ukraine, revisiting an argument she raised during the president’s impeachment defense.\n\n“If they want to make this election a choice between who's been saving America and who's been swindling America, bring it on,” Bondi said.\n\nNor did the convention’s second night go off without a hitch: Organizers had to pull a speaker from the lineup after she promoted anti-Semitic, QAnon conspiracy theory on Twitter. Mary Ann Mendoza -- an advocate for stricter immigration policies whose son was killed in accident by a driver who was an undocumented immigrant – was dropped shortly before the event got underway.\n\nBut for the most part, the convention’s second night appeared to stick to a different script.\n\n“Donald is a husband that supports me in all that I do,” first lady Melania Trump said. “We will be honored to serve this incredible country for four more years.”\n\n-- John Fritze and David Jackson\n\nMelania Trump confident the nation will recover from COVID-19\n\nFirst Lady Melania Trump headlined the second night of the GOP convention with a keynote address from the newly renovated White House Rose Garden, opening her remarks by acknowledging the coronavirus pandemic and the devastation and anxiety it has caused across the country.\n\n“I want to acknowledge the fact that since March, our lives have changed drastically. The invisible enemy COVID-19 swept across our beautiful country and impacted all of us,” she said. “My deepest sympathy goes out to everyone who has lost a loved one and my prayers are with those who are ill or suffering.”\n\n“I know many people are anxious and some feel helpless. I want you to know. You are not alone,” she continued. “My husband's administration will not stop fighting until there is an effective treatment or vaccine available to everyone.”\n\nAre the trees gone?:Melania Trump did not remove cherry trees, historic roses from Rose Garden\n\nTrump’s homage to women’s suffrage and the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution as part of the campaign’s wider effort to appeal to the crucial female voting bloc. A recent ABC/Washington Post poll found that Joe Biden leads Trump 56% to 40% in support among women.\n\n\"I reflected on the impact of women's voices in our nation's story and how proud I will be to cast my vote again for Donald, this November,\" she said. \"We must make sure that women are heard. And that American Dream continues to thrive.\"\n\nThe first lady’s address is her biggest prime-time speech since the 2016 GOP convention, where she was accused of plagiarism after portions of her speech closely resembled parts of a 2008 speech by Michelle Obama.\n\nA Trump Organization employee later issued a statement taking responsibility for the similarities.\n\nTrump has mostly stayed out of the political spotlight as her husband has campaigned in recent months but used the address to highlight her favorite moments as the first lady.\n\nIt also gave her a chance to showcase the renovations she oversaw of the Rose Garden though not without controversy. Delivering her speech from the Rose Garden, part of the official White House, raised ethical questions about whether it blurred the line between the government and the president’s re-election campaign.\n\nShe also opened up about her experience of coming to the U.S. from Slovenia, even as her husband has sought to curb legal and illegal immigration.\n\nTrump said becoming a citizen was \"one of the proudest moments in my life, because with hard work and determination, I was able to achieve my own American dream.\"\n\n\"As an immigrant, and a very independent woman. I understand what a privilege is that we have,\" she said. \"There are no words to describe how honored humbled and fortunate I am to serve our nation as your first lady.\"\n\n— Courtney Subramanian\n\nKentucky attorney general: Biden ‘a backwards thinker’\n\nKentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron slammed Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden as “a backwards thinker” and suggested President Donald Trump could live up to the “mandate” of Abraham Lincoln.\n\nCameron, the state’s first Black attorney general, blasted Biden for saying during a radio interview earlier this year that African Americans who don’t vote for him “ain’t black” and warning in 2012 that Republicans would put Blacks “back in chains.”\n\n“Joe Biden is a backwards thinker in a world craving forward-looking leadership,” Cameron said. “There’s no wisdom in his record or plan, just a trail of discredited ideas and offensive statements.”\n\nCameron, a rising star in the Republican Party, has come under criticism from activists who want his office to speed up its investigation into the death of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman who was fatally shot by police in her Louisville apartment in March. Her death has sparked protests across the country.\n\nIn his remarks at the Republican National Convention, Cameron criticized anarchists who “mindlessly tear up American cities while attacking police officers and innocent bystanders.”\n\nRepublicans “recognize those who earnestly strive for peace, justice, and equality,” he said.\n\nCameron, who was raised just a few miles from Lincoln’s birthplace in Kentucky, said the nation’s 16th president – who is also the first Republican president – believed “the dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present … and we must rise to the occasion.”\n\n“I believe President Trump can meet Lincoln’s mandate, even as Joe Biden remains trapped by his party’s radicals and his own failed record,” he said\n\n— Michael Collins\n\nPompeo touts Trump’s 'bold' foreign policy in remarks from abroad\n\nSpeaking from Israel while traveling on official government business, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Trump has “led bold initiatives in nearly every corner of the world” to secure peace and “keep us safe and our freedoms intact.”\n\n“It may not have made him popular in every foreign capital, but it’s worked,” Pompeo said in defense of Trump’s “America First” foreign policy that has alienated traditional U.S. allies, even as Trump courted foreign adversaries. He recorded his remarks during a stop in Jerusalem, part of a four-country diplomatic mission in the region.\n\nThe State Department said Pompeo was speaking in his personal capacity, not as America’s chief diplomat. But Pompeo talked about policy decisions.\n\nThe successes he touted included holding China accountable “for covering up the China virus,” killing Islamic State leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, lowering the temperature with North Korea, exiting the “disastrous nuclear deal with Iran” and moving the U.S. Embassy to “this very city of God, Jerusalem, the rightful capital of the Jewish homeland.”\n\nIn 2017, Trump delivered on a campaign promise to break with decades of U.S. foreign policy and move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. That decision, among other pro-Israel policies, has helped bolster Trump’s support among evangelical voters, a pivotal constituency for the GOP.\n\nPompeo’s remarks broke diplomatic protocol and perhaps the State Department's own policy on engaging in partisan political activity.\n\nBefore he spoke, Rep. Joaquin Castro, a top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, opened a probe into Pompeo’s decision, saying he has \"a gross disregard\" for ethics rules and \"a blatant willingness to violate federal law for political gain.\"\n\n— Maureen Groppe and Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nEric and Tiffany Trump step into the spotlight to tout father's record\n\nEric Trump, Trump’s third eldest son, joined a list of relatives who spoke or are slated to speak at the Republican convention. He used his remarks to tick off a list of his father’s accomplishments and echoed his brother, Donald Trump Jr., in painting a Joe Biden presidency as “the empty, oppressive and radical views of the extreme left.”\n\n“He is a career politician who has never signed the front of a check and does not know the slightest thing about the American worker or the American business,” Trump said.\n\nLike his brother, Eric Trump falsely claimed that Biden wants to defund the police, a call by some on the left to shift public resources from law enforcement agencies to social programs and public safety alternatives. Biden has said he does not back defunding police and instead called for additional funding for local police forces.\n\nEric Trump rounded out his remarks by speaking directly to his father, saying he missed “working alongside you every day but I’m damn proud to be on the front lines of this fight.”\n\nTiffany Trump, the fourth of the president’s five children and perhaps the least visible, offered a stinging critique of the media, technology companies and even the nation’s education system for promoting what she described as “groupthink” that stands in opposition to the president.\n\n“People must recognize that our thoughts, opinions, and even the choice of who we vote for may and are being manipulated and invisibly coerced by the media and tech giants,” said Tiffany Trump, who graduated from Georgetown Law this year. “If you tune into the media, you get one biased opinion or another.”\n\nTrump’s family was heavily represented on the second night of the convention at a difficult time: The president’s brother died of an undisclosed illness Aug. 15. President Trump has also been forced to contend with a critical book written by his niece, Mary Trump, and recorded audio of sister, Maryanne Trump Barry, ripping him for “phoniness” and “lying.”\n\nThere was little indication of that strife on Tuesday, though.\n\nTiffany Trump implored Americans to see “beyond the façade – the masks – that so many other politicians employ” and she urged voters to “make your judgment based on results and not rhetoric.”\n\n— John Fritze and Courtney Subramanian\n\nPolice officer touts Trump efforts on opioids\n\nMarrying two key criminal justice messages often addressed by President Donald Trump, the Republican convention on Tuesday turned to an Albuquerque police officer who adopted the baby of a woman addicted to heroin.\n\nRyan Holets recalled an incident in 2017 in which he approached a pregnant woman preparing to inject heroin. The woman confessed she seeking a family who would adopt her baby.\n\n\"God showed me exactly what I had to do,\" Holets said. \"Without hesitation, I told her that my family would adopt her baby.\"\n\nThe story hit on several important themes for Trump: First, the president has frequently touted the importance of police in communities, even as some departments have come under criticism for high-profile deadly interactions with Black citizens.\n\nThe story also spoke to an issue Trump has frequently discussed: The growth of opioid addiction in the U.S. Trump has signed several executive orders on the issue, and the administration has worked to reduce the number of opioids prescribed by doctors.\n\n\"I hold a special place in my heart for those facing opioid addiction,\" Holets said. \"That’s why I’m enormously grateful to the president for his leadership in fighting this deadly enemy.\"\n\n— John Fritze\n\nNunez: Trump will oppose socialism\n\nFlorida Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nunez, the first Latina in that post in state history, urged voters to support President Donald Trump to put “America first” in economic policy and for religious freedom.\n\n“Let us join our president in his vow that America will never be a socialist country,” said Nunez, whose parents fled Fidel Castro’s Cuba. “He’s defended our religious freedom, stood with democratic allies like Colombia, and shown unwavering resolve while confronting tyrants in countries like Venezuela, Cuba, China and Nicaragua.”\n\nShe said Trump would support law enforcement. She said he would fight to provide the best quality education by preserving school choice.\n\n“Americans have a choice,” Nunez said. “We can go down a dark road of chaos and government control, or we can choose the path of freedom and opportunity that was paved by those who sacrificed everything to preserve the American Dream for future generations.”\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nIowa governor: Trump ‘had our back’ during floods, storms\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds credits President Donald Trump with helping her state recover from devastating floods and storms.\n\nWhen 100-year floods breached nearly all levees and devastated communities along the Missouri River in Iowa, Nebraska and Missouri last year, Trump approved their request for federal aid in record time – just two days, Reynolds said.\n\nAnd when a storm called a derecho, with hurricane-force winds of up to 140 miles per hour, wiped out millions of acres of crops just two weeks ago, Trump approved the state’s disaster aid request in less than 24 hours, she said.\n\nTrump “had our back,” said Reynolds, a Republican and Trump supporter.\n\n“The president cut through the bureaucracy to do what needed to be done, and to do it quickly,” she said.\n\nIowa is expected to be a key battleground state in November’s election. Trump carried the state in 2016 by nearly 9.5 percentage points. But polls show him in a tight race with Democratic challenger Joe Biden this year. Trump leads Biden by just 1.7 percentage points in the Real Clear Politics average of state polls.\n\n— Michael Collins\n\nRepublican lawyer references Trump impeachment - to attack Joe Biden\n\nSurprisingly, President Donald Trump's impeachment came up at the Republican convention on Tuesday.\n\nNot surprisingly, a Republican lawyer used it to attack Joe Biden.\n\nFormer Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, who helped Trump with his impeachment defense, used her speech to attack Joe Biden's son Hunter for his business dealings in Ukraine.\n\n\"Joe Biden says he'll build back better,\" Bondi said at one point. \"Yeah ... build the Biden's Back Better.\"\n\nBondi provided no evidence that Hunter Biden's business activity in Ukraine was illegal, or that Biden himself acted improperly.\n\nDemocrats quickly pointed out that Trump was impeached for pressuring Ukraine into investigating Biden, despite the lack of evidence, and for threatening to withhold military aid if it did not follow through.\n\nSteve Schmidt, a former Republican and now a Trump opponent, tweeted that Bondi is \"ethically challenged,\" and \"lying about the Biden Family and repeating the talking points of Russian Intelligence Services.\"\n\nBondi has a close relationship with Trump, first as a long-time confidant from her days as attorney general and later as one of the lawyers who defended the president during the Senate impeachment trial earlier this year.\n\nShe also faced heavy criticism in 2013 when a Trump foundation sent her campaign a $25,000 check around the time her office decided not to join a New York state probe of consumer complaints against Trump University. Bondi has repeatedly said the donation had nothing to do with a decision made by independent investigators in her office not to pursue the investigation.\n\n— David Jackson\n\nRNC speaker pulled from lineup after boosting QAnon-tied conspiracy\n\nThe QAnon conspiracy theory made its way to the Republican National Convention Tuesday.\n\nShortly before the second night of programming began, Mary Ann Mendoza was pulled from the RNC lineup after earlier in the day retweeting an anti-Semitic Twitter thread with ties to the QAnon conspiracy theory.\n\nMendoza tweeted “Do yourself a favor and read this thread,” linking to a lengthy thread from a QAnon conspiracy theorist that claimed the Rothschilds, a famous Jewish family from Germany, created a plan to terrorize “goyim” — non-Jewish people — by having \"the goyim destroy each other\" and “rob the goyim of their landed properties.”\n\n— Savannah Behrmann\n\nKudlow: Trump’s actions spurred coronavirus recovery\n\nLarry Kudlow, the White House’s top economic adviser, says the U.S. economy is recovering from the coronavirus pandemic thanks to “a great bipartisan rescue” led by President Donald Trump.\n\nA tax hike would disrupt the recovery, he warned.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 178,000 Americans, has had a catastrophic impact on the U.S. economy since March. A mind-boggling 57.3 million workers have filed for unemployment over the past 22 weeks. Just two weeks ago, some 1.1 million Americans filed first-time applications for unemployment, the Labor Department said, signaling that the recovery will remain volatile.\n\nBut Kudlow struck an upbeat tone in his remarks to the Republican National Convention.\n\n“Americans are going back to work,” Kudlow said. “There’s a housing boom. There’s an auto boom, a manufacturing boom, a consumer spending boom.”\n\nLooking ahead, the Trump administration is planning more tax cuts and regulatory relief for small businesses, Kudlow said.\n\n“Our economic choice is very clear,” Kudlow said. “Do you want economic health prosperity opportunity and optimism, or do you want to turn back to the dark days of stagnation recession and pessimism? There can’t be better economic policies than we’ve had in recent years.”\n\n— Michael Collins\n\nTaxes become theme of RNC\n\nRepublicans are working hard during the second night of the Republican convention to drive home a message about Democrat Joe Biden, arguing his administration would quickly increase taxes – as soon as Day 1.\n\n\"You're coming out of a pandemic, and he wants to raise taxes?\" asked Larry Kudlow, one of President Donald Trump’s top economic advisers. \"That's crazy.\"\n\nIt was a theme that was repeatedly raised throughout the evening.\n\nJohn Peterson, owner a metal company, said Biden is \"ready to raise taxes, crush us with regulations.\" Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said that Trump is the candidate to support for voters \"who want lower taxes.\"\n\nBiden has vowed to repeal the Trump tax cuts approved early in his presidency, but for top earners -- those earning over more than $400,000 – as well as corporations. If elected, Biden would need buy in from Congress to roll back the tax cuts, a move unlikely to take place on his first day.\n\n—John Fritze\n\nControversial former Planned Parenthood employee appeals to anti-abortion voters\n\nAbby Johnson, an anti-abortion advocate known for turning against Planned Parenthood after working as the director of a clinic, touted President Donald Trump’s anti-abortion agenda.\n\n“For me, abortion is real. I know what it sounds like; I know what abortion smells like. Did you know abortion even had a smell? I’ve been the perpetrator to these babies, to these women,” Johnson said on Tuesday.\n\nJohnson, author of the memoir “Unplanned” that was also adapted into a film, told the story of witnessing an abortion that changed her views on the issue while wearing a “1972” pin to symbolize the year before Roe v. Wade made abortion legal.\n\n“I left the clinic, looking back only to remember why I now advocate so passionately for life,” she said.\n\nShe praised Trump for appointing conservative Supreme Court justices who would be sympathetic to pro-life ideals and for withdrawing federal funds from clinics that conduct abortion referrals.\n\n“Life is a core tenet of who we are as Americans,” Johnson said. “And this election is a choice between two radical, anti-life activists, and the most pro-life president we’ve ever had. That’s something that should compel you to action.”\n\nJohnson has come under fire for a number of controversial opinions. Vice reported Tuesday that she said in a video she thinks it is “smart” for police to be “on more high alert” when interacting with her biracial son than with her white sons because “statistically, my brown son is more likely to commit a violent offense over my white sons.”\n\nRecent tweets by Johnson also show she supports head-of-household voting rights, which would only allow one representative from a household to cast their vote rather than each adult citizen. “In a Godly household, the husband would get the final say,” she said.\n\nIn a tweet ahead of her RNC appearance on Tuesday, Johnson accused abortion rights activists of being scared of her speech and “scrambling to try to find anything to detract people from my message.”\n\n—Jeanine Santucci\n\nChallenging the media\n\nNicholas Sandmann, the student at the center of a media storm, urged voters Tuesday to support President Donald Trump because he refuses to allow news coverage “to create a narrative instead of reporting the facts.”\n\n“I believe we must join a president who will challenge the media to return to objective journalism,” Sandmann, 18, said before putting on a red “Make America Great Again” hat. “This is worth fighting for. This is worth voting for. This is what President Donald Trump stands for.”\n\nThe news coverage that focused on Sandmann unfolded in January 2019, when the northern Kentucky teenager stared at Native American elder Nathan Phillips, who played a drum. A viral video of the moment played repeatedly on cable news and was reported in newspapers.\n\nSandmann, then a student at Covington Catholic High School, was attending a March for Life. Phillips was attending an Indigenous Peoples March. Sandmann said unfair coverage of the event changed his life forever in one moment without reporters asking for his side of the story or investigating Phillips’ motives.\n\n“What I thought was a strange encounter, quickly developed into a major news story complete with video footage,” Sandmann said of his portrayal as a smirking boy in a red hat because of Trump’s opposition to abortion. “My life changed forever in that one moment. The full war machine of the mainstream media revved up into attack mode.”\n\nSandmann sued CNN for $275 million by claiming the network defamed him, and the Washington Post. He reached undisclosed settlements in January.\n\nIn March, Sandmann sued five more outlets, including Gannett, the parent company of USA TODAY.\n\n“I learned that what was happening to me had a name. It was called being cancelled. As in annulled. As in revoked. As in made void,” Sandmann said. “Many are being fired, humiliated or even threatened. Often, the media is a willing participant. But I would not be cancelled.”\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nBilly Graham’s granddaughter praises Trump as a 'fierce advocate' for religious groups\n\nCissie Graham Lynch, the daughter of evangelist Franklin Graham and granddaughter of legendary preacher Billy Graham, hailed President Donald Trump as a “fierce advocate in the White House” for people of faith who stands up for religious freedoms that were “under attack” during the Obama administration.\n\n“Our founders did not envision a quiet, hidden faith. They fought to ensure that voices of faith were always welcomed, not silenced. Not bullied,” she said. “But during the Obama-Biden administration, these freedoms were under attack.”\n\nThe president is trying to shore up support among conservative Christians and white evangelicals who helped him secure his 2016 victory, but his approval rating among religious groups has slipped in recent months. A Pew Research Center survey last month found that 59% of white evangelicals say they “very strongly” approve of Trump, down eight points from April. But the survey also found that 82% would still vote for him if the election were held in July.\n\nGraham Lynch, whose father is scheduled to speak on Thursday, said Trump-appointed judges who “respect the First Amendment,” supported religious beliefs in court and “ensured religious ministries would not be forced to violate their beliefs.”\n\nShe added there was “no room for people of faith” in the Biden administration, though the former vice president has frequently talked about how his Catholic faith has helped him survive the death of his first wife and their daughter in a 1972 car crash, as well as the death of his son in 2015.\n\n“Whether you’re a baker, a florist or a football coach, they will force the choice between being obedient to God or to Caesar,” she said. “Because the radical left’s god is government power.”\n\nGraham Lynch’s comments came hours after Jerushah Duford, another granddaughter of Billy Graham, penned a searing rebuke of Trump and her uncle Franklin Graham for his support of the president. Duford, who wrote in USA TODAY that her faith and church have become “a laughing stock,” called on evangelical Christian women to speak out against Trump’s actions.\n\n— Courtney Subramanian\n\nRNC turns to a more hopeful message\n\nBreaking with the dire messaging of \"socialism\" and \"Loch Ness\" monsters that dominated the first night of the RNC, Republicans embraced a softer tone Tuesday -- at least in the early minutes -- ahead of first lady Melania Trump's address.\n\n\"He has followed through on his promises,\" asserted Maine lobsterman Jason Joyce.\n\n\"More than any president in my lifetime, he's acknowledged the importance of farmers and agriculture,\" said dairy farmer Chris Peterson.\n\nIn the most notable example of the shift, Trump appeared himself briefly in a taped appearance from the White House and signed a pardon to Jon Ponder, founder of Hope For Prisoners, a Las Vegas-based organization that helps ex-prisoners re-enter society.\n\nThe event drew scrutiny from Democrats, some of whom questioned the president's use of an official act at a political convention, but it nevertheless underscored more of a focus on the president's accomplishments rather than on what Republicans see as Biden's failures.\n\n\"Today, I’m filled with hope,\" Ponder said. \"I have been given a second chance.\"\n\n— John Fritze\n\nFishing for votes\n\nJason Joyce, an eighth-generation lobsterman from Swan’s Island, Maine, said he didn't support President Donald Trump in 2016 because he expected the president \"to flip flop on his campaign promises.\"\n\nBut Joyce strongly supports Trump’s reelection this year because the president listened to fishermen’s views and adopted them. In contrast, Joyce characterized the Obama administration and former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee, as ignoring industry views.\n\n“As long as Trump is president, fishing families like mine will have a voice,” Joyce said. “But if Biden wins, he’ll be controlled by the environmental extremists who want to circumvent longstanding rules and impose radical changes that hurt our coastal communities.”\n\nTrump has promoted Maine lobster since a June 5 roundtable in Bangor. He reversed the Obama administration order that closed off 5,000 square miles of ocean to fishing for what is called the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument.\n\n“This action was deeply unfair to Maine lobstermen,” Trump said.\n\nThe monument is about 130 miles southeast of Cape Cod – too far for Mainers to reach. And Obama grandfathered lobster and crab harvesting for seven years in the 2016 order, so those fisheries haven't been affected yet. But the decision still rankled fishermen.\n\n“Although Maine's lobstermen don't fish there, Obama's executive order offended us greatly. It circumvented the fisheries counsels’ input,” Joyce said. “President Trump reversed that decision, reinstating the rules that allow stakeholder input, and he supports a process that seeks and respects fishermen's views.”\n\nLobster is a valuable seafood market, with 133 million pounds landed in 2017 worth nearly $600 million, according to the National Marine Fisheries Service. Mainers landed more than 80% of the U.S. lobster catch that year.\n\nBut trade wars have damaged the industry. The European Union agreed Friday to lift tariffs of 8% on U.S. lobster and 20% on lobster products, which had hurt trade compared to Canadian lobster that faced no tariffs.\n\nChina also imposed a tariff on U.S. lobster in 2018 that now stands at least at 35%. Trump asked the Agriculture Department for monthly reports on the China tariff starting Aug. 15.\n\nJoyce said he strongly supported Trump's reelection.\n\n\"When he sees something isn't right, he’s fearless in fixing it,\" Joyce said. \"He listens to working people.\"\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nRand Paul: 'If you hate war ... support President Trump'\n\nSen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican known for his anti-interventionist view of global affairs, praised Trump’s approach to “end war rather than start one,\" trying to portray a stark contrast between the president and Joe Biden when it comes to making the planet safer.\n\n\"I fear Biden will choose war again. He supported the war in Serbia, Syria, Libya. Joe Biden will continue to spill our blood and treasure. President Trump will bring our heroes home,\" said Paul, who has often joined the president in calling for the wind-down of U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\n\"If you hate war like I hate war…if you want us to quit sending $50 billion every year to Afghanistan to build their roads and bridges instead of building them here at home, you need to support President Trump for another term.\"\n\nTrump has touted his unconventional strategy on foreign policy, including efforts to build bridges with authoritarian figures such as Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korea despot Kim Jong-Un.\n\nHe’s also drawn bipartisan fire for trying to undermine the NATO alliance and for pulling troops out of Syria, a move that prompted the resignation of Defense Secretary James Mattis.\n\nPaul, who did not appear at the RNC in 2016, had some unkind words for Trump four years ago when both were running for the White House. He called the billionaire businessman \"a delusional narcissist and an orange-faced windbag.\" Trump in turn criticized Paul's looks and called him \"a spoiled brat without a properly functioning brain.\"\n\n— Ledyard King\n\nPrayers for Jacob Blake during RNC\n\nNorma Urrabazo from the International Church of Las Vegas opened Tuesday’s events with a prayer for “healing and comfort” for Jacob Blake, the Wisconsin man who was shot multiple times in the back by police officers Sunday while he was leaning into an SUV.\n\n“I’m going to invite you to join your faith with mine and let’s prayer in agreement,” Urrabazo said. “Lord, we come before you to ask for your spirit of peace to come over hurting communities in Wisconsin tonight.”\n\nIn addition to prayer for Blake and his family, Urrabazo asked for protection for those who have “put their lives in harm’s way, to bring safety and security to our streets.”\n\n- Maureen Groppe\n\nRNC courts Native American vote for Trump\n\nNative Americans will make up a tiny slice of the electorate in November, but they could have an outsized influence on the election where it counts: Several battleground states.\n\nSo it was no surprise the RNC opened its second night with Myron Lizer, vice president of the Navajo Nation – a territory that covers portions of Utah, New Mexico and Arizona.\n\n“Our people have never been invited into the American Dream,” said Lizer, who appeared with Trump at an event in Phoenix this year. “We’ve for years fought congressional battles with past congressmen and senators that were part of a broken system that ignored us.\n\n“That is, until President Trump took office,” he said.\n\nLizer pointed specifically to billions of dollars in economic stimulus to help tribal communities address COVID-19.\n\nTrump has had a complicated relationship with Native Americans. He repeated use of the word “Pocahontas” to mock Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has been offensive to some.\n\nMore recently, Trump slammed the decision to change the name of the Washington, D.C., NFL team, a word that is a slur used to describe Native Americans.\n\nAccording to the 2010 Census, 5.2 million people identified as American Indian and Alaska Native alone, or in combination with at least one other race.\n\nThe vast majority vote Democratic, except in states where energy is a large focus of the regional economy, such as Alaska, North Dakota or Oklahoma. Native Americans could also be a factor in Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, North Carolina, and Wisconsin.\n\n—John Fritze and Ledyard King\n\nTrump's surprises: Swearing in new citizens, pardoning a prison activist\n\nPresident Donald Trump used a \"surprise appearance\" at Tuesday's Republican political convention to swear in five new U.S. citizens.\n\nWhile some analysts questioned Trump taking official actions at a political convention, the president supervised the swearing-in of five new U.S. citizens born in Bolivia, Lebanon, India, Ghana and Sudan.\n\n\"Congratulations – great going,\" Trump told the group in a video that the White House released hours before it played during the convention telecast.\n\nNoting that one of the new American citizens has a degree in psychology, Trump said: \"In other words, she can figure me out.\"\n\nWhile Trump used the ceremony to tout the virtues of legal immigration, Democrats said his crackdowns at the border are designed to keep out any person of color.\n\nCritics said Trump should not make such political use of the presidency at a political convention.\n\nBen Rhodes, a foreign policy adviser to President Barack Obama, tweeted that the GOP meeting \"is infused with the illegal and unethical use of everything from the White House to the presidential pardon power.\"\n\nBefore the immigration ceremony, Trump signed a federal pardon for Jon Ponder, founder of Hope For Prisoners, a Las Vegas-based organization that helps ex-prisoners re-enter society.\n\n\"Jon's life is a beautiful testament to the power of redemption,\" Trump said\n\nThe state of Nevada had already granted clemency to Ponder, a convicted bank robber.\n\nTrump, who has made criminal justice reform a part of his agenda, praised Ponder's work with ex-prisoners, he did not mention voting rights. The president has opposed restoring voting rights for felons, and criticized governors who support the idea.\n\nIn thanking Trump for his federal pardon, Ponder said \"we live in a nation of second chances.\"\n\nRichard Beasley, a retired FBI agent who once arrested Ponder but is now a friend, also appeared in the video, saying, \"I'm so proud of Jon with his life's turnaround, and for all the lives that he's helped to change.\"\n\nCritics said Trump's use of the presidency violates at least the spirit of the Hatch Act that forbids government employees engaging political activity. (Presidents, however, are exempt from the law.)\n\n\"The Hatch Act is a law designed to separate politics from public service,\" tweeted Valerie Jarrett, senior adviser to President Barack Obama. \"Those lines are being erased tonight.\"\n\nIn his latest break from political tradition, Trump is making appearances every night at the Republican convention.\n\nThat will include his formal acceptance speech on Thursday night.\n\nLocation: The White House.\n\n— David Jackson\n\nRNC viewership fell 29% from 2016\n\nThe first night of the Republican National Convention on Monday averaged 15.9 million television viewers – 29% less than viewership four years ago and 15% less than the first night of last week’s Democratic National Convention.\n\nIt closely resembles the 27% nosedive in viewers for night 1 of the DNC convention, which averaged 18.7 million viewers. The opening night of the 2016 RNC convention in Cleveland, Ohio drew about 22.5 million viewers.\n\nThe Nielsen figures, reported by Variety and the Los Angeles Times, combine viewership on the three main networks, ABC, CBS and NBC, and leading cable new networks CNN, Fox News and MSNBC.\n\nFox News set the pace Monday leading with 7.1 million viewers followed by CNN’s 2 million viewers; ABC, nearly 2 million; NBC, 1.7 million; MSNBC, 1,6 million; and CBS, 1.5 million.\n\nFacing challenges of a global pandemic, both conventions ditched arenas and live audiences in favor of many recorded speeches and prepackaged videos. Democrats pieced together four nights of two-hour television shows while several Republican speakers shared the same stage at Mellon Auditorium in Washington, D.C. while President Donald Trump was featured in multiple videos shot in the White House.\n\nAlthough last week’s DNC viewership was down significantly, the campaign for Democratic nominee Joe Biden touted a record 10.2 million digital viewers, totaling 28.9 million viewers overall when combined with television viewership.\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nMelania Trump big draw of RNC's second night\n\nOn its second night, the Republican National Convention will get personal.\n\nThe virtual lineup for Tuesday includes first lady Melania Trump and two of the president's children – Eric and Tiffany – along with a series of business people, advocates for Republican causes and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nMelania Trump, rarely seen campaigning with the president, will be the big draw of the evening. The first lady will speak in prime time from the newly renovated White House Rose Garden, a project she supervised.\n\nPresident Donald Trump himself is also expected to show up during the online convention Tuesday. He plans to appear every night this week, leading up to his formal acceptance speech on Thursday night, also at the White House.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nDems push economic counter program during RNC\n\nThe battle over who gets credit for the pre-COVID economic recovery has become a defining issue of the conventions as well as this year's presidential election. Not surprisingly, Democrats argued Tuesday that Joe Biden deserves much of the credit.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, speaking as part of the Biden campaign's RNC counter-programming, said it was the Obama-Biden administration that led the country out of the worst economic downturn in generations. Trump, she said, drove that progress into the ground through his trade wars and haphazard pandemic response.\n\n“Donald Trump has severely worsened our country’s economy,” Whitmer said. “Workers and families cannot afford four more of years of that.”\n\nTrump and other Republicans have argued that the recovery under Obama, who signed a major economic stimulus in 2009, was one of the slowest in the nation's history. While unemployment and market indicators were improving under Obama, they note those numbers took off at a faster rate once Trump was in the White House.\n\nThe debate is important because both candidates are positioning themselves as best able to help the nation recover from the economic catastrophe caused by COVID-19.\n\nSen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., cited figures about how 1.5 million fewer jobs were created during the first three years of the Trump administration, compared to the final three years of the Obama administration. Booker also slammed Trump's tax cut bill as benefiting the rich while racking up enormous federal budget deficits.\n\n“We know people all across New Jersey are hurting and need some relief,” Booker said. “Working families know that the president isn’t looking out for them.”\n\n– Bart Jansen and John Fritze", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/08/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/08/16/spaceport-america-police-cat-superdome-plan-news-around-states/39968663/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nDecatur: The city is looking for a new slogan, and it won’t be “A little different.” The north Alabama community of 55,000 people is trying to come up with a new branding tagline, and a Birmingham-based consulting firm suggested it use “A little different.” City leaders liked the idea. Council member Kristi Hill says it seemed modern. But the Decatur Daily reports the public reaction was so negative that leaders voted this week for the company to try again. Hill says the town isn’t ready for something as edgy as “A little different.” Decatur is on the Tennessee River, and it has long been called the “River City.” Council member Chuck Ard says residents need to speak up if they don’t want to lose that identity.\n\nAlaska\n\nKenai: Country musician Zac Brown has lost a bid to limit snoopers on his private property in the state, the latest case in which the desires of the wealthy or celebrity for privacy have been at odds with public access. The lead singer for the multi-platinum, Grammy-winning Southern rock group that bears his name had sought to remove easements allowing access along his property, but the bid was rejected by a planning commission on the Kenai Peninsula, south of Anchorage, KSRM-AM reports. “I’m not interested in the public coming up to my home, people snooping, walking up to my windows,” Brown told the commission. “I’ve had to sell property for this reason.” Brown’s log home in Homer overlooks scenic Kachemak Bay. Homer, with a population of about 5,600, is frequented by fishermen and free spirits and bills itself as the “Halibut Capital of the World.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A court has scheduled arguments Oct. 23 in former Sheriff Joe Arpaio’s appeal of a ruling that refused to erase his criminal record after he was pardoned by President Donald Trump. Arpaio was convicted of misdemeanor contempt of court for disobeying a court order to stop his immigration patrols. A judge who had refused to expunge the conviction says that pardons don’t erase convictions or the facts of cases and that Arpaio’s clemency only mooted his possible punishments. Arpaio’s lawyers argued their client was deprived of his opportunity to appeal his conviction because the pardon came before he was sentenced and final judgment was entered, so the conviction must be erased. A special prosecutor says Arpaio relinquished his right to appeal his conviction when he accepted the pardon.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A plant-based food producer has asked a federal court to temporarily stop the state from enforcing a law that bans labeling vegetarian and vegan products as meat and advertising them as such while litigation is underway. Hood River, Oregon-based Tofurky Co. told courts Wednesday that complying with the law would have a “severe detrimental impact” because of the cost to change marketing and packaging. It’s not clear if the law has been enforced since taking effect three weeks ago. The law’s authors say it’s designed to protect consumers. Tofurky claims the lawsuit restricts commercial speech protected by the First Amendment. A spokeswoman says Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge is reviewing the motion to determine next steps.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Nearly 500 animals including lions, tigers, alligators and wolves will get new homes after officials announced a long-struggling Southern California sanctuary is shutting down. The Los Angeles Times reports the board of directors of the Wildlife Waystation in the Angeles National Forest voted this week to close after 43 years. The Department of Fish and Wildlife says it’s collaborating with the facility and animal welfare organizations across the country to relocate 470 exotic animals, including 42 chimpanzees. Officials with the 160-acre Wildlife Waystation were unavailable for comment. But a Fish and Wildlife spokeswoman said the sanctuary suffered extensive damage in a 2017 wildfire and during severe flooding earlier this year. The Times says for two decades, authorities have been scrutinizing the waystation for alleged environmental and animal-safety violations.\n\nColorado\n\nBethune: The state has set a new hail record, though the exact size of the hail that fell near the Kansas border is still being determined. Officials with the National Weather Service and the Colorado State University Climate Center measured a hail stone that fell at a home north of Bethune on Tuesday and was preserved in a freezer at 4.8 inches in diameter. That’s about the size of a softball, although it’s more oblong. Measurements taken by the family that recovered the hail stone after it was safe to go outside show it was initially a little bigger. The Climate Center says it will consider all information to determine a final measurement. The previous hail record for Colorado is 4.5 inches. The national record is 8 inches – the size of a volleyball – set in 2010 in South Dakota.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A pilot program in several cities aims to divert people accused of low-level offenses and who are homeless or have mental illness from the criminal justice system and get them treatment instead. The Early Screening and Intervention Initiative asks specially trained prosecutors to screen for low-level offenses – such as fourth-degree larceny or second-degree assault – and work with counselors in the courthouse to get the defendants treatment. If the person completes treatment, prosecutors then can decide not to pursue the case. The Division of Criminal Justice says the goal is to reduce the burden on the courts and find more appropriate, and often cheaper, outcomes for people struggling with addiction or other mental health issues in a state where police often file charges directly rather than working through prosecutors.\n\nDelaware\n\nNew Castle: Big Brother wants to keep a closer eye on big rigs in the state. Gov. John Carney was expected to sign legislation Thursday that authorizes state and local governments to install vehicle height monitoring systems. The systems use camera technology to record images of motor vehicles whose heights exceed specified size limits. The legislation is aimed at making sure tractor-trailer drivers aren’t using roads on which trucks are prohibited. State transportation officials will have one year from enactment of the legislation to identify roads as potential candidates for the monitoring systems and conduct an analysis to determine the appropriateness of each location. State officials could then install monitoring systems on state-maintained roads, and local governments could adopt ordinances authorizing monitoring systems on locally maintained roads after notifying the public.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has defended its plan to house unaccompanied migrant children in the city. The Washington Post reports DHHS says unaccompanied minors were apprehended alone, unlike migrant children separated from their families. It says its wards have beds and access to meals, legal services, games and classes. It says it awarded Dynamic Service Solutions a $20.5 million contract this month to operate a 200-bed D.C. facility for kids ages 12 to 17. The Maryland-based contractor has applied for a permit to open the shelter and posted jobs for people to work with “unaccompanied alien” children there. City officials have denounced the shelter, and Councilwoman Brianne K. Nadeau may propose emergency legislation to limit the number of youths allowed at shelters.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: The federal government is proposing to strip the tiny Key deer of its endangered species status despite what environmentalists say are continuing threats to the animal due to development in the Florida Keys, its only known habitat. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service says its studies show there is no more significant threat to the deer and has set a public forum Aug. 22 in the Keys on removing the deer from the Endangered Species List. Environmental groups say stripping the deer of endangered status would leave it at the mercy of further development. The deer, which grows to about 30 inches at the shoulder, have become a tourist attraction. Its numbers are estimated at about 600, up from as low as a couple dozen in the 1950s.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A federal judge overseeing a challenge to the state’s outdated voting system said that after years of inaction in the face of warnings about vulnerabilities, state officials have finally taken a solid step in the right direction. But she foreshadowed a looming fight over the state’s new system, writing that “it may be ‘like ‘deja vu all over again.’ ” U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg’s order Thursday prohibits the state from using its antiquated paperless touchscreen machines and election management system beyond this year. She also said the state must be ready to use hand-marked paper ballots if its new system isn’t in place for the March 24 presidential primary election.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: University of Hawaii students protesting the construction of a $1.4 billion telescope are expected to have class options allowing them to remain on the mountain, a report says. The plan to start construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope on the Big Island has been thwarted for weeks by a group of Native Hawaiian activists who say the construction will further desecrate a mountain that already has more than a dozen observatories. A list of more than 200 courses students can take either online or via distance learning has become available, The Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports. The majority of the remote classes for student demonstrators are offered through UH-Manoa, while others are offered by the UH-Hilo and Hawaii Community College. Course topics include Hawaiian religion, mythology, culture and language, Pacific Island literature, business, creative writing, and philosophy.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: State officials are looking into how the Trump administration’s move to weaken how it applies the Endangered Species Act could affect federally protected species in the Gem State. Scott Pugrud, Idaho Office of Species Conservation administrator, says his office is reviewing the regulatory changes. “We’ve got all our staff kind of digging in and seeing what they are and what the impacts will be on Idaho,” Pugrud told the Idaho Press. Idaho is home to six endangered and 13 threatened species, including sockeye salmon and Kootenai River white sturgeon. Threatened species include Canada lynx and grizzly bears. Idaho’s Office of Species Conservation was established in 2000, one year after the peregrine falcon was removed from the endangered species list. The bird bounced back with a successful captive-breeding effort led by the Peregrine Fund, now based in Boise.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Visitors to the Illinois State Fair can see a plot of newly legalized industrial hemp growing. The Illinois Department of Agriculture announced Wednesday that 100 industrial hemp and eight CBD plants were planted next to the U of I Master Gardner’s land on 8th Street. Hemp production was legalized last summer, and officials in April made applications available to would-be growers. Agriculture Director John Sullivan says the two varieties of the cash crop are easy to differentiate. CBD plants need to branch out to produce buds for oils. Industrial strains are planted close together so they will grow tall with long, straight stems for production of fiber or hurd – dense, absorbent material. An agriculture official will be giving presentations at the hemp plot daily from 1 to 3 p.m.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The cemetery where 1930s gangster John Dillinger is buried is objecting to his body’s planned exhumation as part of a television documentary. Crown Hill Cemetery said in a statement Wednesday that it objects to the exhumation in part because it’s concerned that “the complex and commercial nature of this exhumation could cause disruption to the peaceful tranquility of the Cemetery” and people visiting loved ones’ graves. Dillinger was fatally shot by FBI agents in Chicago in 1934. WXIN-TV reports that Dillinger’s nephew, Michael C. Thompson, sued the cemetery Wednesday, arguing it should allow him and his family to exhume Dillinger’s remains for a forensic examination to determine if it’s in fact Dillinger’s body. That exhumation would be part of a Dillinger documentary for The History Channel.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A full weekend of international food and music is in store next month, with the 15th annual World Food & Music Festival set to be held at Western Gateway Park in downtown Des Moines on Sept.20-22. More than 50 food vendors representing more than 25 countries and culinary regions will be featured at one of the city’s premier food and music events. The festival will be open from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. Friday and Saturday and 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday. Admission is free. The band Vertical Horizon, which had a No. 1 Billboard spot in 2000 for “Everything You Want,” will headline the festival Saturday.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: Prosecutors in the U.S. attorney’s office in Kansas City, Kansas, improperly listened to recorded communications between inmates and their defense attorneys and willfully violated court orders during an independent investigation of the systemic practice, a judge said in a ruling that could upend hundreds of federal convictions and sentences. U.S. District Judge Julie Robinson in a 188-page decision handed down late Tuesday also held the U.S. attorney’s office in Kansas in contempt of court, saying she would impose monetary sanctions against the government as punishment for violating orders to preserve evidence and turn over documents to the court-appointed special master investigating prosecutors’ use of video and phone recordings at the privately run Corrections Corporation of America detention center in Leavenworth, Kansas.\n\nKentucky\n\nLexington: A new state law requires public schools to display the motto “In God We Trust,” and one school district has responded with framed copies of a $1 bill. Fayette Superintendent Manny Caulk told the Lexington Herald-Leader on Wednesday that all schools in the district have been provided the framed copy to display. Parent Brittany Pike posted a message on Facebook saying she was pleased to see the back of the dollar bill framed at an elementary school last week and said her children “don’t feel awkward or excluded for not believing in any God.” Republican state Rep. Brandon Reed of Hodgenville filed the legislation that created the new law. He says he’s disappointed to see schools “spend time searching for silly loopholes,” noting the law passed with broad support.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The iconic Superdome, home to the Saints football team and a symbol of the city’s revival after Hurricane Katrina, will undergo a $450 million facelift, under a financing plan approved Thursday that is aimed at keeping the NFL team in Louisiana for decades. The 44-year-old domed stadium, which has hosted seven Super Bowls, will see its ramp system removed and replaced with elevators and escalators, club and suite levels expanded, new entry gates erected, concession stands added and access for people with disabilities improved. Construction is expected to take four years, working around football and other event schedules, but will be completed before the Superdome hosts its next Super Bowl in 2024, says Doug Thornton, a New Orleans-based executive for SMG, which manages the facility.\n\nMaine\n\nRockland: Pop artist Robert Indiana had $13 million in the bank even as his house sank into disrepair before his death, with pigeons living in the roof, water damaging books, rotting wood and the stench of cat urine, according to court documents filed Wednesday. Documents filed by Indiana’s estate allege that aide Jamie Thomas was not a selfless caregiver, contending he “improperly lined his pockets,” claimed as gifts more than 100 of Indiana’s works, and allowed Indiana to live in “squalor and filth.” Indiana, whose “LOVE” series is instantly recognizable worldwide, died at his home on Vinalhaven Island on May 19, 2018. He was 89. The documents, filed in Superior Court, accuse Thomas of violating his duties to Indiana. In the end, it took more than 1,000 hours of cleanup and the disposal of 8.6 tons of ruined, waterlogged paper to get the home in order, the documents say.\n\nMaryland\n\nOwings Mills: An African American school principal says he was degraded by a white Baltimore County police officer while he and his son watched an arrest. The Baltimore Sun reports police are investigating the claim made by Patterson High School Principal Vance Benton, who says he and his 15-year-old son were observing an arrest last month when the officer began “baiting” him, making belittling comments, such as asking Benton if he could read and insinuating that Benton’s son would be arrested someday. His letter to county officials says he’d never experienced such “degradation, disrespect and humiliation.” He wrote that innocent lives are in jeopardy from this kind of racial bias. Police Chief Melissa Hyatt says they’re taking the complaint seriously. The department denied the paper’s request for the officer’s body camera recording.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nProvincetown: An increase in the number of great white sharks around Cape Cod has forced a longtime charity swim race to be rerouted. The Cape Cod Times reports that Cape Cod National Seashore officials have denied a permit for the 32nd annual Swim for Life & Paddler Flotilla. The race was originally slated to start off Long Point Beach in Provincetown Harbor. Agency superintendent Brian Carlstrom says starting the race there isn’t in line with the organization’s “shark-smart” principles. Carlstrom says the agency made the decision out of an abundance of caution. The rerouted Sept. 7 race will be closer to shore. The state’s first fatal shark attack in 80 years occurred last September off Cape Cod. Another man was seriously injured in an attack last August.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: More than half of the state’s inmates who are eligible for resentencing following a 2016 U.S. Supreme Court ruling on so-called juvenile lifers still are waiting to learn their fate. An analysis found nearly 200 inmates, or about 55% of those eligible, haven’t gotten new sentencing hearings. As of early July, 86 of the state’s 354 juvenile lifers have been released. “We are not resolving cases at the rate that you would hope, given that the United States Supreme Court said these sentences should be rare,” says Tina Olson, an attorney with the Michigan State Appellate Defender Office. Her office is representing roughly two-thirds of the state’s cases. Prosecutors defend the process and say they’re thoughtfully weighing each case.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: A conservative law center is suing state Attorney General Keith Ellison, alleging that a lawyer working in his office on climate issues is an improper political plant. Attorney Pete Surdo is working for Ellison under a fellowship with the State Energy and Environmental Impact Center at New York University’s School of Law. Minnesota Public Radio reports the center was funded by billionaire donor Michael Bloomberg to address climate issues. Doug Seaton of the Upper Midwest Law Center says the connection is improper and unethical. He also says the arrangement violates a state law requiring all lawyers in the attorney general’s office to be state-paid. But Ellison says the arrangement is legal. He says Minnesotans expect an attorney general who enforces environmental law, and he’s happy to accept the help.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state’s largest city will stop curbside recycling collections by month’s end. Public Works Director Bob Miller says the program is indefinitely suspended, in part because China’s demand for recycled materials has fallen. Officials say more than 300 cities nationwide have stopped curbside collections. Jackson is referring residents to private collectors and says it’s seeking drop-off alternatives. Residents will get at least one more curbside collection before Sept. 1. Miller says while the city has been spending $1.15 million annually for curbside pickup, less than a third of residents participate. He says Jackson will consider restarting curbside recycling when the marketplace “reorganizes itself.” Waste Management, which collects Jackson’s garbage and recycling, argues the city can’t cut recycling from its contract. Jackson officials disagree and haven’t paid for months.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: The state Department of Natural Resources and Missouri Central Railroad have more time to negotiate over a proposed 144-mile bike trail that would stretch across the state. Missouri State Parks said Wednesday that the U.S. Surface Transportation Board approved a request for another 133 days to negotiate an agreement for the Rock Island Trail, which would run from Windsor in western Missouri to Beaufort in eastern Missouri. The trail would run along a former Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad path. The Jefferson City News-Tribune reports Mike Sunderland, of the Missouri State Parks, says the extension will allow the Missouri State Park Foundation to develop potential partnerships to support the project.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: A federal land agency has purchased a large area of land from a state conservation organization, increasing the amount of public ownership in the region. The Missoulian reports the Bureau of Land Management signed paperwork this week to purchase 20 square miles in the Lower Blackfoot River corridor just east of Missoula. Federal officials say money from the Land and Water Conservation Fund was used to purchase the land, with future plans to acquire additional areas by the end of 2020. Officials say the goal is to reach 94 square miles in the Blackfoot drainage and return formerly public lands that were given away decades ago. Officials say any additional purchases will have to go through a federal review process.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Officials say hunters may begin donating deer to the Hunters Helping the Hungry program beginning Sept. 1 at 11 processor locations around the state. The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission says two more will accept deer for the program starting Nov. 1 and Nov. 16. Hunters pay no processing costs for the processing. The program is funded solely by tax-deductible contributions. Ground venison is distributed by charitable organizations to Nebraskans in need. Processors accept only whole deer in good condition to ensure a good yield of pure ground venison. Learn more about the program and how to support it at the commission website, or contact program coordinator Teresa Lombard at 402 471-5430 or teresa.lombard@nebraska.gov.\n\nNevada\n\nElko: The Federal Highway Administration has issued an environmental excellence award to state wildlife and transportation officials for creating wildlife safety crossings on special highway overpasses in northeast Nevada. The award recognizes nine safety crossings installed on Interstate 80 in Elko County between Wendover and Wells and U.S. Highway 93 north of Wells to reduce potentially dangerous vehicle-animal collisions. The overpasses are covered with native soil and vegetation to replicate the natural environment and encourage crossing by mule deer, elk and other animals. Nevada’s departments of transportation and wildlife worked together to identify the most critical deer migration and roadway-crossing points, including GPS collars to track the migratory movements of hundreds of deer.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: The police department says it will install surveillance cameras despite a judge’s warning they could violate privacy laws. New Hampshire Public Radio reports the American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire sued the city of Manchester over the cameras in June. A judge’s preliminary order Tuesday said reviewing the footage and using it to identify someone is illegal, though installing the cameras isn’t. Manchester police want to install the three cameras near City Hall because of complaints about crime, panhandling and loitering. A live feed would be transmitted to the dispatch office. While not intended for traffic, the cameras on Elm Street could capture a driver’s identifying information, such as their face or license plate, which the ACLU says is against the law.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A judge has put a temporary hold on a new state law allowing terminally ill patients to seek life-ending drugs. Judge Paul Innes of Superior Court in Mercer County signed the temporary order Wednesday blocking the law and set a hearing for October. Brought by Dr. Yosef Glassman, the suit seeking to block the law argues it violates constitutional rights as well as common law barring suicide. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy signed the bill in April, making New Jersey the seventh state allowing the practice. Maine enacted a similar law in June, becoming the eighth. New Jersey’s law went into effect this month. Murphy said at an unrelated event Thursday that he will fight the suit, and the attorney general will put out guidance.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nUpham: Virgin Galactic has unveiled its digs at Spaceport America. The once-empty hangar in a remote spot in the New Mexico desert that anchors the taxpayer-financed launch and landing facility has been transformed into a custom-tailored headquarters where Virgin Galactic will run its commercial flight operations. Two levels within the spaceport include mission control, a preparation area for pilots, and a lounge for paying customers and their friends and families, with each element of the fit and finish paying homage to either the desert landscape that surrounds the futuristic outpost or the promise of traveling to the edge of space. Billionaire Richard Branson, who is behind Virgin Galactic, and former Gov. Bill Richardson first pitched the plan for the spaceport nearly 15 years ago, but there were plenty of construction delays and cost overruns.\n\nNew York\n\nSyracuse: Visitors may now get a look at two rare leopard cubs at the Rosamond Gifford Zoo. Onondaga County Executive Ryan McMahon announced that the little Amur leopards made their public debut Wednesday at the Syracuse zoo. The male and female cubs gradually ventured out from private quarters into their exhibit. It’s a temporary one while the zoo works toward a new, more complex $400,000 outdoor space for the leopard family. The cubs were born June 19 to parents Tria and Rafferty. The cubs don’t yet have names. The zoo plans a vote soon. Amur leopards are considered critically endangered. They are found in far eastern Russia, where an estimated 84 remain in the wild, up from about 30 in 2012. About 250 Amur leopards live under human care.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nMocksville: The police department is evicting its pet cat named Sgt. Butters, and some residents are mounting a campaign to bring him back. The Winston-Salem Journal reports the Mocksville Police Department’s resident feline needed a new home after concerns were raised about a pregnant woman who worked in the building and said she couldn’t be around cats. Officers had rescued the cat last year after it was seen hanging around the department. A Save Sarge Butters petition on Change.org was nearing its goal late Thursday. Sgt. Butters has been credited with helping to restore the department’s tarnished image after a jury awarded $4.1 million in damages to three former officers who said two town officials fired them in 2011 for reporting allegations of corruptions to state officials.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMinot: North Dakota State Fair officials have decided against holding a tobacco-free day at next year’s event. The state Health Department and Bismarck tobacco prevention coalition had asked the fair board to designate Family-Military Day as smoke-free at the 2020 event. Fair Board President Gary Knell says it would be difficult to make a fairgrounds ban work. The board decided to continue following state guidelines regarding tobacco in public places. State law prohibits smoking in enclosed public spaces oe within 20 feet of doors, windows or ventilation systems of public buildings. The Minot Daily News reports Knell says even though the board denied a tobacco-free day, advocacy groups could set up booths at the fair to encourage people to go tobacco-free on the grounds.\n\nOhio\n\nPortsmouth: A man is crediting his dog for saving him after the man suffered a bad fall. WSAZ-TV reports Jimmy Hale fell off a flood wall in Portsmouth last week while walking Taco. Hale ended up passing out after falling 15 feet and didn’t wake up until the next day. Hale says he screamed for help, but no one answered. That’s when Hale says he heard a lawnmower and then footsteps. Portsmouth city worker Mark Puckett says he only noticed Hale because of Taco, who stayed on the wall until someone showed up. Hale was flown to St. Mary’s Medical Center, where he was still recovering Wednesday from pelvic and wrist injuries. Hale was reunited with Taco in the hospital Wednesday, and the two had an emotional reunion.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The maker of the powerful painkiller OxyContin has agreed to provide access to propriety research and other data to researchers at Oklahoma State University to help them find causes and treatments for drug addiction. Purdue Pharma announced the agreement Thursday in a joint statement with OSU. Purdue said it will provide OSU’s new National Center for Wellness & Recovery access to “research molecules and certain associated data” that will help with research into addiction. The company and its controlling family, the Sacklers, agreed earlier this year to pay Oklahoma $270 million to settle allegations they helped create the nation’s deadly opioid crisis with their aggressive marketing campaign. That money is being used to establish the research center at OSU.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The governor has signed a bill requiring eggs produced by commercial farms to eventually be cage-free. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports Gov. Kate Brown approved the new law mandating all eggs produced or sold in Oregon must come from cage-free hens by 2024. The measure signed Monday applies to commercial farms with 3,000 or more chickens. The state requirements will give about 4 million birds added space and perches. The Humane Society of the United States called the law a “monumental win for hens confined in tiny cages in the egg industry.” Oregon joins a handful of other states with similar laws including California, Washington and Massachusetts. The newspaper cites reports that say cage-free laws provide an improvement for chickens, but most remain held in small spaces and cages.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nMechanicsburg: A man is accused of putting people at risk by placing unidentified substances into consumer product packaging and returning the items to retail stores. Police on Wednesday charged 58-year-old Robert Keith Burns of Mechanicsburg with reckless endangerment, theft by deception and criminal mischief through tampering. The arrest affidavit says Burns wouldn’t tell investigators what materials were put inside of packaging for beauty aids and medication returned to stores or recovered from his home. He’s in jail, unable to post $50,000 bail. Burns doesn’t have a lawyer listed in court records. Authorities seized packaging, glue, jars and white cream from a search of Burns’ home last week. Police have said they are trying to determine what substances were used and haven’t fielded any reports of people being sickened.\n\nRhode Island\n\nCentral Falls: The state’s attorney general and state police launched investigations Thursday after a truck drove through a group protesting federal immigration policies at a detention center, which has since placed an employee on leave. At least two people were injured, one seriously, Wednesday night outside the Donald W. Wyatt Detention Facility in Central Falls, according to the Jewish youth movement Never Again Action. The center is used by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. A video posted by the group on social media shows a black pickup that protesters say was operated by a uniformed corrections officer driving up to an entrance blocked by demonstrators. The vehicle stops before again moving forward. Protesters surround the truck, screaming and chanting: “The whole world is watching! The whole world is watching!”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nBeaufort: A former commercial helicopter pilot has become the first female Marine to pilot the F-35, a next-generation joint strike fighter aircraft. The Island Packet reports Capt. Anneliese Satz completed her fighter jet training this summer at the Marine Corps Air Station in Beaufort. Satz trained in Mississippi, Florida and Texas over the past four years before arriving in Beaufort last summer to train in the F-35B Lightning II. A station statement says Satz’s aircraft is a supersonic stealth vessel designed to operate from short-field bases and near front-line combat zones. The statement says the 29-year-old Satz credits her history as a commercial helicopter pilot as what prepared her for a career in military aviation. She’s now headed to Iwakuni, Japan, to join a unit called the Green Knights.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nBrandon: The state Department of Health and city officials are trying to assure residents the quality of the city’s drinking water is just fine. Concerns were raised after a doctored water quality report surfaced online that indicated unsafe radium levels. The report had redacted information about the company that conducted the testing, as well as the identity of the customer who hired the water quality assessment done. The state and city investigated and found the report posted online July 28 had been altered. The city of Brandon held a press conference Wednesday afternoon to address the issue and assure residents Brandon’s drinking water meets Environmental Protection Agency safety standards.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A local startup aims to use honey to help heal wounds, and Regional One Health is putting its unique product to the test. Apis is a dissolvable patch made of manuka honey from New Zealand and the structural protein collagen that protects wounds during the healing process. It’s the first product by SweetBio, a company with four full-time employees based out of the University of Memphis’ CommuniTech Research Park. SweetBio wants to figure out where exactly its product fits in the health care industry, a question Regional One’s health system is suited to answer thanks to the variety of patient scenarios it encounters. Regional Medical Center in Memphis, an acute-care hospital, is in that system. The partnership is the next step in Apis’ journey to becoming a commercial product, following its FDA clearance for wound management in May.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Area voters will be asked this fall to approve up to $3.5 billion in bonds to expand public transportation that supporters say could benefit more than a dozen communities. Metropolitan Transit Authority board members on Tuesday agreed to place the issue on the Nov. 5 ballot. The bonds would be repaid by future sales tax revenues. Federal money will also be sought for the anticipated $7.5 billion in projects that could extend three light rail lines, expand use of bus rapid transit in dedicated lanes and create high-occupancy vehicle lanes along most of Houston’s freeways. Houston-area voters in 1978 created METRO and approved a one-cent sales tax to support operations.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The University of Utah plans to spend about $925,000 to improve safety following the killing of a student track athlete on the Salt Lake City campus. University President Ruth Watkins had called for a task force to evaluate safety after 21-year-old Lauren McCluskey was gunned down in October by a man she briefly dated. The task force made two dozen recommendations, including improving building alarms, adding police patrol outside of night classes and hiring a chief security officer. The university is also rolling out a campus ride-hailing service. Students hired to be drivers will transport students and staff across campus. The university plans to have most of the security measures in place before classes start next week.\n\nVermont\n\nWilmington: A nonprofit created in response to Tropical Storm Irene is dissolving and donating its funds for local trail upgrades. The Wilmington Selectboard voted this week to accept more than $176,000 of remaining assets from the Wilmington Fund to be used for renovations of the Valley Trail system. The Brattleboro Reformer reports the money is meant to be used to enhance, upgrade and build the trail system with “family friendly” biking and hiking. The designated area spans about 5.6 miles between Wilmington and Dover. Town Manager Scott Tucker says the board’s next step is to plan the design for the trail system. He did not give a cost or exact time estimate for the project. Tucker says they hope to begin construction by next spring.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: The widows of two state troopers killed in a helicopter crash while monitoring a deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville are suing the state and others, blaming their husbands’ deaths on a “maintenance nightmare.” Amanda Bates and Karen Cullen filed wrongful death lawsuits Monday against Virginia, the Secretariat of Public Safety and Homeland Security and state police. Berke M.M. Bates and H. Jay Cullen had been monitoring the “Unite the Right” rally Aug. 12, 2017, before their helicopter crashed. The lawsuits say the helicopter was a “maintenance nightmare” with a history of malfunctions. Federal transportation safety investigators expect to issue a final report on the crash next year. A preliminary report did not offer a likely cause. Spokeswomen for the defendants said they couldn’t comment on pending litigation.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: Newly leaked emails show conservative state Rep. Matt Shea has had close ties with a group in the state that trained children and young men for religious combat. The Spokesman-Review reports the emails were first revealed in The Guardian on Wednesday, while Shea’s ties with Team Rugged also showed up in a video on Shea’s public Facebook page. “The entire purpose behind Team Rugged is to provide patriotic and biblical training on war for young men,” a man identified as the group’s leader, Patrick Caughran, wrote in a 2016 email to Shea, R-Spokane Valley. “Everything about it is both politically incorrect and what would be considered shocking truth to most modern christians,” Caughran wrote. “There will be scenarios where every participant will have to fight against one of the most barbaric enemies that are invading our country, Muslims terrorists.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nFort Gay: The town has received a grant that’s expected to help transform a lock house into a community historical site. The Herald-Dispatch reports the FOCUS WV Brownfields Grant check was presented last week to leaders in Fort Gay. The $5,000 grant will allow the town to get an environmental assessment, which is the first step in transforming the Lock Masters House at the Big Sandy Lock and Dam #3. The town hopes to turn the lock house into a welcome center and community museum. Leaders also want to add a public river walk. Construction of the dam was completed in 1897 but abandoned in 1925. Currently, the locks are mainly used by a few fishers, but Mayor Joetta Hatfield says she hopes the site attracts more anglers in the future.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Assembly Speaker Robin Vos accused a paralyzed Democratic lawmaker of trying to sabotage a new national role for the Republican legislative leader by publicly seeking accommodations for his disability. This “does not seem like an accident to me,” Vos told a conservative radio show host Thursday. “Everything they do is political and trying to make the other side look bad.” Vos earlier this year rejected Rep. Jimmy Anderson’s request to be able to call into meetings he cannot attend because of his disability and to bar overnight floor sessions. Vos told WISN’s Jay Weber he believes the timing of Anderson’s public appeal was meant to undermine the announcement of Vos taking over as president of the National Conference of State Legislatures. But Democratic leaders made the request in February, and Anderson reached out to a reporter in May. Vos took over the new role 10 days after the story was published.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: A new state park at a former launch command center for one of the world’s most powerful nuclear missiles has opened to the public this week. KGAB-AM reports the Quebec 1 Wyoming Historic Site north of Cheyenne opened for tours Tuesday. An official grand opening is set for this weekend. The former Peacekeeper missile site is located off Interstate 25 about 25 miles north of Cheyenne. Tourists will be able to go underground to the steel-reinforced concrete capsule. The site also features a museum. It’s estimated that the site will attract 50,000-60,000 visitors a year.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/08/17/carbon-storage-commissioner-comeback-hand-recounts-news-around-states/50609615/", "title": "Carbon storage, commissioner comeback: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nHuntsville: A project that’s been planned for more than a decade is nearing fruition, thanks to a $20 million federal grant. The Pedestrian Access and Redevelopment Corridor has been on hold for years because of a lack of funding, city officials said. Known unofficially as the skybridge, the PARC project will safely connect the downtown, Mill Creek and Lower Mill communities through greenways and a suspended pedestrian bridge, al.com reports. Those three areas are now separated by two major state and federal roads. The funding comes from the Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity grant, administered by the U.S. Department of Transportation. “We appreciate our partnership with the federal government and this grant, which will help us take Huntsville to the next level,” Mayor Tommy Battle said. Two other Alabama projects also received funding through similar grants. The town of Cordova received $5.2 million to improve deteriorating roadways, and the Northwest Alabama Council of Local Governments received $2 million for the Shoals Area Railroad Overpass in Colbert County. Shane Davis, Huntsville’s director of Urban & Economic Development, said the city’s skybridge project has been a goal since 2006.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Baby boomers who retired early as the COVID-19 pandemic set in are a key factor behind the state’s labor shortage, Alaska Public Media reports. State economist Dan Robinson told the news outlet that many older workers felt they could afford to take the leap early, while many others who left the labor market in recent years were in their 30s and stymied by a lack of child care. He told APM that while the pandemic was a factor, employers will just have to adjust to a new reality, as a lack of stable funding for government services means Alaska’s population loss trend is unlikely to abate.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Proponents of three voter initiatives who each turned in hundreds of thousands of signatures last month to qualify them for the November ballot are trying to beat back legal challenges that could prevent them from going before voters. Two of the measures – one requiring disclosure of who is funding political campaigns and another rolling back or blocking efforts by Republicans to tighten voting rules – are being challenged by pro-business groups. They alleged that paid petition circulators made errors or omitted required information on their registrations with the secretary of state or petitions. The third measure, backed by a California-based employee union, would protect residents from predatory bill collection and raise the amount of assets shielded from bill collectors. It faces a similar challenge from a newly formed group funded by Arizona debt collection agencies, who say the description voters saw when they asked to sign was illegally misleading. Lawyers for challengers and the initiative proponents have spent the past two weeks in court, and three different Phoenix judges will decide who is correct. Whichever sides lose are are expected to appeal directly to the state Supreme Court.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A federal appeals court on Tuesday upheld the state’s use of the sedative midazolam in its lethal injections. A three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a lower court judge’s ruling upholding Arkansas’ execution process. U.S. District Judge Kristine Baker ruled in 2020 that the state’s use of midazolam in injections is constitutional and dismissed claims that less painful methods of execution are available. “With no scientific consensus and a paucity of reliable scientific evidence concerning the effect of large doses of midazolam on humans, the district court did not clearly err in finding that the prisoners failed to demonstrate that the Arkansas execution protocol is sure or very likely to cause severe pain,” the appeals panel said in its ruling. The ruling comes more than five years since Arkansas raced to execute eight inmates over 11 days before its batch of midazolam expired. The state ultimately put four men to death after courts halted the other four executions. It hasn’t executed any inmates since 2017 and has none scheduled. “It is past time that justice be carried out in these cases of defendants killing innocent people, and the Eighth Circuit’s decision reaffirms that Arkansas’ execution protocol is constitutional,” Attorney General Leslie Rutledge, a Republican, said in a statement.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: Nearly 2,000 Kaiser Permanente psychologists, therapists, social workers and other mental health workers in Northern California began an open-ended strike Monday over staffing shortages that their union said have led patients to wait for months to get help. The National Union of Healthcare Workers, which represents the workers, is negotiating a new contract with the Oakland-based health giant. It said the strike is to demand Kaiser hire more mental health workers to ease the burden put on the current staff. Kaiser Permanente said in a statement it has hired hundreds of new mental health workers, including 200 since January 2021, and pointed out the shortage in mental health care professionals is happening nationwide. It said that what’s at issue is the union’s demand to increase the time therapists spend on tasks other than seeing patients. The union is demanding 9 hours be allotted for administrative work, which would leave only 31 hours to see patients per week, the company said. It said it proposed increasing the time for administrative tasks from 6 to 7.2 hours, leaving 32.8 hours to see patients. Jeffrey Chen-Harding, a clinical social worker with Kaiser who was picketing Monday in San Francisco, said that what Kaiser calls an administrative task is actually important work directly related to patient care.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A man had a rude awaking early Saturday morning when a roughly 400-pound bear flipped the lever doorknob to his home and rummaged through some dog food, Colorado Parks and Wildlife officials said Monday. The homeowner, Ken Mauldin, grabbed a gun and shot the bear multiple times until it collapsed and died just after 2 a.m., said Rachael Gonzalez, spokesperson for Colorado Parks and Wildlife. Nobody was injured, she said. Officers removed the animal from the house, located in the ski resort town of Steamboat Springs. The couple had a legal right to shoot the bear if they felt threatened, Gonzalez said. Colorado has roughly 12,000 bears, and break-ins aren’t uncommon in Rocky Mountain towns. People shooting and killing bears in self-defense, however, is rare, Gonzalez said. This particular male bear was not tagged, and the department does not know if it was involved in other break-ins, she said. “Steamboat, that area, they’ve been dealing with bears getting into homes all summer long,” Gonzalez said. “It’s not impossible that this bear learned the behavior from another bear.” Residents of Steamboat Springs are warned by the agency to lock doors and windows, secure their trash and recycling in bear-proof bins, and even take down bird feeders to prevent these kind of confrontations.\n\nConnecticut\n\nBridgeport: A federal bankruptcy judge on Monday cleared the way for a defamation lawsuit in Connecticut to proceed against Infowars host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. The case was filed by relatives of some victims of the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown. Jones has falsely claimed that the nation’s deadliest school shooting – which killed 20 students and six educators – was a hoax. Jones’ lawyer had sought to transfer the case to a federal bankruptcy court, rather than continue the case in Connecticut state court. That move brought the first day of jury selection to a sudden halt earlier this month. However, Monday’s ruling by Judge Julie Manning essentially allows the plaintiffs to continue the defamation lawsuit against just Jones as an individual, without Free Speech Systems, a company owned by Jones and a defendant in the Connecticut case. “The plaintiffs’ rights to have that process continue in the Connecticut Superior Court should not be disturbed,” Manning wrote in the decision, adding that the plaintiffs’ claims for damages were ready for trial. A Texas jury this month ordered Jones to pay $45.2 million in punitive damages to the parents of one of the children killed at Sandy Hook and another $4.1 million for the suffering he put them through by claiming for years that the shooting was a hoax.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A family is hoping for change after a 37-year-old man with an intellectual disability had his arm broken while he was taken into police custody earlier this year in an encounter advocates say could have gone differently if crisis intervention tactics were used. The man, who was violating a court order when he stood across the street from his aunt’s house in the New Castle area and is now facing charges, called police himself to report an argument with his aunt. The encounter ended with him being leg-swiped by an officer, which landed him on the ground with a broken arm that required surgery. New Castle County Police investigated the use of force officers exhibited that night and found that officer conduct was appropriate. But the encounter is one from which family and advocates say police can and should learn, as people with disabilities are more likely to be victims of police brutality. “Disability-related behaviors can be misunderstood by law enforcement officers who are trained to gain control and compliance on a scene but typically not trained to identify a disability or know how to interact or communicate with persons with disabilities,” said Carlean Ponder, director of disability rights and housing policy at The Arc, a Washington D.C.-based nonprofit that advocates for people with disabilities.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The Homeland Security Department’s inspector general has refused congressional requests for documents and staff testimony about the erasure of Secret Service communication related to the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol, angering top Democrats who accuse him of unlawfully obstructing their investigation. In an Aug. 8 letter disclosed Tuesday, Inspector General Joseph Cuffari told the leaders of the House Oversight and Homeland Security committees that his office will not comply with their requests for internal documents and sit-down interviews due to the ongoing criminal investigation into deleted Secret Service text messages. In response, House Oversight Chair Carolyn Maloney and Homeland Security Chair Bennie Thompson sent a letter Tuesday demanding Cuffari turn over documents and make his staff available to lawmakers or risk facing a potential congressional subpoena “Your obstruction of the Committees’ investigations is unacceptable, and your justifications for this noncompliance appear to reflect a fundamental misunderstanding of Congress’s authority and your duties as an Inspector General,” Maloney and Thompson wrote in the letter. “If you continue to refuse to comply with our requests, we will have no choice but to consider alternate measures to ensure your compliance,” they wrote.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: Tracks used by the nation’s deadliest railroad will see added fencing to keep pedestrians away and safety improvements at crossings under a $25 million federal grant announced Monday. Brightline and government officials announced the grant as the privately owned passenger line continues to be plagued by deaths along its tracks between Miami and West Palm Beach. In the past two weeks, Brightline trains have killed three people – and 68 since the service began its first runs five years ago. That’s about one death for every 33,000 miles its trains travel, the worst fatality rate among the nation’s more than 800 railroads, according to an ongoing Associated Press analysis of Federal Railroad Administration data. The grant, part of the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity program, will cover safety features, including 33 miles of fencing at locations of frequent trespassing along with extensive crossing improvements at all 333 crossings along the corridor, which will eventually stretch from Miami to Orlando, Brightline President Patrick Goddard said. The company will also install an additional 150 warning signs and 170 more suicide crisis hotline signs “to better reach those who might be struggling with suicide,” Goddard said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Gov. Brian Kemp said Monday that he will spend up to $1.2 billion in federal COVID-19 aid on payments of $350 apiece to more than 3 million Georgians who benefit from Medicaid, subsidized child health insurance, food stamps or cash welfare assistance. The payments will start in September, said Katie Byrd, a spokesperson for the governor’s office. The move comes atop Kemp’s proposals last week to spend $2 billion in state surplus, split between property tax rebates and a second round of income tax rebates, if voters choose him for a second term in November over Democratic challenger Stacey Abrams. Those separate plans would require legislative approval next year. Monday’s announcement will put money in the hands of less affluent Georgians in the months before the nationally watched election in a narrowly contested swing state. Those are voters to whom Abrams has been tailoring her economic platform. She also backs another round of income tax rebates, like those Kemp already pushed though, but has been arguing that Georgia also needs to do more to invest in long-term expansions of health, education and small-business assistance to try to create a less unequal economy.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A new monk seal on Oahu’s North Shore has marine officials asking the public to give the mother and pup plenty of room, HawaiiNewsNow reports. The baby monk seal is the 14th birthed by mother Right Spot and her first on Oahu, having typically given birth on the island of Molokai, where she was born.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A federal judge says the Legislature can intervene in the U.S. Department of Justice’s lawsuit targeting the state’s total abortion ban – but only to present evidence about emergency abortions performed in Medicaid-funded emergency rooms. In the written ruling handed down Saturday, U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill said the Legislature’s interests are already well-represented by the Idaho Attorney General’s office and Gov. Brad Little, so there’s no legitimate reason to add another party to the lawsuit. The Justice Department sued Idaho last week over the state’s strict abortion ban, saying it would force doctors to violate the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, a federal law that requires anyone coming to a medical facility for emergency treatment to be stabilized and treated. Allowing a state legislature the right to intervene in every federal case without first proving a distinct need would allow a state to “turn into a nine-headed Hydra whenever it chooses,” Winmill said. The abortion ban was enacted in 2020 and set up as a “trigger law,” set to take effect Aug. 25 now that the U.S. Supreme Court has overturned Roe v. Wade. Idaho’s law criminalizes all abortions, and anyone who performs, attempts or assists with abortions can face two to five years in prison and lose their health care license. Physicians who perform abortions to save a patient’s life or in cases of rape or incest can use that information as a legal defense during the criminal trial.\n\nIllinois\n\nNaperville: A suburban Chicago police officer who fatally shot a hatchet-wielding man during a June traffic stop was justified in the deadly shooting, a prosecutor has determined. DuPage County State’s Attorney Robert Berlin said Monday that Naperville police Officer Frank Tonkovich “reasonably believed” Edward Samaan, 28, of Naperville, was trying to kill either him or a driver Tonkovich had pulled over separately. Berlin said in a news release that Tonkovich’s actions were not just reasonable “but necessary in order to prevent great bodily harm or death to himself or the motorist he had stopped,” The (Arlington Heights) Daily Herald reports. The officer had pulled over a car June 3 and was standing at that driver’s window when Samaan pulled his vehicle up nearby, exited it and charged Tonkovich with a hatchet in his hand, Berlin said. Tonkovich then shot at Samaan six times, hitting him five times. Samaan was pronounced dead at a hospital. The officer, a 22-year-veteran of the Naperville Police Department, was not injured.\n\nIndiana\n\nEvansville: Preliminary autopsy results released Monday for the three victims of a house explosion in a southern Indiana neighborhood show they died of blunt force trauma and compression asphyxia. A married couple who lived at the center of the Wednesday explosion in Evansville, 43-year-old Charles Hite and 37-year-old Martina Hite, both died of blunt force trauma to their chests, and 29-year-old neighbor Jessica Teague died of compression asphyxia, the Vanderburgh County Coroner’s Office said in a news release. Final autopsy reports and toxicology are pending, Chief Deputy Coroner David Anson said in the news release. The explosion injured a fourth person and damaged 39 homes, leaving 11 uninhabitable, authorities have said. A statement Monday by the Evansville Fire Department said the investigation is still in its early stages and likely will be lengthy. Suzanne Dabkowski, a spokeswoman for the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, said last week that the agency can’t speak to any possible causes of the explosion. Dabkowski said the ATF has explosive specialists and firearms investigators on site helping with the investigation. Evansville authorities have declined to speculate whether natural gas or another issue is responsible for the explosion.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The developer of a proposed $4.5 billion carbon capture pipeline must release the names of landowners who could be affected along its roughly 680-mile route, a district judge ruled. Summit Carbon Solutions, an Ames company that has proposed building a pipeline to transport liquefied carbon dioxide, failed to win a permanent injunction to keep secret the names of thousands of landowners it said could be in the pipeline’s path. Under state law, Summit was required to hold public meetings for landowners potentially affected by the pipeline project, and the company compiled a list with more than 10,000 names along the route. After the Iowa Utilities Board asked Summit to submit the names, the company asked state regulators to keep the list confidential. Summit also filed a petition with the court to keep the names secret. The Sierra Club of Iowa asked regulators to release the names under state’s open records law, a move state Consumer Advocate Jennifer Easler also supported. In November, the Iowa Utilities Board decided it would keep secret most of the names, saying property owners’ right to privacy outweighed the public’s interest. On Friday, Polk County District Judge David Nelmark said Summit had failed to show landowner information should be excluded from state public records law.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state plans to do a partial hand recount that won’t change the outcome of this month’s decisive vote in favor of abortion rights after abortion opponents charged almost $120,000 to credit cards Monday to cover the cost. The Kansas secretary of state’s office said the recount will occur in nine of the state’s 105 counties that account for more than half of the votes cast on the Aug. 2 abortion ballot question, including four of the state’s five most populous counties. Voters who want to keep the abortion rights allowed under the Kansas Constitution prevailed in eight of the nine counties. The recount request came Friday from Melissa Leavitt, an election conspiracy promoter from Colby in far western Kansas, but Mark Gietzen, a hard-right anti-abortion activist from Wichita who also promotes election conspiracies, pledged to help pay for the recount. Gietzen used a credit card to pay for all but $1,500 of the costs, which Leavitt will cover. Voters on Aug. 2 overwhelmingly rejected a proposed amendment to the Kansas Constitution that would have allowed the Republican-controlled Legislature to further restrict abortion or ban it. There has been no evidence of significant problems with the election. Leavitt has an online fundraising effort that had received more than $41,000 in donations as of Monday evening.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Experts who are visiting disaster centers can help people whose heirlooms and keepsakes were damaged in recent flooding. The Heritage Emergency National Task Force experts may be able to help save photos, artwork, quilts, important documents and other items, the Federal Emergency Management Agency said. The experts are visiting Clay County Community Center this week Friday through Sunday, Knott County Sportsplex Tuesday through Sunday, and Hazard Community College First Federal Center Wednesday through Sunday. FEMA said the experts will discuss how to handle, dry and clean the items, and they can provide information about personal safety during the restoration process. The Heritage Emergency National Task Force is co-sponsored by FEMA and the Smithsonian Institution. The task force was created to protect cultural heritage from damage from natural disasters and other emergencies.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Law enforcement officers have ended a three-day peaceful protest by jail inmates who demanded improvements to living conditions, including quicker attention to requests for medical care. Orleans Parish Sheriff Susan Hutson issued a statement saying her deputies and state Department of Public Safety and Corrections officers entered a pod inside the Orleans Justice Center on Sunday night after inmates activated the sprinkler system and began to flood the area, WDSU-TV reports. The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reported inmates had barricaded a pod and refused food, water and medication. Hutson said deputies repeatedly offered to bring food and medication, and inmates refused to accept it. Inmates produced a list of desired changes that Hutson released Sunday. It included demands for more recreation time, a new washer and dryer, a second television, and the lifting of restrictions on how many books and photos inmates may receive each month. They also demanded proper medication and said they wanted sick calls to be treated seriously. An altercation at the jail in June resulted in the death of an inmate, and three stabbings recently occurred in the pod where the protest happened.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Federal regulators who want to enforce new vessel speed rules to help protect rare whales can expect some pushback from ship operators. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced the new proposed rules, which are designed to protect the last remaining North Atlantic right whales, last month. The rules would expand seasonal slow zones off the East Coast and require more vessels to comply with the rules. The agency’s National Marine Fisheries Service is holding a series of informational meetings on the new rules. Some shipping and maritime groups said they have concerns the rules could make their jobs more difficult or less safe. The American Pilots’ Association is concerned the new rules would make operations more hazardous for pilot boats, said Clayton Diamond, executive director of the group. Pilot boats transport maritime pilots to and from larger ships, often in bad weather and at carefully calculated speeds, Diamond said. “We think that the NOAA/NMFS proposal to apply the speed restriction to pilot boats is unwise and unsafe,” Diamond said, adding that the group “strongly” supports protecting marine mammals. The agency isn’t commenting on industry concerns during the rulemaking process, said Allison Ferreira, a NOAA spokesperson.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The Maryland State Board of Elections voted Monday to file an emergency petition in court that seeks an earlier count of mail-in ballots for the general election in November. The board voted 4-0 to seek a legal remedy in hopes of speeding up the vote count for mail-in ballots, which have become much more popular with voters in the state. In a statement after the vote, the board said that the continued expansion of mail-in balloting and the inability of the local boards of elections to count mail-in ballots before Election Day could have significant implications. “It could leave local, statewide, and even federal contests without certified results until late December 2022 or early January 2023,” the board said. “Maryland is currently the only state in the union that forbids any kind of processing of mail-in ballots until after Election Day.” Currently, mail-in ballots can’t be counted until two days after Election Day. That caused delays in determining winners in the state’s primary last month. The state elections board certified the primary election Monday. Maryland’s primary was delayed by three weeks due to legal challenges involving congressional and legislative redistricting.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Michael Cox, a Boston police veteran who was brutally beaten by fellow officers while chasing a suspect and fought against efforts to cover up his assault, was sworn in Monday as commissioner of the police department. After taking the oath during a ceremony at City Hall Plaza, Cox thanked his family and friends who supported him through the incident that he said changed his life forever but does not define him. “I’ve worked to change policing since that incident occurred, and I will continue to do all I can to make sure that no Black or brown person or any individual, no matter their gender identity or race, is the victim of any kind of unconstitutional policing,” said Cox, who is Black. Mayor Michelle Wu called Cox a leader that Boston “deserves.” “I’m incredibly proud, grateful and inspired in the future for this city with Commissioner Michael Cox at the helm of the Boston Police Department,” she said. The Boston native most recently served as police chief in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Before taking that job in 2019, Cox served three decades in the Boston Police Department, where he took on the so-called blue wall of silence after he was attacked by colleagues who mistook him for a fleeing suspect whom he was trying to grab as he scaled a fence.\n\nMichigan\n\nFlint Township: A name change for Flint Township will not appear on the fall ballot. Township trustees voted 4-2 Monday against placing the question on the ballot. The result would not have been binding, but there had been interest in getting the public’s opinion about a change to Oak Hills Township, MLive.com reports. Supporters of a name change say “Flint” carries baggage. The city is nearby. “In my business world, I have a really hard time selling Flint Township to outside folks,” said Winfield Cooper, a real estate broker. “I have to explain to them it’s not the city of Flint. I have to explain to them it’s not lead-contaminated water.” Flint’s water was contaminated in 2014-15 because state regulators didn’t require that water from the Flint River be treated to reduce corrosion. Changing the township name would cost at least $72,000 to change uniforms, vehicles and buildings at the fire and police departments. “It does nothing to change the township other than to spend money,” said resident Roger Powell, who opposed it.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The Minnesota Department of Corrections has dropped its order that 18 prisoners who were released from prison to protect their health during the coronavirus pandemic report back to prison. The state had ordered the 18 to return to prison by Monday. But a Ramsey County judge has granted a temporary restraining order, saying reincarcerating the individuals could still be detrimental to their health. Assistant Attorney General Corinne Wright on Friday asked Judge Mark Ireland to cancel further hearings on the corrections order and said the state instead will make individual determinations for the 18 people remaining on conditional medical release, according to an email shared by American Civil Liberties Union Minnesota attorney Daniel Shulman, who sued on behalf of the inmates. “I applaud them for taking this step, and I hope that they will let these people remain on (medical release) where they should be,” Shulman told the Star Tribune. The 18 former prisoners were among the 158 people granted conditional medical release as COVID-19 swept through the prison population in Minnesota. Nearly 2,300 prisoners had applied for release.\n\nMississippi\n\nFlowood: For the second time in less than a month, an innocent bystander was killed during a police chase involving the same department. One person was killed Sunday during a police chase that began in Pearl. The chase ended when the vehicle that was being pursued crashed into a motorcycle, killing the driver. Public information officer Greg Flynn said a Pearl police officer attempted to make a traffic stop when a silver sedan took off. The officer pursued the vehicle into the neighboring city of Flowood, where police there joined the chase until it ended after the fleeing vehicle struck a motorcycle. Flynn said police later discovered the man was driving with a suspended license and had felony convictions at the federal and state levels. He is being charged with felony fleeing resulting in death. Pearl police, Flowood police, the Rankin County Sheriff’s Office and the Flowood Fire Department responded to the scene. Three weeks ago, another vehicle being pursued by Pearl police crashed into a U.S. Postal Service truck in Jackson, killing mail carrier Brad Pennington, 32. That chase began when police attempted to pull over a man for speeding. The man allegedly failed to pull over, and police chased him into Jackson until he crashed his Toyota Camry into Pennington’s mail truck.\n\nMissouri\n\nWyatt: A gas explosion Monday at a southeast Missouri home killed one person and injured nine others, authorities said. The explosion happened about 7 a.m. in Wyatt, a town of about 280 people that’s about 130 miles south of St. Louis, said Capt. Barry Morgan with the Mississippi County Sheriff’s Office. He said authorities were trying to determine whether a water heater or stove was to blame. He identified the person killed only as a man in his mid-20s. Nine other people – the youngest just 6 months old – had serious or critical burn injuries. Several were flown to hospitals in St. Louis and Memphis, Tennessee. “That is a ton of people in a house,” Morgan said. “So that’s what we’re trying to determine, why there were so many people in there, because when I arrived on scene, it was just there was victims lying everywhere, badly burned.” The garage of a neighboring home also caught fire, but no one inside that structure was hurt, Morgan said. The State Fire Marshal and a state propane commission were investigating.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Native Americans who must travel long distances to election offices and cope with unreliable and infrequent mail delivery are further disenfranchised under election laws approved last year, a lawyer said Monday during opening statements in a trial challenging the laws’ constitutionality. Jacqueline De León, an attorney with the Native American Rights Fund, said she would present evidence that the laws ending Election Day voter registration in Montana and banning the paid collection of voted ballots put unreasonable barriers on Native Americans who already face other economic and logistical obstacles. The new laws were passed by the Legislature in 2021, and a similar ballot collection law was declared unconstitutional by two state judges in 2020. “We should not have to bring this case again. But we will certainly prove, once again, that Native Americans are disproportionately and unfairly impacted” by the two bills, De León said. The trial that began Monday in Billings also challenges a law that requires additional proof of residency besides student IDs for college students to register and vote. The trial before District Court Judge Michael Moses is scheduled to last 10 days.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A state audit says the former head of the nonprofit History Nebraska organization diverted COVID-19 relief money to a private foundation, the Omaha World-Herald reports. Deputy State Auditor Craig Kubicek’s report suggested potential criminal liability for former History Nebraska Executive Director Trevor Jones over the 2020 transfer of two pandemic aid checks representing more than $270,000 to the History Nebraska Foundation, a then-new group that rivaled History Nebraska.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: As officials in some rural parts of the state vow to bypass voting machines in favor of hand-counting ballots this November, the Nevada secretary of state’s office is proposing statewide rules that would specify how to do it, including requiring bipartisan vote counters, creating room for observation and instructing how many ballots to count at a time. On Friday, four voting rights groups came out against the proposal, calling it an “admirable attempt to ensure higher standards” for counting votes by hand but urging the secretary of state to prohibit the practice outright, noting that the push for hand-counting stems from “unfounded speculation” about voting machines. “The regulations are not enough to address the underlying accuracy issues and remediate the legal deficiencies of hand count processes,” the groups Brennan Center, All Voting is Local, ACLU Nevada and Silver State Voices said in a statement Friday. Both voting rights groups and hand-counting proponents spoke at an online hearing Friday, the first meeting convened to discuss the regulations. Voting rights groups lobbied to prohibit hand counts, while voting machine skeptics, a majority of the speakers, said the proposed regulations were a power grab meant to sabotage hand-counting.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDover: As COAST enters its 40th year, the regional bus transportation service is preparing to build a new operations, maintenance and administrative facility, funded in large part by $7.7 million from the federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. U.S. Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan and U.S. Rep. Chris Pappas were among those legislators instrumental in getting the $7.7 million grant from the Federal Transit Administration to improve public transportation in the area. “COAST has provided reliable public transportation throughout the Seacoast region for more than 40 years,” Shaheen said. “Its current Dover facility is too small and outdated to achieve its full potential, which is why I helped secure this $7.7 million grant to construct a new facility. This improved facility will advance the quality and sustainability of public transit in the region, which will help drive local economic growth.” Hassan said the grant will “ensure that Granite Staters can get where they need to go safely and efficiently,” while Pappas noted “this grant will help COAST achieve its mission of providing affordable and accessible public transportation.” COAST said the federal funding will greatly enhance its ability to meet the Seacoast’s public transportation needs.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: With three state Supreme Court seats vacant, Chief Justice Stuart Rabner announced that a trio of appellate court judges would be temporarily promoted to fill the gaps. The order, issued Monday, comes amid a “crisis” of judicial vacancies statewide, causing massive backlogs for cases such as divorces and estate settlements. That shortage includes the New Jersey Supreme Court, which hasn’t had as many vacancies as it does now in recent memory – an “outrageous” scenario, one lawyer said. “Assigning one appellate judge is not uncommon, but three may be unprecedented,” said Carl Golden, who was director of communications for the judiciary from 1990 to 1993 under then-Chief Justice Robert Wilentz. Rabner’s order named Judges Clarkson Fisher Jr., Jack Sabatino and Douglas Fasciale to the state’s highest court. These judges, “who are senior in service,” Rabner said, will “participate in new matters presented for the court’s consideration.” Jeralyn Lawrence, president of the state’s bar association, said these jurists are the “best of the best,” but this is “not what the constitution envisioned, and the triage continues.” “All three levels of our courts are being impacted solely because our governor and our Legislature can’t fill these vacancies, and they are hurting the public,” she said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Cowboys for Trump founder Couy Griffin is fighting to keep his seat as a county commissioner as he faces possible removal and disqualification from public office for his participation in last year’s insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. Griffin was previously convicted of a misdemeanor for entering Capitol grounds on Jan. 6, 2021. He was sentenced to 14 days and given credit for time served. Three residents of Santa Fe and Los Alamos counties filed a lawsuit seeking to remove Griffin from being commissioner of Otero County’s 2nd district for the rest of his term. Griffin, a 47-year-old Republican, is representing himself in the two-day bench trial that began Monday. “This lawsuit is about removing a duly elected county commissioner from office through the civil court,” Griffin said in court. “By allowing this case to move forward, you’re going to set a very dangerous precedent.” On the witness stand Monday, Griffin said he went to Washington, D.C., to peacefully protest and pray with other Trump supporters. “I had no intention of breaking the law on that day,” he said. The three plaintiffs in the case argued in a 259-page petition that Griffin should be disqualified from holding public office on the basis of a clause in the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is endorsing Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler in his contentious primary contest with another veteran U.S. House member from the state, Carolyn Maloney. Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement that “New York has a lot of outstanding leaders but few of them lead with the courage, conviction, and brilliant legislative effectiveness” that Nadler has. He called Nadler a “critical partner” who “was right on the issues years before so many others.” Nadler, 75, and Maloney, 76, have each represented Manhattan-area districts in Congress for 30 years but have gone from allies to rivals after their Upper West Side and Upper East Side districts were drawn together under new redistricting maps. Schumer’s backing comes on the heels of Nadler winning an endorsement from The New York Times over the weekend ahead of the Aug. 23 primary. The newspaper’s endorsement carries a lot of weight in deep-blue New York City but is expected to be especially decisive in a contest featuring two veteran lawmakers. Nadler and Maloney chair the powerful House Judiciary and Oversight committees, respectively. Another Democrat, 38-year-old attorney Suraj Patel, is also running in the primary race for New York’s 12th District.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: After receiving more than a dozen reports of conduct violations by party-appointed poll watchers during the May primaries, the state elections board tightened regulations for precinct observers Tuesday to prevent partisan interference in the November general election. The board unanimously voted to approve temporary rules for the upcoming election that more clearly outline the code of conduct for partisan observers, prohibiting them from standing close to a “tabulator, laptop, pollbook or other voting document” where they could view marked ballots or confidential voter information. The revisions heighten scrutiny for observers and poll workers alike, adding to a list of prohibited conduct for precinct officials that forbids them from tampering with voting equipment or expressing their political views on the job. While poll watching has been an element of electoral transparency since the 1800s, the practice grew in prominence in the 2020 election cycle due to ex-President Donald Trump’s unfounded allegations of voter fraud. A survey of county elections directors in late May found violations in 15 North Carolina counties, where officials observed poll watchers harassing voters and attempting to enter restricted areas to view confidential voting records.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Gov. Doug Burgum said Monday that he’ll work with legislators on a bill next session to “guarantee that the opportunity exists” for students and elected governing bodies to say the Pledge of Allegiance, if they choose. The Republican governor’s announcement comes after the Fargo School Board last week announced plans to stop reciting the pledge on the grounds that it doesn’t align with the district’s diversity code. Under current state law, governing bodies and schools can’t be required to recite the pledge. Burgum spokesman Mike Nowatzki said the governor’s aim is to ensure that those who wish to say it may legally do so. “America is the land of opportunity. And students in every public school in North Dakota, along with elected governing bodies and those who attend their meetings, should have the opportunity to recite the Pledge of Allegiance and express support for the American ideals upon which our country was founded,” Burgum said in a statement. “Our administration is creating a framework for legislation to guarantee that the opportunity exists to recite the Pledge of Allegiance, as other states have done,” the statement said. Burgum said he is working with state Sen. Scott Meyer of Grand Forks and state Reps. Pat Heinert of Bismarck and Todd Porter of Mandan to draft the legislation.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Ohio mothers who rely on Medicaid will now be eligible for up to a year of health coverage after the birth of a child, up from 60 days previously. Up to 21,000 low-income and disabled people annually will benefit from this change, said the Ohio Department of Medicaid, which announced the change before April but only received final approval from the federal government Tuesday. “We know that access to postpartum care not only saves lives but leads to better health outcomes for moms and their babies,” Maureen Corcoran, director of Ohio Medicaid, said in a statement. “Extending eligibility for a full year postpartum ensures women have access to critical services that impact maternal morbidity and mortality as well as the health of their baby.” Available coverage includes treatment for postpartum depression; medical care for chronic conditions such as hypertension or diabetes; breastfeeding resources; and nurse home visits. The change was initiated by state lawmakers in the previous state budget. Ohio suffers from one of the highest rates of infant mortality in the nation, at 6.9 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2019. The extended coverage, for now, will be available for a five-year period through April 2027.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt granted death row inmate Richard Glossip a 60-day stay of execution Tuesday while a state appeals court considers his claim of innocence. Stitt signed an executive order delaying Glossip’s execution for the 1997 killing of Glossip’s boss, motel owner Barry Van Treese, that was scheduled for Sept. 22. “This stay is granted to allow time for the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals to address a pending legal proceeding,” the order said. A Stitt spokeswoman declined to comment on the governor’s decision, which also means that a clemency hearing before the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board that was scheduled for next week will be delayed. Glossip asked the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals for a new evidentiary hearing following the release of an independent investigation by Houston law firm Reed Smith that raised new questions about his guilt. The firm’s report did not find any definitive proof of Glossip’s innocence but raised concerns about lost or destroyed evidence and a detective asking leading questions to Glossip’s co-defendant, Justin Sneed, to implicate Glossip in the slaying. Sneed admitted killing Van Treese but said he did so at Glossip’s direction. Sneed was sentenced to life in prison and was a key witness against Glossip.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state’s chief justice fired all the members of the Public Defense Services Commission on Monday, frustrated that hundreds of defendants charged with crimes and who cannot afford an attorney have been unable to obtain public defenders to represent them. The unprecedented action comes as Oregon’s unique public defender system has come under such strain that it is at the breaking point. Criminal defendants in Oregon who have gone without legal representation due to a shortage of public defenders filed a lawsuit in May that alleges the state is violating their constitutional right to legal counsel and a speedy trial. In a letter to the commission members, Chief Justice Martha Walters said that “it is now clear that it is time to reconstitute the current commission.” Oregon’s public defender system is the only one in the nation that relies entirely on contractors: Large nonprofit defense firms, smaller cooperating groups of private defense attorneys that contract for cases and independent attorneys who can take cases at will. But some firms and private attorneys are periodically refusing to take new cases because of the workload. Poor pay rates and late payments from the state are also a disincentive. The American Bar Association found that Oregon has only 31% of the public defenders it needs.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nBerwick: Two people remained in critical condition Tuesday after a car drove through a crowd at a weekend fundraiser for victims of a house fire, killing one woman and injuring 17 other people, authorities said. Of the 17 injured, two remained in critical condition in Geisinger Medical Center in Danville, while five others were listed as fair, a hospital spokesperson said. Ten other people had been released following treatment at several hospitals, state police said. Adrian Oswaldo Sura Reyes, 24, is charged with homicide in the death of 50-year-old Rebecca Reese, of Wilkes-Barre, at the fundraiser in Berwick shortly after 6 p.m. Saturday. He faces another homicide count in the slaying of his mother at their Nescopeck home minutes later. Police allege in a criminal complaint that Sura Reyes told investigators he was driving in Berwick after arguing with his mother. At the time, about 75 people were in a blocked-off parking lot outside the Intoxicology Department bar for a fundraiser to benefit victims of the Aug. 5 blaze in Nescopeck that killed seven adults and three children. Police say Sura Reyes told them he drove past, then turned and headed back “to drive through the crowd of people.” They allege that video corroborates his alleged statement to investigators that he “sped up into the crowd purposefully.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nEast Providence: A carousel that’s the last vestige of an amusement park next to the Providence River is spinning again after getting a new foundation. The Crescent Park carousel started running again Aug. 6 and will continue to operate Saturdays and Sundays between 12 p.m. and 6 p.m. until Oct. 10, as well as on three Fridays: Aug. 26, Sept. 23 and Oct. 21. Rides cost $2. Having sat closed since the start of the pandemic, as cleaning procedures would have damaged the antique horses, dragons and a camel, crews used the time to stabilize and then replace the carousel’s foundation. This month, as it cranked up again after the hiatus, the carousel gave 958 rides. Carousel Manager Tracy Johnson is training new staff members on how to operate the attraction. Caretaker Ed Serowik said he started working at what was then the Crescent Amusement Park as a child in 1948, setting up pins at the bowling alley before working the carousel in 1950. He is now one of the primary people conducting maintenance on the ride. “It’s exactly the same,” he said, looking up at the mirrors that ring the carousel.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A small group of state lawmakers have given their approval to a near-total abortion ban that does not include exceptions for pregnancies caused by rape or incest. The 3-1 vote Tuesday – all Republicans on a House subcomittee for it and the lone Democrat against – set up a showdown later in the day on whether to send the restrictive bill to the House floor. South Carolina currently has a six-week ban passed in 2021 that went into effect after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June. Republican lawmakers plan a special sessions over the next month to consider even more restrictions. The bill bans all abortions except when the life of the mother is in danger. It lists a number of different medical emergencies that would fit into the exceptions. The legislation still has a long way to go before it could reach Republican Gov. Henry McMaster, who has said he wants to see no abortions in the state. Opponents and supporters alike said the proposal could change considerably on its way through the General Assembly. Outside the House’s office building on Statehouse grounds, about a dozen demonstrators with Planned Parenthood South Atlantic gathered. They were outnumbered by law enforcement, who set fencing and barricades expected to stay up most of the week.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Final vehicle counts for vehicles entering Sturgis indicate traffic was up 2% from the past five years during the 10-day Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, according to the South Dakota Department of Transportation. A total of 502,835 vehicles entered Sturgis over 10 days, according to SDDOT. The previous five-year average was 492,535 vehicles. The first day of the rally on Aug. 5 had 11% more traffic than the past five years, according to SDDOT.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The Nashville Predators Foundation is teaming up on an event offering people gift cards, preseason vouchers and giveaways if they turn in guns to the city’s police. The NHL team says its foundation is partnering on the event Saturday at Greater Revelations Missionary Baptist Church. People can turn in guns to the Metro Nashville Police Department there with no questions asked. They can also drop off unused or expired medication that police will destroy. In seven Gift Card for Guns days since 2011, people turned in 658 firearms. It’s the first year the Preds Foundation has been involved in the event. Predators Vice President of Community Relations Rebecca King expressed hope that the initiative would make the community safer.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: As they consider pay raises for other city employees, the Austin City Council’s members this week are poised to give themselves a 40% pay raise – one some members defend as long overdue and more reflective of the hours they work. The topic will come up Wednesday as the council works on setting the city’s operating budget for the upcoming fiscal year. The money for the pay increase would come from the additional $20 million the city recently discovered for the council to spend in any way it sees fit. Several council members say there is enough money available not only to boost their pay but also to identify an estimated $5 million to $10 million needed to raise the minimum hourly wage for city employees to $20. In total, the council pay raises would cost the city’s taxpayers an additional $371,000 per year. “The dollar amount we’re talking about is very little in the scheme of things,” Council Member Ann Kitchen said. This year, Austin’s 10 district council members are each making $83,158 – about the same as a sixth-year officer with the Austin Police Department. The last time the council approved a pay increase for themselves was in 2006, when a council member made $57,736 and the mayor made $67,981. Since then, they’ve received only cost-of-living increases.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The Utah Democratic Party is suspending a longtime lawmaker accused of sexual misconduct from party-related activities at all levels and has called for state Sen. Gene Davis to step down from the Legislature. The decision, announced in a statement over the weekend, came after a former intern’s allegation exposed a rift in the party over its handling of sexual harassment. In prior statements, the party’s stance was that it couldn’t take action unless it received an official complaint, the Salt Lake Tribune reports. “Following Ms. Weglinski’s statement last week, party leaders and members of the Executive Committee spoke privately with Senator Davis,” Utah Democratic Party Executive Director Thom DeSirant wrote in the statement. “Though he denied specifics of the allegations in his interview with the Salt Lake Tribune, we believe the behavior he acknowledged, regardless of context or intent, was unacceptable. We requested he voluntarily step down.” University of Utah student Sonia Weglinski, a former intern who also worked on the senator’s reelection campaign this spring, said in an Aug. 3 Instagram post that Davis touched her in ways that made her feel uncomfortable on multiple occasions during the five months she worked with him.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The certification of last week’s primary election results in Vermont has been delayed by a technical issue, the secretary of state’s office announced Tuesday. The statewide and federal primary election canvassing was expected to take place Tuesday. The secretary of state’s office said a state software contractor has been unable to resolve a technology issue affecting the office’s ability to produce reports from votes submitted by town and city clerks. The process is separate from the official counting of ballots and local certification by town clerks, the office said, adding that the delay does not impact its 100% confidence in the accuracy of the vote totals reported by town clerks. “The Secretary of State’s mission is to provide a secure and accurate election. The office will always default to a delay to ensure integrity and confidence of the results when they are certified,” the office said in a statement.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: An author’s investigative effort to uncover the origins of a racist photo on Ralph Northam’s medical school yearbook page has ended inconclusively, according to the author, who has written a book that offers new details about the 2019 scandal and the former governor’s remarkable political survival. “Of course, I would like to have determined exactly who was in the photograph. And I gave that my best effort,” Margaret Edds, a retired journalist and the author of “What the Eyes Can’t See,” told The Associated Press ahead of the book’s November publication. Although Edds – like journalists and two groups of law firm investigators before her – did not arrive at any definitive answer about the photo of one person in blackface and another in a Ku Klux Klan costume, her 296-page book offers a behind-the-scenes look at the turmoil the image sparked. The book details Northam’s decision to remain in office despite tremendous pressure, as well as the steps he took to become better informed about the legacy of racism, redeem his reputation and work with Black leaders to sharpen his administration’s focus on racial justice. Northam participated in 14 interviews for the book. “What the Eyes Can’t See” also draws on interviews with Northam’s wife, staffers, consultants, friends and public officials.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The West Seattle Bridge will open Sept. 18, according to the Seattle Department of Transportation. The date is the most specific milestone set by the city since the bridge closed more than two years ago due to safety concerns, and it provides weary West Seattle travelers with a beacon of hope. The city previously set the week of Sept. 12 as its window for reopening the bridge but hedged the announcement with caveats about possible unanticipated hiccups in the final stretch of construction. The date provided Thursday reflects the progress crews have made in recent months, most notably the final post-tensioning of nearly 50 miles of new cable, which compress the span of the bridge to strengthen the concrete, The Seattle Times reports. The cables are anchored by concrete blocks capable of holding 20 million pounds of force. SDOT previously hoped to open the bridge in July, but a labor strike of concrete workers delayed progress. The 40-year-old bridge is among the city’s most important, previously allowing 100,000 drivers and 20,000 transit users to move between West Seattle and the rest of the city every day.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state Division of Motor Vehicles is making it easier for residents to get a REAL ID ahead of the May 3 federal deadline. The department recently announced a new online service that offers a guided path through pre-enrollment and cuts the time spent at the DMV, according to a news release. REAL ID Headstart allows applicants to verify their identities, upload required documents, and schedule their REAL ID appointments online. While the federal REAL ID Act requires documents be presented in person, a change is in progress. Once the act is amended, the DMV aims to enhance REAL ID Headstart so that no in-person visit is needed. Congress passed the Real ID Act in 2005 to establish minimum security standards for state-issued driver’s licenses and ID cards following a recommendation from the 9/11 Commission. The updated identification cards will be required for airport check-in and to enter federal facilities. REAL ID Headstart is available at dmv.wv.gov.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state can’t impose property taxes on tribal lands that have changed hands unless it gets congressional approval, a federal appeals court ruled Monday. The decision from a three-judge panel from the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals marks another chapter in a lawsuit four Chippewa tribes from northern Wisconsin filed in 2018. The Lac Courte Oreilles, the Lac du Flambeau, the Red Cliff and the Bad River sued after the state imposed property taxes on land within their reservations. Such land is immune from state property taxes under an 1854 treaty, but the state argued that the land is eligible because tribal members sold it to non-American Indians before the land was were sold back to tribal members. The three-judge panel affirmed that the land isn’t taxable without congressional approval, saying only Congress can diminish tribes’ sovereignty, and the treaty is best read to promise tax immunity even for reacquired lands.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: The tax incentives offered under the Inflation Reduction Act and a $2.5 billion infusion from Congress last year are spurring hopes of more carbon storage projects in the rolling prairie lands of northeastern Wyoming. Geologist Fred McLaughlin has been drilling nearly 2 miles into the ground, far deeper than the thick coal seams that make this the top coal-mining region in the United States. McLaughlin and his University of Wyoming colleagues are studying whether tiny spaces in rock deep underground can permanently store vast volumes of greenhouse gas emitted by a coal-fired power plant. The concept known as carbon storage has long been touted as an answer to global warming that preserves the energy industry’s burning of fossil fuels to generate electricity. One goal of McLaughlin’s project is to preserve the lifespan of a relatively new coal-fired power plant, Dry Fork Station, run by Basin Electric Power Cooperative. State officials hope it will do the same for the whole beleaguered coal industry that still underpins Wyoming’s economy. The state produces about 40% of the nation’s coal, but declining production and a series of layoffs and bankruptcies have beset the Gillette area’s vast, open-pit coal mines over the past decade.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/17"}, {"url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/12/09/paula-cooper-executioner-within/93650408/", "title": "Indiana killer Paula Cooper: The Executioner Within", "text": "Robert King\n\nrobert.king@indystar.com\n\nThis 13-chapter story, told as a real-life novel, raises questions about race, justice, poverty and abuse. But it is also the story about the human capacity for forgiveness and a young woman’s struggle to find peace.\n\nStill shrouded in darkness, she sat alone in her car, parked between night and day, between this world and the next.\n\nBehind her, a family of teddy bears sat strapped in by a seat belt. In the front seat next to her was a digital recorder. And a gun.\n\nShe picked up the recorder and clicked it on.\n\n\"This is Paula Cooper.\"\n\nA short introduction, a simple statement. Even though nothing had been simple about being Paula Cooper.\n\n\"I believe today is the 26th; 5:15 will be my death.\"\n\nShe saw it clearly now, even in the pre-dawn gloom. She'd spent so much of her life searching for peace. But early on the morning of May 26, 2015, the end was in sight. She would reach it before sunrise.\n\nShe just had a few things left to say.\n\n—\n\n\"My sister. My queen. My everything.\"\n\nEvery morning she spoke to Rhonda. Why should this morning be different?\n\n—\n\n\"My mother, I felt like you didn't love me. You didn't care about me. You cut me off. You judged me. You didn't want me at your church. You hurt me about the man I loved. But I still love you.\"\n\nOthers had forgiven Paula. Yet she never felt it from the woman who mattered most.\n\n—\n\n\"To Monica, I'm so sorry. This pain that I feel every day. I walk around. I'm so miserable inside. I can't deal with this reality.\"\n\nMonica had been like a godmother in the fairy tales — someone to fill the void in the absence of a mother's love.\n\n—\n\n\"LeShon, I love you. … You showed me how to love.You showed me how to be a woman.\"\n\nLeShon looked beyond Paula's past. As if it had never occurred.\n\n—\n\n\"Michael, I'm so proud of you. And thank you for apologizing.\"\n\nMichael was her first love. She wanted a life with him; he wanted something else.\n\n—\n\n\"Meshia … you helped me when I was down, but I explained to you better than anybody how I feel.\"\n\nMeshia knew Paula's pain; she'd just been unable to stop it.\n\n—\n\nThese were the people Paula loved most. And to each one she had revealed part of herself, but never the whole. It was a select list from a life populated by characters: Her brutal father and her innocent victim; the judge who condemned her and the man who forgave her. There were friars and a bishop and a pope; jailers and journalists; people who were zealous to save her life and people eager to end it. There were too many to consider, really. And the sun would be up soon. She could wait no longer.\n\n\"Forgive me,\" she said in a recording that would soon become part of a police investigation. \"I must go now.\"\n\nHer coda finished, Paula stepped out of the car and into the shadows. She took a seat against a blighted tree. She felt the breeze in her hair. She felt the gun in her hand.\n\nShe was familiar with death. She'd seen it up close. She'd been condemned to it, resigned to it and reprieved from it. She had debated its merits and come to terms with it. Never had she stopped thinking of it.\n\nBut the question that would vex those she was leaving behind was maddeningly simple.\n\nWhy, after all she had endured and all she had survived, after all she had done and seemed capable of doing, had she chosen to die now?\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nThe garden spot in the woods — where her father grew vegetables and beat his daughters — was only an occasional venue of torture.\n\nMore often, for Paula Cooper, it happened at home.\n\nAs a child, Paula went to bed night after night next to her sister, listening to their parents argue, listening to her father make threats to come after them. Sometimes her mother would talk him out of it. Sometimes the man's wrath ebbed and they fell asleep. Sometimes they would be jarred awake at 3 o'clock in the morning, her father standing over them, ready to beat them.\n\nPaula believed there were other kinds of families out there. She watched the people on \"The Cosby Show,\" and they seemed to have such a nice family. But that was television. This was real. This was her family. And it looked as if there was no escaping it.\n\n—\n\nPaula was born in Chicago to Herman and Gloria Cooper on Aug. 25, 1969. Her sister, Rhonda, was three years older. Early on, the family lived in Michigan City, but by the time Paula was old enough for school they had moved to Gary.\n\nThe girls attended Bethune Grade School, a stone's throw from home. They went to nearby New Testament Baptist Church, where Paula sang in the choir and helped with the little children's Bible classes.\n\nBy the late 1970s, Gary's downward spiral from a midcentury boomtown was picking up speed. Manufacturing jobs were disappearing. White families were fleeing to the suburbs. Crime was rising. Like many black families still in the city, the Coopers were left in the wake of all this.\n\nGloria worked as a lab tech at a hospital. She had an assortment of health problems, none of them helped by the drugs and booze she added to the mixture.\n\n\"One day my mother be nice, the next day she be angry,\" Paula would tell Woman's Day, years later, when her story was national news. \"And the next day she be real strange-acting.\"\n\nHerman worked for U.S. Steel and worked construction, but his employment was sporadic. He had a girlfriend on the side and would be gone for long stretches. When he returned, chaos followed. Herman and Gloria were a volatile pair, drinking hard and arguing often, creating an atmosphere that was not just unstable, but dangerous.\n\nThe result, as Paula would say later, was that the girls had to \"fend for themselves.\" Sometimes, on evenings when Herman was gone and Gloria worked late, Paula took meals with the next-door neighbors, who allowed her to stick around and watch TV. Most of the time the girls had food and nice clothing. But, as Rhonda would say later, \"we hardly ever had any love.\"\n\nExcept from each other.\n\nIn the middle of all the darkness, Paula and Rhonda clung tightly to each other. They found moments to giggle together, play pranks together and share secrets.\n\nMore than just a sister, Rhonda became Paula's caregiver. Yet, through their early years, they were unaware of an important family secret: Rhonda was the child of a different father. It was a secret Gloria took great pains to hide, even though she allowed Rhonda's father, Ronald Williams, to visit occasionally. She said he was her uncle.\n\nBefore Herman came along, Ronald and Gloria were engaged. They broke it off, as Williams would later tell a courtroom, because he felt Gloria had a \"split personality.\" In short, he thought she was crazy.\n\nLiving with Herman Cooper didn't help.\n\nHerman beat everyone in the house. He beat Gloria in front of the girls. He beat the girls together. He beat them separately, sometimes in front of their mother. Sometimes Gloria seemed to egg on the violence.\n\n\"We did everything we was supposed to do, but it just wasn't never good enough for her,\" Paula told Woman's Day many years later. \"… She get mad at us and he'd beat us. 'Be a man,' she'd tell him. 'Take care of it,' she'd say. And he'd take care of it.\"\n\nThe girls grew up unable to remember a time before the abuse. When they were little, Paula would later say, Herman beat them \"for the things little kids do.\" When they were older, Rhonda remembered, he beat them for forgetting to take out the trash, for not doing the dishes and for skipping school.\n\nHerman employed an assortment of tools for punishment, whatever he could get his hands on — shoes, straps, sticks, a broom. Sometimes he used an electrical cord from an air conditioner.\n\n\"He'd triple it up and go to work,\" Paula would say later. \"It got to the point I was so used to it I didn't cry anymore.\"\n\nTo heighten the pain, Herman sometimes ordered the girls to remove their clothes before a beating. Questioned later, he denied that he ever abused the girls at all.\n\n—\n\nThis stark picture of Paula Cooper's childhood emerges from several sources; the courtroom testimony from Rhonda and her father; testimony from Dr. Frank Brogno, a clinical psychologist who discussed what he learned from examining Paula. Some of the glimpses into the darkness come from now-yellowed news clippings. Others come from anecdotes Paula shared with friends and loved ones and the few journalists she favored. Finally, there's the freshest source of insight into Paula's world — more than 100 personal letters she wrote to a treasured friend that were reviewed by IndyStar.\n\nTaken together, they amount to a catalog of horrors. Her father's beatings, Paula said, left her \"close to death so many times.\" With no apparent means of escape, she seemed to stop fearing death at all. \"I just cried,\" she wrote, \"until all my tears were gone away.\"\n\n—\n\nIn 1978, when Paula was 9, the tears were still flowing. Her parents separated, but it was often fuzzy as to when they were back together and when they were apart. Once, when Herman returned home to find the doors locked, he forced his way in. According to testimony Rhonda gave in court, Herman entered their home, beat up their mother and raped her in front of the two girls.\n\nThe incident seems to have been a tipping point. Not long after, Gloria began telling her daughters the world had nothing to offer them. Instead, she said, they'd all be better off going to heaven. On this point, Rhonda would say later, Gloria began pressuring her daughters. Eventually, the girls came to believe, like their mother, they had nothing to live for.\n\nGloria phoned Ronald Williams, Rhonda's father and steady friend. It was late. She'd been drinking and taking pills. She was crying. Herman had been giving her problems, she said, and things weren't good at work.\n\nShe was thinking of killing herself.\n\nWilliams had heard this kind of talk from Gloria before. Always, he had been able to console her, to talk her back from the precipice. He reminded her that she had Paula and Rhonda to think about. What would happen to them? His question made Gloria think. But only for an hour.\n\nShe called Williams back. Between her tears and her wailing, Gloria said: \"I finally found out what I'm going to do with the kids.\"\n\nWilliams was alarmed. He demanded to know what she meant.\n\n\"I'm going to take them with me,\" she replied. \"I'm going to let you speak to your daughter and Paula for the last time.\"\n\nThe girls took the phone in turns. They were crying, too. Rhonda said they were going to heaven with their mother.\n\n\"Don't do nothing drastic,\" Williams told them. \"Let me speak to your mother, OK.\"\n\nThe phone went dead.\n\nWilliams panicked. Gloria and the girls had recently moved. She hadn't shared their new address. He didn't know where to find them, how to stop her.\n\nHe called the operator and asked for his last call to be traced; it was no good. He called Gary police. Without an address, they could do nothing.\n\nThere was nothing anyone could do. Williams waited. For three weeks, he waited. He feared what had become of them.\n\nHad Gloria killed them all?\n\n—\n\nAfter she hung up the phone, Gloria decided not to act right away; she'd wait until morning. When she awoke, Gloria took the girls out to the car in the garage. She put them in the back seat and started the engine. The garage door remained closed.\n\nFrom there, accounts differ. Williams testified that a friend told him neighbors noticed something and called the fire department. Rhonda testified that, as the fumes gathered, the girls drifted off to sleep. They thought they were going to heaven; instead, they woke up in bed. How they got there isn't clear. Rhonda said Gloria had changed her mind. When the girls awoke, she said, their mother was coughing on the lawn.\n\nFrom then on, Williams tried to coax Gloria into letting him have the girls. Rhonda was his daughter, and he was fond of Paula, too. Gloria would have none of it.\n\n\"I'd rather see them both dead,\" she said.\n\n—\n\nThe girls survived their first brush with death. But Paula and her sister were being shaped in a world without hope. And now their mother had planted a seed: The ultimate escape was death.\n\nRhonda looked around at this nihilist world and began seeking a way out. Several times she tried to run. Soon, she began taking Paula with her. \"I couldn't take it no more in that house,\" she would say, \"and I didn't want her to, either.\"\n\nBy 1982, when both girls were teenagers, they made an unsuccessful attempt to run and were sent — together — to the Thelma Marshall Children's Home in Gary. Within a short time, they were returned to the Coopers. For Paula, it was the beginning of a cycle — of running and being returned home. For Rhonda, that cycle ended only when she learned Ronald Williams was her biological father. At her first opportunity, she left the Coopers to live with him.\n\nIf the move helped Rhonda, it had grievous consequences for Paula, then 13. Her sister had been the most stable person in her home. Now she was gone. Paula came to believe her parents blamed her for Rhonda's departure. Now that her father's anger had one less target, Paula's beatings grew more frequent and more brutal. Even as her parents divorced, Herman never quite left the picture. And his handiwork began to show.\n\nAt school, Paula revealed to an administrator a rash of injuries — a bruise on her thigh, a welt on her arm, a rug burn on her elbow.\n\nWhen a welfare caseworker visited the Cooper home, Herman and Gloria cursed at her. They blamed Paula's problems on interference from the courts, from the school psychologist and from the welfare department itself. When the caseworker recommended family counseling, Gloria said she'd rather go to jail.\n\nAt various times, Gloria and Herman seemed to vacillate between wanting Paula and considering her a curse. Paula began running away on her own. After one attempt, welfare officials wanted to send Paula home, but her mother objected. If Paula returned, Gloria vowed to leave.\n\nOn another occasion, when Rhonda made a rare visit to spend a weekend with Paula and her mother, arguments ensued and Williams returned for Rhonda. He couldn't find her there, but he found Paula. She was crying so loudly he heard her without going in. Gloria, who stood in front of the house fuming about Paula, simply said: \"I'm going to kill that bitch.\"\n\nPaula emerged and, seeing Williams, ran to him and jumped into his arms. He asked her if her mother would really hurt her.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nWilliams told her to get in the car. Gloria charged out toward them and began to threaten Paula. \"I'm going to kill you and if I don't (Herman) will.\"\n\nWilliams considered it serious business to take Paula. He lived in Illinois and assumed it would be a crime to take a child across the state line without permission of the parents. He took her anyway. Gloria and other family members threatened to phone the police.\n\nAt his home, Williams asked Paula what she wanted to do. They talked about the logistics of her staying with him without her mother's permission. It would be impossible for her to go to school. Then there was the trouble Williams might face. With tears, Paula looked at Williams and said, \"It's best for me to go home … I don't want to get you in no trouble.\" Paula's respite lasted only a few hours.\n\nEven though he wasn't keeping Paula, Williams couldn't fathom returning her home. Instead, he just let her walk away. She was young, no more than 13, but Williams believed she was safer on the streets of Chicago than at home. Under scrutiny for making such a choice, Williams later told a courtroom he thought Paula was in danger there. \"I would rather see her in the street as a slut than for her mother to blow her brains out.\"\n\nFor several days, Paula survived on her own. Inevitably, she wound up back home.\n\n—\n\nBy 1983, when Paula turned 14, she stayed away from home as much as possible. She was smoking cigarettes and drinking. She smoked marijuana almost daily. Tall, but heavy, she took speed to lose weight. She tried cocaine. She skipped school routinely. She was sexually active. Years later, she would warn others against making similar choices. But for the moment, it was her life.\n\nAnd it was a rootless life. She spent six months at a children's home in Mishawaka and three months in a juvenile detention center. She was removed from one home after only six days after she threatened a staff member and another resident — with a knife.\n\nWith each new address, Paula changed schools. She attended four high schools without ever finishing the 10th grade. Her schoolwork, decent at first, nosedived. She called a teacher \"crazy,\" resulting in a suspension. She struggled to keep friends. She developed a reputation as a bully. All the while, Paula struggled to wake up in the mornings. When she was evaluated for the problem, a doctor at a local hospital asked if she ever thought of killing herself.\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied.\n\nFor that answer, she was sent to a mental hospital. Released four days later, she returned home.\n\n\"I told people I needed help and to talk, but all they did was move me from home to home,\" Paula would write a few years later. \"I didn't care about life or trouble or consequences at all.\"\n\n—\n\nPerhaps the pinnacle of Paula's abuse came, ironically, after her father visited Gary police seeking advice on how to deal with a wayward child. Paula was 14, and Herman Cooper couldn't keep her reined in. Frustrated, he asked the police what he should do with her. It was a family matter, they said; he should do what he thought was right.\n\nFor Herman Cooper, that meant one thing: another beating. But for what he had in mind this time, he'd need some privacy. He took Paula to a woody patch near a spot where he kept a garden. Paula had been there before; so had Rhonda.\n\n\"If you scream where I take you,\" he told Paula, \"no one will hear you.\"\n\nSeveral times in her life, Paula thought her father was going to beat her to death. This was one of them. \"He just kept beating me and beating me,\" she would tell the clinical psychologist, for what seemed like half an hour. Instead of the cord or a broom or a stick, this time Herman beat her with his bare hands.\n\nWhen he was done, Herman put Paula in the car to take her home. But as they drove through the darkening streets of Gary, Paula knew she couldn't go back there. Not when the possibility of more punishment lay ahead in the Cooper house of horrors.\n\nAs Herman pulled the car up to the house, Paula jumped out and took off running into the night. Running and screaming. Herman gave chase, but porch lights began to click on. Up and down the street, neighbors stepped out to investigate the commotion. The neighbors had seen this show before; it never seemed to end. This time, though, Herman retreated.\n\nPaula ran until she wound up where the night had begun — at the police station. She told officers there about the beating, told them she couldn't go home. At least not while Herman was around. The state pulled her away from the Coopers. It isn't clear from the record where she was placed. But soon, she was sent back home.\n\n—\n\nIn the summer of 1984, when Paula turned 15, she felt as lonely as ever.\n\nAdrift, Paula briefly took up with a guy she hoped might offer her a haven. Later, she would tell others he was a rough character who dealt drugs and treated her poorly. The one thing he did for Paula was leave her pregnant.\n\nMany teenage girls would consider pregnancy a tragedy; Paula saw it as a blessing. She had almost forgotten how to care about anyone. She wanted a family, wanted someone to belong to. The child growing inside her represented someone she could love, someone who would love her in return.\n\nAnd then it was gone.\n\nGloria had been dead set against the pregnancy; she wanted Paula to end it. Paula refused and ran off — perhaps to seek help from a woman she knew in Chicago. Her mother tracked her down and, as Paula would write years later in a letter and tell friends, forced her to have an abortion.\n\nPaula was several months into the pregnancy; the procedure nearly killed her. \"She took something that would have completed my life,\" Paula would write later, \"and after that I felt I had no one.\"\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nRuth Pelke was gentle, an old woman with silvery hair and horn-rimmed glasses. As her stepson Robert and his wife pleaded for her to leave Gary, she listened.\n\nRobert pledged to do everything necessary to make her house ready for sale — the legal stuff, the touch-up jobs, whatever. She listened as they talked to her about how dangerous her neighborhood had become.\n\nBut Ruth didn't really need reminding. Her Glen Park neighborhood was still one of the better places to live in Gary, although that wasn't saying much, given the city's downward lurch. There were abandoned houses now. There were burglaries. Her own home had been hit five times in recent years, including when her husband, Oscar, was still alive. Now, at 78, she was widowed and alone, and things were only getting worse. But Ruth had been in Glen Park for 41 years; it was home. She still had some good neighbors. Just as important, she had a mission.\n\nFor decades, she'd opened her home and heart to the neighborhood children. She'd taught them the Bible using felt cutouts of Bible characters that she stuck to a flannel board. She'd given the kids candy when they memorized Scripture. She'd driven them to church. She believed these were children who needed hope, and they could find it in Jesus. No, she finally said that night after her stepson's plea — she wouldn't be leaving the home in her neighborhood.\n\n\"I'll stay here until I go there,\" she said.\n\nRuth Pelke was pointing a finger to heaven.\n\n—\n\nThe next day, Tuesday, May 14, 1985, Ruth's doorbell rang.\n\nShe answered it and found three teenage girls standing on her porch. She didn't recognize them, but she opened her door. One of the girls said, \"My auntie would like to know about Bible classes. When do y'all hold them?\"\n\nRuth wasn't up to teaching anymore, but she wanted to help the girls. \"Come back on Saturday,\" she said. And closed the door.\n\n—\n\nThe girls — Karen Corder, Denise Thomas and Paula Cooper — walked back across the alley. Sitting on a porch, April Beverly was waiting.\n\nThe foursome — all ninth- and 10th-graders at Lew Wallace High School — left school at lunchtime that afternoon with no intention of going back. The girls walked the 10 blocks or so to an arcade near 45th and Broadway where they spent what little money they had on games and candy. When their money was gone, they headed back to the house where April was staying with her sister.\n\nThey were a ragtag bunch.\n\nAt 16, Karen Corder — known to her friends as \"Pooky\" — was the oldest. More than two years earlier, she'd given birth to a baby boy whom she'd delivered in a toilet. She'd managed to keep the pregnancy secret from her parents until the child was born, according to court records.\n\nAt 15, April Beverly was seven months pregnant. She was part of a divided family with 11 children, and she bounced between two homes, her father's and her sister's. Her mother was dead, her father had remarried. On occasion, April benefited from the kindness of the old lady across the alley. She'd listened to Ruth Pelke's Bible lessons. And the old woman had brought food over to April and her siblings when she was concerned they might be hungry.\n\nAt 14, Denise Thomas was the youngest of the four and the smallest. The others were mature young women — at different places on the spectrum of teen motherhood. Denise still looked very much like a little girl. In the context of this group, some would later describe her as a tag-along.\n\nAnd, of course, there was Paula Cooper. At 15, she was only months removed from an unwanted abortion that had nearly killed her. She was tall, somewhat heavy and had the bearing of a girl beyond her years. She would be described as the \"prime mover\" of the quartet — the ringleader. But it was a label she'd never cop to.\n\n—\n\nTo date, the sum total of their illicit behavior was strictly small-time. Karen had tried her hand at shoplifting. Paula, Karen and April had pulled off a burglary a few days before that netted them $90. Mostly, the girls were truants. And on this Tuesday afternoon away from school, their immediate priority was to raise some money so they could go back to the arcade.\n\nTheir first attempt was a harebrained scheme April cooked up to get some cash from a woman up the street. All four girls had gone to the woman's door. April introduced Denise, the small one, as her daughter. April claimed the woman's husband had taken $20 from Denise and they'd come to collect it. For added zest, April threw in this detail: The woman's husband had been naked when he stepped into the street to take Denise's money.\n\nThe woman didn't go for it.\n\nAfter that failure, April turned her focus to Ruth Pelke. She seemed to recall the lady keeping a jar of $2 bills. She thought the woman might even have some jewelry. The question was how to get to it all.\n\nAs they sat on the porch at her sister's house, April asked Paula to come inside — she might know where there was a gun. For the girls, a gun crime would be a considerable step up the criminal ladder. But the gun wasn't where April thought it was; she couldn't find it. Then it occurred to April: Something else might do.\n\n\"I have a knife you could scare the lady with,\" she said.\n\nSoon, April produced a 12-inch butcher knife. It was sharp and had a curving blade that graduated to a fine point. It was a cooking tool, but also a potentially lethal instrument. Paula took the knife and hid it in her light jacket. Out on the porch, she and April explained to the other girls: This was their new weapon of choice. And Karen came up with another approach to getting inside the old lady's home: They would ask her to write down the time and place where the Bible classes would be.\n\nIn all this planning, Paula and the other girls would forever swear, the subject of killing the old woman never came up. The most they would admit, according to Corder, was that they'd knock out the woman and rob her. Still, the reality of what they were planning — to con their way into her house, pull a knife and take the old woman's valuables — was fraught with danger.\n\nAs their scheme unfolded, April stayed back again, resting on her sister's porch; she didn't want the old woman to recognize her. Karen, Paula and Denise crossed the alley.\n\nThey rang the bell, and soon Ruth Pelke appeared at the door. This time, when she answered, Karen said: \"My auntie wants to know where the Bible classes are held at. Could you write it down for me?\"\n\nRuth said she no longer taught the classes, but she knew of a lady. \"I'll look up her telephone number for you.\" She invited the girls to come in. And she turned to walk to the desk on the far side of the room.\n\n—\n\nRuth Pelke looked for all the world like the kindly grandmother drawn up in children's books. She was also a woman whose Christian faith was essential to who she was. She went to church on Wednesday nights and twice on Sundays. She visited church members who were too old or too sick to get out. She sang in the choir. She hosted missionaries in her home on their trips back from foreign lands. She took her own missionary journeys, going deeper into the heart of Gary to share her faith with children.\n\nWhat followed — recorded in statements to police, testified to in court, reported in newspaper accounts and, in brief instances, described in letters Paula would write years later — was a scene that would shock Northwest Indiana and the rest of the state.\n\nAs Ruth Pelke crossed her living room to the desk where she kept phone numbers, she felt a pair of arms wrap around her neck.\n\nPaula had put her jacket on the couch and run up on Ruth, grabbing her from behind. For a moment, the teenager and the old woman struggled. Ruth still tended a garden and did a little work outside the house to keep fit, but she was in no shape for a chunky 15-year-old girl who now had her in a headlock.\n\nPaula threw Ruth to the floor.\n\nOn a table nearby sat an item some would describe as a vase but others likened more to a triangular snow globe. One of the girls picked it up and hit Ruth Pelke over the head. Prosecutors would allege it was Denise Thomas; Paula took the blame.\n\nPaula demanded to know where Ruth kept her valuables. She threatened to cut her with the knife. \"Give me the money, bitch,\" she said.\n\nRuth looked up and said simply: \"You aren't going to kill me.\" She began hollering for help. Paula's anger rose now. Then she looked at Ruth's head. Blood was streaming from the place where she'd been hit with the vase. Paula saw the blood and reacted in a way she would struggle to explain for the rest of her life.\n\nTo police investigators, she would say she entered \"a blackout stage.\"\n\nTo a judge, she would say, \"Something clicked in on me.\"\n\nTo a psychologist, she said the sight of the blood altered her perception of whom she was attacking: \"I saw somebody else inside of that body.\"\n\nSeveral friends and supporters who heard similar explanations from Paula concluded that, in this moment, Paula no longer saw the meek and mild Bible teacher in front of her. They believed Paula saw the woman who watched her suffer so many beatings and did nothing to stop them, the woman who took away the baby she'd wanted to love. They were convinced that, in the defenseless woman pinned to the floor, Paula saw her mother.\n\nWhatever she saw, Paula reached for the knife. She grabbed it by the handle and began slashing. She sliced open the old woman's cheek. She stabbed at her head, without deep penetration. Ruth fell back, flat on the floor. And Paula went to work, cutting her arms and legs.\n\nThe other girls stood by in disbelief.\n\nKaren Corder, the oldest, told Paula to stop.\n\nDenise Thomas, the youngest, cried and screamed for Paula to quit. Later, she would claim she yelled, \"I'm getting out of here,\" only to be met with a withering threat from Paula: \"Leave and you're dead.\"\n\nPaula's barrage was relentless. She stabbed the old woman in the belly and, finally, thrust the blade deep into the side of Ruth's chest. With that, Paula stopped; she pulled back from the carnage.\n\n\"I can't take it no more,\" she said.\n\nPaula looked at Denise; she told her to come hold the knife. But Denise refused. She looked at Karen, communicating the same message. Karen knelt beside the wounded woman. The blade remained lodged in her chest. And Karen held it in place.\n\nApril Beverly, who concocted the robbery scheme, initially held back. After the others went inside, she had come up to Ruth's porch and acted as lookout. Now she entered the house. The old woman was lying on her back, her dress covered in blood, her arms and legs still moving. Karen, she noticed, held the knife as it protruded from the woman's side. To April, it appeared that Karen wasn't just holding it: She was wiggling the knife back and forth. Out of some morbid curiosity, she would tell police later, Karen pushed the blade farther into the hole to see how deep it would go. At one point, she concluded, \"The bitch won't die.\"\n\nKaren estimated she held the knife in Ruth Pelke's side for upwards of 15 minutes; Paula thought it closer to 30.\n\nRuth Pelke moaned through most of this. The old woman's torn and tortured face was too much for the girls to bear. One of them went to the bathroom and got a towel to cover Ruth's face — and try to smother the last breaths of life from her. Paula and Denise said it was Karen; Karen said it was Paula.\n\nIn her dying moments, Ruth Pelke managed to share a few last words. Denise heard her saying the Lord's Prayer.\n\n\"Our Father, which art in heaven …\"\n\nPaula had stalked in and out of the room, and the last words she heard from Ruth were something else. Words that would haunt her the rest of her life.\n\n\"If you kill me,\" she heard Ruth say, \"you will be sorry.\"\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nPaula and Denise began tearing the house apart, rifling through drawers, ripping items off shelves and upending furniture.\n\nFor Paula, it was a mad search for some reward for the awful business she'd just concluded. There had to be some money somewhere. Maybe some jewelry. But as she continued her desperate search, a nervousness began to grow inside her. Whether it was regret for the killing or the chilling final words of her victim, she felt uneasy. And she didn't like it. As they were going through the upstairs rooms, Paula tried to pull herself away. But the only place to go was back downstairs, where the source of her angst lay dead on the floor. She resumed the treasure hunt and soon managed to turn up some cash — all of $10. She came across a key and thought it might start the old woman's Plymouth in the garage. She ran out to give it a try. Nothing.\n\nApril joined in the search and quickly turned up another key. This time when Paula tried it, the engine stirred to life. April went inside to fetch the other girls.\n\nBy then, Karen and Denise were alone with Ruth Pelke's body. Karen had watched the rise and fall of the old woman's chest until it grew shallower. Finally, it stopped. Maybe April sensed some new panic; she sternly warned the other girls: \"If you tell anyone, I'll kill you.\"\n\nThe girls had spent roughly an hour in the old woman's house. They hadn't found a jar of $2 bills. They hadn't found a trove of jewelry. But it was time to go. Someone might come looking. Before they could leave, Karen grabbed one last item.\n\nShe knelt down again beside Ruth. The butcher knife was planted firmly in the left side of her chest, just below her breast. Karen grabbed the handle. She pulled it out. As they headed out to the car, Karen carried the knife at her side. She climbed into the back of the car and dropped it to the floor. The blade was still coated in blood.\n\n—\n\nPaula Cooper was 15. She was too young to drive. But with her three accomplices as passengers, she managed to steer Ruth's car out of the neighborhood and onto 45th Avenue. They were just down the street from Lew Wallace High School. School was out now and, almost immediately, they saw a classmate walking along the street. Almost reflexively, they waved to Beverly Byndum. And Beverly waved back.\n\nThis was the paradox they now faced. They were teenagers in possession of a car, the apex of adolescence. Yet they had acquired it in the most horrific way imaginable. Years later, Paula would say things just \"got out of control.\" But here she was — a killer. Now that the deed was done, now that they had a few bucks, Paula and the others seemed in no mood to enjoy it.\n\nBefore they arrived at the video arcade, Karen asked Paula to let her out of the car; she wanted to go back to April's house. Paula let her go, but not before asking her to perform a little task: Go back to the old lady's house and get the jacket Paula had left inside.\n\nNext, Denise said she wanted to go home. She asked Paula to let her out at a convenience store and she would make her way from there.\n\nWhen Paula and April pulled up to Candyland Arcade, they were alone. For a few minutes, they just sat there, talking about what they'd done. April hadn't witnessed everything that went on inside the house. It's not clear how many of the missing details Paula shared.\n\nPaula said she needed to use the restroom, and she ventured into the arcade. When she returned, five girls from school were standing around the car. One of them was Beverly Byndum, whom they had passed on the street. Her sister, Latesha, asked where they had come by the car. Paula said it was her sister's.\n\nWithin minutes, Karen walked up to the arcade out of breath, as if she had been running to catch up with the crew. Wherever she had been, she hadn't stayed long. Paula pulled her aside and asked if she'd gone back to the house, if she'd picked up the jacket. No, Karen replied. It was probably the last place on Earth she wanted to go. And she didn't hang around long enough to talk further about it. In a few minutes, she caught a bus for home.\n\nWhether Paula remembered it or not, she had left more than her jacket in the house. Inside one of its pockets was a newly filled prescription for birth control pills — her pills. She had picked them up earlier that morning before school. It was just one of the clues she had left for investigators to find.\n\nPaula and April looked around at the girls and asked if anyone wanted a ride home. Eagerly, their friends piled into the Plymouth. Latesha Byndum was among those who jumped into the back. As she did, she felt her foot brush across something on the floor. She reached down to pick it up. It was a knife. And there was blood on it. There was also blood on her shoe. Latesha looked at Paula and April in the front seat and asked, \"What you all do? Just kill somebody?\"\n\nThe girls looked back at Latesha.\n\nNo, they replied.\n\nAnd, in a response that would reverberate across the community, Paula and April laughed.\n\n—\n\nPaula and April dropped off their passengers at various addresses around Gary. But details about where and how they spent their next two days are choppy and imprecise.\n\nProsecutors would characterize their time in the car as a joy ride. But from this point on, Paula and April seemed to have a different sense of what to do next.\n\nApril wanted to go to a park in Hammond; she wanted to see her brother Tony; she wanted to see her boyfriend. When she found $40 in Ruth Pelke's glove box, she wanted to spend it. When they picked up April's boyfriend and he brought some alcohol, she drank it.\n\nPaula wanted to go to a girl's home where she had lived for a time; she wanted to pick up some friends there. But she quickly decided she and April needed some time to focus on what to do next. When April found the money, Paula thought they should save it for gas. While April got drunk, Paula wanted nothing to drink. She was too nervous.\n\nMost symbolic of their division, perhaps, is what happened to the money from Ruth's glove box. The girls wrestled over it, and one of the $20 bills was torn. Paula gave up the fight. April could keep the money and do with it what she wanted.\n\n—\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the day after the crime, Robert Pelke phoned Ruth's house to check up on her. She didn't pick up the phone, and he decided to check on her in person. Just three days before, he and a large portion of the extended Pelke family had taken Ruth out for a Mother's Day dinner. Just two days earlier, Robert and his wife had pushed Ruth to think about selling her house and leaving Gary. Robert rang the doorbell, with no idea how prescient that conversation had been.\n\nThere was no answer, so Robert opened the mail slot on the door and called inside. There was only silence. But through the mail slot, something caught Robert's eye: The dining room was torn apart. He went to fetch a spare key Ruth kept hidden outside. Looking around the place, he noticed Ruth's car was missing from the garage, and he assumed Ruth must be gone, too.\n\nHe found the key, unlocked the door and stepped into the house. The place appeared to have been ransacked. Pictures that had adorned the walls were now scattered about the floor. Cushions from the couch had been pulled up and cast about. And then his eyes turned to the dining room floor.\n\nThe cloaked figure of a woman lay there motionless. Her dress was caked in blood. Her arms were slashed. A towel masked her face.\n\nRobert knelt down next to her. He pulled the towel away and called her name. Still, there was no movement. He touched her, and the body was cold. He knew she was dead.\n\nRobert got up and went for the phone. In an age when every phone was a landline, Ruth's had been ripped from its place on the wall. He stepped outside and began going door to door, looking for someone who would let him use their phone. But at house after house, he found nobody. Finally, Robert looked farther up the street and saw a man and a woman getting out of a car. He approached them and asked them to call the police.\n\nHis stepmother had been murdered.\n\n—\n\nRobert's son, Bill Pelke, arrived home just after 3 o'clock from his shift at Bethlehem Steel and soon received a phone call. It was one of his uncles. Nana, he said, was dead.\n\nNana was the term of endearment everyone in the family used for Ruth. Bill had grown up listening to her Bible stories. He'd loved her flannel board tales of the three men in the fiery furnace, of Noah and the ark and his favorite — Joseph and the coat of many colors.\n\nEven as a 37-year-old man, he still loved to go to Nana's house for the holidays, to warm himself beside her fireplace and congregate there with the rest of the family. His grandfather had passed almost two years before, but Nana was still a magnet. She could still bring the family together. And now, suddenly, she was gone.\n\nAt such moments of shock, the brain's processor goes into hyperdrive. And some key facts rushed through Bill's head: Nana had been 78; she was the oldest Pelke; she'd had a good life; it must have been her time. But that instant of comfort evaporated quickly. He sensed something else in his uncle's voice that was borne out in his next words: There'd been a break-in at Nana's house. He didn't know if there was a connection.\n\nBill hung up and turned on the television, wondering if there might be some news about it. Sure enough, his father appeared on camera. He was saying something about it being a terrible murder. For Bill, everything else was a blur; he had to go. He had to be with his family.\n\nAs it turned out, Ruth Pelke had been dead for a full day.\n\n—\n\nBy that spring of 1985, crime was a painful reality in Gary. Its murder rate was among the highest in the country. It was on its way to becoming the murder capital of the United States.\n\nGary was a city in decline; poverty was growing like a cancer. But the violence was being spread through an influx of gangs with names such as The Family and the Black Gangster Disciples.\n\nYet as accustomed to crime as the city had become, the murder of Ruth Pelke shocked and angered people in a whole new way. There was the innocence of Ruth herself — the elderly Bible teacher. As one observer put it, she was a grandma to the neighborhood. The killing's effect also might have been amplified because it happened in Glen Park, which a prosecutor later described as a \"last bastion\" of the white population in a city from which white residents had disappeared.\n\nOn the day after the discovery of Ruth's body, The Post-Tribune in Gary devoted two front-page columns to the story: \"Bible teacher, 77, murdered in her home.\" It had her age wrong, but the dominant image on the page was a picture of Ruth — silver-haired and smiling behind her horn-rimmed glasses from another era.\n\nThe newspaper reported that neighborhood children \"were visibly upset and shaken by the murder.\" They spoke of Pelke as \"meek and mild,\" serving cookies during summer Bible classes and giving out boxes of candy to the children who memorized Scripture.\n\nAs for who might be responsible, the initial story carried some important nuggets: Police were searching for a 15-year-old girl who'd been seen driving Pelke's blue Plymouth. They weren't releasing her name, but the girl was a student at Lew Wallace High and lived in Gary's Marshalltown neighborhood.\n\n—\n\nPaula Cooper lived in Marshalltown.\n\nAs they combed through Ruth's house, police found the jacket with the prescription in the pocket. Eyewitnesses had seen Paula and the other girls in a car that matched the description of Ruth's missing Plymouth. And on the day Ruth's body was discovered, Gloria Cooper phoned police to report her 15-year-old daughter missing; she'd been missing since the day before.\n\nThe ink was barely dry on the newspaper stories when Karen Corder, walking around school on Thursday, two days after the crime, began looking for someone on whom she could unload her conscience. She had opted out of the joy ride and gone home and had a couple of restless nights' sleep. She found a gym teacher who'd been nice to her and said they needed to talk; she'd witnessed a murder. Soon, police were at the school. They took Karen and Denise into custody. And Karen was telling her story about the crime.\n\nIn the two days since the killing, Paula and April — with April's brother, Tony — had driven aimlessly from Gary to Hammond and to various parts of Chicago's South Side. They'd had no real sense of direction.\n\nTony pressed on in Ruth's Plymouth until the gas needle dropped well below empty. Then he pushed it some more. Finally, the car died. Their money gone, they found a phone and called April's sister. Thursday night, with the police dragnet closing around them, she took the girls to see the Gary police.\n\n—\n\nDetective William Kennedy Jr. had been looking for Paula Cooper and April Beverly for the better part of two days. When his phone rang around midnight, the news was good: They'd turned themselves in.\n\nIn addition to being a cop, Kennedy worked security at Lew Wallace High School. He'd seen Paula Cooper walking the halls. He never knew her name, but they'd exchanged hellos. Now, he was tidying up the loose ends of a case for murder against her.\n\nWhen he arrived at the station, Paula's parents were waiting. Kennedy asked Herman and Gloria Cooper if Paula could make a formal statement about the crime. Herman, speaking for everyone, declined. They were interested in talking to a lawyer, and he seemed annoyed at the article in the morning paper, which he felt pointed a finger at Paula even if it didn't name her.\n\nThe Coopers met briefly with Paula, then returned to the waiting room. Soon, Rhonda arrived at the station. She'd read the papers. She knew Paula was in jail. And she was upset. She wanted to see her sister.\n\nGloria was OK with that but urged her to persuade Paula to talk about what she'd done. When the police wouldn't let Rhonda see her sister without a parent, Gloria agreed to go with Rhonda.\n\nAfter so many years of turmoil and strife, Gloria and her two daughters were together again — for a moment alone in a police interrogation room. What they said isn't clear. But when Kennedy, the detective, rejoined them, Gloria gave Paula a nudge.\n\n\"Say something,\" she said.\n\nPaula hesitated. She said she didn't want anyone looking at her. So Kennedy turned 45 degrees and looked at a wall. Paula began to speak. She kept speaking for 15 minutes. She laid out the essential elements of Ruth Pelke's murder, described the girls' desire for money and a car, described how they came up with the Bible class as their way in. She described how she got the knife and stabbed the old woman more times than she could remember. She talked about the aftermath, when they took the car and gave rides to their friends. At one point, according to the account the detective would later make from his \"mental notes,\" Gloria Cooper asked Paula in front of the detective: Were you and Karen basically responsible for the lady's death?\n\nPaula's answer: \"Yeah, you could say that.\"\n\nWhen Paula was done, Kennedy left the room. Her mother and her sister left, too. As Paula stood alone in the interrogation room, April Beverly was giving a statement in a room nearby. When Kennedy returned to Paula, she was newly animated. She began unloading a rapid-fire addendum to her confession to the detective.\n\n\"April is lying. She's lying on me, so I'm going to tell you where the murder weapon is. It's at the McDonald's in Hammond on Calumet Avenue, next to the police station. Her brother threw it out the car right by the drive-thru window side. It was by a tree right there.\"\n\nFor Paula, this was the start of one of the great grievances of her life — her claim that the other girls lied. A few details aside, their stories largely matched up. But in the discrepancies, Paula saw injustice. And correcting the narrative to fit her exact version of the truth would become an obsession.\n\nThe legal ramifications of what she'd shared, in her two statements, were that Paula had essentially confessed to the key elements of the murder. She had gift-wrapped a case for the authorities. She also had put herself in the cross hairs of a zealous prosecutor. She had no idea just how precarious her own life had become.\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nJack Crawford — with a swooping, blow-dried haircut that gave him an appearance not unlike the televangelists of the era — came before a bank of reporters with material certain to make a splash.\n\nA rising star in Indiana's Democratic Party, Crawford had swept into the Lake County prosecutor's job years before, having pledged to get tough on crime. Since then, he had pursued the death penalty more than any other prosecutor in the state. In the first five months of 1985, he'd already won four death penalty convictions.\n\nNow, flanked by a pair of cops, Crawford came before the gathered media with an announcement sure to make headlines: For the first time in Lake County, his office was charging four girls with murder. He would seek the death penalty against the oldest — 16-year-old Karen Corder — and if the other girls were moved out of juvenile court, he'd likely seek death for them, too.\n\n\"I've been a prosecutor for seven years,\" Crawford told the media, \"and we've never had a case like this before.\"\n\nAs zealous as he was, Crawford privately acknowledged that same day that his chance for death sentences had already taken a big hit. That's because the clerk's office announced that the judge handling the Ruth Pelke cases was Superior Court Judge James C. Kimbrough Jr.\n\nKimbrough was a former public defender and NAACP lawyer who'd grown up in the civil rights heartland of Selma, Ala. More important than all of that, everyone around the courts — from prosecutors and public defenders to reporters and clerks — knew Kimbrough hated the death penalty. Hated it for its unfairness. Hated it for its inability to deter crime. And in a county where other judges had shown themselves willing to brandish the ultimate weapon, Kimbrough hadn't sent anyone to the electric chair during 12 years on the bench. Only once had he come close: Kimbrough sentenced a man to death who had been convicted of a double murder. Soon, though, the judge reversed himself and gave the man a new trial. Eventually, he was set free.\n\nSo, at word of Kimbrough's assignment, Jack Crawford and his team murmured that the path to a death sentence was a steep one. \"We certainly thought we had an uphill climb,\" he would say later.\n\n—\n\nIn the Lake County Juvenile Detention Center, Paula Cooper's life behind bars was getting off to a rough start.\n\nShe was no stranger to jail, having spent three months in the same detention center two years earlier after she ran away from home. She was a bit weepy then, even tender, the guards remembered. But this 15-year-old version of Paula Cooper was angrier, explosive and cocky. She acted as if she owned the place. She was a handful.\n\nTwo weeks after the crime, Paula took a seat next to two of her friends in the jail during \"quiet hour.\" Soon they grew noisy. A guard told them to shut up and disperse; Paula refused. The guard ordered her back to her cell. But as she stepped into the hall, Paula struck the guard across the bridge of the nose. She fought until reinforcements arrived to pull Paula off. As they were dragging her away, Paula issued a warning: They'd better transfer the guard or she would get a knife and come after her.\n\nThe dust-up prompted a transfer for the girls — from the juvenile center to the Lake County Jail. It also made the local papers, which didn't help the cause of saving their lives.\n\nBy the end of July 1985, the cases against all four girls were formally moved to adult court. Crawford, after sifting through the ample evidence, made his purpose clear: He would seek the death penalty against all four.\n\nThe case had pricked the public's consciousness of crime at a new level.\n\nCrawford's decision made news on the Chicago television stations; it made headlines across Indiana. The public defender assigned to represent Paula, Kevin Relphorde, was incredulous. \"They must be the youngest females in the country facing the death penalty,\" he told reporters.\n\nBy then, Paula and Karen, sharing a cell in the Lake County Jail, had been locked up two months. They began telling jail staff they were considering suicide. On cards they were given to report health problems, they wrote things such as \"Give me the electric chair\" and \"Give me that shock. I want to die.\"\n\nAs a precaution, jail officers took their personal belongings and stripped them to their underwear; they were on suicide watch.\n\nPaula and Karen responded by banging on the bars and making noise. To calm them, a nurse broke out the oral sedatives. Karen took hers; Paula refused. The guards teamed up to hold down Paula so the nurse could give her a shot. But as they tried to restrain her, Paula jumped up and hit one guard in the shoulder.\n\n\"Oh you tough, huh?\" the guard replied. \"You stabbed an old lady.\" It was less than professional, but it was a gut reaction.\n\n\"Yeah, I stabbed an old lady,\" Paula replied. \"And I'd stab that bitch again. I'd stab your fucking grandmother.\"\n\nThe jail incidents were part of a pattern to be repeated in years to come. Paula didn't respond well to restraints; she bucked authority. In such instances, she could be aggressive and hostile. A psychologist noted her tendencies and something else plain to see: Battered and badgered as a girl, she was now mistrustful and suspicious.\n\nSoon, Paula's interaction with the jail staff would grow more complicated. By August 1985, about the time she turned 16, Paula began receiving a series of private visitors. Two were male corrections officers. Another was a male recreational therapist. They weren't visiting just because of their jobs.\n\nThey were coming for sex.\n\n—\n\nOutside the jail, the stories about the angry young prisoners seemed only to add to the public's contempt. And as the details of their crime emerged, they were already easy to hate. Especially the girl who had wielded the knife — Paula Cooper.\n\nPaula had not just killed Ruth Pelke; she had stabbed her 33 times, according to the coroner. Some of the cuts on her arms looked like saw marks, as if the knife had been pulled back and forth. In other instances, the 12-inch knife had been wielded with such ferocity that the tip of the blade went through Ruth's body, pierced the carpet on which she lay and chipped the wood flooring beneath. Worst of all, it appeared Ruth Pelke survived the torturous assault for more than 30 minutes. The Post-Tribune called it \"possibly the most brutal killing in Gary history.\"\n\nIf all that wasn't bad enough, two of the girls had bragged about the killing at school. As defendants go, they were about as unsympathetic as they come. With guilt hardly in doubt, letters began appearing in the Gary newspaper debating the punishment. Some asked for mercy; others wanted severe justice. One letter directed at Paula appeared under the headline, \"She should pay.\"\n\nAll of it left Kevin Relphorde, Paula's lawyer, searching for a viable strategy to save Paula's life. The evidence was overwhelming, and the prosecutor was determined, which made a plea deal unimaginable. Paula's childhood had been bad, but it didn't seem to add up to an insanity plea. Her youth and relatively clean prior record were assets, but they looked meager compared to the brutality of the crime. Then there was the jury. Any panel drawn from across Lake County would be mostly white. And Paula was a black teenager who had killed an old white woman. All of it added up to a grim outlook.\n\nAs best as Relphorde could figure, the only thing Paula had going for her was the judge. Relphorde knew of Kimbrough's opposition to the death penalty. Ultimately, he suggested to Paula a stomach-churning strategy: Plead guilty.\n\nRelphorde was a part-time public defender who'd never handled a death penalty case. But he figured Paula's chances were better in the hands of a liberal judge than with 12 angry jurors.\n\nAs risky as it sounded, Relphorde wasn't the only person who sized things up the same way. David Olson, who was Karen Corder's attorney, came to a similar conclusion. He'd had a nightmare about Karen, he told the Post-Tribune in March 1986, and awoke fearful of \"losing her.\" His fears were amplified when he attended the trial of Denise Thomas, the first suspect to answer for the death of Ruth Pelke.\n\nJust before the case against Thomas went to trial, in November 1985, prosecutors withdrew the death penalty charge, concluding she'd been more of a bystander to the crime.\n\nBut that didn't stop the jurors from reacting strongly to the horrific details of Pelke's death. They quickly found Denise guilty. Olson didn't want to risk that with death on the line for his client. So in March, 10 months after the crime, Karen went before Kimbrough with a guilty plea. Her sentencing would follow two months later.\n\nHow well Paula understood the risks of her plea — and how much say she had in it — is now a matter of dispute. Relphorde said he met with Paula regularly to talk strategy and that the plea was ultimately her decision. Years later, Paula would recall only three brief meetings with her attorney, who she said assured her the judge opposed the death penalty and would be sympathetic to a black girl. If she pleaded guilty, she said she was told, she wouldn't get a death sentence.\n\nOn April 21, 1986, Paula appeared in court to plead guilty to murder.\n\nHerman Cooper came to the courtroom that day; so did Paula's sister, Rhonda. But Gloria Cooper, Paula's mother, was nowhere to be found. She had moved to Georgia and stopped answering the calls of Paula's attorney.\n\nWhen the hearing began, Kimbrough asked Paula more than once if she knew she could be sentenced to death. Each time, Paula answered yes. To the most important question — How do you plead? — she never hesitated: Guilty.\n\nFor the record, Paula retold the story of the crime — the scheme to get into the house; what she did to Ruth; how the girls took the car.\n\n\"We went to commit a robbery, you know,\" she told the judge.\n\nWas there any discussion in advance about what you'd do with Mrs. Pelke? he asked.\n\n\"No. It wasn't a discussion to go and kill anyone, you know.\"\n\nKimbrough accepted the plea. Paula's life was now in his hands. But she would have to wait months for an answer. Relphorde left convinced Paula had made her best play: \"We were basically throwing ourselves on the mercy of the court.\"\n\nPaula's strategy seemed to appear sound when, in May 1986, Kimbrough spared Karen Corder's life, giving her 60 years in prison. In fact, three of the girls had escaped with their lives. Denise Thomas, found guilty at trial, received a 35-year sentence. April Beverly, who conceived the robbery but waited outside during the killing, pleaded guilty in exchange for a 25-year prison term.\n\nOnly Paula's fate remained unresolved.\n\nLost in the news of Corder's reprieve, perhaps, was some language the judge used in reference to Paula. It seemed ominous. Kimbrough said it had been \"conceded by all that Paula Cooper was the leader of this group of four young ladies. That Paula Cooper was the dominant factor in the crime.\" He said Corder was \"operating under the substantial domination of Paula Cooper.\" Despite such words, the prevailing view in legal circles was that Kimbrough would spare Paula's life.\n\n—\n\nAs her judgment approached, there were hints that Paula Cooper's case was starting to resonate beyond Indiana. Jack Crawford's first clue came when his secretary stepped into his office with an unusual message: \"There's a man outside who says he's from the Vatican. He's dressed like a monk and wants to talk to you about Paula Cooper's case.\"\n\nCrawford took a look. Sure enough, in a brown tunic bound at the waist with a cord, there stood a Franciscan friar. He told Crawford he was from Rome. He offered a letter validating his credentials. And he brought a simple message: Pope John Paul II and the Vatican weren't pleased with Crawford's decision to seek the death penalty.\n\nCrawford was Roman Catholic. He'd gone to Notre Dame. He knew the church's opposition to the death penalty. But, as he explained to the friar, this was a legal decision, not a religious one. The friar left unsatisfied. He would not be the last Franciscan to stand with Paula.\n\nMore surprising than the friar's appearance was the visit Crawford received in June 1986 from Paula's attorney, Kevin Relphorde.\n\nIt was just weeks before Paula's sentencing, and Relphorde had few cards to play in Paula's defense. This time, though, it appeared he might have a game changer.\n\n\"You can't execute Paula Cooper,\" he said.\n\n\"Well, why is that, Kevin?\" Crawford asked.\n\n\"She's pregnant.\"\n\n—\n\nThe sex scandal at the Lake County Jail erupted in June 1986.\n\nFor months, corrections officers Vernard Rouster, 25, and Parmaley Rainge, 27, had been coming to see Paula for sex, officials discovered. So, too, had Michael Dean Lampley, a recreational therapist from a mental health center. Their encounters occurred even as a 40-year-old female corrections officer and a police patrolman were supposed to be maintaining security for the state's highest-profile murder suspect.\n\n—\n\nOne of the guards admitted the sex began when Paula was still a week shy of 16 — the age of consent in Indiana. That people working in the jail were having sex with a captive wasn't illegal in Indiana in 1986. After the revelation, the jail workers resigned their jobs and the therapist was fired, but no one was prosecuted. Supervisors on the jail floor were suspended — for 15 days.\n\nFor all of its tawdriness, the scandal had the potential to affect Paula's case. State law prohibited the execution of a pregnant woman; punishment would have to wait. And while a death penalty appeal was certain to outlast a pregnancy, the strange episode raised the possibility of a sentencing delay.\n\nKimbrough ordered a medical exam for Paula. Quickly, the matter was put to rest: She wasn't pregnant. But, in a sign of the times, public discussion about the scandal seemed to focus less on the culpability of the jailers than on the promiscuity of the 16-year-old girl in jail.\n\nJames McNew, a deputy in Crawford's office who prosecuted the case, told the Post-Tribune he suspected Paula Cooper tried to get pregnant to stir up sympathy and avoid death.\n\nHowever it came about, the sex scandal prompted a change in state law: It became a crime for jailers to have sex with their prisoners. Soon, though, the jailhouse sex scandal would become little more than a footnote before a judgment heard around the world.\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nBill Pelke sat on the wrong side of the courtroom.\n\nHis grandmother was the murder victim. Unwittingly, Bill took a seat on the side of the murderer. He was unfamiliar with the trappings of the courtroom. And unlike some in the community — in his own family — Bill carried no blood lust into the chamber. He thought people who committed murder should die. And Paula Cooper had killed his beloved Nana. But he wasn't fuming about it.\n\nBill had stayed away from the previous court hearings, but decided this was one he shouldn't miss. It was July 11, 1986. And for Paula Cooper, it was judgment day.\n\nCourtroom 3 of Lake Superior Court was a small space. The gallery, oriented outside a circle where the business of the court was conducted, had seats for just 43 onlookers. This day, it was packed to overflowing. People stood, straining to hear, just outside the public entrance. Lawyers and other court personnel did the same just outside the doors normally used by the judge and juries. All wanted to know the fate of a 16-year-old girl who faced a potential death sentence.\n\nInto this cauldron, Paula Cooper entered under the escort of a jail matron. She didn't need to look around to see she had few friends in the room. Her sister and her grandfather were there, but neither of her parents was present. Her mother had moved to Georgia, her father to Tennessee. As Paula entered, the matron said something that made the young defendant smile. The gesture surprised Bill Pelke; it struck him as unbefitting for the moment. When this day is done, he thought to himself, she's not going to be smiling.\n\nDeputy Prosecutor James McNew began the proceedings by calling Bill's father to testify. Robert Pelke hadn't missed a hearing — for Paula or any of the other girls. He had been the family spokesman, and he wanted a death sentence for Paula. He described going to Ruth Pelke's home when she hadn't answered the phone, finding her home in disarray and her body on the floor. He described her bloody dress and the towel wrapped around her head. When the attorneys finished questioning him, Robert asked to read a statement to the court.\n\nThis, Robert Pelke said, was a crime that deserved the maximum sentence the law would allow. He quoted the Bible about submitting to authorities and God's vengeance and punishing evildoers. He said Paula gave Ruth no second chance, and he saw no reason to give Paula one.\n\n\"Paula reveled in her doings and enjoyed it,\" he said. He spoke of ridding society of those who would prey upon the innocent. \"This is a tragedy that should never have happened,\" he said, \"and a tragedy that family and friends will never forget.\"\n\nNext, one of the girls from Lew Wallace High School testified about seeing Paula and the others on their joy ride and about finding the bloody knife on the floor of the car.\n\nA crime lab technician discussed grisly photos from the scene — pictures of Ruth Pelke, of the knife-torn carpet and the gouge marks in the hardwood floor.\n\nThe prosecution introduced into evidence the autopsy report, which expressed the damage done by the 33 stab wounds. There was also an anatomical diagram noting the points where Ruth had been wounded — so many it looked like a star chart.\n\nJailers who had been attacked and threatened by Paula detailed her bad behavior; they recounted her admission about stabbing \"an old lady.\"\n\nEntering into evidence the grisly details of the crime and the accounts of Paula's callous behavior was part of the prosecution's effort to build a case that the only just punishment was death.\n\nIn Paula's defense, only three witnesses spoke.\n\nRhonda Cooper gave a picture of how she and Paula grew up terrorized in the home of Herman Cooper. She testified to the beatings, to their father's raping their mother in front of them, to their mother's suicide attempt and to their attempts to run away.\n\nRonald Williams, Rhonda's biological father, testified that he wanted to take Paula away from the misery, but her mother refused. He spoke of Gloria's threats against Paula and of the suicide attempt.\n\nDr. Frank Brogno, a Gary psychologist who examined Paula, described how Paula's abuse left her angry and confused, depressed and hostile. He said she was prone to confusion and bizarre thinking, even drifting into fantasies. Still, he said, Paula knew right from wrong. There was still hope for her, but also a real danger she could become a sociopath.\n\nMcNew, on cross-examination, ripped into the doctor. He pointed out how Brogno had testified in Karen Corder's case that Paula was the \"prime mover\" in the crime.\n\n—\n\nRelphorde made a plea for Paula's life, saying she had gone to Ruth Pelke's home to rob, not kill. He said the other girls were intensely involved in the crime and their lives had been spared. The death penalty, he said, was applied at the whim of prosecutors. He said Ruth Pelke, a woman of faith, wouldn't want Paula to die. In the end, he said, Paula was the handiwork of an abusive home and a system that failed her.\n\n\"I don't think Paula was born violent,\" he said. \"I think Paula was a product of what was done to her.\"\n\nMcNew, closing the prosecution's case, checked all the boxes needed for a death sentence: Paula wasn't crazy. She wasn't doing someone else's bidding. She'd struck the death blows. She had a criminal record, as far as a juvenile goes, for skipping school and running away from home. And Paula's abusive childhood? To use that for an excuse, McNew said, was to insult everyone who has endured similar treatment and found a way to overcome the horrors. Giving Paula the death penalty, McNew said, would have a sobering effect on others who might be considering crime. But McNew said there was one reason, above all, for a death sentence.\n\n\"I am not seeking a deterrence to crime when I ask the death penalty on Paula Cooper. I seek justice for the family of Ruth Pelke.\"\n\n—\n\nWith the attorneys done, Kimbrough asked Paula if she had anything to say. And Paula did not shrink from the moment.\n\nShe hadn't wanted a trial, Paula began; she only wanted to tell the truth. \"Now my family life, it hasn't really been good. … Nobody understand how I feel.\"\n\n\"This man,\" she said, pointing to the prosecutor, \"sit here and say he want to take my life. Is that right? I didn't go to Mrs. Pelke's house to kill her. It wasn't planned. I didn't go there to take somebody's life. It happened. It just happened. Something. It wasn't planned. We didn't sit up and say we was going to go and kill this innocent old lady. I didn't even know the lady. But everybody put the blame on me.\"\n\nShe said Jack Crawford had described her in the newspaper as the ringleader. \"I wasn't the ringleader. I didn't make those girls go,\" she said. \"They went on their own.\"\n\nLooking around at the people in the courtroom, Paula seemed disgusted. \"Well, where was all these people at right here when I needed somebody? Where was they at? They turned their backs on me and took me through all this. All I can say is now, look where I am now, facing a possible death sentence.\"\n\nShe pointed at the Pelke family and repeated her plea that killing wasn't her intention. \"I hope you all could find some happiness in your hearts to forgive me. And I know your mother was a Christian lady, and she is in heaven right now. I read my Bible. How do you think I feel? I can't sit here and tell you I understand how you feel because I don't.\"\n\nShe acknowledged that \"sorry\" would never be good enough.\n\nPaula looked to Judge Kimbrough. But, as Bill Dolan would report in the Post-Tribune the next day, the judge \"didn't return her gaze.\" \"I don't know what the decision is going to be today, or whenever you make your decision. I know justice must be done. And whatever the circumstances, or whatever your decision is, I will accept it, even if it is death.\" She acknowledged she couldn't change what happened: She hoped to get out one day and start life over, maybe even finish school.\n\n\"Will I have a chance?\" she asked. \"Will I get a chance?\"\n\nFor a couple of minutes, Paula rambled. She repeated that she hadn't forced the other girls to act; she felt it important everyone know she wasn't a gang member. Then she reined it back in for one final thought: \"I am sorry for what I did. And I know my involvement in this case is very deep. But all I can ask you is not to take my life. That is all I can ask you. That is all I can ask is to spare my life.\"\n\nSuddenly, a commotion broke out in the courtroom. There was shouting in the gallery. \"My grandbaby, my grandbaby.\"\n\nBill Pelke looked at the wailing man near him and saw the tears run down his cheeks; the visage burned into Bill's memory. He watched the man as the bailiff escorted him out of the courtroom.\n\nIt was Paula's grandfather, making one final plea on Paula's behalf.\n\nNow it was up to the judge.\n\n—\n\nJudge James C. Kimbrough had been wading through the sordid details of Ruth Pelke's murder for more than a year. He'd parsed the depressing narrative, and people had speculated whether he had a death penalty in him, especially for a girl. Now they were about to get their answer.\n\nThere was no doubt about Paula Cooper's guilt. Kimbrough dispatched that with his first breath. The murder had been disturbing: Paula had inflicted the 33 stab wounds in the body of 78-year-old Ruth Pelke.\n\nThose were the strikes against her.\n\nBut the defendant had no prior criminal history, and she was 15 at the time of the crime.\n\nThose were factors to consider on her behalf.\n\nThe other requirements for the death penalty, Kimbrough said, didn't work in the defendant's favor. She acted of her own free will. She wasn't under the influence of drugs. Her mental problems didn't rise to the level of incompetence. But all those things, Kimbrough said, were legalities. Ultimately, he said, death penalty cases boil down to a \"political utterance.\"\n\n\"This case has received an unusual amount of publicity,\" Kimbrough said. \"There is worldwide interest in the outcome of these proceedings today. And the court is certainly aware of that interest.\"\n\nWhen he left law school in 1959, Kimbrough said, he had been \"totally against\" the death penalty — and most of the country shared the view.\n\nNearly 30 years later, he said, public sentiment had changed, perhaps because of the violent activities of people such as Paula Cooper. Now, the vast majority of the public favors the death penalty, Kimbrough said, Normally, he wrote out his sentences in advance. But this case had challenged him to the point he'd been unable to do so.\n\nKimbrough praised the deputy prosecutor for speaking \"eloquently\" — he said McNew brought the matters into focus \"better than all of the turmoil that I have been through in the last several months.\"\n\nHe criticized state law for being too general when it came to giving minors the death penalty. It left him unsure what to do on that fundamental question. \"I don't know what the right political answer to that question is.\"\n\nThen Kimbrough, in a moment of vulnerability judges don't always reveal, showed some insight into his restless mind. \"I don't believe I am ever going to be quite the same after these four cases. They have had a very profound effect on me. They have made me come to grips with the question of whether or not a judge can hold personal beliefs which are inconsistent at all with the law as they were sworn to uphold. And for those of you who have no appreciation of it, it is not a simple question. It is not a simple question for me.\"\n\nKimbrough interrupted his confessional to take issue with something Robert Pelke said: \"I do not believe the failure to impose the death penalty today would be unbiblical. … I don't profess to be an expert in religion. But I know the Bible has passages which are merciful, and do not demand or mandate an eye for an eye.\"\n\nReturning to his inner turmoil, Kimbrough said he'd concluded that a judge must decide a case based on facts, regardless of whether it satisfies him. \"I will tell you, very frankly now, on the record, that I do not believe in the death penalty.\"\n\nThis seemed to launch Kimbrough on a rant. \"Maybe in 20 years, after we have had our fill of executions, we will swing back the other way and think they are unconstitutional. Maybe.\"\n\nAt about this point, Jack Crawford, sitting at the prosecutor's table, was ready to give up hope for a death penalty. He turned to McNew, he remembered later, and whispered into his ear.\n\n\"He's not going to give it.\"\n\nThen Kimbrough directed his eyes to the girl awaiting his judgment.\n\n\"Stand up, Paula.\"\n\nShe had stabbed Ruth Pelke 33 times, he said. He was concerned about her background. She had been \"born into a household where your father abused you, and your mother either participated or allowed it to happen. And those seem to be explanations or some indication of why you may be this type of personality that you are.\"\n\n\"They are not excuses, however.\"\n\nHowever.\n\nThat word caught Crawford's attention. So did the fact that Kimbrough's shoulders seemed to slump, as if the weight of the moment was getting to the judge. Crawford leaned in and whispered again to McNew.\n\n\"I think he's going to give it. I think he's going to give it.\"\n\nKimbrough continued.\n\n\"You committed the act, and you must pay the penalty,\" Kimbrough said. Briefly, he trailed into some legalese about the charge. Then he gathered himself for the final judgment.\n\n\"The law requires me, and I do now impose, the death penalty.\"\n\n—\n\nThe courtroom erupted.\n\n\"What did he say?\"\n\nPaula Cooper looked at Kevin Relphorde for help; amid the chaos, she wasn't sure what had just happened. She looked back for the judge; he had already left the bench. She asked Relphorde what had happened. He delivered the verdict again: He gave you the death penalty.\n\nThe smile Paula wore into the courtroom was gone, indeed. Bill Pelke took note of that. Instead, he saw a river of tears streaming down her cheeks. As she was led from the courtroom, the tears soaked the top of her blouse.\n\nJust like that, Paula Cooper — at 16 years, 10 months and 16 days — became the youngest person ever sentenced to death in Indiana; she was now the youngest female on death row anywhere in the United States. In this age before the cellphone, news reporters from national outlets raced out of the courtroom to the nearest bank of pay telephones. It took a few hours, but the verdict soon circled the globe.\n\nIn the hallway outside the courtroom, Rhonda Cooper yelled in anguish at members of the Pelke family and the prosecutors nearby.\n\n\"Are you satisfied now?\"\n\nThey seemed satisfied.\n\nStrangely, one of the most unsatisfied people in the building was the source of the commotion: Judge Kimbrough.\n\nAfter delivering the verdict, he darted out of the courtroom and into the hallway leading to his chambers. There, between the two rooms, he spotted William Touchette, a public defender who handled appeals. Kimbrough told Touchette to follow him.\n\nTouchette (pronounced TOO-shay) had been among those outside the courtroom straining to hear the proceedings. Like so many local lawyers, he was friendly with the judge; they'd socialized outside of work. He followed Kimbrough into his chambers.\n\nThe judge was angry. As angry as Touchette had ever seen him. Angry that the defense hadn't given him enough to spare Paula Cooper's life. Then Kimbrough uttered seven words Touchette would never again hear from a judge.\n\n\"I want you to get me reversed.\"\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nPaula Cooper's death sentence was one of Indiana's biggest news stories in 1986. It garnered network television news coverage. Once it hit the international news wires, it was picked up by newspapers in Europe, where it inspired protests.\n\nBut Monica Foster, working for a nonprofit death penalty defense group in Downtown Indianapolis, somehow missed all that. To her, it was as if the Paula Cooper case had never happened.\n\nIt wasn't that Foster was uninterested in current events or that she was dull. In fact, Foster was a wunderkind. She'd graduated from high school at 16, college at 19 and law school at 22. She'd come to work for the Indiana Public Defender Council, researching and offering advice to lawyers with death penalty cases, even before finishing her law degree. But at 27, she had a tendency to get absorbed in her work. And when that happened, the outside world ceased to exist.\n\nSo when William Touchette, the Lake County attorney preparing Paula Cooper's appeal, called the council looking for some help, Foster knew nothing of the case. Without hesitation, Foster agreed to be Touchette's local connection to Paula, who was being held at the Indiana Women's Prison on the city's east side. Foster even said she'd donate her time, seeing the client on evenings and weekends, as a sideline.\n\nFoster didn't realize she'd just signed on to the case that would become the most noteworthy of her career.\n\nWhen the case file arrived in her office, Foster began reading about Paula Cooper. Right away, she was puzzled.\n\nHere was a black girl from Gary who had been sentenced to death by a black judge whom even Foster knew to be one of the most liberal, anti-death penalty jurists in the state. The girl had brutally murdered an elderly woman during a robbery, but Foster told the people in her office that to get a death sentence from this judge Paula Cooper had to be some kind of rabid animal.\n\n\"She must be frothing at the mouth.\"\n\nFoster decided to go to the prison and see Paula Cooper for herself.\n\n—\n\nPaula had arrived at the Indiana Women's Prison — America's oldest women's prison — five days after her sentencing.\n\nEstablished shortly after the Civil War, it was originally in the countryside east of Indianapolis. Over time, brick storefronts and wood-frame houses sprang up around the prison's series of boxy brick buildings — situated around a grassy courtyard — and now the prison was landlocked in the middle of an urban neighborhood.\n\nAwaiting Paula was a cell tucked away on the second floor of the segregation unit. It was stark: block walls and tile floor; aluminum sink and toilet; a desk and a chair; all of it packaged in a space slightly bigger than a walk-in closet.\n\nShe had one window to the outside world. Depending on which side of the hallway she was assigned at the time, it featured either a view of the courtyard or, just beyond a fence topped by razor wire, the backside of a row of decaying houses.\n\nPaula's cell had two metal doors. One was made of bars, the other was solid. Most of the time, the solid door remained open, allowing her to talk through the bars to passing guards and nearby prisoners. But when the solid door was closed, it was as if she was locked in a vault. Worse, the prison had no air conditioning. As summer temperatures outside climbed into the 90s, the only air moving through the wing was pushed by a floor fan at the end of the hall. Most of the time, the place felt like the inside of a cook stove.\n\nHere, Paula Cooper spent 23 hours a day. In the remaining hour, she had 30 minutes to shower and 30 minutes for recreation, which meant a short walk to a larger room where she could play Ping-Pong or cards with other prisoners. Meals were delivered to her cell.\n\nShe was 16 years old and, in the grand scheme of things, set apart from the rest of the human race.\n\nThe treatment was harsher than what Paula's three co-defendants in the murder of Ruth Pelke faced. They were housed elsewhere in the prison, with the general population. They had greater freedom of movement, time outdoors and an ongoing interaction with other people. Paula was allotted 10 hours of visits per month, but she wasn't sure who would fill the time. Her sister had moved to Minnesota. Her mother had moved to Georgia. Her father had moved to Tennessee. Paula was as alone as she could be.\n\nYet she faced a struggle greater than isolation and heat. She lived in fear that the executioner was coming for her any minute. Whatever she'd been told about the appeals process hadn't registered. She thought she was about to be taken away and killed. She existed moment to moment, in dread the guards were about to drag her away to the electric chair. In letters, she would describe her situation in the bleakest of terms — \"a mental hell.\" Paula needed hope. She needed a friend. But who?\n\n—\n\nMonica Foster entered the security checkpoint at the Indiana Women's Prison and was shown to the glass-walled consultation room. In short order, she watched as a guard escorted her client in to meet her.\n\nPaula Cooper was nothing like she expected. Monica came looking for the heartless killer who had murdered an old woman in cold blood, fought the guards at the county jail and been given a ticket to the chair by the most liberal judge in Lake County.\n\nInstead, Foster found a girl, sobbing uncontrollably, who had been on suicide watch. Foster tried to calm her. After some questioning, she gathered the reason for the emotional meltdown: Paula thought they were coming any time now. To kill her.\n\nFoster's blood boiled. She realized that, since the sentencing, no one had explained to Paula the years of appeals; the good chance for a reprieve; and, should all else fail, the notice she would receive well ahead of an execution. Foster felt sorry for Paula. She explained the process. Above all, she told Paula she'd never be ambushed by the executioner.\n\nPaula went back to her cell in a little better shape, but Foster left the prison rattled. She couldn't believe how she had misjudged her client. She realized that her role in this case was about more than legal counsel. She would need to offer her client a shoulder to cry on, an ear to listen.\n\nFoster began going to the prison on weekends, sitting and talking with Paula for hours. She listened to Paula talk about being depressed, and she tried to buck her up. She listened to Paula's troubles with the prison administration and offered advice on ways to get along. She listened to Paula describe the abuses of her childhood, and Foster shared some of the tougher aspects of her own. The conversation wasn't always heavy. Sometimes they talked about places they dreamed of going and about men Foster was dating. Paula, in particular, was quick with a jab about Foster's romantic failures. Even in a maximum security prison, with one of them facing death, they spent a good deal of time laughing. And Foster found Paula's laugh to be infectious. That she could laugh at all impressed Foster. The girl seemed to have some kind of resiliency. After a while, Foster could deny it no longer: She liked Paula Cooper.\n\n—\n\nBill Pelke felt no such affection.\n\nIn the 18 months since Paula Cooper killed his grandmother, Bill had lost the ability to think of Ruth Pelke as the sweet person she'd been; he could only see the murder victim. He couldn't remember the warmth of Ruth's home; he could only think of it as a crime scene. When Paula Cooper received her sentence, Pelke felt justice had been served. His father, Robert Pelke, warned him that the justice wouldn't last. On a trip to Florida they took to get away from it all, Robert Pelke said Paula would probably never see the electric chair. \"Some do-gooder will probably come along and help get her off death row,\" he'd said. Bill struggled to imagine it; he just tried to get on with his life.\n\nBut moving on wasn't easy. And at 39, Bill already had other things on his mind that bothered him. He'd dropped out of college and wound up in Vietnam during the height of the war. As a radio operator, he was supposed to take cover during the fighting and call in air support. But he still carried shrapnel in his side from the wounds he suffered. Worse than that, he carried memories of the Army buddies who'd never come back. The experience left him sick of death. When he returned home, he'd married and started a family, but his marriage failed. So many things in his life hadn't gone as he'd planned. One afternoon in November 1986, all of this seemed to coalesce in Bill's mind.\n\nBill worked in a steel mill as a crane operator. He sat 50 feet above the manufacturing floor in the cab of his crane, moving heavy loads as the need arose. But on this Sunday night shift, things were slow; his mind began to drift. He wondered why life was so hard, why God had allowed Ruth to suffer such a horrendous death. He wondered why his family — his good family — was made to suffer in the wake of the crime. It was an unlikely perch for prayer, but Bill closed his eyes and began seeing images in his mind. He saw the courtroom where Paula had been sentenced to death. He remembered the outburst of her grandfather and the tears streaming down the man's face. He remembered Paula's reaction and the tears streaming down hers, how they soaked her blouse.\n\nA hard realization hit Bill: Ruth wouldn't have wanted these things. She had invited Paula and the girls into her home to help them find faith. It occurred to Bill that Ruth would be more interested in Paula's salvation than her execution. He was certain, too, that Ruth would have hated seeing Paula's grandfather in anguish.\n\nBill thought of the Bible stories Ruth had taught and the lessons he'd learned from a lifetime in church. He remembered Jesus taught that you shouldn't forgive someone just seven times, but 70 times seven — in other words, forgiveness should be a habit. He remembered being taught that the measure of forgiveness we show others is the measure by which we shall be judged. He remembered hearing about Jesus on the cross, offering salvation to the man dying next to him, offering grace to those who sought his death. \"Forgive them,\" Jesus had said, \"for they know not what they do.\"\n\nAnd then Bill realized something: Paula hadn't known what she was doing. Nobody in their right mind would take a 12-inch butcher knife and stab someone 33 times. It was crazy. Senseless.\n\nIn his mind, Bill began to see a new image: It was the picture of Ruth, the one published countless times since her death — silver hair, horn-rimmed glasses, sweet smile. Except now, he saw her face in the picture with tears running down her cheeks. Bill felt certain Ruth wanted someone from her family to show love to Paula and hers. Bill wasn't capable of it right then, but he thought he should try. He was a blue collar guy — a steelworker — and now he was at work crying a river of his own tears. From his seat in the cab of the crane, Bill prayed: \"God, give me love and compassion for Paula Cooper and her family.\" In return, he promised God two things. First, Bill would give credit to God for giving him the ability to forgive Paula whenever success came his way. Second, he'd walk through whatever door opened as a result of forgiving Paula.\n\nEventually, the sweet memories of Ruth would come back to Bill. He would be able to put aside the horror story. First, though, he felt he had to take a greater leap of faith. He had to get in touch with his grandmother's killer. He had to reach out to Paula Cooper.\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nThe next day, Bill phoned Paula's attorney. He wanted her prison address, and he was willing to do whatever it took to help save Paula's life. Kevin Relphorde's response wasn't encouraging: \"It's kind of late for that.\"\n\nUndeterred, Bill took the address and sat down at a desk in his Portage home to write perhaps the most intense letter of his life. He told Paula he had forgiven her; he wanted to visit her; there were Bible verses his grandmother would want him to share. He also wanted to meet her grandfather, he of the tearful courtroom outburst.\n\nBill dropped the letter in his mailbox and, at some level, thought that would be the end of it. But in the days following, he found himself checking his mailbox almost daily. Ten days after he sent his letter, an envelope showed up. The return address said: \"Ms. Paula Cooper.\"\n\nThe envelope was thick. Inside, he found a letter dated Nov. 10, 1986, six pages of a teenage girl's loopy cursive, written in pencil, on pink stationery. The contents were far from a schoolgirl's bubble gum dreams. It was a snapshot of Paula's mind on death row. Her thoughts darted back and forth — between apologies and self-pity, between empathy for those who hated her and preachiness about why they should forgive her. Much of the letter was frenetic. Sentences ran on and on like the transcriptions of a nervous talker. Her misspellings and limited punctuation seemed to reflect the erratic schooling of someone who'd been on the run since eighth grade. But it also bore the hallmarks of a mind in overdrive, overloaded with conflicting emotions. Here are some excerpts. Periods have been added for clarity.\n\nBill 11/10/86\n\nHello how are you? fine I truly hope. me I'll survive, I received your letter today & it was nice of you to write me. one of Ms Pelkes friends wrote me also, I answered it back also. Im not the mean type of person your family thinks I am but I can except that. I really do. your cousin Robert was something else & what he said about not knowing if Ms Pelke would forgiving me. Ive read my bible & I know it says the way you judge others the Lord will judge you the same way. Ive prayed for your family. a lady in a wheel chair use to visit me at the jail. she said God would be pleased if I prayed for all of you, I am doing fine. They treat me ok & I am always isolated 23 hrs a day. thats how it is on death row, it is a mental hell because no one cares except for themselves. I am thankful to the Lord for them letting the others have a little time, because I've had hell all my life. so it really doesnt matter if I live or die because Im ready any time they come …\n\nIn his initial letter, Bill expressed a desire to save Paula from her death sentence. But in her reply, Paula told Bill he need not write, travel or speak on her behalf; she just wanted his forgiveness. She seemed proud of her performance in court — how she looked his family in the face and apologized. She seemed to excuse her parents for missing her sentencing. Although they had beaten and neglected her, Paula said, her actions affected them, too.\n\nAt various times, her words ranged from fatalistic to self-pitying:\n\nI cant stay here like this & I don't want to be here, I deserve a chance one that Ive never had before. but one day Ill be free even if its when Im dead…\n\nI cry every time I think of your grand mom. the others think it's a joke because you all let them be free. Im not an evil person, or what ever you think of me to be, Im just some one who is real angry, angry with life & all the people around me …\n\nIve never done anything wrong before except ask for help, I was turned away & introduced into a life of drugs, sex & crime, but now its too late for help. Im dying inside because of this but I only hope for the best for others.\n\nIn closing, she made it clear she wanted more interaction with Bill, even if she was passive about it. She would put him on her list of allowable prison visitors; she would write him whenever he wrote her; she offered her grandfather's phone number and address. In a dark world, it was as if she had seen a flicker of light.\n\nWell, Ill go now, Ill continue to pray for all of you.\n\nTake care\n\nPaula\n\nTheir first exchange was the start of a surprising correspondence that would span years and delve into the core themes of Paula's life — searching for forgiveness; grappling with remorse; her closeness with death; her search for peace.\n\nThe letters also chart the course of a relationship that many people would struggle to understand, especially Bill Pelke's father.\n\n—\n\nAfter a second exchange of letters with Paula, Bill felt compelled to share with his parents the news of his surprising correspondence: His father had once warned of a do-gooder who would get Paula off death row. Now it appeared Bill wanted to be that do-gooder.\n\nAt first, his parents were speechless. \"We don't understand why you are doing this,\" his mother, Lola, said. Surprisingly, his father acquiesced.\n\n\"Do what you got to do,\" Robert said.\n\nBill wrote Clarence Trigg, the superintendent of the Indiana Women's Prison, a letter that spent most of a page describing Ruth Pelke's faith and her commitment to sharing it. He concluded with a request:\n\nClarence, if Ruth Pelke could speak with you right now, I am sure she would say, \"Please let Billy see Paula.\"\n\nThank you for your consideration\n\nIn the name of Jesus and His Love\n\nWilliam R. Pelke\n\nBut the prison doors weren't about to open to Bill anytime soon. Corrections officials didn't know what to make of his request — a murder victim's grandson seeking an audience with her killer. They suspected he had another motive, such as revenge.\n\n—\n\nThe aftermath of Paula's case was confounding in other ways. Since giving Paula a death sentence, Judge James C. Kimbrough had been very public about his discomfort with his own ruling. Based on the law and the case in court, he said Paula qualified for the death penalty. But he hadn't been able to square it with his own opposition to capital punishment. The decision was costing him sleep. In an interview with the (Gary) Post-Tribune, published Aug. 4, 1986, a reporter noted the judge's nervous appearance.\n\nHe fidgeted in his chair. His gaze varied — at times less steady and slanted toward the desktop. He removed his glasses, toying with them.\n\nFriends who knew Kimbrough said the judge was different than he'd been before the Paula Cooper sentencing. The man they knew as friendly and jovial, even gregarious, was more reclusive, less outgoing. \"It weighed heavily on his mind,\" said Earline Rogers, a state legislator and a friend. \"That was something he felt legally he had to do but, personally, he would not have taken that path.\"\n\nSome in the legal community began to think there was a good chance Paula's death sentence would be overturned. But Kimbrough wouldn't live to find out.\n\nOn April 30, 1987, less than a year after his judgment of Paula, Kimbrough drove his car into the back of a semi and was killed. He had been drinking. The tragedy cast a pall over the Lake County courts, but it also landed hard at the Indiana Women's Prison. When Monica Foster told Paula her judge was dead, Paula was inconsolable. Days later, in a letter to Bill Pelke, she shared her thoughts about the judge.\n\n\"all I could do was cry, even though Kimbrough sentenced me to die. I felt a closeness to him as if he were my father. I have been sentenced to die many times by a lot of people and it's only words. We are all on Death Row and the last day of April his death sentence was completed & it should teach a lot of people we all have a date that is already planned & the way it will happen.\"\n\nPaula's own father had been cruel; at least Kimbrough had agonized over the punishment he gave.\n\nThe letter about Kimbrough was the 20th she'd written to Bill Pelke in less than six months. She was surprising herself at her output: \"I didn't even know I had a good handwriting or a great vocabulary until I was locked up.\"\n\nBy then, she was 17 and a condemned killer with hours to contemplate her past, present and future. Several themes recurred in her writing.\n\nLife on death row. She struggled to sleep, to breathe, to deal with the noise. \"To be on death row is worst than when I was in a mental hospital. At least it was quiet.\" She had ailments from toothaches to a bad back. Mostly, she was confused and on edge. Life on the row made her feel like \"a walking time bomb.\"\n\nMemories of the murder. Her thoughts were plagued by it. She described what she did to Ruth Pelke as \"awful.\" She wished she could erase it. \"Every day,\" she said, \"I see my nightmare.\"\n\nDeath. It was constantly on her mind, whether by execution or by her own hand. She alternated between dread of the electric chair — \"I hope it never happens to me\" ­— and anticipation of it — \"sometimes I wish they would just go ahead & do it. They continue to put this death threat on my life and I'm tired of it.\"\n\nSuicide. She seemed to ponder the merits of killing herself. She wasn't sure what it would solve but, in words that seemed to echo from her mother, she said, \"there isn't anything here for me.\" She talked about hanging herself but acknowledged she couldn't follow through. \"I know that if I do that I might go to hell (and) I don't want that to happen.\"\n\nMeanwhile, people from across the country wrote her. Some, including a death row inmate in North Carolina, wanted a romantic relationship. Some wanted answers to the plague of juvenile crime. Others sent her Bibles and tried to save her soul. Yet her faith — another frequent topic — had grown cold. As a child, she read her Bible often, she said, but \"my faith started to shatter because of a lot of feelings, hopes and unanswered prayers. I love the Lord but we aren't rea", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/12/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/11/02/civil-rights-records-walking-spiderwebs-making-saints-news-around-states/49312225/", "title": "Civil rights records, walking in spiderwebs: News from around our ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The quest by civil rights pioneer Claudette Colvin to have her arrest record wiped clean nearly 70 years after she protested segregation has raised the possibility of similar bids to clear the names of Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr., whose convictions remain on the books in the former capital of the Confederacy. Parks, a Black seamstress and activist who refused to give up her bus seat to a white man in 1955, was convicted of violating racial segregation laws. King, who helped lead the resulting Montgomery Bus Boycott, paid a $500 fine after being convicted in 1956 of violating a law banning boycotts. Parks refused to pay her $10 fine, and she and King went on to become icons of racial justice and the modern civil rights movement. Yet their cases remain on the books, said civil rights attorney Fred Gray, who represented both. Montgomery County District Attorney Daryl Bailey said he would generally support a move to expunge the arrest records of King and Parks, but he’d need to see details of any such request before responding in court. Colvin asked a court last week to remove records stemming her from arrest and conviction after she refused to move to the back of a bus in 1955 in Montgomery, before Parks did the same. Now 82, Colvin – who was a 15-year-old high school student when she was convicted of assaulting an officer during her arrest and declared delinquent – isn’t sure such an effort would be possible since there was so much injustice for so long. “That would take a hundred years, maybe 200 years to go through the court system,” she said. “You could never finish it.”\n\nAlaska\n\nSitka: Twelve bears have been killed in the city this year, including four last week, that were deemed dangers to life and property, the Daily Sitka Sentinel reports. The southeast Alaska city “has a garbage problem,” Stephen Bethune, a wildlife biologist with the state Department of Fish and Game, told the local Assembly recently. “Neither I or any of my agency colleagues like killing bears or the labor that ensues but will continue to do so as necessary,” he said. “However, removing bears from the population only serves to treat the symptom and fails to cure the root problem. ... That problem can be linked directly to Sitka’s current garbage disposal system and the unwillingness or inability of some members of the public to properly store trash.” He urged the use of bear-resistant trash cans and told the newspaper he would encourage the use of electric fences to help deter bears. Teal West owns a car damaged by bears last month. “My back trim and my back bumper were basically ripped off my car,” West said. “I taped the bumper back on, but I’m looking at around $6,000 worth of damage.” Bethune said he hopes the tension with bears in town eases soon. “Hopefully in the next couple weeks they’ll disappear, go up into the hills for the winter,” he said.\n\nArizona\n\nFlagstaff: Conservationists and state officials say the popularity of Oak Creek Canyon, near Sedona, has created some real ecological problems for the corridor. A group of Arizona Conservation Corps members recently completed the second phase of a project that officials hope will rehabilitate many areas hit hard by visitors, improve water quality in the creek, and protect habitat for the threatened narrow-headed garter snake, the Arizona Daily Sun reports. A collaboration among the AZCC, the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality, the National Forest Foundation and the Coconino National Forest’s Red Rock District, among other groups, the project seeks to close hundreds of unofficial social trails that crisscross the area between the highway and the creek. Large rocks have been stacked under a fence. Guardrails installed along 89A have limited roadside parking spots that led visitors to cut more and more new trails. Teams have installed low fencing and placed thick blankets of cut juniper limbs along the edge of pull-offs. And they’ve improved about 40 trails in an effort to leave direct pathways to the creek, reducing erosion and making them safer. Over the last year, AZCC crews have addressed nearly 200 social trails along the creek corridor, said Ron Tiller, a Department of Environmental Quality scientist. In one area, he said, they cataloged 47 individual trails visitors had cut within just a quarter-mile stretch. The foot traffic increases erosion of sediment into the creek and often contributes to outbreaks of E. coli as human waste left by visitors is swept into the water.\n\nArkansas\n\nSpringdale: Jim Bob Duggar, whose large family was featured in the TLC reality show “19 Kids and Counting,” has announced he’s running for a seat in the state Senate. Duggar, who previously served in the state House, announced Friday on the family’s Facebook page that he’s running for the northwest Arkansas district that includes Springdale. Last week, Republican state Sen. Lance Eads resigned the seat to take a job in the private sector. A special election will be called to fill the term. TLC pulled “19 Kids and Counting” in 2015 over revelations that Duggar’s son Josh had molested four of his sisters and a babysitter. His parents said he confessed to the fondling and apologized. Josh Duggar has also apologized for his pornography addiction and for cheating on his wife. Josh Duggar is set to go to trial in federal court in November on two counts of downloading and possessing child pornography. He faces up to 20 years in prison and fines of up to $250,000 on each count if convicted. A longtime family spokesman, Chad Gallagher, told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that no family “is immune from tragedy, heartbreak or impact from the decisions of the ones they love.” He added that it’s “important to note that Josh is a grown adult.” Jim Bob Duggar, who was born and raised in Springdale, and his wife, Michelle, have 20 children and 22 grandchildren.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: A $650 million plan would give the Los Angeles Zoo a theme park-style transformation over the next 20 years. The city-owned zoo in the city’s Griffith Park area would get exhibit upgrades and new attractions such as a 60-foot-deep canyon for rock climbing and a hilltop building called the California Center in the style of a Yosemite National Park lodge with a sweeping view of a 25,000-square-foot vineyard, the Los Angeles Times reports. Supporters of the zoo’s “20-year Vision Plan” said building the features would increase zoo attenance by 72%, to up to 3 million visitors annually. But the construction would consume 23 acres of native woodlands, drawing opposition led by the historical preservation group Friends of Griffith Park and the California Native Plant Society. Zoo officials were thinking about the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games as they crafted the plan, said Denise Verrett, the zoo’s director and chief executive. The renovation would happen in seven phases starting next year and would be funded by grants and donations raised by the Greater Los Angeles Zoo Association, a nonprofit support group, and possibly a bond issue, according to the Times. The next step for the proposal is consideration by the Los Angeles City Council’s Arts, Parks, Health, Education, and Neighborhoods Committee.\n\nColorado\n\nBrighton: Three police officers and two paramedics indicted on manslaughter and other charges in the 2019 death of Elijah McClain appeared in court for the first time Monday since being charged. Officers Randy Roedema, Nathan Woodyard and Jason Rosenblatt and fire department paramedic Jeremy Cooper and fire Lt. Peter Cichuniec each took turns standing before Judge Priscilla Loew with their lawyers in a courtroom in Brighton. As McClain’s mother, Sheneen McClain, watched from the gallery with her lawyers, each waived a reading of the charges and penalties they face. None was asked to speak. McClain, a 23-year-old Black man, died after being put into a chokehold and injected with a powerful sedative in a fatal encounter in the Denver suburb of Aurora that provoked a national outcry during racial injustice protests last year. He never regained consciousness and was later declared brain-dead at a hospital. While the former district attorney said he could not file charges because an autopsy could not determine how McClain died, the officers and paramedics were indicted by a grand jury this summer over a year after Gov. Jared Polis ordered state Attorney General Phil Weiser to open a criminal investigation into the case.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: With the legalization of recreational cannabis for adults and the impending start of retail sales in the state next year, several coastal towns are saying no, for now. Guilford, Madison and North Branford recently put in place measures that stop cannabis establishments from opening for nine months to a year from now, and Clinton has made it unlawful for any building, structure or land to be used as a cannabis establishment, producer, retailer or dispensary, the New Haven Register reports. The law signed in June by Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont law allows individuals ages 21 and older to possess or consume up to 1.5 ounces of “cannabis plant material” and up to 5 ounces in a locked container in a home or in the trunk or locked glove box in the person’s vehicle. Retail sales of recreational cannabis in Connecticut are not expected to begin until summer 2022 at the earliest. Clinton town manager Karl Kilduff told the Register that at a public hearing in September on the issue, 15 of 17 people spoke against allowing cannabis establishments in the town. The town’s police chief also expressed concern about a “black market” developing alongside the legal market.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The University of Delaware has introduced new safety measures following student protests that criticized the school’s delayed action after a student was charged with attacking his ex-girlfriend, also a UD student, on Oct. 8. The security initiatives, which went into effect last week, include an expanded safety escort program, a new nighttime shuttle service and a reevaluation of the blue light phone system that connects students to police. “The safety of our community is our top concern and we’ll be actively driving improvement of all available resources for our students to address that priority head on,” John Long, the university’s executive vice president and chief operating officer, said in a statement. Long, who oversees the units in charge of campus safety, said he worked with President Dennis Assanis and other campus leaders to develop the new pilot programs. He said they are specifically focused on students going to and from their residences. University police officers will now have a golf cart to drive students to and from on-campus residences, according to the announcement. Those in nearby off-campus housing can take a shuttle from four on-campus locations. Both programs will run from 6 p.m. to 1 a.m., seven days a week. Students can request rides using the LiveSafe app or by calling 831-RIDE.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A George Washington University fraternity house was broken into and vandalized, with a Jewish text desecrated, WUSA-TV reports. George Washington University Police are investigating the incident in which a Torah scroll at Tau Kappa Epsilon was destroyed. The crime happened Saturday and was discovered Sunday morning, according to a police report. “Our entire chapter is outraged and saddened by the blatant act of antisemitism against our brothers,” the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity said in a statement on Instagram. The fraternity said it is cooperating with police and the Anti-Defamation League. In a tweet, the ADL’s D.C. regional office said it was disturbed by the incident and said officials were in touch with students and the campus police. “We expect a full and rapid investigation,” the ADL said. University President Thomas LeBlanc issued a statement late Sunday saying George Washington University Police is working with D.C.’s Metropolitan Police Department to find who is responsible. “I want to be clear: I condemn all such acts of antisemitism and all forms of hatred, discrimination, and bias in our community. Any act of antisemitism is an attack on the entire GW community and cannot, and will not, be tolerated,” LeBlanc said in the statement.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: The University of Florida is prohibiting three professors from providing expert testimony in a lawsuit challenging a new law that critics claim restricts voting rights, saying it goes against the school’s interest by conflicting with the administration of Gov. Ron DeSantis. Though the decision is being criticized as threat to academic freedom and free speech, the university said in a statement Saturday that allowing professors Dan Smith, Michael McDonald and Sharon Austin to serve as paid experts for plaintiffs challenging the law would be “adverse to the university’s interests as a state of Florida institution.” Lawyers for a coalition of civic groups challenging the law said in court papers Friday that the professors were told by the university that their expert testimony would dissent from the DeSantis administration, creating a conflict for the school. Attorneys for the professors said Saturday that they would take legal action claiming violations of the First Amendment and academic freedom if the school doesn’t reverse the decision. “The university cannot silence the professors on matters of great public importance. These professors are citizens entitled to participate in the marketplace of ideas,” attorneys Paul Donnelly and Conor Flynn said in a letter to a university lawyer. “These unlawful restrictions are shameful, and could very well deter top scholars from joining UF’s ranks.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A large spider native to East Asia has spun its thick, golden web on power lines, porches and vegetable patches all over north Georgia this year – a proliferation that has driven some unnerved homeowners indoors and prompted a flood of anxious social media posts. In metro Atlanta, self-described arachnophobe Jennifer Turpin stopped blowing leaves in her yard after inadvertently walking into a web created by the Joro spider. Stephen Carter has avoided a walking trail along the Chattahoochee River where he encountered Joro webs every dozen steps. Farther east in Winterville, Will Hudson’s front porch became unusable amid an abundance of Joro webs 10 feet deep. Hudson estimates he’s killed more than 300 of the spiders on his property. “The webs are a real mess,” said Hudson, an entomologist at the University of Georgia. “Nobody wants to come out of the door in the morning, walk down the steps and get a face full of spider web.” The Joro – Trichonephila clavata – is part of a group of spiders known as orb weavers for their highly organized, wheel-shaped webs. Common in Japan, China, Korea and Taiwan, Joro females have colorful yellow, blue and red markings on their bodies. They can measure 3 inches across when their legs are fully extended. Hudson is convinced they will spread across the South.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Lava continues to pour out of Kilauea’s summit crater, more than a month after the latest eruption began at the Hawaii volcano. The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said Friday that lava was emerging from a single vent inside Halemaumau Crater. The eruption is contained within Hawaii Volcanoes National Park and isn’t threatening any homes. Nightime aerial video shot from a helicopter shows lava gushing from a vent and spreading across the crater floor. Kilauea is one of the world’s most active volcanoes. It has erupted dozens of times since 1952. The latest eruption began inside the crater Sept. 29. In 2018, the volcano erupted from vents within a residential neighborhood. That episode sent streams of lava across the Puna district of the Big Island, destroying farms and more than 700 homes.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Instances of hoarding, illegal reselling and bad behavior by customers have caused the state agency that sells alcohol to change how it rolls out rare spirits at stores, officials said. The Idaho State Liquor Division late last month announced new rules involving rare but highly sought-after bourbons, whiskeys and other small-batch liquor offerings. That combination has resulted in what the agency calls unsavory behavior by some customers that includes harassment of store workers. The new rules mean the agency will now sporadically allocate rare products across its 67 retail outlets to create what it calls a “treasure hunt” approach. The agency also has stopped listing rare-product inventory on its website and will only sell alcohol visible on store shelves. The changes follow reports of shoppers getting “very aggressive with these products,” Tony Faraca, the Idaho State Liquor Division’s chief financial officer, told The Idaho Statesman. “We know that there is a lot of hoarding going on,” he said. “We know that there are illegal secondary sales going on. Our store employees are being harassed by these whiskey groups. It’s causing a lot of stress and turmoil with our staff.” He said some groups try to buy up rare bottles that have limits of one per customer. Some customers, armed with inventory details, have tried to persuade employees to go into storage and dig through unopened boxes. Now that the agency has stopped sharing inventory details, “our hope is that more people will get to partake in the rare product,” Faraca said.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A judge on Monday suspended a Dec. 31 deadline for the city’s police officers to be vaccinated against COVID-19 but didn’t interfere with a requirement that they be regularly tested for the coronavirus. Disputes over vaccinations should be handled as a labor grievance with an arbitrator, Cook County Judge Raymond Mitchell said. “The effect of this order is to send these parties back to the bargaining table and to promote labor peace by allowing them to pursue” remedies under Illinois law, Mitchell said. The grievance process could last months, the city said last week. Officers who haven’t been vaccinated still must be tested twice a week under city policy. Officers also can lose work and pay if they don’t disclose their vaccine status. “The principal risk to those who are unvaccinated is to themselves and to others who choose to be unvaccinated,” the judge said. Police Superintendent David Brown last week said 70% had disclosed their vaccination status, and 80% of those officers reported being vaccinated. Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s administration announced the vaccine policy weeks ago, drawing sharp objections from police union leaders. The judge noted that COVID-19 has killed many officers nationwide. “In light of that terrible sacrifice, the police unions’ request just to have their grievances heard seems a pretty modest task,” Mitchell said.\n\nIndiana\n\nConnersville: A fire that badly damaged a Black City Council member’s home is being investigated by the FBI after a racial slur was found spray-painted at the house. The fire broke out about 3:30 a.m. Friday at the home of Connersville City Councilman Tommy Williams, who is Black, while his wife said the couple and their two sons were away on vacation. The racial slur was painted on the back patio, and FBI agents spent Saturday at the house, Emma Williams said. FBI Special Agent Steve Secor confirmed Monday that the agency was working with state and local authorities investigating the fire in the 13,000-person city about 50 miles east of Indianapolis. Secor said no suspects had been immediately identified. Williams said she had no idea who would attack her family in this way, and she was forgiving whoever is responsible. “I’m grateful for our community,” Williams told WXIN-TV. “We have really good people here, and I don’t want this to be a message that represents our village here because it’s a lie. It’s not what we’re about here.” Tommy Williams, a retired U.S. Postal Service worker and Army veteran, was elected by a Republican caucus last year to fill a City Council vacancy. An online fundraiser had collected more than $30,000 on Monday to assist the family’s recovery.\n\nIowa\n\nCedar Rapids: Beef, chicken, bread, fruit and vegetables, and paper products are among items school districts are struggling to get so they can provide varied and quality meals to students. Schools are making changes to their breakfast and lunch menus “nearly weekly” to account for items that are delayed or unavailable, said Alison Demory, Iowa City schools’ nutrition services director. “If we saw the light at the end of the tunnel, we might feel a little better,” Demory told the Cedar Rapids Gazette. “I’ve heard this isn’t going to go away any time soon.” Staffing shortages at food manufacturers and distributors are making it challenging to make and transport enough products to meet the demand, Demory said. Some items can be ordered only in a limited quantity, which may not meet the needs of the Iowa City district. “If we can only order two cases of a product at a time, that’s a problem,” Demory said. Instead of providing individual bags of chips, the district is purchasing bulk orders and portioning them out to students, which requires more preparation, Demory said, giving an example of how the supply chain shortages can cause more work down the line. Cedar Rapids schools have had to substitute products but are able to offer similar items to “maintain the quality and integrity of our meals,” said Jennifer Hook, Cedar Rapids schools’ food and nutrition department manager.\n\nKansas\n\nOverland Park: A first-year state lawmaker, who was reprimanded by his colleagues for abusive conduct before taking office, has been arrested on suspicion of domestic violence. Democratic state Rep. Aaron Coleman of Kansas City remained in custody Sunday afternoon, according to Johnson County Jail records. The 21-year-old was arrested Saturday evening by Overland Park police on a domestic battery charge. Police didn’t immediately respond to messages Sunday, and calls to Coleman’s cellphone rang unanswered Sunday. Coleman is not married, and details of his domestic situation were not immediately available. It wasn’t immediately clear what consequences Coleman might face in the House after his arrest. He was being held without bond ahead of a court appearance scheduled for Monday. “Given what little we know about the situation, I am concerned for everyone involved,” Speaker of the House Ron Ryckman told the Kansas City Star. “I know that law enforcement will thoroughly investigate and assess the situation so that we can take appropriate action.” House Democratic Leader Tom Sawyer said Coleman should resign. “This is extremely disturbing news. We are watching closely to make sure we gather all the facts,” Sawyer said.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The state’s workers are taking a cue from country crooner Johnny Paycheck, telling their employers to “take this job and shove it.” And they’re doing so at a rate higher than any other state in the country. In August, 84,000 Kentuckians quit their jobs – a 26,000-person increase from the number who quit in July, according to the State Job Openings and Labor Turnover report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. With the mass exodus of workers in Kentucky, the commonwealth has the nation’s highest quit rate, the total number of workers who quit during an entire month as a percent of total employment. In Kentucky, the quit rate was 4.5% as of August – a 1.4% increase from the month prior, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The states with the next-highest quit rates were Georgia and Idaho, with rates of 4.2% and 4.1%, respectively. But there is a glimmer of hope for the commonwealth: 103,000 Kentuckians were hired in August 2021, with a hire rate of 5.5%, the fifth-highest of any state and 1.2% higher than the national average. Gov. Andy Beshear said during a recent press conference that “our challenges in the labor market are complex” but that “there’s some really good things going on right now,” and “people ought to feel more hope than concern.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state is continuing its “Shot for $100” COVID-19 vaccine incentive program through November, hoping to persuade more people to get the shots by offering them money. More than 19,000 people have received a Visa cash card through the effort so far. The program aimed at college students started in August. Gov. John Bel Edwards expanded it in October to cover anyone getting newly vaccinated. The state Department of Health said 5- to 11-year-olds will be eligible if federal officials sign off on a vaccine for the children and if their parents give consent for them to get immunized. “Thanks to many Louisianans working together, the fourth surge is behind us, but in order to help avoid another surge we need many more of our people to get vaccinated,” Edwards, a Democrat, said in a statement. “This is how we’re going to put this pandemic behind us and protect our loved ones and our communities.” To be eligible, people must use one of the community-based vaccination sites listed on ShotFor100.com. A person may only participate once in the program. After getting the shot, those participating receive the gift card and must register it online so it will be loaded with $100. More information is available on the website or by calling Louisiana’s vaccine hotline at 1-855-453-0774.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The battle over a 145-mile electricity transmission line is the most expensive ballot-question campaign in the state’s history. More than $90 million from utilities has flowed into the fight over the $1 billion project funded by ratepayers in Massachusetts that supporters say would remove carbon from the environment and provide needed electricity. The high-stakes campaign put environmental and conservation groups at odds and pitted utilities backing the project against operators of fossil fuel-powered plants that stand to lose money. Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, who supports the project, made a last-minute pitch over the weekend for bold action against climate change. “We just can’t afford just to do nothing,” she said. A ballot question Tuesday will let Maine voters have their say. The project has received all the necessary permits, and construction began 10 months ago. But a court ruling called into question a state lease for a 1-mile section. More litigation is expected regardless of the outcome of the vote. Lewiston Mayor Mark Cayer said he doesn’t understand the opposition, noting that the new sections are being built in working forests that have been logged repeatedly over the years.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The process of recognizing saints in Catholicism can take generations, but the church can accelerate matters when it wants, as it did in the cases of Mother Teresa of Calcutta and Pope John Paul II, waiving a five-year waiting period after their deaths to get the process started. Now a group of Baltimore Catholics says it’s time to expedite the cases of six other heroes of the faith. Parishioners of St. Ann’s Catholic Church, a predominantly African American congregation, and the two other churches in its pastorate, Historic St. Francis Xavier and St. Wenceslaus, seek to make the case that the church should immediately canonize six Black American Catholics. Those include Mother Mary Lange, a Baltimore nun who started and ran a school for Black children during the era of slavery. They supporters planned to use a special Mass at St. Ann’s on Monday night to advocate for the cause, and organizers have said they’ll also use the All Saints’ Day service to launch a national letter-writing campaign to Pope Francis. Also among the proposed candidates are a Haitian American former slave, Pierre Toussaint, who went on to became a successful business owner and philanthropist, and Mississippi-born scholar-evangelist Thea Bowman. They had to overcome so much racism inside and outside the church during their lives that their cases should be viewed as exceptional, said Ralph E. Moore Jr., a St. Ann’s member helping to lead the effort. The church has never made a Black American Catholic a saint.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nOrleans: The Coast Guard and other authorities were searching off the coast of Cape Cod on Monday for a small plane that failed to arrive as scheduled Sunday night, officials said. The Piper PA-28 that departed from Reading, Pennsylvania, was reported missing about 10 p.m., the Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement. It was headed to Chatham Municipal Airport in Massachusetts. One person was on board the plane, the Coast Guard said in a tweet. The original call was made to the Air Force Regional Command Center by a concerned friend who was waiting for the aircraft in Chatham. The Air Force then contacted the Coast Guard. The aircraft’s last transmitted transponder signal was at 6:49 p.m. descending at 4,000 feet per minute. The search taking place off Nauset Beach in Orleans involved a Coast Guard fixed-wing aircraft and a helicopter and three Coast Guard vessels, as well as area harbormasters and other assets, the Coast Guard said. No information about the plane’s occupant was released.\n\nMichigan\n\nMackinaw City: Business owners on Mackinac Island are celebrating a big rebound in tourism this year after fewer visitors made the journey to the island in 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic. Many visitors discovered the iconic carless-island getaway for the first time this year, said business owners on the island, which sits in the Straits of Mackinac separating Michigan’s upper and lower peninsulas. Chris Shepler, a third-generation operator of Shepler’s Ferry, which shuttles visitors to Mackinac Island, said the summer “was out of control” for the ferry service. “Absolutely crazy. We set records for our all-time busiest summer in the history of our company,” he said. Through Sept. 1, the island’s overall hotel room revenue for the 2021 season was on pace to smash the record year it saw in 2019, when revenue topped $74.56 million, said Tim Hygh, executive director of the Mackinac Island Tourism Bureau. Final data is still be crunched for 2021, he said. “It came after vaccinations, and people were so eager to travel. The market found us,” Hygh said. As everything closes up for the season on the island known for its hiking, biking and horse-drawn carriage rides, Mackinac Island Mayor Margaret Doud said she’s cautious but hopeful about what 2022 may hold. “I look forward to moving out of the pandemic, but we are still in a pandemic,” said Doud, who is often found at the front desk of the iconic Windermere Hotel.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Those who monitor voting access for people with disabilities say the state generally does a good job on the issue, but it’s not without challenges. Minnesota Council on Disability ADA Director David Fenley said while barriers still persist, the state provides good general access for voters with different disabilities. Polling stations are equipped with an accessible voting machine for people with vision impairments, with many counties using an electronic ballot marker machine called AutoMARK. “Just say, ‘Hey, where’s your AutoMARK? I need an accessible voting machine,’ ” he advised. Grace Gouker Littlefield, executive director at a new Minnesota-based organization called Able to Vote, is working to connect people with voting resources. Littlefield said she wants to see more disabled voters like herself with equal access across the country, starting in her own backyard this fall, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. A chat feature on AbleToVote.org connects staff to people who need assistance finding transportation to the polls, coming up with a voting plan or reporting an accessibility barrier. “Just understand that the lives of people with disabilities can be very complex,” Littlefield said. “And this process should not be political, even though people are voting for political offices sometimes.”\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The city will soon start installing larger water pipes to replace some of the lines that failed during a deep freeze that struck the Deep South in February. WLBT-TV reports 48-inch cast iron water transmission lines have been arriving in south Jackson. City engineer Charles Williams said officials gave the order last week to proceed with the final phase of the project, which involves laying 2 miles of pipes in the area. The work will connect water transmission lines from the O.B. Curtis Treatment Plant to south Jackson. They will replace 24-inch pipes that failed to provide adequate water pressure from the plant during the winter storm. Thousands of Jackson residents lost water service for weeks after the storm, and those with running water had to boil it because of the danger of contamination when pressure is low. “We’re actually placing a new water main service, and then we’ll be taking off some of the existing service lines that are in the area that are smaller and tie it into that 48,” Williams said. “So the improved capacity will help improve water pressure and also limit disruptions of service due to failed water mains.” The $8 million project is funded through federal money. Installation of the new pipes is expected to be complete by March 2023, depending on weather.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: One of the leaders of a St. Louis charter school has been appointed to the State Board of Education by Gov. Mike Parson. Kerry Casey will begin serving on the state board immediately, the governor’s office said Monday. Her term will run until July 1, 2027, if she is confirmed by the state Senate. The State Board of Education oversees Missouri’s 518 public school districts, 37 charter schools, and state schools for the blind, deaf and severely disabled. Casey, of Chesterfield, was a founding board member of the KIPP Charter School and continues to serve on its board. She also is vice president for global sales at Exegy, a financial markets data company. She replaces Victor Lenz of St. Louis, whose term on the State Board of Education expired in July 2019. Missouri law allows board members to continue serving until the governor appoints a replacement. Lenz had been serving as the board’s vice president. Two other board members also are serving on expired terms: President Charlie Shields of St. Joseph, whose term expired in July 2020, and Donald Claycomb of Linn, whose term expired this past July.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state’s redistricting commission delayed a decision on a map dividing the state into congressional districts after an all-day meeting Saturday. The commission failed to reach a consensus on the map proposals it was considering, instead kicking the decision until after receiving more public comments this week as it speeds toward a Nov. 14 deadline. The two Democrats on the commission pushed to approve a map they had proposed that would divide the state into an eastern and western district and place Kalispell, a Republican stronghold in the northwest corner of the state, in the eastern district. That map would give Democrats a fighting shot at winning in the western district despite the state’s increasingly red political hue. But the map faced opposition from Republican members of the commission, who are against placing the mountain community of Kalispell in an eastern district dominated by prairieland and agricultural communities. Commission Chair Maylinn Smith, who was appointed by the state’s Supreme Court, said she could not break the tie in favor of a proposal by Democrats or Republicans before receiving additional public comment on a new proposal submitted by the Republican members of the commission just two days before the meeting.\n\nNebraska\n\nBridgeport: One small western Nebraska county is using roughly half the federal coronavirus aid money it is set to receive for bonuses of up to $10,000 each for county employees. Morrill County officials approved the bonuses in August as hazard pay for the county’s roughly 50 employees, according to the Omaha World-Herald. The county is set to receive about $900,000 from the federal program. Most of the state’s 92 other counties are still deciding how to spend the roughly $376 million they will share from the American Rescue Plan Act, but the Morrill County attorney and officials with the Nebraska Association of County Officials say using the money for premium pay is allowed. Jon Cannon, the executive director of the counties group, said he’s telling officials not to rush to spend the money because they have until the end of 2024 to decide what to use it for. Morrill County officials said the bonuses were warranted because of the work employees did throughout the pandemic, which included keeping the courthouse in Bridgeport open the entire time. “There were a lot of things you couldn’t use it for,” said Jeff Metz, of Angora, chairman of the three-member Morrill County Board. “We ran across that one of the allowable expenses was hazard pay. We felt that fit with what we were trying to do.”\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The return this week of a big automotive products trade show is expected to draw as many as 100,000 people to the Las Vegas Convention Center, tourism and event officials said. The Specialty Equipment Market Association show, commonly known as SEMA, opens Tuesday, after being canceled last year due to the coronavirus pandemic. It runs through Thursday, followed by a public event Friday dubbed “SEMA Ignited” in the convention center parking area. A companion event, the Automotive Aftermarket Products Expo, will be held at the Sands Expo and Convention Center – part of what the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority dubs Automotive Aftermarket Industry Week. SEMA represents a multibillion-dollar automotive aftermarket industry and has been held in Las Vegas since 1977, when it moved from the Anaheim Convention Center in California. Electric vehicles will be featured this year, and convention attendees will be able to ride Tesla vehicles in the nearly 1-mile underground people-mover built between convention center stops by Elon Musk’s The Boring Co. SEMA executive Tom Gattuso told the Las Vegas Review-Journal the show this year has 51,000 registered buyers and could host 100,000 industry professionals.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nLincoln: A company that offers old-fashioned train rides along Lake Winnipesaukee and the Pemigewasset River says it won’t operate its annual Santa Express Trains this season because of rising COVID-19 cases in the state. The Hobo & Winnipesaukee Scenic Railroad said in news release Monday that it hopes to offer the holiday trips, during which participants meet Santa and Mrs. Claus, next year. The Santa Express trains run from Lincoln. The railroad still plans to reopen for its regular season next year in mid-May. “The railroad had planned to make Santa Express Train tickets available in early November, but due to COVID-19 positivity rates trending upward, we felt it best to hold off on ticket sales due to the surrounding uncertainty,” railroad manager Benjamin Clark said. Last week, Dr. Benjamin Chan, the state epidemiologist, said New Hampshire continues to have a high or substantial level of community transmission, averaging 500 to 550 new infections per day with a coronavirus test positivity rate around 6%.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Calls for help to a statewide children’s mental health hotline have increased compared to last year as parents seek help, especially during the morning hours, according to the commissioner of the Department for Children and Families. The overall call volume to the Children’s System of Care increased, with the most calls coming from parents as their children experience stress before school hours, Commissioner Christine Norbut Beyer said during a state COVID-19 briefing. “Getting adjusted to something as simple as taking the bus can be stressful,” she said, referring to behavioral and emotional challenges faced by K-12 students returning to in-person school after a year of hybrid or remote learning as “a pandemic of mental health.” It is typical to see a rise in mental health reporting from K-12 students during the month of October, when educators become familiar with their students and are able to assist parents in reporting complaints and concerns. But this year, the uptick in calls occurred in September, with more than 10,000 calls, peaking in the morning, and particularly on Monday mornings, said Jason Butkowski, a DCF representative. Such calls in the morning usually have to do with school-avoidant behavior.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nBernalillo: Town officials deny wrongdoing in the installation of a hidden surveillance camera in a police office used by a now-former police sergeant who says her expectation of privacy was violated. An attorney for Monica Torres has formally notified the town that Torres intends to file a lawsuit alleging violation of a state law requiring consent from at least one person in a recording, KRQE-TV reports. Video obtained by KRQE shows a town worker installing the video camera in an air conditioning vent under the direction of Bernalillo Police Department Chief Broderick Sharp and a police lieutenant when Torres was on vacation in November 2020. “I freaked out,” Torres recalled to KRQE about when an office visitor spotted the camera a week or two later. “I had changed (clothes) numerous times in there.” KRQE reports it obtained records of a New Mexico State Police investigation prompted by a complaint by Torres. Video from the hidden camera showed a male sergeant shutting the door to change clothes inside the office, KRQE reports. The State Police investigation ended by concluding that no crime had been found. The matter was submitted to the District Attorney’s Office of the 13th Judicial District for review. That office said a special prosecutor would decide whether to file charges.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A giant red heart sculpture installed last week in Central Park as a tribute to health care workers and COVID-19 victims has been taken down – an apparent casualty of confusion and red tape. Italian sculptor Sergio Furnari said he was walking by the park Thursday afternoon with friends when he noticed that his “Heroes Heart Monument” was gone. When he went to file a police report, he said, he was bounced from police station to police station until a police officer on Friday showed him video of people removing the 10-foot-tall, 3,000-pound monument and placing it on a truck. “They literally broke my heart,” he said. Furnari conceded he did not have a permit to place the heart in the park but considered a $4,000 grant he received from New York City’s government to be his permit for the temporary installation. He said he considered the removal of his memorial “an abuse of power.” A message seeking comment was left with the Central Park Conservancy, the nonprofit that manages the park on behalf of the city. Furnari said he planned to go to the organization Monday to find out what happened to his heart. Furnari said he wanted the sculpture to be a place for emotional and spiritual solace in the bustling city and not just a popular spot for selfies, though he said he was cool with that, too.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nGreensboro: Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones has urged supporters of public education to organize to fight “anti-history laws” being promoted by Republican lawmakers. Hannah-Jones said the left hasn’t gotten “mad enough” in opposing the “culture war that has been contrived by the right wing” that has led to laws banning schools from teaching things such as her 1619 Project. She said at an online forum of North Carolina educators last week that people are living in “dark and scary times” in which teachers are “afraid to even teach and talk about the experiences that their children are having.” “We’re being outgunned right now, and I think that’s because this is not an issue that’s getting enough of the people on the left angry,” Hannah-Jones said. “People on the right are very angry, and anger is often what inspires you to organize and to push for laws and to push for these changes.” Hannah-Jones was the keynote speaker Tuesday at the Color of Education Summit, a two-day virtual event drawing 1,600 people “to engage in critical conversations centered on addressing issues of racial equity and education.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Paleontologists have given the name “Beautiful Nightmare” to a rare dinosaur fossil thought to be the only partial skull of its species found in North Dakota. “She is a beautiful example of her species, and she was a nightmare in her day to a lot of other critters,” said Fossil Excavators President Mike Kjelland, an assistant professor of biology at Mayville State University. The specimen, which includes an upper jawbone and lower teeth, is thought to be a Nanotyrannus, closely related to Tyrannosaurus rex. Only five Nano partial skulls have been found in the world, though there is debate about whether the fossils are instead of juvenile T. rex, Kjelland said. Researchers uncovered the Nano and myriad other fossils – some rare and potentially new species – on private land at a remote Badlands canyon Kjelland found two years ago near Bowman while looking for the fossil-rich Hell Creek Formation. The site comprises an ancient river channel and sandbar. The fossils, which date to 66 million to 69 million years ago, represent a diverse array of creatures from the Late Cretaceous, including two notable Triceratops skulls that drew national attention, The Bismarck Tribune reports.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A concealed weapons permit would become optional, and the requirement that individuals “promptly” notify police officers they are carrying a concealed weapon would be eliminated, under proposed legislation in the state House. The bill is similar to a measure pending in the state Senate and one of several GOP-backed proposals in recent years seeking to expand gun rights in Ohio. The concealed weapons bill, dubbed “Constitutional Carry” by its backers, is sponsored by Republican Reps. Tom Brinker of Cincinnati and Kris Jordan of Ostrander. Gun owners could still apply for a concealed weapons permit under the measure, allowing those who obtain it to carry a concealed weapon in states with reciprocity agreements recognizing such permits. The GOP-controlled House Government Oversight Committee approved the bill along party lines last week. The concept has the backing of the Buckeye Firearms Association, which says 21 other states allow people to carry a concealed weapon without a license. Gun control groups such as Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America oppose it, along with law enforcement groups. Rep. Paula Hicks-Hudson, D-Toledo, said the bill has been rushed with little time for discussion and would make Ohio less safe.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s Pardon and Parole Board on Monday recommended Gov. Kevin Stitt spare the life of death row inmate Julius Jones, whose murder conviction for the 1999 killing of an Edmond businessman has drawn national attention. The board recommended in a 3-1 vote that Stitt grant Jones clemency and commute his sentence to life in prison with the possibility of parole after hearing from Jones, 41, who testified via video link from the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester. Several members of the panel agreed they had doubts about the evidence that led to Jones’ conviction. One board member, Scott Williams, recused himself from the vote because of an existing friendship with an attorney who has advocated for Jones. “I continue to believe there is still doubt in this case,” said board member Kelly Doyle. The lone vote against clemency came from Richard Smothermon, a former prosecutor, who said he believed Jones was not being truthful in his testimony. “To believe in Mr. Jones’ theory of the case, you have to disbelieve every other piece of evidence in the case,” including testimony from law enforcement officers, independent witnesses and physical evidence, Smothermon said. Stitt must now decide whether to grant clemency or commute Jones’ sentence.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: An agreement has been reached between timber and environmental groups to overhaul management of 10 million acres of private forestlands in the state. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports the deal, announced Saturday by Gov. Kate Brown’s office, concludes more than a year of negotiations to develop a plan to boost protections for vulnerable fish and wildlife while shielding the timber industry’s ability to log. Friday was the deadline for both sides to either reach consensus, abandon the process or move the deadline. “Today’s historic agreement is a perfect example of the Oregon Way – coming together at the table to find common ground, to the mutual benefit of us all,” Brown said in a statement. Jim James with the Oregon Small Woodlands Association similarly praised the compromise. “We were able to put down the contentious situations that we’ve had in the past, and we had a continuous agreement to move forward,” James said. Speaking on behalf of the timber coalition, Adrian Miller with the Florida-based forest products company Rayonier said Saturday’s agreement gives timber operators a sense of security going forward. “I think we’re all really proud to be part of a new era of forestry in Oregon,” Miller said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration told more than 70,000 state employees Monday that it is offering five days of paid leave for getting fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by the end of the year, quickly drawing opposition from the state treasurer over the potential cost. The administration told employees that five days of “verification leave” can be used between Dec. 20 and March 31. Employees who don’t use the days by then will be paid for them, and an employee who has verified fully vaccinated status to the administration will automatically receive the days, it said. “This leave will help incentivize the vaccinations that protect commonwealth employees and the Pennsylvanians we serve,” the administration told employees. “It’s one more way we can show our gratitude to employees who step up to help us protect our communities and bring this pandemic to an end.” The administration already offers employees a paid day off to get vaccinated. Treasurer Stacy Garrity, a Republican, called on Wolf, a Democrat, to abandon the plan. Her office said the cost to taxpayers for paying employees who do not use the days could amount to more than $100 million.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A federal appeals court has upheld a settlement between Brown University and student-athletes who had challenged the Ivy League school’s decision to drop several women’s varsity sports. The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the university and the athletes who originally sued in letting the settlement stand. Twelve athletes on the women’s gymnastics and ice hockey teams had asked the court to reject the settlement in the interests of current and future female athletes at Brown. The settlement, approved by a federal judge in Providence last year, restores the women’s equestrian and women’s fencing teams to varsity status and calls for an end in 2024 to a 1998 legal agreement ensuring gender equity in varsity sports at Brown. The legal challenge centered on the Providence school’s decision to reduce several women’s varsity sports teams to club status. Several men’s sports were also reduced to club status, although some were later restored. The student-athletes alleged that the cuts violated the 1998 pact. The 1998 agreement had stemmed from a legal challenge to Brown’s decision to cut women’s gymnastics and volleyball in the early 1990s. Brown has said the agreement established unique reporting requirements not faced by any other U.S. college or university.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The Historic Columbia Foundation has unveiled a new look at the capital city’s LGBTQ past. Historic Columbia launched its comprehensive online oral history of the capital city’s gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and queer communities last month at the city’s Famously Hot South Carolina Pride festival. The foundation worked with the oral history department at the University of South Carolina to collect the stories of a diverse range of LGBTQ+ people in Columbia so that the often untold story of those communities in the Midlands can be honored and remembered. “We have to do this now before some of this stuff is lost forever,” said Kat Allen, director of research at Historic Columbia, who worked to put the comprehensive project together. “Every day more stuff gets thrown away. People pass away, and then someone says, ‘Nobody’s going to want this,’ but USC will absolutely take all of this stuff. … There are things we would have never known about without some of this material.” The project maps a timeline of Columbia’s LGBTQ+ history, from early 1900s drag shows and a procession of gay-friendly establishments to the first Pride March to the S.C. State House in 1990 that birthed today’s Pride festival.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Labor shortages in the service industry are high enough that there is now a $1,000 offer for new workers to move to the Mount Rushmore State. A new employee coming from out of state to work a job in retail, restaurants, hospitality, grocery, trades and other needed sectors can receive $1,000 payment through the South Dakota Retailers Association and its “$1,000 Workforce Incentive” push. SDRA, a partner organization for dozens of companies, is launching the $1,000 payment to supplement any hiring bonuses or other incentives straight to new employees, according to a press release Monday. The cash payout would supplement any hiring bonuses or other incentives offered by an individual business. The incentive will be paid directly to an employee hired from out of state to work in a Retailers Association member business. To be eligible, an employee must work at least 30 hours per week for 90 days at a physical location in South Dakota. Additional eligibility details are available at www.sdra.org.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The Grand Ole Opry’s broadcast of its 5,000th Saturday show attracted a host of big country music stars to its historic venue. Garth Brooks, Trisha Yearwood, Darius Rucker, Vince Gill, Chris Young and a half-dozen others lined up to celebrate the nearly century-old country music program. The radio broadcast was carried by WSM radio, the same station on which it debuted as the “Barn Dance” program in 1925. Bill Anderson, a 60-year Opry veteran, kicked off the show with the Roy Acuff tune “Wabash Cannonball.” Singer Vince Gill played an acoustic guitar he said was once owned by Opry star Sam McGee. Gill said McGee first played the famed radio program in 1926, months before the barn dance program became known as the Grand Ole Opry. Brooks and Yearwood closed the show with a set of several songs before Brooks ended with his country classic “Friends in Low Places.” “Happy 5,000 to the Grand Ole Opry,” Brooks said. “Can’t tell you how lucky we feel to be a part of it.”\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The city’s school district is defying a request from a Republican state lawmaker for select school districts to investigate and catalog library and classroom books related to race, gender identity or sexuality. District spokesman Jason Stanford said in an email Friday that district officials “decided that a response is not necessary, especially since anyone can search our library catalogues on this website.” Rep. Matt Krause, R-Fort Worth, chairman of the Texas House General Investigating Committee, made the request to select superintendents and Texas Education Agency deputy commissioner Lily Laux in a letter with a list of more than 800 books for districts to check against library and classroom collections. The letter appears to have been sent to large urban and suburban school districts across the state, said Joy Baskin, director of legal services for the Texas Association of School Boards. The list includes award-winning books on race and social justice, as well as health books and guides, including “The Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine” and titles on sexually transmitted diseases. The letter also called on districts to identify other books or content addressing “human sexuality” and “material that might make students feel discomfort ... or convey that a student, by virtue of their race or sex, is inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously,” mirroring language in a new Texas law targeting classroom discussions of such topics.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: The city, the 2021 DOCUTAH International Film Festival, and Art Around the Corner are collaborating to bring a mural to life for the public. Artists featured in the films “Alice Street and Prophets” and “Teachers & Kings” will create a mural on the side of the Electric Theatre in real time during the festival, which began Monday. This year’s mural will be a mix of artistry and an ode to filmmakers in the form of Charlie Chaplin filming a Shivwits powwow dancer and a jazz band with an artist using a paintbrush to depict the scene. Artists Desi Mundo and Pancho Peskador will be the featured artists. Initially, the films were set for 2020, but the COVID-19 pandemic put them on hold. The artists and films are now back for the 100-film festival and in what DOCUTAH considers an expanded edition of the festival. “This public space mural is intended to remind us that with understanding our past and looking toward our future, St. George continues to be a vibrant and welcoming place for all to enjoy,” said Rhondalon Crawford, Board Chair of the Art Around the Corner Foundation. “The partnership with DOCUTAH and the City of St. George demonstrates the commitment our community has to all of the arts and to providing our citizens and visitors with a wide variety of artistic experiences.”\n\nVermont\n\nWinooski: State educational officials will ban spectators from a high school boys soccer state semifinal this week, following alleged racist behavior and overly rough gameplay between two schools’ players earlier this year. The Vermont Principals’ Association said in a statement Monday that “this decision has been made to ensure the physical and emotional safety of all student-athletes involved.” Winooski High School has said that during the first home game of the season, its players were targeted with racial slurs by Enosburg High School’s players and fans. There’s also a separate investigation into Winooski players getting violent with Enosburg players during that Sept. 18 game, which ended in a 3-2 Winooski win. In response to the alleged racial abuse during the game, Enosburg conducted an internal investigation but found no evidence of wrongdoing. However, the school said its report was incomplete without interviewing Winooski players, who declined to participate in the investigation. Winooski’s school officials said they believe what their student-athletes reported about the racial abuse from Enosburg. Winooski Athletics Director Sam Jackson has characterized the school as Vermont’s most diverse high school.\n\nVirginia\n\nWilliamsburg: A schoolhouse where enslaved and free Black children were taught before the Revolutionary War will be moved from the William & Mary campus to Colonial Williamsburg and restored to its original state, officials announced Friday. The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation is buying the building that housed the Bray School, the university and foundation said in a news release. Once modern additions to the building are removed, it will be moved a few blocks to the living history museum’s campus, where it will be restored and incorporated into the foundation’s public history programming. “This nondescript building that was hidden in plain sight for decades is taking the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation and William & Mary in a new and exciting direction,” Colonial Williamsburg President and CEO Cliff Fleet said. “This important work will expand our understanding of 18th-century America and add to our body of knowledge about this important time in our nation’s history.” The university says the building is likely the oldest surviving schoolhouse for African Americans. It will be the first addition to Williamsburg’s collection of historic buildings since the 1960s. The foundation expects to restore the building by 2024, the 250th anniversary of the school’s closure just before the Revolutionary War.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: The former Spokane County health officer who believes he was fired last year due to unpopular decisions he made to try to contain COVID-19 has filed a claim with the health district, which could lead to a lawsuit. The Spokesman-Review reports Dr. Bob Lutz filed the administrative claim Oct. 8. Robert Carlson, Lutz’s attorney, said the hope is that the district determines Lutz’s claim has merit and works to resolve the issue out of court. Lutz is claiming at least $1.4 million in damages for wrongful termination in addition to “defamation, emotional distress, mental anguish and injury to professional reputation” as a result of his firing in October 2020. The health district has 60 days to respond to Lutz’s claim, at which point Lutz could proceed with a lawsuit. The claim details several examples of alleged political pressure and tension between Lutz and certain Board of Health members throughout 2020, especially when the county was stuck in limited phases due to COVID-19 case rates. “I took a stand for Public Health. It cost me my job,” Lutz said in a statement released through his attorney. “As a public health physician, it has been my responsibility to protect the public’s health and safety.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: Marshall University has launched its newly formed Institute for Cyber Security. Marshall President Jerome Gilbert said the institute is an academic and research cluster that will support cybersecurity-related programs across the campus. “We can do research and teaching to expand our presence in the cyber arena,” Gilbert said. The new center will work to address emerging needs in cybersecurity, the Charleston Gazette-Mail reports. David Dampier, dean of the College of Engineering and Computer Sciences, said it is designed to tap into a new mix of students and early-career professionals and connect those learners with top cybersecurity talent in the region. The institute is housed in the university’s Applied Engineering Complex.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gun dealers in the state are struggling to keep shelves stocked with ammunition. Supply chain disruptions from the coronavirus pandemic and increased demand for guns and ammunition have left shelves empty in some cases. And when a shipment does arrive at local gun stores, ammunition is quickly snapped up. Tony Blattler, of Phillips, watched as employees unloaded a shipment of .270 Winchester hunting cartridges recently at the Fleet Farm in Marshfield. Not long after, about two dozen people had filed into the store, grabbing ammunition as fast as workers could unload it, Wisconsin Public Radio reports. “Probably by within an hour or two, they were sold out of that ammunition just by word of mouth,” Blattler said. Pat Kukull, owner of Superior Shooters Supply, said the store had a shortage of shotgun ammunition for trap shooting over the summer, with vendors sending maybe 2% of the usual 500 cases it might receive. She said there’s been “absolutely nothing” for those hunting pheasant, grouse or waterfowl. “Now, we’re moving into rifle season, and we haven’t had any .30-30 shells in a year to speak of, really,” Kukull said. Across Wisconsin, background checks for handguns surged 174% last year from 2019, according to the Wisconsin Department of Justice.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Employee transition efforts are ramping up with just a few weeks left before the state’s last underground coal mine shutters. The long-anticipated closure of the Bridger Underground Coal Mine was originally expected to affect 94 mine workers, according to the layoff notice sent to the Rock Springs City Council a month ago. The number of affected staff has since fallen to 89 and is continuing to shrink as staff leave to start new jobs, the Casper-Star Tribune reports. Rocky Mountain Power, whose subsidiary Bridger Coal Company owns the mine, hosted a job fair last month at which the workers it’s not retaining were able to interview with other mining companies. Two of the five companies were from out of state, meaning new hires would have to leave Rock Springs for work. But Rocky Mountain Power is also collaborating with Western Wyoming Community College in an effort to help underground mine workers access vocational training programs. Many will qualify for federal retraining funds targeting displaced coal workers. Employees’ existing skills also translate well to other mining jobs, including in the trona industry, which produces a source of soda ash, said Rick Lee, CEO of the Rock Springs Chamber of Commerce. The Green River Basin trona patch is about 40 miles from Rock Springs.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/04/26/school-satan-club-plane-swap-fail-amazon-helix-news-around-states/50142737/", "title": "After School Satan Club, plane swap fail: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: The state will remember the Holocaust, the systematic slaughter of Jews and other people by Nazis, with events planned for this week in Montgomery and Birmingham. The Alabama Holocaust Commission is sponsoring an annual gathering of remembrance Tuesday at the Alabama Department of Archives and History in the capital. A child survivor of the Holocaust, Inge Auerbacher, is scheduled to speak, and a state proclamation will be presented. A commemoration will also be held Thursday at Temple Beth-El in Birmingham. The program will feature George Nathan, the son of Alabama Holocaust survivors Henry and Sophie Nathan. The family lived in both Anniston and Birmingham after arriving in the United States. About 6 million people were killed by the Nazis in the early 1940s during World War II. The state Holocaust commission holds events each year to remember the victims.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Legislators are considering a request by Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s administration that the state take over part of a federal environmental permitting program, though some members of the state Senate’s budget-writing committee have expressed concerns with the potential costs. Administration officials have said the idea behind the proposal is to speed the construction of roads, bridges, mines and drilling projects, the Anchorage Daily News reports. While the state would have to follow federal standards, critics of the proposal say the state has traditionally favored development and underfunded oversight capabilities. Industry groups say the current permitting process is too slow. The House included a $4.9 million increase to the budget of the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, which expects to hire 28 new staff members. The funding was part of the House version of the state operating budget, which passed earlier this month; senators currently are working on their version. If the proposed increase is approved, department officials plan a two-year process to take over part of the federal Clean Water Act known as Section 404. Permits issued under that section determine whether a developer can fill wetlands, rivers or other bodies of water during construction.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Aviation history wasn’t made Sunday night, but disaster was avoided, as cousins Luke Aikins and Andy Farrington were unsuccessful in completing the first-ever “plane swap.” One plane spiraled out of control as the two pilots were thousands of feet in the air. Both pilots were safe with no reported injuries. The Red Bull-sponsored flight, which took place at an undisclosed location in Arizona, began as the two pilots ascended to the skies about 5:45 p.m. local time. Nearly an hour later, the two jumped out at 12,100 feet in the air with the airbrake system engaged on both planes. Aikins was able to successfully get into the other plane, but Farrington was unable to do the same. The plane spiraled out of control as Farrington could be heard saying on-air: “Blue plane is out of control.” Farrington then deployed his parachute and safely landed in a remote area. The uncontrolled plane had a parachute on it that automatically activated when it got to a certain altitude, and it was deployed before touching the ground. The condition and location of the plane weren’t immediately known. The 6-mile-per-hour winds created good conditions for the stunt, the pilots said leading up to the stunt, as the area had faster winds in the days leading up to the event. But Farrington was unsure what happened.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Friday said he was refusing most of $146 million in federal pandemic rental assistance the state was to receive, citing the state’s low unemployment rate and economic climate. With Hutchinson’s decision, Arkansas joins Nebraska in turning down the latest round of pandemic rental assistance funds. Hutchinson, a Republican, asked U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen that the state be allowed to use 39% of the funds — about $60 million — for “housing stability” programs offered by nonprofit groups that would include job training, education and treatment as well as some rental assistance. Arkansas still has about $20 million from the first round of rental assistance that was given to states. “Our economy has returned, there’s jobs aplenty out there and we have existing programs in place for rental assistance that were pre-pandemic,” Hutchinson told reporters at a news conference at the Capitol.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Nearly 2,000 homeless people died in Los Angeles County during the first year of the pandemic, an increase of 56% from the previous year, driven mainly by drug overdoses, authorities said. The findings released Friday in a report from the county’s Department of Public Health showed that despite initial fears, the coronavirus itself was not the main culprit in deaths among California’s largest-in-the-nation unhoused population. But it did cut people off from mental health and substance abuse treatment after services were drastically reduced to prevent the spread of the virus. Between April 1, 2020, and March 31, 2021, the county recorded 1,988 deaths of homeless people, up from 1,271 deaths during the same period a year earlier, the report said. During both of those years, drug overdoses were the leading cause of death, but they increased by 78% in the pandemic’s first year. In the pre-pandemic year, the Department of Public Health reported 402 fatal overdoses. In the year after the outbreak, the number nearly doubled to 715, the report said. The report found that 179 homeless people died from COVID-19 during the pandemic’s first year. A San Francisco study released last month showed similar findings: Between March 2020 and March 2021, there were 331 homeless deaths recorded in San Francisco, more than twice the number of any previous year, with the leading cause of death being drug overdose, according to a study conducted by the University of California San Francisco and the city’s Department of Public Health.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: Heading into what experts speculate may be one of the worst summers of wildfire the state has seen, Gov. Jared Polis and state fire officials are preparing for the future. “We are vastly improving our year-round fire response, expanding our arsenal of world-class firefighting tools and continuing to activate every tool we have to help our communities prepare for and respond to the threat of wildfires and climate change,” Polis said in a press release Friday. In the past two years, Colorado has experienced the three largest wildfires in state history – the Cameron Peak Fire, the East Troublesome Fire and the Pine Gulch Fire – and just five months ago it saw the most destructive fire in state history, the Marshall Fire. Just last week brought wildfires in Monte Vista, near Longmont; between Gypsum and Dotsero, in Custer County; and northeast of Las Animas, according to state officials. “Colorado could very well be headed towards the worst wildfire season in the state’s history. We need to take action,” state Senate President Steve Fenberg said. He is supporting legislation that would invest $15 million in first responders and communities to improve the state’s emergency dispatch system and add a second air tanker and two high-quality helicopters. The bill would also create the Office of Climate Preparedness.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew London: The recent appearance of two cruise ships in the city has raised hopes that Connecticut might stand to benefit from the return of an industry decimated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The two ships, part of American Queen Voyages, were on a tour of the East Coast and Canada and were the first cruise ships to stop in New London in four years. Both are scheduled to stop in New London on the way back south in the fall. The ships each brought about 90 passengers and 75 crew members and were met with gift bags, discounts in local restaurants and a driving tour of the city. Connecticut also has deep-water ports in New Haven and Bridgeport that can handle large ships, but the state often isn’t seen as a cruise destination. “It’s encouraging that with the industry just really trying to make a comeback, they picked New London,” Mayor Michael Passero told the New Haven Register. Connecticut ports could benefit from Canada’s reopening its own ports to cruises after two years, as well as from industry trends toward more domestic routes and smaller ships that cater to an older clientele, said Chris Gray Faust, managing editor of consumer review site Cruise Critic. “There has been a pivot toward more domestic cruises,” Gray Faust told the newspaper. “Some of these ports are ones that you don’t think of as cruise ports, necessarily.”\n\nDelaware\n\nNew Castle: The Wall That Heals, a traveling replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, is returning to the First State on Tuesday. The Vietnam War memorial will be escorted by Delaware State Police and veterans on motorcycles to New Castle, where it will be met by students and volunteers at Southern Elementary School about 1:45 p.m. Tuesday and at William Penn High school about 2:30 p.m. The Wall That Heals is a mobile exhibit that features a three-quarter scale replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. The replica, built in 1996, stands 7 feet 6 inches high at its tallest point and 375 feet long. Similar to the original, it is erected in a chevron shape and allows visitors to do name rubbings of individual service members’ names. Visitors can also experience the Wall rising above them as they walk toward the apex, a key feature of the Washington memorial. After arrival at William Penn High School – the first school in the nation to host the wall – the setup will begin Wednesday. The Wall will be open to the public 24 hours a day, starting Friday and ending Sunday at 2 p.m. More than 100 volunteers are needed to guard the wall, help with parking and assist with events in the coming days. An opening ceremony begins at 9 a.m. Thursday with a Prisoner of War keynote speaker. A candlelight vigil will be held at 8 p.m. Saturday to read the names of Hometown Heroes from the exhibit with a procession along the wall and a 21-gun salute.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Jon Stewart, accepting the Kennedy Center’s Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, warned Sunday night that speculation about the future of comedy amid increased audience cultural sensitivity was ignoring a true and enduring threat: authoritarian governments around the world. “Comedy doesn’t change the world, but it’s a bellwether,” Stewart said. “When a society feels under threat, comedians are who gets sent away first.” Stewart pointed in the audience to Egyptian comedian Bassem Youssef, whose Stewart-inspired political comedy show earned him both fame and self-imposed exile. Youssef’s story is “an example of the true threat to comedy,” Stewart said. The intersection of comedy and politics was the main theme as celebrities and comedy royalty gathered to honor Stewart, who set the modern template for mixing the topics during his 16-year run hosting TV’s “The Daily Show.” Stewart, the 23rd recipient of the prize, was honored in testimonials from fellow comedians and previous Mark Twain Prize recipients. And his political influence was apparent Sunday from a guest list that included House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and White House press secretary Jen Psaki. This was the first Mark Twain ceremony since Dave Chappelle’s in 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic scuttled the event in 2020 and 2021.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: The judge overseeing jury selection for a man who murdered 17 people at a high school declared Monday that the process will start over, conceding she should have questioned 11 potential jurors who said they would not follow the law before she dismissed them. In granting the motion filed by Nikolas Cruz’s prosecutors over the strong objection of his attorneys, Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer nullified two weeks of work by prosecution and defense lawyers, forcing them to begin the entire process anew Monday. As a result, almost 250 potential jurors who had said they could sit for a four-month trial will not be called back next month for further questioning. More than 1,200 candidates had been screened. Prosecutor Carolyn McCann made her argument after miscommunication caused 11 jurors who were improperly dismissed by Scherer two weeks ago not to be told to return to court Monday as had been planned for further questioning. Scherer said they would be brought in next week, but McCann argued that more time would be wasted if it turned out the potential jurors had to be struck anyway. She said the prosecution has just as much right to question potential jurors and to an untainted final panel as the defense. “This is not harmless error,” McCann said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Officials have put the brakes on the city’s largest road race. The Rock ’n’ Roll Marathon has brought tens of thousands of runners to Georgia’s picturesque founding city since first adding Savannah to its race roster in 2011. But Mayor Van Johnson said the city won’t be granting marathon organizers a permit or paying the $25,000 contract fee this year. Organizers released a statement saying a comeback in 2023 appears unlikely. They had intended to return to Savannah this fall, and runners had been registering for the race before City Hall announced its decision. Johnson told news outlets Savannah needs a break from the marathon to evaluate whether it’s worth the cost – not just in taxpayer money for sanitation and extra police but also in hassles to residents and businesses affected by street closures. He said the city has recouped “a relatively very small percentage” of what it has spent on the event. Visit Savannah, the city’s tourism bureau, reported the 2019 marathon had an economic impact of $23 million. Michael Owens, president of Savannah’s Tourism Leadership Council, said the race gave the city’s hospitality industry a needed shot in the arm during what’s otherwise a slow period for tourists right before the holidays. “To be honest with you, it’s devastating,” Owens told WTOC-TV. “I’ve gotten more phone calls about this than anything. I’ve gotten more calls about the cancellation of Rock ’n’ Roll than I did in the beginning of the pandemic.”\n\nHawaii\n\nWahiawa: The only skilled nursing and rehabilitation facility in central Oahu expects to close this summer. Wahiawa General Hospital said it plans to close its long-term nursing center July 22, citing insufficient insurance reimbursements and continued financial challenges, Hawaii News Now reports. It’s also been struggling to hire and retain staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. Wahiawa General, a small independent hospital, had received millions in taxpayers dollars to keep it afloat in the past, but it is still losing over a million dollars a year. It also doesn’t have the money to improve existing facilities, such as the long-term nursing center, which was built in 1966. Hospital administrators said many of the patients in Wahiawa are covered by the Supplemental Security Income program or Medicaid, which have low reimbursement rates. The long-term care center has 115 beds, according to its website. It currently has 60 patients. John McDermott, the state’s long-term care ombudsman, said Hawaii can’t afford to lose nursing homes, especially when the state’s senior population is increasing so rapidly. The nearest alternatives for skilled nursing and rehabilitation are in Kaneohe and Pearl City. Wahiawa General is giving 90 days’ notice and helping to relocate patients.\n\nIdaho\n\nLewiston: Jurors convicted a 17-year-old boy of first-degree murder after about three hours of deliberation Thursday. Demetri Ewing and his father Clyde Ewing were both charged with first-degree murder in connection with the Jan. 8, 2021, shooting death of Samuel Johns, The Lewiston Tribune reports. Clyde Ewing has pleaded not guilty, and his trial is scheduled to begin May 16. Ewing, who was 16 at the time of the shooting, was charged as an adult and could face up to life in prison when he is sentenced in June. During Demetri Ewing’s nearly two-week trial, Nez Perce County prosecutors said the father and son were in the midst of a family dispute over a missing gun and an Army bag that had belonged to Clyde Ewing’s late father. Prosecutors said the pair believed the bag had been left at Johns’ home, so they left their motel in Clarkston, Washington, and rode bicycles to Johns’ residence in the neighboring town of Lewiston, Idaho. Nez Perce County Prosecutor Justin Coleman said the Ewings used zipper-style cable ties to bind the hands of a woman in the home, and that one of them shot and killed Johns. Under Idaho law, prosecutors are not required to prove which defendant killed someone, only that a person was killed in the process of another planned felony like a burglary.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A man seen on video wheeling a bulky suitcase out of a woman’s apartment has been acquitted of murder. Cook County Judge Diana Kenworthy noted a lack of evidence against Jimmy Jackson, 75, and said the video was not enough to convict him. Daisy Hayes, 65, disappeared in 2018. Family members were stunned by the verdict Friday. “All I could do is scream and just run out the courtroom – like, what didn’t you see?” daughter Teresa Smith said of the video. Jackson, 75, and Hayes, 65, had an intermittent relationship. “You see him struggling with this suitcase. You see him actually put the suitcase in the dumpster. You actually see him take garbage from other dumpsters to put on top of her so it can be concealed,” Smith said. Jackson was arrested in Tennessee after Daisy disappeared.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Local native and 12-time Grammy-winning singer and producer Babyface will headline the Madam Walker Legacy Center on June 17 as part of a weekend­long Juneteenth celebration at the historic theater. Tours of the newly remodeled center, a family-friendly outdoor block party and other musical performances will be spread throughout Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Babyface, whose given name is Kenneth Edmonds, will also be inducted into the Madam Walker Legacy Center Walk of Fame. His credits include some 250 top-10 R&B and pop hits, working with the likes of Beyoncé, Aretha Franklin and Whitney Houston. He last performed in Indianapolis on the free stage of the Indiana State Fair in August.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The local school district plans to hold a series of discussions to address school violence following a shooting outside East High School last month. The five public meetings will give the school community a chance to talk about concerns related to violence in schools and communities and how to begin healing from the shooting death of Jose Lopez-Perez, 15. While Des Moines Public Schools is hosting the events, outside community groups will guide the conversations. Lopez-Perez was shot and killed outside the school March 7. Also injured were East High School students Kemery Ortega, 18, and Jessica Lopez, 16. Ten teenagers have been charged with Lopez-Perez’s death and the shooting. The meetings’ topics will be guided using information gleaned from earlier conversations with student following the shooting. East High School students focused their discussion on student health and well-being, school climate, culture, and safety, said Madeline Cano, the East community school coordinator. Students also said they wanted to see the school “bounce back from COVID.” The community school coordinators help support students and families within Des Moines schools and the community.\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: A Wyandotte County judge struck down a GOP-authored congressional map enacted earlier this year and ordered the Legislature to take steps to address what he considered to be gerrymandered district lines. It is the first time a state-level judge has waded into redistricting for the U.S. House, though the ruling is all but certain to be appealed, setting up a showdown at the Kansas Supreme Court. Wyandotte County District Court Judge Bill Klapper called the maps passed over the veto of Gov. Laura Kelly earlier this year “motivated at least in part by an intent to dilute minority voting strength” and said state courts had the right to take up redistricting cases. Three lawsuits were filed challenging the map, arguing the new district lines illicitly divide the Kansas City area and improperly place Lawrence in the sweeping 1st Congressional District dominated by western Kansas. Supporters say the decision to divide Wyandotte and Johnson counties, as well as splitting Kansas City between the 3rd and 2nd districts, was born out of simple math, with population growing in the region. But critics argue the endeavor amounted to nothing more than racial and political gerrymandering, something cited by Klapper in his 200-plus-page opinion that quoted everything from the French philosopher Montesquieu to folk music.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: An arson unit is investigating after a fire destroyed a synagogue and worship center on the final day of Passover. Rabbi Avrohom Litvin, regional director of Chabad of Kentucky, said the blaze started as a grease fire in a building adjoining Louisville’s Chabad House early Saturday, WDRB-TV reports. Firefighters brought it under control, but it apparently rekindled around noon, and the Chabad House caught fire. Litvin said the Chabad House was quickly engulfed in flames, and the roof collapsed. No one was injured, but the sanctuary and nearly everything in it was destroyed, Litvin said. Only the Torah scrolls were rescued, having been removed that morning for an off-site remembrance service due to electricity being cut off at the synagogue. Litvin said it was a “miracle” the 75 congregants – including 25 children – were not in the synagogue at the time of the larger fire and in harm’s way. “There’s a story of a man who was on his way to a big vacation, and he breaks his leg, and he feels so bad that God let his leg be broken just before his vacation,” he said. “And then he reads that the plane went down, and he says, ‘God saved my life by breaking my leg.’ “So I absolutely see the hand of God here. ... Yes, this leg got broken; the core of the building is gone. But we can rebuild the building.” Litvin said officials told him they have not uncovered any evidence of arson, though their investigation is ongoing, including determining if the second fire was a reignition of the first.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A small, historically Black university known for its success in getting graduates into medical school announced Thursday that it is now planning its own medical school. The coronavirus pandemic emphasized the need for greater diversity in medicine because representation and trust are part of the reasons for health disparities affecting underrepresented populations, said Reynold Verret, president of Xavier University of Louisiana. “Xavier was founded with the mission of promoting the creation of a just and humane society through education,” he said in a news release announcing plans for a medical school and graduate school of health sciences in New Orleans. “The establishment of graduate education programs dedicated to the preparation of more black healthcare professionals is a natural extension of our foundress’ legacy as we approach our second century of service. It is also where we are called to answer a critical need of our nation.” For decades, the Catholic school founded in 1925 has graduated more African American students and students of color who go on to get medical degrees and health doctorates than any other higher education institution in the U.S., the news release said.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Democratic Gov. Janet Mills asked tribal chiefs and legislative leaders in a letter made public Monday to drop their effort to amend a 1980 land settlement deal that gave the state of Maine some governmental power over tribes. Mills said the proposal to expand tribal sovereignty could be a setback in tribal relations with her administration, instead of building on recent successes. “I do not wish to have a confrontation,” she wrote in the letter. “It would serve no constructive purpose and only inflame emotions on all sides of the discussion.” The letter was written Thursday night, the day before the bill failed to advance in the appropriations committee. Maggie Dana, chief of the Passamaquoddy Tribe at Pleasant Point, said previously she hoped the governor would be “on the right side of history” and agree to the long-sought changes. For the tribes, it has been a long, frustrating battle since they traded some rights to the state under the $81.5 million Maine Indian Land Claims Settlement Act of 1980, signed by President Jimmy Carter. Because of the settlement, tribes in Maine have less autonomy than tribes elsewhere across the country, and their reservations are treated like municipalities, subject to state law. Critics of extending tribal sovereignty feared there could be unintended consequences and further litigation if that changed.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: A potentially lucrative revenue stream for struggling commercial fishermen and women could become a reality as the state begins to research a shrimp fishery in Maryland’s warming waters. The bill, introduced by state Sen. Mary Beth Carozza, R-Worcester, would allow the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to establish a shrimp fishery pilot program for certain commercial licenses. “As a lifelong commercial fisherman, I have seen changes to our environment, our fisheries and our livelihood,” said Sonny Gwin, a fisherman based in Ocean City. “An abundant amount of shrimp has been seen in Maryland waters, both in the Atlantic Ocean and its tributaries. We would like to have the opportunity to participate.” Gwin said the first step in diversifying the industry on the Delmarva Peninsula is understanding the impact it could have. Warming waters in the Atlantic Ocean are among the reasons much of the seafood caught off Maryland’s coast is becoming more diverse. White shrimp, which typically thrive in the Gulf of Mexico and south Atlantic Ocean, used to only venture as far north as North Carolina in any significant numbers. But as water temperatures rise off the coast of Maryland, shrimp have moved farther north.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nNantucket: Scientists at MIT are proposing releasing hordes of genetically altered mice on the posh vacation destination of Nantucket to combat the growing scourge of Lyme disease. Researchers with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab’s Mice Against Ticks project explained their plan to residents of the island off Cape Cod at a recent meeting, The Boston Globe reports. The scientists said hundreds of thousands of native white-footed mice engineered to resist the bacteria that causes Lyme could help slow disease transmission. They say if Lyme were less prevalent among mice, then fewer ticks would contract the disease, leading to less cases among humans. The proposal would require review from regulators, not to mention local support, but Joanna Buchthal, the project’s research director, argues the idea offers a “real, if revolutionary, way” to address the disease. “With so many people suffering from Lyme every single day, which is an awful disease, we need a solution urgently,” she told the newspaper. Nantucket is one of Massachusetts’ hot spots for Lyme disease, which is now the most common infectious disease on the island, the Globe reports. Incidents of Lyme disease have nearly doubled nationwide since 1991, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nMichigan\n\nTaylor: A person taking part in a suburban Detroit police training program suffered a gunshot wound and was hospitalized, Michigan State Police said. The shooting happened Sunday afternoon during the exercise at a Taylor city park for the city’s volunteer auxiliary police program. The civilian was a “role player” in a training scenario when an auxiliary officer in the training fired a shot from his service revolver, hitting the person in the abdomen, state police said. The person was taken to a hospital in stable condition. State police investigators were reviewing the shooting at the request of Taylor police. The volunteers with Taylor’s auxiliary police assist the city police force during emergencies and help with other duties such as home and business checks and anti-crime programs, according to the city website.\n\nMinnesota\n\nCrookston: Volunteers and National Guard members in northwestern Minnesota spent two days sandbagging to fortify the city from an expected record flood along the Red Lake River. Gov. Tim Walz authorized 100 members of the Guard to assist with the flood fight after heavy rains forced the the tributary of the Red River to spill its banks. At least 50 Guard members were on hand over the weekend to aid efforts through Sunday. The National Weather Service has been predicting the Red Lake River to near 29 feet Monday or Tuesday. The record high water mark was 28.4 feet in 1997. No injuries or damages have been reported, and the city has not asked anyone to evacuate, Crookston Police Chief Darin Selzler said. Officials were switching from a sandbagging to monitoring stage late Sunday, the Crookston Times reports. Several counties in the northwestern Minnesota region have declared local emergencies and activated their emergency plans, according to Walz’s office. Many county roads were covered with water or washed out, and officials warned motorists about attempting to drive through flooded areas. The Red Lake River flows into the Red River at East Grand Forks and Grand Forks, North Dakota, where officials from both cities have started to activate permanent flood protection measures.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state is enacting a new law that says state and local government agencies cannot withhold services or refuse jobs to people who choose not to get vaccinated against COVID-19. The ban applies to state agencies, city and county governments and schools, community colleges and universities. COVID-19 vaccination mandates have not been widespread in Mississippi, but some lawmakers said they were acting against the possibility of government overreach. Republican Gov. Tate Reeves said Friday that he had signed House Bill 1509, and it became law immediately. “Government shouldn’t be in the business of forcing Americans to choose between the COVID-19 vaccine & putting food on their tables, sending their kids to school, or visiting a small business,” Reeves said on Twitter. The law specifies that COVID-19 vaccinations cannot be required for children to attend school or day care. It does not change Mississippi’s other childhood vaccination requirements, which are some of most stringent in the nation. The law also says anyone in Mississippi can cite “a sincerely held religious objection” to avoid a public or private employer’s COVID-19 vaccination mandate.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A bill approved by the state Senate would impose limits on Missouri’s public records law to exclude certain types of documents and communications and no longer classify some meetings of elected officials as “public.” Senate Bill 741 was initially designed to limit personal information of constituents from being public in records requested by members of the public but was amended Thursday by Sen. Andrew Koenig, R-St. Louis, to include a litany of other adjustments to the Missouri Sunshine Law. The law allows for members of the public, press and other organizations to request and acquire government documents. Under the bill, documents and communications “that do not have substantial administrative or operational value” would not be considered public records and could thus be made unobtainable through a request. “A lot of times when you’re working on a bill, you’re going to go through many drafts, and you want to be able to think out loud with your staff a little bit, and it might not even be a good idea,” Koenig said. “When it’s not a working document, I think it’s appropriate for that to not necessarily be public.” The legislation allows the state to close any document kept by lawmakers and staff “that contains information regarding proposed legislation or the legislative process.”\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A judge has temporarily blocked enforcement of a state law that required transgender people to have undergone a “surgical procedure” before being allowed to change the sex listed on their birth certificates. District Judge Michael Moses of Billings ruled Thursday that the law is unconstitutionally vague because it does not specify what surgical procedure must be performed. The law also required transgender people to obtain a court order indicating they’d had a surgical procedure. Because he could grant the temporary injunction based on the vagueness issue, Moses said he did not further analyze the constitutionality of the law. “We are thrilled that the court recognized the substantial and unnecessary burdens this law places upon transgender individuals in violation of their constitutional rights,” said Akilah Lane, staff attorney at the ACLU of Montana, which challenged the law. The plaintiffs – Amelia Marquez, of Billings, and a transgender man who is not identified in court records – wanted to change the sex on their birth certificates without undergoing costly surgical procedures. Both argue having a birth certificate that does not match their gender identity puts them at risk of embarrassment, discrimination, harassment or violence if they are asked to provide their birth certificate.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Google says it will invest more than $750 million in the state in 2022, including construction of a data center in Omaha. The Omaha World-Herald reports the investment also includes an expansion of Google’s existing data center in Papillion. Company leaders did not provide specific financial details for that or any of the other projects during an event with elected leaders in Papillion. The new northwest Omaha data center will be the third Google data center to open in the region. Along with the facility in Papillion, Google has one in Council Bluffs. The Nebraska projects are part of Google’s investment of about $9.5 billion in offices and data centers across the U.S. A company official said Google didn’t have any job figures for the Omaha area.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: An electric scooter sharing program years in the making has finally launched. The City Council approved an exclusive three-year franchising deal with Bird, a company that partners with cities to provide e-scooters and e-bikes. On Thursday, city officials and Bird representatives met for a ribbon-cutting ceremony to mark the official start of the program, which aims to bolster “micromobility” transport options downtown and in Midtown. Bird’s e-scooter fleet will deploy in phases over the next eight weeks, with the full fleet reaching approximately 1,000 scooters, a schedule released by City Council shows. The program operates at no cost to the city, which will receive a cut of every scooter ride around town. Riders will pay $1 to start the vehicle and 39 cents a minute thereafter, with Reno receiving 25 cents per ride and $20 per scooter in registration fees, though certain riders can get a 50% discount. The Bird deal has been years in the making as the city opted for a cautious approach to reimplementing an electric vehicle sharing program after its first partner, Lime, saw its electric bikes vandalized at the rate of nine per week in 2018.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state Senate has killed a proposed expansion of New Hampshire’s education tax credit program, arguing it would diminish the benefits for current beneficiaries. House Bill 1298 would have raised the upper income limit for the state’s tax credit scholarship program from 300% of the federal poverty level to 500%. Created in 2013, the program provides scholarships for students by allowing businesses to donate to the scholarship fund that administers the program and receive a credit on their business taxes. The scholarships may be used for private school tuition. Advocates for the bill had argued that the expansion would allow the program to boost families in the middle class. Currently, the program can benefit any family of four making up to $83,250 per year; expanding it would allow a family of four making up to $138,750 to access the funds. But a bipartisan group of state senators said the expansion would only mean more students would be competing for the same pool of funds donated by businesses. “The (Senate education) committee heard concerns about the neediest of students receiving less funding from this tax credit program as this bill would open the pool to a larger population of students,” said Sen. Denise Ricciardi, R-Bedford Republican.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nOcean City: The developers of a wind energy farm off the southern New Jersey coast said Monday they have hired two companies to connect the project to the electrical grid on land. Ocean Wind 1 has signed contracts with companies that will build electrical substations on land and run power lines from the offshore wind farm to the onshore connection points. Ocean Wind 1 – a joint venture between Orsted, the Danish wind power company, and Newark-based PSEG – hired JINGOLI Power LLC and Burns & McDonnell Engineering Company Inc. The moves come as New Jersey is working aggressively to become the East Coast hub of the fast-growing offshore wind energy industry. In February, six companies bid a combined $4.37 billion for the right to build wind energy projects on the ocean floor off New Jersey and New York in the U.S. government’s largest such auction in history. Before that happened, New Jersey’s Board of Public Utilities approved three offshore wind energy projects: two by Orsted and one by Atlantic Shores. Those three projects combined aim to provide enough electricity to power more than 1.6 million homes. The Ocean Wind 1 project is among those three and could provide enough power for 500,000 homes.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nCarlsbad: State environmental regulators are reviewing plans submitted by Mosaic Potash to investigate and define the extent of groundwater contamination from discharges associated with potash mining along the Pecos River in southern New Mexico. The state Environment Department announced earlier this month that contamination had been detected in nearby groundwater monitoring wells between the company’s Laguna Grande lake and the river. As a result, the company was required to submit a plan for monitoring and dealing with the pollution. Potash mining is a main economic driver in Eddy County. A salt rich in potassium, potash is used mostly as a plant fertilizer and in animal feed. Carlsbad was the site of potash’s first discovery in North America in 1925 during oil drilling. The discovery led to a boom in development in the former ranching town that predated the area’s prominence in fossil fuels. Mosaic’s mine, about 16 miles east of Carlsbad, produces the ore both through its underground mining and via surface operations. Waste resulting from mining the ore is moved around the facility into multiple disposal areas, potentially leeching into groundwater supplies. Extracting potash from underground generates tailings that are disposed of along with salty brine water.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Several dozen teachers and other school employees in the city who officials said submitted fraudulent proof of COVID-19 vaccination were placed on leave as of Monday. The United Federation of Teachers is challenging the disciplinary action, which it says violates its collective bargaining agreement. The employees in question were placed on leave after investigators determined they had provided false vaccine cards, a spokesperson for the city Department of Education said. “Fraudulent vaccination cards are not only illegal, they also undermine the best line of protection our schools have against COVID-19 – universal adult vaccination,” the spokesperson, Nathaniel Styer, said in a statement. “We immediately moved to put these employees – fewer than 100 – on leave without pay.” A COVID-19 vaccination mandate took effect for New York City school employees last fall and was later expanded to include all city employees. The school vaccination rule was a key component of the city’s policy of opening all classrooms to in-person learning this academic year, rather than offering a remote option as some school districts did. The UFT said in a notice of claim that about 82 members were notified last week they were being placed on unpaid leave because they’d provided false proof of vaccination.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Leslie McCrae Dowless Jr., the key player in an absentee ballot fraud probe that led to a do-over congressional election, has died. His daughter, Andrea Dowless Heverly, wrote that her father “passed away peacefully” Sunday morning, according to a social media post. He had been diagnosed with an advanced form of lung cancer and died at his daughter’s home in Bladen County, his friend Jay DeLancy said. Dowless was in his mid-60s. The political operative was set to go on trial this summer on more than a dozen state criminal counts related to absentee ballot activities for the 2016 general election and the 2018 primary and general elections. A half-dozen others were also charged. Witnesses told state officials that Dowless, with help of his assistants, gathered hundreds of absentee ballots from Bladen County in 2018. Those workers testified they were directed to collect blank or incomplete ballots, forge signatures on them and even fill in votes for local candidates. The 2018 general election results for the 9th Congressional District were ultimately thrown out, and a new vote for the seat was ordered by the State Board of Elections, following an inquiry. Dowless was working in the 2018 congressional race for then-Republican candidate Mark Harris. No charges were filed against Harris.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Secretary of State Al Jaeger has approved the formatting of a petition for a proposed ballot measure to legalize recreational marijuana in the state. The sponsoring committee behind the petition must obtain 15,582 valid signatures by July 11 for the measure to be placed on November’s ballot. That figure amounts to 2% of North Dakota’s population. If supporters miss that deadline but obtain the signatures by April 21, 2023, the measure could be placed on the June 2024 ballot or come to a vote if a special election occurs before then. The proposed measure seeks to allow people age 21 or older to purchase and use marijuana under certain conditions, the Bismarck Tribune reports. It also sets up the framework for the sale of marijuana within North Dakota, a process that would be implemented by the state Department of Health and Human Services or another entity as determined by the Legislature. The department could register up to seven marijuana manufacturing businesses and 18 dispensaries. Similar petition drives have failed twice in recent years to gather enough signatures to place a measure on the ballot.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: State regulation of streams that flow temporarily after rainfall will be restricted under legislation signed into law by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine. Construction companies, the mining industry and other business groups say removing so-called ephemeral streams from regulation would make Ohio’s practice consistent with federal law. The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency created a permitting system for development projects affecting ephemeral streams after the government removed them from federal oversight in 2020 and left their regulation up to states. The EPA says about 36,500 miles of the state’s 115,200 miles of primary headwater streams are ephemeral streams. DeWine signed the bill last week, saying it strikes a balance between protecting state waterways and providing consistency in state regulations to support economic development. Environmental groups largely opposed the legislation, saying the streams play an important role in maintaining water quality. They also questioned why Ohio would remove the streams from regulation at the same time it’s spending millions to improve water quality under DeWine’s H2Ohio initiative.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: After calling for the disestablishment of a tribal reservation in eastern Oklahoma and criticizing the lingering impacts of the U.S. Supreme Court’s McGirt decision, a candidate for the 2nd Congressional District is receiving pushback from tribal leaders. John Bennett, 47, who is stepping away from his post as chairman of Oklahoma’s Republican Party to seek a seat in Congress, said he believes the court’s ruling continues to be an issue for law enforcement and needs to be reversed. “Congress needs to go back, and they need to de-establish the Muscogee (Creek) Nation reservation. I say once they do that, then they can carry on as they have, you know, all of these years,” Bennett told the Washington Examiner last week. “So when I get to Congress, this will be one of my priorities because it hurts everyone in my district, tribal and nontribal.” The Inter-Tribal Council of the Five Tribes, which includes the Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, Seminole and Muscogee Nations, said the anti-tribal rhetoric should not be welcome in Washington. In a statement signed by each of the tribes’ leaders, the group condemned Bennett’s comments for ignoring ongoing efforts to expand criminal justice systems alongside state and federal partners. They also said the call for a McGirt reversal is an attack on tribal sovereignty.\n\nOregon\n\nClatskanie: An investigator has determined that Clatskanie High School girls basketball players in northwest Oregon “more likely than not” used racist language against members of the De La Salle team during a December game. As a result, Clastkanie has been placed on probation by the Oregon School Activities Association until mid-February 2023, The Daily News reports. The association said the high school team’s players and coaches must engage with a guest speaker about equity and inclusion before next season, among other measures, and all Clatskanie student athletes and coaches must complete racial equity training and implicit bias training. A press release from Clatskanie High School athletic director and dean of students Ryan Tompkins on Wednesday confirmed the findings of the report more than two months after it was completed. Tompkins said the high school is prepared to meet the probation requirements. De La Salle North High School President Oscar Leong said he believes the drawn-out process of the investigation has resulted in positive change for student-athletes across Oregon. Additionally, the investigation found that Clatskanie school staff and referees assigned by the Lower Columbia Officials Association failed to address concerns about racially charged language after they were brought up during the game.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nDillsburg: A school board has denied a resident’s request form an After School Satan Club at Northern Elementary School. Hundreds from the community filled the auditorium for the Northern York County School District board meeting last week and erupted into applause when the votes were taken on the issue. Only board member Thomas Welch voted in favor of the club. The evening had more than two hours of citizen comments, with the majority opposed to the adoption of the club. Many comments focused on the age of the children the club would target, the cultural and biblical issues, and the content on the Satanic Temple’s website for the program. Many of the residents spent the evening rallying the crowd and quoting Christian scripture, saying regardless of any laws that allow freedom of speech, proposing the club is morally wrong. One said the introduction of the club would contribute to a social decline in school. “So nobody benefits from having an After School Satan Club, whether it be those who are against them or those who are in favor of them, because Satan always does harm all the time. That, philosophically, has been proven,” a resident asserted. There were some voices in support, saying that they understood the concerns but that the formation of the club was a constitutional right.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The U.S. Supreme Court will not take up a conservative advocacy group’s challenge to the state’s campaign finance laws. The Gaspee Project and national conservative legal groups appealed to the high court after two lower federal courts ruled against their 2019 lawsuit arguing Rhode Island’s campaign finance disclosure laws are unconstitutional. The Supreme Court denied Gaspee’s appeal petition Monday, according to Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha and the Campaign Legal Center, which defended the state’s campaign finance laws in the case. “To reduce political corruption, we need real transparency about who is spending big money in elections and to that end, voters in Rhode Island have a right to know who is attempting to influence their votes,” Campaign Legal Center Senior Vice President Paul Smith said in a news release. “This denial of review from the Supreme Court of the United States means that vital right will remain in place and continue to enable Rhode Islanders to be well-informed before heading into the voting booth.” The 2019 lawsuit from Gaspee and the Illinois Opportunity Project sought to strike down Rhode Island’s disclosure laws around “independent expenditures,” spending to influence an election that is not coordinated with any campaign.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nYork: A county is suing two cities inside its border, saying they are refusing to keep up with a deal to pay $73 per day to house jail inmates from the cities. York County said it will continue to take inmates from Rock Hill and Tega Cay until the court rules, The Herald of Rock Hill reports. Rock Hill officials said they don’t mind paying a fair fee, but York County has failed to give a detailed assessment of how it came up with a $73-a-day cost per inmate. The county originally wanted to charge $100 but lowered the assessment after Rock Hill asked for details, the city said in a statement. Documents obtained by the newspaper showed the cities were paying about $43 a day per inmate before the fees were increased. York County said other cities in the county like Fort Mill, Clover and the city of York have signed an agreement to pay the $73 fee. York County is asking a judge to decide if the county, which is legally required to have a jail, has to take inmates from cities without a written agreement on fees. Rock Hill officials said their residents and businesses pay York County $7.9 million in property taxes that help run the jail and the sheriff’s office.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Despite an annual $15 million given to the Bridge Improvement Grant program and other additional funding focused on bridges, the state continues to tread water when it comes to how quickly work is done, leaving hundreds of bridges requiring “high priority” corrective repairs and dozens closed. An analysis of data through the Federal Highway Administration’s National Bridge Inspection program focused on the vast amount of data that FHA collects on the nation’s bridges, looking at data from 2015 and the most recent data from 2021. To some, the bridge program, as well as other aspects of the 2015 transportation package, haven’t panned out the way they were supposed to. “I know I’m sounding a little bit negative about it, but I feel like we got duped a little bit,” Brown County Highway Superintendent Dirk Rogers said. The BIG program was created as a collaboration between the state and local governments. To be eligible to participate, counties had to enact local wheel taxes on vehicles so they had a source of local funds in the program. Since 2015, 37 counties have added a wheel tax, according to the South Dakota Department of Revenue, and only six counties in the state don’t have a wheel tax.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state will soon add harsh penalties against public schools that allow transgender athletes to participate in girls’ sports, under legislation signed into law by Republican Gov. Bill Lee. Lee quietly signed the proposal last Friday without comment. The governor had previously signed a measure last year mandating that student-athletes must prove their sex matches that listed on the student’s “original” birth certificate. If a birth certificate is unavailable, then the parents must provide another form of evidence “indicating the student’s sex at the time of birth.” This year, the GOP-controlled Legislature decided to add penalties to that ban, which is in effect even as a lawsuit challenging its constitutionality makes it way through court. A trial has been tentatively set for March 2023. According to the bill, Tennessee’s Department of Education would withhold a portion of state funds from local school districts that fail to determine a student’s gender for participation in middle or high school sports. The measure does not specify exactly how much money should be withheld by the state. The bill will go into effect July 1. “Telling transgender students that they can’t participate as who they really are amounts to excluding them from sports entirely – depriving them of opportunities available to their peers and sending the message that they are not worthy of a full life,” Henry Seaton, ACLU of Tennessee’s transgender justice advocate, said in a statement.\n\nTexas\n\nEagle Pass: Search crews on Monday recovered the body of a Texas National Guard member who went missing after jumping in the river on the U.S.-Mexico border to help a migrant who was struggling to swim across. The body of Spc. Bishop Evans was found three days after he was reported missing in the Rio Grande near the border city of Eagle Pass. The local sheriff has said Evans jumped into the river without his jacket or radio to help a woman who appeared in distress while trying to swim over from Mexico. “Our National Guard soldiers risk their lives every day to serve and protect others and we are eternally grateful for the way SPC Evans heroically served his state and country,” Gov. Greg Abbott said in a statement Monday. The body was found near the boat ramp of a bridge in Eagle Pass, said Democratic state Sen. Roland Gutierrez, whose district includes Eagle Pass. Migrant rescues are common in the river along the Texas border, and the attempted crossings are also sometimes deadly. Maverick County Sheriff Tom Schmerber said the bodies of as many as two migrants a week are sometimes found along his county’s section of the river. Evans was assigned to Abbott’s sprawling border mission known as Operation Lone Star. Gutierrez said Evans is at least the fifth Guard member known to have died during the mission that began last year. He called for an inquest into their deaths.\n\nUtah\n\nCedar City: Four people were killed when a single-engine airplane on a sightseeing tour crashed minutes after takeoff in rural southwestern Utah, authorities said Sunday. Deputies discovered the aircraft after responding to a report of a fire just before 7 p.m. Saturday about 5 miles east of Cedar City, the Iron County Sheriff’s Office said. Pronounced dead at the scene were pilot Steven Eatchel and his wife, Lindsay Eatchel, of Springville, Utah; Thomas Eatchel, of Heber City, Utah; and Danielle Deagostini, of Sandy City, the sheriff’s office said. The National Transportation Safety Board identified the aircraft as a Diamond DA-40 and said it was investigating the crash. No cause was immediately identified. The plane earlier in the day flew from Spanish Fork to Cedar City, where it had a layover of about 21/ 2 hours at the regional airport before taking off and heading east toward some mountains for a sightseeing tour of Zion National Park, the sheriff’s office said. Radar communication with the aircraft was lost about four minutes after it took off. The position of the downed aircraft and damage to foliage at the crash site suggested it was headed west when it crashed, the sheriff’s office said.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The share of Vermonters living with a disability is growing quickly, yet nobody is sure just how many people fall under this category – an uncertainty that may affect how the state allocates money for support. Vermont’s population of people who have at least one disability rose nearly 10% between 2011 and 2020 to over 14% of people in the state, according to a study by Avacare Medical Blog, which analyzed 2021 U.S. Census Bureau data. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says about 1 in 5 adults in Vermont has at least one disability. Even higher is the figure from the Vermont Department of Health, which says 24% of Vermont adults had at least one disability as of 2019. How people are polled and how disability is defined can make it difficult to understand the true number of those living with a disability in Vermont, said Sarah Launderville, executive director of the Vermont Center for Independent Living. “I think that there’s a bunch of people who might not think that they fit into that category of disability because of the way that we look at disability in society,” Launderville said. To be considered disabled by the Social Security Administration and receive financial support, a person’s disability cannot be “partial” or “short-term,” meaning a medical condition prevents ability to work, according to the agency website. However, not all types of disabilities prevent someone from working or living independently.\n\nVirginia\n\nFalls Church: The Arlington County Board gave unanimous approval Saturday to Amazon’s plans to build a unique, helix-shaped tower as the centerpiece of its emerging second headquarters in northern Virginia. Amazon announced the plans in February 2021 for the eye-catching, 350-foot tower to anchor the second phase of its redevelopment plans. The new office towers will support a second headquarters for Amazon that is expected to welcome more than 25,000 workers when complete. The helix is one of several office towers granted approval, but it stands out. The spiral design features a walkable ramp wrapping around the building with trees and greenery planted to resemble a mountain hike. Amazon has said the building is designed to help people connect to nature, and the outdoor mountain climb will be open to the public on weekends. The plans have gone through the famously thorough review process of Arlington County, including numerous public hearings. Earlier this month, the county planning commission voted 9-0 to support the project. On Saturday, the County Board voted 5-0 to approve the plans. They also include park space and will accommodate a community high school, along with ground-level retail. Amazon has said it hopes to complete the project in 2025.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympic National Park: The Olympic Peninsula has lost 45% of its glacier coverage since 1980, according to a new study by Portland State University professor Andrew Fountain and co-authors from Washington state and British Columbia. The peninsula’s remaining 250 glaciers, which covered about 2 square miles at last estimate, should be gone in another 50 years as humanity’s pollution continues to overheat the planet, the study found. Fountain told KUOW glaciers worldwide are getting a kind of double whammy, with less snow in the winter and more melt in the summer. Beyond the fascination they provide for a small community of researchers, glaciers serve as frozen reservoirs. “These glaciers provide water during the hottest, driest parts of the year,” Fountain said. Salmon and people in glacier-fed watersheds rely on nature’s ice chests to keep rivers flowing and cool each summer. Fountain said a rapid end to fossil fuel burning could delay the glacial melt-off by a few decades. “We have to encourage our lawmakers to start enacting legislation to cut greenhouse gases,” he said. “I think, for the foreseeable future, the fate(s) of the glaciers on the Olympic Peninsula are sealed.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nNorthfork: Several communities in the state’s southern coal fields celebrated the completion of a long-awaited project to bring clean water to local communities last week. The Elkhorn Water Project began in 2015 and included a new 400,000-gallon water storage tank on Elkhorn Mountain. The recently completed second phase brings county water to 112 McDowell County Service District customers in Upland, Kyle and Powhatan; 163 customers in Northfork and Algoma; and 101 in Keystone, the Bluefield Daily Telegraph reports. Many water systems in the area were installed in the early 1900s by coal companies and have been failing for years. Residents of Keystone, for example, were under a boil-water notice for more than a decade. U.S. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., met with local and state officials Thursday to celebrate the completion of the second phase. Capito said clean drinking water is among the basic infrastructure rights, which also include good roads and broadband access.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWaukesha: Five months after an SUV plowed through the crowd and killed six people at a Christmas parade, the city continues to have the tragedy in mind in legislative decisions. Various committees have studied proposals for things such as a permanent parade memorial, safety barricades and public consideration of how to address the 2022 parade. The actions complement an effort by nonprofit organizations to collect and disperse funds to aid the hundreds of victims in the parade tragedy. Waukesha’s Christmas Parade in 2021 will forever stand for the tragedy that it was, and a special commission with the city has begun to try to figure out how to memorialize those who died. The Waukesha Parade Memorial Commission has considered creating three sites: a permanent large memorial, possibly in Grebe Park, and one or two smaller sites along the parade route on Main Street. “It’s about what we can to help avoid this anytime in the future, not just for Waukesha but for any community,” said Jerry Couri, the commission’s chairman, whose business, Couri Insurance Agency, has long been a fixture on Main Street. The commission began with the expectation of having the permanent memorial in place in 14 to 15 months. Couri said members are keeping that time frame in mind as they develop ideas.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Conservation groups are still seeking protections for a rare plant that scuttled plans for a gypsum mine in the Bighorn Basin area, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. The Center for Biological Diversity has joined with two smaller groups in announcing plans to file a lawsuit against the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service if federal officials don’t finish a status review on the thick-leaf bladderpod by mid-June, saying the agency is violating its own deadlines, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/09/01/lifeguard-death-traffic-ticket-scam-amherst-pushback-news-around-states/118519764/", "title": "Lifeguard death, traffic ticket scam, Amherst pushback: News from ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Rural school districts are leading the state in reported COVID-19 case rates. When the Alabama Department of Public Health updated its COVID-19 school dashboard for the first time this school year Friday, three districts stood out with the highest percentage of confirmed cases: Covington, Greene and Marion county schools. All three are rural districts, and about 5% of students in each district have tested positive for the coronavirus. These schools were among only 52 of Alabama’s 137 school districts with available data on the state dashboard. In Marion, most of the 160 reported cases were concentrated in three schools, resulting in temporary closures, said Marion County Superintendent Ann West. “We’re just trying to operate with what’s best for each school,” West said. “I don’t like to send children home because for some of our students, what they get to eat is at school.” Masks are not required in Marion County Schools, but West said the district strongly encourages them. “Certainly, if I were not vaccinated, I would be wearing a mask,” she said. Meanwhile, masks are required in Greene County Schools, which reported 47 COVID-19 cases Friday. Covington County Schools reported 140 cases. According to district protocols, masks are “recommended for all individuals while indoors” and required on school buses.\n\nAlaska\n\nSitka: The Sitka Assembly has authorized a 20-year lease of land to an Alaska Native corporation for development for cruise ship passengers. The Assembly, voting 5-2, approved leasing 17 acres to Shee Atika Inc., which plans to work with another company, Adventure Sitka, to develop the land with attractions such as zip lines, a salmon bake and a canoe launch, the Daily Sitka Sentinel reports. The land is between the ferry terminal and Sitka Sound Cruise Terminal. Chris McGraw, who owns the terminal and manages Adventure Sitka, said development of the property will be an important part of handling an expected large number of tourists. “The key to over-tourism is good distribution of guests,” McGraw said at an Assembly meeting. Karl Potts, CEO of Shee Atika Inc., said the lease would generate $300,000 to $400,000 a year for the city. Assembly member Kevin Knox raised questions about staffing at the site, citing difficulties businesses are having this year with hiring staff. But he said he would vote “yes” because of an expected influx of passengers next year. “We don’t have a lot of options here,” he said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The FBI’s Public Corruption unit is investigating efforts by Gov. Doug Ducey’s past and current staffers – including one who is now a federal judge – to push for a closed-door deal to issue tax refunds worth as much as $100million to aid one of Ducey’s campaign supporters. Grant Nulle, former deputy director at the Department of Revenue, said an FBI agent contacted him in mid-July, shortly after an Arizona Republic investigation uncovered how the Ducey administration had pushed the department to agree to refund sales taxes on fuel for mining companies, even though that tax had been in place for decades. The companies that stood to benefit were represented by Texas tax firm Ryan LLC, founded by Ducey supporter G. Brint Ryan. The top three deputies in Ducey’s administration left their government jobs and went to work for Ryan to push for the tax refund. The men and others working for Ducey met with Revenue officials at least 16 times to insist that the department – which was under their oversight in the governor’s office – agree to stop opposing Ryan and issue a tax refund to one fuel company. That, officials said, would have triggered refunds in all other similar cases, costing the state’s general fund more than $100 million.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The number of COVID-19 patients on a ventilator climbed to a new high Monday as the state reported 33 new coronavirus deaths amid the summer surge driven by the highly contagious delta variant. The Department of Health reported the state’s COVID-19 patients on ventilators rose by 17 to 361, surpassing the high the state had set last week. The state’s virus hospitalizations remained unchanged from a day earlier at 1,257. There are 533 COVID-19 patients in intensive care units around the state. The department reported there are 21 available ICU beds in Arkansas, though it’s not clear how many of those are equipped for COVID-19 patients. Last week the state ran out of ICU beds for virus patients, though availability has slightly eased since then. The state’s COVID-19 death toll rose Monday to 6,912 since the pandemic began. It also added 882 new virus cases. Arkansas ranks fifth in the country for new cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers. The Department of Health reported that the number of active cases among students and staff in the state’s public schools has grown to 3,684. Cabot, Fort Smith, Springdale, Rogers and Bentonville schools each reported more than 100 active cases.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The Legislature on Monday voted to guarantee people can call out their bosses publicly in most harassment and discrimination cases. When companies settle complaints filed by their employees, the agreements often include a provision barring the employee from disparaging the company or talking publicly about what happened. These agreements came under fire during the #MeToo movement, criticized as shielding public figures and companies from responsibility in sexual harassment cases. California passed a law in 2018 that bans these nondisclosure agreements in cases involving sexual harassment, discrimination or assault. The Democratic-dominated Legislature voted Monday to expand that law to include other types of harassment and discrimination, including claims based on race, religion, gender identity and sexual orientation. The bill now heads to Gov. Gavin Newsom, who must decide whether to sign it into law. “No worker should ever be silenced from speaking out about their own experience of harassment or discrimination in the workplace,” said Sen. Connie Leyva, D-Chino, author of the bill. “For far too long, these secret settlements and agreements have reinforced a culture of secrecy that prevents accountability, respect and justice.”\n\nColorado\n\nLoveland: A former police officer involved in the rough arrest of an elderly woman with dementia should stand trial for assault, a judge ruled Monday. District Judge Michelle Brinegar said there is probable cause for the charge against former Loveland police Officer Austin Hopp, who will be arraigned in late September, the Loveland Reporter-Herald reports. Hopp arrested Karen Garner in June 2020 after she left a store without paying for about $14 worth of items. His body camera footage shows him catching up to the woman as she walks through a field along a road. Gardner, now 74, shrugs and turns away from him, and he quickly grabs her arm and pushes her 80-pound body to the ground. A federal lawsuit filed on Garner’s behalf, which included images from the body camera footage, claims that Hopp dislocated her shoulder by shoving her handcuffed left arm forward onto the hood of his patrol car and that she was denied medical treatment for about six hours. Former Loveland police Officer Daria Jalali is facing several charges stemming from the arrest, including failing to intervene in the use of excessive force.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: More than 1,500 long-term unemployed residents who recently found jobs are being awarded $1,000 bonuses under the first round of the Back to Work CT program, an initiative funded with federal COVID-19 relief funds. Approximately $10 million has been allocated for the program, which will provide bonus payments for up to 10,000 eligible applicants through Dec. 31. “Many workers who were displaced during the early months in the pandemic and faced long-term unemployment are now transitioning back into the workforce and starting to rebuild,” Gov. Ned Lamont said Monday in a statement. “This one-time bonus payment will help some of those workers pay for the critical things they need to get back to work, including childcare.” To be eligible for the program, applicants must obtain and maintain a full-time job for eight consecutive weeks between May 30 and Dec. 31. Applicants must complete and submit an application electronically to the Department of Revenue Services.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A state trooper who received several traffic commendations has been indicted for a fraudulent traffic warning scheme in which at least two of his victims were fellow law enforcement officers, the Delaware Department of Justice announced Tuesday. Cpl. Edwin Ramirez, who was stationed at Troop 9, was charged with misdemeanor and felony tampering with public records; issuing a false certificate, a felony; and official misconduct, a misdemeanor. If convicted, he faces up to nine years in prison. Delaware State Police contacted prosecutors in May, according to the justice department, after an internal review found “a serious pattern of fraudulent E-Warnings” by Ramirez. The review began April 30 after one of his supervisors found discrepancies in an accident report, prosecutors said. Ramirez was immediately suspended. According to the indictment, after finding the discrepancy, the supervisor began looking at Ramirez’s activity and compared instances in which E-Warnings and E-Tickets were issued to dashcam footage to determine whether the stop had occurred and if so, what had been issued. In April alone, Ramirez issued more than 30 fraudulent warnings, according to the justice department. In some cases, motorists were not informed of the warnings. In other instances, a traffic stop never happened.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Landon Collins, safety for the Washington Football Team, took some time away from the field Monday to bring joy to young football players, WUSA-TV reports. Collins surprised players at the D.C. Department of Parks and Recreation’s Woodbridge Warriors Youth Football Team at a Dick’s Sporting Goods store in Northeast D.C. Each member of the team got a $150 Dick’s Sporting Goods gift card to use however they wanted. Collins served as their personal shopping consultant. The kids, surprised and excited to spend time with the star player, grabbed new shoes and other football gear. “It just feels great for him to come down here and spend his time with us, just so we can have a surprise and get us ready,” one player said Collins said the opportunity to spend time with the kids was a blessing. “Being around these kids to give them a smile on their face and to put something on their shoulders that they can use on and off the football field is amazing,” Collins said.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: State education officials on Monday began to make good on threats to withhold funding from school districts that defied Gov. Ron DeSantis’ ban on mask mandates, despite a circuit judge last week ruling the ban unconstitutional. Commissioner of Education Richard Corcoran announced that the Florida Department of Education has withheld an amount equal to monthly school board member salaries in Alachua and Broward counties, as directed by the State Board of Education. Funds will continue to be withheld until the districts comply, Corcoran said. Broward County Interim Superintendent Vickie Cartwright said in a statement that Broward County School Board believes it is in compliance with the law. “The health and safety of our students, teachers and staff continue to be our main priorities,” Cartwright said. “As such, BCPS (Broward County Public Schools) will continue to mandate masks, knowing the data shows they help minimize the spread of COVID-19 in our schools.” DeSantis, a Republican who is eyeing a possible presidential run in 2024, had been threatening to impose financial penalties on school boards for weeks. Democratic President Joe Biden has said if that happened, federal money would be used to cover any costs.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: State lawmakers will use the same guidelines as in 2010 to redraw congressional, legislative and other electoral districts, meaning lawmakers are not required to give members of the public an advance look at the plans, nor consider whether districts give candidates from different political parties a meaningful chance to win. Identical guidelines were presented to both House and Senate redistricting committees Monday. The House voted to adopt the guidelines, while senators gave preliminary agreement, with a final vote likely on the first day of a special session expected in October or November. Asked about whether maps would be released in advance, Senate Majority Leader John Kennedy emphasized the shortened time period because of delays in U.S. census data stemming from COVID-19. In 2010, state legislative maps were unveiled the Friday before the redistricting special session began. “We’re obviously operating under a very short period of time compared to what they had to this previously,” said Kennedy, R-Macon. Advance notice of maps is one of the key objectives for which outside groups have been lobbying. “Georgians need to have access to the maps and know how and when the maps will be presented,” said Jerry Gonzalez, CEO of the Georgia Association of Latino Elected Officials.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Health care officials are concerned about a shortage of oxygen as the state’s coronavirus surge continues to grow. Hospital officials are canceling nonemergency procedures that require oxygen in an attempt to conserve supplies, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. There is a global shortage of oxygen containers that are needed for transport to the islands, said Hilton Raethel, president and CEO of the Healthcare Association of Hawaii, a trade group for the state’s hospitals and nursing homes. “The combined demand has increased to the point where we are concerned about whether we can generate enough oxygen in Hawaii to meet all the needs of our health care facilities,” Raethel said. Hawaii’s two oxygen plants have switched to producing medical gas only. Raethel said mainland tank orders are backlogged for months. Hawaii Pacific Health, which oversees several hospitals in the state, directed staff to cancel elective procedures where oxygen is needed. “We do not plan to defer any emergency surgery, and we will need to have careful consideration of cases that are urgent but not emergent,” Hawaii Pacific Health President and CEO Ray Vara said in a staff memo. “Any cases that can be deferred safely should be deferred until the oxygen supply solutions are clearer.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: An environmental group that wants to end public-land grazing has outbid a rancher for a grazing lease on state land that includes habitat for bull trout and steelhead. Western Watersheds Project’s bid of $8,200 won the 20-year grazing lease on 620 acres in central Idaho’s Sawtooth Valley in Custer County. The group and the Idaho Cattle Association say it’s possible other state grazing leases could be sought by other environmental groups. Western Watersheds will also have to pay an annual $800 fee based on the number of sheep or cattle authorized for the allotment. “That’s still a screaming deal,” said Erik Molvar, executive director of Western Watersheds Project, noting that private-land grazing fees are about three times that much. “Certainly, at those prices, the parcel is a lot more valuable for conservation than it is for grazing livestock.” Molvar said the group will not graze livestock but instead convert the grazing lease into a conservation lease and allow the area to be used by wildlife, notably a herd of 50 pronghorn that frequent the area. Elk and bighorn sheep are also in the region. He also said sections of two streams running through the parcel, Fourth of July Creek and Champion Creek, will be protected. The new lease takes effect Jan. 1.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A white police officer has been placed on administrative duty as the city’s police oversight agency investigates his struggle with a Black woman who was walking her dog in a lakefront park. Police Superintendent David Brown on Monday directed that the officer be placed on paid desk duty while what happened over the weekend is investigated, the department said. Attorneys for the woman allege the encounter became violent and was an “obvious case of racial profiling.” The Civilian Office of Police Accountability said Monday that it reviewed the officer’s body camera video and recommended he either be placed on administrative duty or be relieved of his police power while it investigates. “If violations did occur, COPA will hold the officer accountable,” interim chief Andrea Kersten said. A law office representing Nikkita Brown said she was near the lakefront with her dog about 12:10 a.m. Saturday when a police officer approached her for being in the area after the park was closed. In a video recorded by a bystander, the woman and her dog appear to be walking away from the officer as he follows closely, and at one point she turns around with her phone in her hand and stops. Moments later, the officer appears to reach for her phone and then grabs Brown.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state’s health commissioner defended herself Monday against criticism arising from a photograph circulating on social media showing her not wearing a face mask during a wedding reception. Dr. Kristina Box said in a statement that she “made an informed decision” to take off her mask while dancing or talking at a recent family wedding with guests fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Box said all but five people at the wedding were fully vaccinated. Several social media comments called Box’s actions hypocritical, as she said Friday that Indiana had reached “the darkest time in the pandemic” amid a surge in infections and hospitalizations and urged more people to get COVID-19 shots and wear masks. The photo shows Box standing amid several people, none of whom are wearing masks. Box said in her statement that federal guidelines call for people to wear masks at indoor public places when in areas of “high or sustained transmission.” “I continue to wear my mask in these settings and encourage Hoosiers to do the same,” Box said. Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb apologized in May 2020 after posing for a photo with two people in which none of the three wore masks inside a Brown County restaurant, a day after recommending mask-wearing.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: A man was sentenced to life in prison without parole Monday in the abduction and killing of University of Iowa student Mollie Tibbetts, three years after she disappeared while out for an evening run. Judge Joel Yates’ sentence for Cristhian Bahena Rivera was mandatory for a first-degree murder conviction in Iowa, which does not have the death penalty. The 27-year-old former farmhand, who testified that he came to the U.S. illegally from Mexico as a teenager, has been jailed since his arrest in August 2018. Yates pointedly rejected defense claims that others were responsible for the crime. “Mr. Bahena Rivera, you and you alone forever changed the lives of those who loved Mollie Tibbetts,” he said. The sentence caps a case that inflamed anger over illegal immigration, fueled fears about violence against solo female runners, and took several noteworthy twists during and after Bahena Rivera’s trial in May. Tibbetts’ mother, Laura Calderwood, addressed Bahena Rivera in a victim impact statement read to the court. “Mollie was a young woman who simply wanted to go for a quiet run on the evening of July 18 and you chose to violently and sadistically end that life,” she wrote.\n\nKansas\n\nMission: Former Gov. Jeff Colyer announced Monday that he is dropping out of the 2022 race for governor after being diagnosed with prostate cancer. “While I have always focused on helping others, for the next few weeks I am going to focus on my health,” said Colyer, a physician who served as governor for a little less than a year in 2018. In his announcement, Colyer said he was endorsing Attorney General Derek Schmidt in the governor’s race. Colyer had been Schmidt’s main rival for the Republican nomination to challenge Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s reelection. Schmidt wished Colyer “all the best in overcoming his current health challenges” in a statement and said that “now is the time to come together to elect a Republican governor for Kansas next year.” In a tweet, Kelly wished Colyer “a quick recovery.” “Colyer and I may have our disagreements. But one thing we can all agree on: the need to defeat cancer,” she wrote on Twitter. Colyer was elevated from lieutenant governor in January 2018, when GOP Gov. Sam Brownback resigned to become U.S. ambassador at large for international religious freedom. Colyer narrowly lost the 2018 Republican primary to polarizing conservative Kris Kobach, who alienated moderate GOP and independent voters and lost to Kelly that November.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The governor signaled Monday that he wants to convene a special legislative session to deal with COVID-19 issues once a “general consensus” is reached on what can be achieved. Gov. Andy Beshear said the special session needs to happen soon in part to maintain the state of emergency he declared at the outset of the pandemic in Kentucky. And there are pressing coronavirus-related issues stemming from school closures due to surging outbreaks, he said. The governor has the authority to call lawmakers into special session and to set the agenda. Beshear, a Democrat, has had discussions with leaders of the Republican-led Legislature over what actions could be taken if lawmakers are brought back to the statehouse. Those negotiations come as Kentucky suffers its worst surge of virus cases and hospitalizations since the pandemic began. Various emergency measures previously issued by Beshear are set to expire as a result of a recent landmark court decision. It’s up to lawmakers to decide whether to keep them in place. Kentucky had more new cases of COVID-19 last week than any other week in the pandemi, and on Monday reported another record number of hospitalized coronavirus patients. The highly contagious delta variant is spreading fastest among school-age Kentuckians, the governor said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A storied jazz site where a young Louis Armstrong once worked toppled when Ida blew through the state as one of the most powerful hurricanes ever to hit the U.S. The Karnofsky Tailor Shop, where a Jewish family employed Armstrong, collapsed Sunday during the storm. Armstrong would play a small tin horn as he worked on the coal and junk wagons, according to the National Park Service. The business opened downtown in 1913 and had a residence above it where the late jazz legend would often eat meals. The family, who provided Armstrong a “second home,” lent him money to buy his first cornet. “Louis said it was the Karnofskys that instilled the love of singing in his heart,” jazz historian and retired photojournalist John McCusker said, according to WWL-TV. Morris Karnofsky, the family’s son and Armstrong’s childhood friend, opened the city’s first jazz record shop on that same street, according to the park service. Armstrong would visit Morris Music when he returned to New Orleans after moving away. When daylight came Monday morning, all that was left was a pile of bricks and other remnants of the historic site.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The lobster fishing industry will face a host of new harvesting restrictions amid a new push from the federal government to try to save a vanishing species of whale. The new rules, which have loomed over the profitable lobster industry for years and were announced Tuesday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, are designed to protect the North Atlantic right whale. The whales number only about 360 and are vulnerable to lethal entanglement in fishing gear. NOAA said it expects the new rules will result in a nearly 70% reduction of the risk of death and serious injuries the whales can suffer from entanglement. The rules had long been expected to focus on reducing the number of vertical ropes in the water, and they will. The rules reduce the number of rope lines that link buoys to lobster and crab traps, NOAA said. The rules will also require the use of weaker ropes so whales can more easily break free if they do become entangled, the agency said. NOAA said the rules also expand the areas of ocean where fishing with trap rope is prohibited or limited. Members of the lobster fishing industry have said strict new rules could make it difficult to get lobsters to consumers.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: Organizers of the 80th National Folk Festival say they’re adding a fourth stage at this year’s festival, the Maryland Traditions Family Folklife Stage. The festival is slated to return to downtown Salisbury on Sept. 10-12 for the third year of its residency in the Eastern Shore city. Supported by Maryland Traditions, the traditional arts program of the Maryland State Arts Council, the Maryland Traditions Family Folklife Area & Stage at the 80th National Folk Festival celebrates and showcases the rich, living traditions of Maryland. The area shines a spotlight on the distinctive music, rituals, crafts, occupations, foodways and other traditions at the heart of Maryland heritage, expressing both the state’s deep history and its evolving character. Performances, demonstrations, displays, exhibits, and narrative presentations by Maryland master artisans and performers explore a wide range of cultural traditions, including those of its First Peoples, the cultural legacies of European settlers, and the expressions of the newest Maryland residents whose cultural roots come from around the globe.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Hundreds of students at Amherst College are pushing back against what they call the school’s overly restrictive coronavirus protocols that include double-masking indoors, restrictions on off-campus activities, and no in-person campus dining. In a letter sent to President Carolyn “Biddy” Martin a week ago, the students said that “the guidelines are not based on any given data, have been developed without student input, are significantly stricter than our peer institutions, and are in conflict with (U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines.” The restrictions originally announced Aug. 24 and designed in response to the spread of the delta variant apply to the first two weeks of the fall semester, which began Monday. The prestigious private liberal arts college celebrating its 200th anniversary this year had already mandated COVID-19 vaccinations. In response to the pushback, Martin wrote another campuswide email Aug. 27. “We are in the midst of a surge, and you are arriving on campus from all over the country and the world, including from delta hotspots,” she said, adding later: “Now is not yet the time to relax key restrictions.” She did, however, amend a near-universal outdoor mask mandate, calling it “unworkable.”\n\nMichigan\n\nRoyal Oak: Some animals are rolling up their fur for COVID-19 shots at the Detroit Zoo. The zoo in suburban Detroit said its gorillas, chimpanzees, tigers and lions are getting a vaccine developed by Zoetis, a veterinary drug company, and authorized by the U.S. Agriculture Department. Other animals will follow. “We’re both thankful and relieved a special vaccine is now available to protect against COVID-19,” said Scott Carter, the zoo’s chief life sciences officer. “The animals routinely get other vaccinations.” The zoo said no COVID-19 infections have been found in its animals. Anti-vaccine advocates have aggressively criticized other zoos nationwide that have administered the shots to their animals. But the animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has said it supports the animal vaccines, which “have been clinically tested and administered to animals only after deep consideration by veterinary professionals.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The state has reached 300 traffic accident deaths before Labor Day for the first time in more than a decade, prompting state public safety officials on Monday to issue a plea for people to slow down. The state reported its 300th fatality Saturday – the earliest the state has eclipsed that threshold since 2007, according to data from the Minnesota Department of Public Safety’s Office of Traffic Safety. There were 240 traffic deaths in the state at this time last year, and the state did not reach 300 until October. Officials attributed 103 of the deaths, or about 40%, to speeding, compared to 78 at this time last year. “This many preventable deaths on Minnesota roads before Labor Day is completely unacceptable,” said Office of Traffic Safety Director Mike Hanson. “It’s not a homework assignment; you don’t get a do-over. We all need to drive smart to keep our family, friends and neighbors alive.” Nearly three-fourths of all victims were male, with the majority between 21 and 30 years old. Alcohol-related deaths stand at 74, which is down from 88 at this time last year and 136 in 2011. Drunken driving-related deaths comprised 20% of all traffic fatalities in 2020 compared to more than half in the 1960s. State officials say the lower numbers are due in large part to extra impaired driving enforcement.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Republican U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker said Tuesday that he is feeling well, less than two weeks after being diagnosed with COVID-19. “To everyone who has asked, I have recovered fully from my bout with COVID-19, and I have a clean bill of health,” Wicker posted on Twitter. “I am looking forward to resuming my travel in the state this week.” Wicker, 70, is one of three senators who announced Aug. 19 that they had tested positive for the coronavirus. Wicker, independent Sen. Angus King, 77, of Maine, and Democratic Sen. John Hickenlooper, 69, of Colorado, had all been fully vaccinated. All three have recommended that people get their shots. Wicker wrote Tuesday: “Being fully vaccinated greatly reduced my risk of developing severe complications from the virus. Getting the shot is safe, easy, and free, and it could save your life.”\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A judge on Tuesday refused to reinstate federal unemployment benefits that were cut in June when Gov. Mike Parson pulled out of several programs, saying the court “would not substitute its judgment” for that of the governor. The ruling by Cole County Circuit Judge Jon Beetem came a day after lawyers representing Missouri residents who lost the jobless benefits asked for reinstatement with back pay that, for some people, could have amounted to $1,500. The enhanced benefits from several federal programs added money to the unemployment checks for out-of-work Americans to help ease the crunch caused by shutdowns for the COVID-19 pandemic. But some Republican governors, including Parson, ended the benefits, saying they wanted to prod people to rejoin the workforce. In his four-page ruling denying a preliminary injunction, Beteem wrote that “the balancing of harms and the public interest strongly favor the Governor’s decision to promote economic recovery and encourage workers’ re-entry into Missouri’s critically understaffed labor force.” Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt said in a statement that the ruling “affirmed the legality of Governor Parson’s decision to terminate these temporary benefits and will hopefully lead to the hiring of workers for businesses that desperately need the help.”\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Gov. Greg Gianforte has announced a rule encouraging schools to give parents final say on whether children should wear masks in schools, after several large school districts implemented mask requirements for all students. Gianforte, a Republican, made the announcement Tuesday after the U.S. Department of Education on Monday opened civil rights investigations into five Republican-led states that have banned or limited mask requirements in schools, saying the policies could amount to discrimination against students with disabilities or health conditions. Gianforte said in a statement that masking in schools, which is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control, is “based on inconclusive research.” He also said masking could have adverse impacts on children’s “health, wellbeing and development.” The CDC issued its guidance in light of the rapid spread of the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus. The rule says schools should consider “parental concerns” when adopting mask mandates and provide parents the ability to opt out of health-related mandates for a wide array of reasons including physical and mental health, developmental needs, religious beliefs and moral convictions.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The number of COVID-19 cases in the state has increased in each of the past ten weeks, and the total nearly doubled over the past two weeks as the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus continues to spread. Nebraska reported 5,006 new cases for the week ending Friday, according to an Omaha World-Herald analysis of data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That’s up from 3,755 the previous week and nearly double the 2,668 cases recorded the week before. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Nebraska has also risen over the past two weeks from 190 new cases per day Aug. 15 to 715.14 new cases per day Sunday. “Those numbers speak for themselves,” said Dr. James Lawler, a co-executive director of the University of Nebraska Medical Center’s Global Center for Health Security. “We’re going up, and we’re following in the footsteps of the Southern states that saw increasing cases before us. And we’ll continue that way unless something dramatic happens.” The state said 323 people were hospitalized with the virus in the state as of Thursday. Last week, Gov. Pete Ricketts ordered all the state’s hospitals to delay elective surgeries, if possible, to help free up capacity, but he resisted taking other measures to slow the spread of the virus.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: City officials say they’ll use a $50,000 grant from the National Park Service to fund research about five decades of segregation, civil rights activism and advocacy in the historic West Las Vegas neighborhood. An announcement Monday said the project aims to focus on the years 1930 through 1979 in what amounted to the city’s segregated Black community. The goal is to determine what buildings and properties could be included on the National Register of Historic Places and listed on the city’s Historic Property Register. The funds to Las Vegas are part of nearly $750,000 nationwide allocated under the park service’s Underrepresented Community Grant Program, the city statement said. The city Historic Preservation Office submitted the grant request, and the city will issue a request for proposals for contracts with experienced cultural resources consultants to prepare the survey and inventory.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPortsmouth: A milestone anniversary for the New Hampshire Film Festival is again being pushed back a year due to COVID-19. Announced Monday, the 20th annual NHFF will have to wait another year because of the pandemic. The celebration was originally scheduled for October 2020, then delayed to October 2021. Now it’s planned for 2022. An autumn tradition in Portsmouth, which has hosted the festival since 2004 after its debut in Derry three years before, the festival said it would be unable to keep up with new health and safety protocols seen in art venues and community events across the country “due to the scale and scope” of an event spread across several days and multiple venues. “We are upset to find ourselves in this extremely difficult position, but our deeper concern lies with the filmmakers, attendees, supporters, partners and sponsors who continue to struggle with the ongoing pandemic,” NHFF executive director Nicole Gregg said in a statement. Celebrating newer filmmakers and directors, as well as more experienced screenwriters and actors, the NHFF is a four-day fall event that typically draws crowds for film showings, question-and-answer sessions with film producers and actors, and receptions and parties at downtown restaurants.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nBerkeley Township: A young lifeguard was killed, and seven other people, including three other lifeguards, were injured when lightning struck a Jersey Shore beach Monday afternoon, authorities said. It marked the second death of a young lifeguard at the Jersey Shore in a little over a week. Ocean County Sheriff Michael Mastronardy said the others were taken to hospitals with injuries that were not considered life-threatening. “Our hearts are with the family and friends of the young lifeguard killed by today’s horrific lightning strike on the beach in Berkeley Township, and we pray for a full recovery for those injured,” Gov. Phil Murphy wrote on Twitter. “I’ve spoken to Mayor Carmen Amato and offered the full support and assistance of our administration during this difficult time.” Amato said his township’s beaches will be closed Tuesday through Thursday as crisis counselors are made available to beach staff and lifeguards. Four of those struck were lifeguards, and four others were beachgoers. “This is a tragic and heartbreaking day for our town and the entire Jersey Shore,” Amato said in a statement. “This young person was out there every day protecting the lives of others. Our lifeguard teams, like so many along the shore, develop special connections with our community throughout the summer, which makes this loss even greater.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The state’s largest electric provider wants to transfer its share of a coal-fired power plant to an energy company backed by the Navajo Nation, but environmentalists argue that approving the deal would prolong the life of the plant and run counter to New Mexico’s renewable energy goals. The state Public Regulation Commission will determine whether Public Service Co. of New Mexico’s plan for Four Corners Power Plant is in the public interest during a two-week hearing that began Tuesday. It heard from the public Monday. Some of those who spoke at the virtual meeting Monday choked back tears when talking about pollution emitted by the plant over the decades, while others spoke about how their jobs at the power plant and coal mine helped to put their children through college. Some tribal members told regulators that all levels of Navajo leadership are behind the proposal. They said allowing the Navajo Transitional Energy Co. to take over the utility’s stake in Four Corners would provide more time for the tribe to find ways to deal with significant economic consequences that will come when the plant closes in 2031. If regulators don’t approve PNM’s plan, the Navajo Nation could lose up to $60 million annually, said LoRenzo Bates, former speaker of the Navajo Nation Council.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Resigning from office probably didn’t end former Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s legal problems, and no matter what happens next, taxpayers are likely to wind up with a hefty bill. The state has already agreed to pay up to $9.5 million to lawyers representing and investigating Cuomo and his administration over sexual harassment allegations and other matters, according to a review of available contracts. That figure represents the maximum amount that could be spent, not actual bills submitted so far. It doesn’t include the legal fees of Cuomo’s private attorney, whose bills are being paid by his campaign committee. His successor, Gov. Kathy Hochul, can decide whether the state will continue to pay lawyers to defend Cuomo and his administration going forward. Cuomo and the administration face the possibility of civil lawsuits from women who have accused the Democrat of sexual harassment. The state attorney general is looking into Cuomo’s use of state employees to help with a book he wrote. Federal prosecutors are investigating his administration’s handling of nursing home death data. He’s also facing a state ethics commission inquiry.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed a bill Monday that would do away with the permit someone must obtain from a county sheriff before buying a pistol, turning back a key agenda item of conservative gun rights supporters. Cooper’s veto was expected, and an override will be difficult for Republicans who control the General Assembly, since they lack veto-proof majorities in the House and Senate. Only two Democrats – both in the House – voted for doing away with the pistol purchase permitting system, which goes back more than 100 years. Cooper supports more gun-sale restrictions, not less, and his office expressed his opposition to the bill the day after the final legislative vote this month. “Gun permit laws reduce gun homicides and suicides and reduce the availability of guns for criminal activity,” Cooper said in a news release Monday. “At a time of rising gun violence, we cannot afford to repeal a system that works to save lives. The legislature should focus on combating gun violence instead of making it easier for guns to end up in the wrong hands.” Bill supporters said the current process has become duplicative with the comprehensive national checks that licensed gun dealers must conduct. The North Carolina Sheriffs’ Association backed the repeal this year after opposing it previously.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A federal judge has rejected a lawsuit by the state of Missouri seeking to stop a project that would supply Missouri River water to central North Dakota. The Bismarck Tribune reports the ruling will enable the federal Bureau of Reclamation to move ahead with a water service contract for the Central North Dakota Water Supply Project. The project will receive water from the McClusky Canal for systems in Burleigh, Sheridan, Wells, Foster, Kidder, McLean and Stutsman counties. The Missouri suit alleged violations of federal policy, including failure by project developers to properly study the project’s environmental impacts and its alternatives. U.S. District Judge Nanette Laughrey ruled against Missouri on all counts. The state of Missouri “doesn’t like any depletion from the Missouri River,” said Merri Mooridian, deputy manager of the Red River Valley Water Supply Program, which will move Missouri River water by underground pipeline from Washburn east to supply systems in the east and central parts of the state. The Central North Dakota Water Supply Project will use the same pipeline, taking nearly 13 million gallons a day. “The state of North Dakota has the right to flows of the Missouri River in the state of North Dakota,” Mooridian said.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: A Common Pleas judge has rescinded his order that a man sentenced for a felony drug charge get vaccinated against COVID-19 within two months as a condition of his probation. Speaking at a hearing Tuesday, Judge Christopher Wagner told Brandon Rutherford that it’s not a judge’s role to make decisions for him or “teach you to be a better person.” The reversal came nearly a month after Wagner had sentenced Rutherford. At the time, Wagner told Rutherford he presumed he hadn’t been vaccinated because he was wearing a mask in court, which Rutherford confirmed, telling the judge he wasn’t worried about the vaccine. Neither Rutherford nor his attorney, Carl Lewis, objected to the vaccination order during the sentencing, but soon afterward Rutherford expressed concerns about the directive. Lewis said Tuesday that his 21-year-old client has concerns about the vaccine and will not get it within two months. Lewis had argued that a judge doesn’t have the power or authority to order someone to be inoculated.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A bill approved by the Republican-led Legislature this year that seeks to crack down on protesters is unconstitutional and would chill the ability of groups to mobilize people to advocate for racial justice, a civil rights group argues in a federal lawsuit filed Monday. The Oklahoma chapter of the NAACP filed the lawsuit in federal court in Oklahoma City, along with the national NAACP, the nation’s oldest civil rights organization, and the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at Georgetown University Law Center. The lawsuit argues the law, which takes effect Nov. 1, was written to discourage peaceful demonstrations and violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, which guarantee the right of the public to peacefully assemble and give citizens equal protection under the law. The new law increases the penalties for blocking roadways, grants motorists civil and criminal immunity if they kill or injure someone while fleeing from a riot, and authorizes hefty fines for national organizations that coordinate with those found guilty of committing crimes under the state’s rioting statutes.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: City employees must be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 – or obtain a medical or religious exemption – by the middle of October, or they will be fired. “With COVID-19 filling hospitals and claiming lives, we must do everything within our power to end this pandemic and restore our community’s health,” Mayor Ted Wheeler and all four City Commissioners wrote Monday in a letter to municipal workers. The city will require its approximately 6,800 employees to submit proof of vaccination, show they are in the process of being vaccinated, or apply for an exemption by Sept. 10 and be fully vaccinated or granted an exemption by Oct. 18. Those who fail to meet the deadline “will be put on a list for separation from employment,” according to the letter. The city plans to provide a comprehensive outline of the new policy later this week and to answer whatever questions municipal workers might have. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports that earlier this month, Multnomah County imposed a vaccine mandate on its employees, and Gov. Kate Brown has announced similar requirements for all teachers, health care workers and state employees across Oregon.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Masks will be required in all public and private schools, as well as child care facilities, Gov. Tom Wolf announced Tuesday, reversing course amid a statewide COVID-19 resurgence that is filling hospital beds just as students return to class. The Department of Health order will take effect Tuesday, Sept. 7 – a week or more after the start of school in many districts – and will require students, teachers and staff to wear masks when inside, regardless of vaccination status, the Wolf administration said. The order will not apply to student-athletes while they’re playing, nor to outdoor activities. “Wearing a mask in school is necessary to keep our children in the classroom and to keep COVID out of that classroom,” Wolf said at a news conference Tuesday. The Pennsylvania School Boards Association said the decision on masking should have been left to local school officials, but it would nevertheless remind school districts “of their legal obligation related to the directive.” Less than a month ago, Wolf had ruled out a statewide mask mandate for schools after requiring them last year. But the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus has changed the administration’s calculus about what is needed to keep students in class.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The union that represents nurses at the state’s only Level 1 trauma hospital is calling on its parent company to increase the pay of nurses who have been on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic. The United Nurses and Allied Professionals union on Tuesday delivered a petition with more than 2,000 signatures to Lifespan Corp., which operates Rhode Island Hospital in Providence. Lifespan, the state’s largest health care organization, has already increased compensation for nurses at some of its other hospitals. “We provide a critical component of patient care in Rhode Island, yet during this unprecedented health crisis, Lifespan seems to have forgotten about us,” Frank Sims, a Rhode Island Hospital nurse and union president, said in a statement. “While the nurses at Miriam Hospital and Newport Hospital are being recognized for their front line service with appropriate compensation increases during this crisis, Lifespan has refused to do the same for Rhode Island Hospital nurses.” A Lifespan spokesperson said the system provides nurses with “highly competitive wage and benefits packages.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A private college is allowing men to live on campus for the first time since it was founded 167 years ago. About 45 men moved into a dorm set aside for them at Columbia College this month, media outlets report. College officials said last year that they decided to bring men to what had been an all-women college because enrollment had fallen 25% in the past decade. “Most women now are looking for a co-educational experience. Also, we really believe the opportunity that we provide and the environment we have is a good one for men to grow. And so it’s expanding our outreach to men of course but also to a broader group of women,” said Columbia College President Tom Bogart, who took over as leader of the school in October. Jordan Wright was one of the first men to move into the Columbia College dorms. “I feel like it’s a good experience,” Wright said. “It’s a new beginning and new blessings. I know it’s a little different now, but I feel like everything is still going to go good with the boys and girls, even though it’s a new thing.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem said Tuesday that she has activated nine soldiers from the state National Guard to help with coronavirus testing in the western part of the state amid a surge of infections. “This past week, I had conversations with all three South Dakota hospital systems and asked them what they needed as cases start to rise again,” she said in a statement. “Monument asked for the National Guard to assist them in their testing efforts, and we are happy to help.” Over the past two weeks, the average number of infections has tripled statewide. The western part of the state has been the hardest-hit, with Meade County, which hosted the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally earlier this month, leading the state in new cases per capita. The Department of Health reported last week that it had traced 63 cases among rallygoers. Meanwhile, COVID-19 hospitalizations statewide reached 216 – the largest number since January. Two deaths were also reported Tuesday, bringing the total death toll of people with COVID-19 in the state to 2,069. The health department said Pennington County had more than twice as many new COVID-19 cases in the prior day than any other county in the state. Noem activated the National Guard last year to prepare field hospitals for a surge in patients, but the hospitals were not utilized.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The snail darter, a tiny fish that notoriously blocked a federal dam project in the state decades ago, should no longer be on the endangered species list, federal officials announced Tuesday. Arguing that the fish is no longer in danger of extinction, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has begun the process to delist the species, a move backed by the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental group that has favored lifting protections for the fish since 2019. “Thanks to the persistence of many people, the extinction of the snail darter was ultimately avoided, and today we can celebrate its recovery,” said Zygmunt Plater, the attorney who wrote the citizens’ petition to save the snail darter in 1975. Snail darters, a member of the perch family, grow up to 3.5 inches long and mostly eat freshwater snails. Shortly after the passage of the landmark 1973 Endangered Species Act, construction of the Tennessee Valley Authority’s Tellico Dam in eastern Tennessee threatened the habitat of the newly discovered fish, located just above the site of the project. The case eventually made its way to the U.S. Supreme Court, marking the first time the nation’s highest court took up an ESA case. In 1978, the court ruled in favor of protections for the fish and halted work on the nearly completed dam. Congress later exempted the dam from the law to allow the project to be completed. But the TVA worked to transplant the snail darter to other rivers and streams.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The GOP-controlled Legislature passed a broad overhaul of the state’s election laws Tuesday, tightening already strict voting rules and dealing a bruising defeat to Democrats who waged a months­long fight over what they argued was a brazen attempt to disenfranchise minorities and other Democratic-leaning voters. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott said he will sign the bill, the latest in a national GOP campaign to add new hurdles to voting in the name of security, spurred in part by former President Donald Trump’s false claims of a stolen election. Texas Democrats fought the legislation for months, arguing the bill was tailored to make it harder for young people, racial and ethnic minorities and people with disabilities – all Democratic-leaning voters – to cast ballots, just as they see the demographics shifting to favor their party. The bill specifically targets Democratic strongholds, including Houston’s Harris County, further tightening rules in a state already considered among the hardest places to cast a ballot. The legislation set off a heated summer in Texas of walkouts by Democrats, Republicans threatening them with arrest, Abbott vetoing the paychecks of thousands of rank-and-file staffers when the bill failed to reach him sooner, and accusations of racism and voter suppression. Even the final vote did not escape a parting round of confrontation after Senate Republicans, at the last minute, scuttled one of the few areas of bipartisan agreement: efforts to shield voters with felony convictions from prosecution if they did not realize they were ineligible to cast a ballot. It had been included following backlash over the arrests of two Texas voters, both of whom are Black.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Gov. Spencer Cox cast doubt on the efficacy of mask-wearing Tuesday as health leaders made some of their most impassioned pleas yet for Utahns to mask up and get vaccinated. Cox, a Republican, said his administration is encouraging people to wear masks but said it is unclear whether they are effective against the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus. “Masks are not as effective as most of the pro-mask crowd are arguing,” Cox told reporters at a news conference. “We know that they’re just not.” Cox offered no specific evidence to support his assertion, and his comments contradicted public health experts, as well as statements Utah’s state epidemiologist Dr. Michelle Hofmann made a few minutes earlier at the same news conference. State hospital leaders made emotional pleas for vaccinations and universal masking to prevent the state’s ongoing COVID-19 surge. “There will be enduring harm to our children and generations to come if we do not stop the divisiveness around the things we know work like masks and vaccines,” Hofmann said. “We know the path to healing is the end of this pandemic, and it hasn’t ended yet even if we want to pretend it has.”\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Nearly all arriving students at the University of Vermont have been vaccinated against COVID-19. UVM spokesman Enrique Corredera said officials are still working with fewer than 100 students to bring them into compliance with the school’s inoculation requirement. Earlier this month UVM reinstituted an indoor mask mandate for all faculty, staff, students and visitors on the Burlington campus. The exact size of this year’s school enrollment won’t be known for several weeks, but it’s expected to be more than 13,000. The incoming freshman class is expected to have about 3,000 students. “In wonderful news for the years ahead, an extraordinary new class of Catamounts have joined us this fall – with more than 25,000 applications for admission, the incoming class is on track to being the best academically prepared and the largest we’ve ever welcomed!” President Suresh Garimella said in a message to the student body. Students at colleges and universities across Vermont are returning for the fall semester amid the latest surge in COVID-19 cases, this time driven by the more transmissible delta variant of the coronavirus.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Ralph Northam granted posthumous pardons Tuesday to seven Black men who were executed in 1951 for the rape of a white woman, in a case that attracted pleas for mercy from around the world and in recent years has been denounced as an example of racial disparity in the use of the death penalty. Northam announced the pardons after meeting with about a dozen descendants of the men and their advocates. Cries and sobs could be heard from some of the descendants after Northam’s announcement. The “Martinsville Seven,” as the men became known, were all convicted of raping 32-year-old Ruby Stroud Floyd, a white woman who had gone to a predominantly black neighborhood in Martinsville, Virginia, on Jan. 8, 1949, to collect money for clothes she had sold. Four of the men were executed in Virginia’s electric chair Feb. 2, 1951. Three days later, the remaining three were also electrocuted. All of them were tried by all-white juries. It was the largest group of people executed for a single-victim crime in Virginia’s history. At the time, rape was a capital offense. But Northam said Tuesday that the death penalty for rape was applied almost exclusively to Black people. Northam said the pardons are an acknowledgement that the men did not receive due process and faced racial bias.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The coronavirus pandemic is filling hospitals at an “alarming” rate and continuing to strain health care workers, state health officials said Monday. And for the first time during the pandemic, hospitals are also seeing large numbers of sick pregnant patients, said Dr. Tanya Sorensen, the executive medical director of women’s health at Swedish Health Services. She noted pregnant patients are generally less likely to be inoculated against COVID-19. “We’re seeing ICU admissions, maternal deaths, babies born prematurely either to help the mother breathe or rescue the baby,” she said. “It’s really heartbreaking. … Pregnant women need to be vaccinated.” As of Monday morning, the state’s hospitals and health care centers were treating 1,570 COVID-19 patients, Washington State Hospital Association CEO Cassie Sauer said. Of those, 188 were on ventilators. Eleven days ago, the hospital association had counted 1,240 patients with 152 on ventilators. “It’s an enormous stress on a health care system to have this many patients with a single diagnosis,” she said. “This doesn’t happen. … It’s very, very alarming.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nWheeling: A historic suspension bridge will be undergoing major repairs, but it’s not clear whether the span will reopen to traffic. The West Virginia Division of Highways and Gov. Jim Justice announced Monday that a $17.9 million contract had been awarded to repair and rehabilitate the Wheeling Suspension Bridge, The Intelligencer/Wheeling News-Register reports. The project will make repairs on the span’s superstructure and substructure as well as clean, paint, replace damaged suspension cables and renovate lighting, officials said. “It is absolutely fantastic news for the city of Wheeling to know that its most iconic structure, the suspension bridge, is going to be fully repaired and rehabilitated,” Mayor Glenn Elliott said Monday. The future of the historic 1849 bridge was in question after officials closed the span to vehicle traffic in 2019 since motorists repeatedly ignored Division of Highways weight restrictions and warnings on the structure. Multiple overweight vehicles tried to cross it, leading to damage, and it’s unclear whether the repairs will allow the bridge to reopen to traffic. After the contractor begins work on the bridge, crews will determine the extent of the damage, and officials will then determine how the bridge will be used going forward.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWaukesha: A school district has reversed a decision to leave a federal free meals program following widespread criticism and loud protests from parents and others. Waukesha school board members said they received threats in the wake of national attention after voting to opt out of the program that was providing free breakfast and lunch to all students in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The board voted 5-4 on Monday to reverse course, with parents and others packing the meeting room and two overflow rooms. Board member Karin Rajnicek said after the board’s previous vote to end the free program that it made it easy for families to “become spoiled.” Darren Clark, assistant superintendent for business services, said he feared there would be a “slow addiction” to the service. Even without the program, Waukesha students from low-income families still would have been able to apply for free or reduced-price meals under the traditional National School Lunch Program. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s decision to extend the Seamless Summer Option during the pandemic to offer free meals year-round has allowed for more coronavirus-safe practices by eliminating the need to collect payments and allowing meals to be served more easily in classrooms or outside.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: More staff than inmates at the state’s men’s prisons have tested positive for the coronavirus in the past month, the Department of Corrections said late last week. Since July 23, the state has reported 43 cases of COVID-19 among staff at the Wyoming State Penitentiary in Rawlins and the Wyoming Medium Correctional Institution in Torrington. A total of 20 inmates in those two facilities tested positive for the virus over the same period of time. “Historically, we’ve had far more positives in our inmate population, as a percentage of the population, than we’ve had for staff,” Wyoming Department of Corrections spokesperson Paul Martin said Wednesday. “I think that trend is changing now.” About 35% of prison employees report being fully vaccinated, compared to 64% of inmates, the agency said. Vaccinations are not required for anyone, Martin told the Casper Star-Tribune, but are offered to employees and inmates. Inmates are still wearing face coverings and social distancing, Martin said. The only facility that did not experience an outbreak during the peak of the pandemic was the Wyoming Women’s Center in Lusk. This month, the women’s prison has reported five cases among staff and 11 among inmates.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/01"}]}

Your funds don't get to the account for three days unless you pay a 1% fee to speed it up.\n\nHow it works: Link to your debit or credit card or bank routing and account number and pay friends electronically. Note: All payments are, by default, set to “public” so that everyone on the Venmo social network can see who you’re paying and what you’re buying unless you change the setting to friends only or private.\n\nWhat it says: “Venmo is designed for payments between friends and people who trust each other.\"\n\nWhat it doesn’t tell you: Every time you make a transaction on Venmo, it shares personal information with third-party firms. In our case, it sent our GPS location information and the name of the person we interacted with to data firms Braze, GIF sticker maker Holler.io and anti-fraud company Pinpoint Secure Data Collector.\n\nComment: “Venmo’s publicly available privacy policy and user agreement outline that we may share certain data with third-party service providers who assist us with parts of our business operations and providing services to users.”\n\nOur grade: Venmo is incredibly easy and convenient to use, and many people love it. But because it doesn’t respect the privacy rights of customers and because all transactions are by default sent to public, we give Venmo a D.\n\nFine print:Data privacy: Why Venmo sent my personal info – and yours – to Braze\n\nLook out:Venmo scams: How to use a payment app without getting ripped off\n\nCash App\n\nWhat it is: A payment app owned by Square, which many small merchants use to process retail purchases.\n\nNumbers: 24 million monthly customers\n\nCost: Free, but when people pay you, it takes 1-3 business days for the money to go into your account. One-day payments cost 1.5% of the transaction.\n\nHow it works: You need a debit card to link your account to Cash, or Bitcoin, to make payments. From the app, you can also invest in stocks or buy and sell Bitcoin.\n\nWhat it says: Cash is \"the easiest way to send money, spend money, save money, and buy cryptocurrency.\"\n\nWhat it doesn't tell you: Customer service support can be an issue. Both the iOS and Google Play app stores have many low-rated reviews of Cash by customers frustrated over support issues. Cash sends customers to its Twitter support page or via a support menu in the app that takes you an e-mail option, with the promise of a reply within 24 hours.\n\nSecurity: Cash sent what it says was \"anonymized\" information about our test transaction to marketi companies.\n\nComment: The Cash app \"sometimes use third-party services to analyze anonymous data about app usage to help us fix bugs, identify app crashes, understand marketing campaigns, and improve the customer experience. These services are common in the industry and we choose products that are designed with customer privacy in mind.”\n\nOur grade: Easy to use, but if you don't have a debit card, you can't use Cash and dealing with customer service is not so smooth, so we give it a B.\n\nApple Pay Cash\n\nWhat it is: Apple's offer to pay people via iMessages.\n\nNumbers: Apple hasn't released any usage stats on the app.\n\nCost: Free.\n\nHow it works: First, you'll need an iPhone, iPad or Apple Watch and know that you can send money only to people who also have Apple devices. Setting up Apple Cash is more convoluted than others. Associate your debit card (banking account numbers won't work) with the app (found in the Apple Wallet app, on the home screen) and then you need to add cash to the account. At first. Then you can start making payments through Cash via your debit card.\n\nWhat it says: \"Sending money is as simple as sending a message. Use your debit card with just a touch of your finger or by asking Siri.\"\n\nWhat it doesn't tell you:. If your friend uses a Samsung Galaxy or Google Pixel, you're out of luck. It works only on iOS.\n\nHow it makes money: It can take 1-3 days to transfer funds in Apple Cash to your bank account for free. Instant Transfers to a debit card charge 1% of the transaction.\n\nSecurity: Apple didn't share our information with third-party data firms.\n\nGrade: Great if you use iMessages and are on the Apple platform, not so if your friend has an Android phone. Also, setup is a pain. And some people may prefer to have their bank account linked instead of a debit card. Apple Cash gets a B.\n\nGoogle Pay\n\nWhat it is: Google's digital payment app that works on both Apple iOS and Android platform.\n\nNumbers: Google hasn't released usage numbers.\n\nCost: Free. Transfers take 1-5 days to receive funds from bank accounts. Google doesn't charge for \"instant\" transfers and makes money on credit card fees.\n\nHow it works: Download the app on iOS; it may come preloaded on your Android phone, and set it up with your debit and/or credit card. But you can only use debit for person-to-person transactions.\n\nWhat it says: \"Google Pay is the fast, simple way to pay online, in apps, and in stores. Plus, send money to friends, split bills, and cash in on loyalty and rewards – all without your wallet.\"\n\nWhat it doesn't tell you: That no app is easier to use for sending money. Hidden within Gmail, the most used free e-mail program, is a $ icon. Click it, and either pay or request money from a contact.\n\nSecurity: Google didn't share our transactions with any third parties.\n\nOur grade: For ease of us, working with debit and credit cards and banking accounts, better security than most and for the ability to pay via e-mail, we give Google Pay a B+.\n\nOur reservations: Google doesn't share the data with others, but now it knows even more about me – who I pay, what I buy and how often, and that feeds the Google monster in coming up with more personalized ads that I don't want to see.\n\nFacebook Pay\n\nWhat it is: The social network's vehicle to pay people from within the Messenger mobile app, or on desktop.\n\nNumbers: Facebook hasn't revealed usage stats.\n\nCost: Free. Like the others, it can take 1-5 days for the money to get credited to your bank. If you use PayPal with Facebook, you'll need to go into that app as well to transfer funds. Facebook makes money on credit card transactions.\n\nHow it works: Connect your credit or debit card, or PayPal account and start making payments by clicking the $ icon within Messenger. From there, friends can message you money as well that will be deposited to your account.\n\nWhat it says: \"Pay directly from your favorite apps,\" with icons of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp.\n\nWhat it doesn't tell you: Only Facebook and Messenger offer it.\n\nSecurity: Facebook did not share our transactions with third-party data firms.\n\nOur grade: The app works flawlessly and if your friends have Facebook they can get paid or send you money. You're still giving too much information to Facebook (who you pay, where you both live, what you use the money for), but at least they're not sharing it with others. B+\n\nZelle (via Chase bank app)\n\nWhat it is: A bank consortium-owned app to make digital payments.\n\nNumbers: $187 billion in payments for 743 million 2019 transactions.\n\nCost: Free to use. Unlike the other apps, there isn't a hold on money transfers.\n\nHow it works: Sign up with your bank (partners include Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America and most of the big banks) with your account and/or debit card info, and send money to others via your bank app, which runs Zelle in the background. People you pay will need to sign up to receive it. We tested Zelle with the Chase app. If you bank with BofA, Wells Fargo or other Zelle partners, you'll be paying with Zelle from within those apps.\n\nWhat it says: A \"fast, safe and easy way to send money in minutes with friends, family and others you trust.\"\n\nWhat it doesn't tell you: What exactly is Zelle? Still much less known and used than the other pay services, Zelle's actually available right within your bank account app and just requires the phone number or email address your friend has connected with the service – something they probably haven't yet set up. You never actually have to download a Zelle app.\n\nSecurity: Our transaction was sent to Zimperium, which provides \"enterprises with protection for mobile devices and apps against the next generation of mobile cyber attacks.\"\n\nComment: We asked Chase why it shared our information with a third party. The response: “JPMorgan Chase does not share or collect personally identifiable information (including location data) with any of the third-party providers that validate the integrity of our customers’ devices.\"\n\nOur grade: It's cool that Zelle doesn't charge for instant deposits and can be used without a debit card. And we like that partner Chase already knows our purchase history, so it's not like giving them more information. But using Zelle via the Chase app didn't seem as smooth and simple as apps like PayPal or Google Pay. We give that experience a B.\n\nPayPal Mobile Cash\n\nWhat it is: The original payment app created by Elon Musk, Peter Thiel and others back in 1999 and for years associated with eBay. It's now a separate company.\n\nNumbers: 300 million users\n\nCost: Peer-to-peer transactions are free but can take 1-3 business days to clear the bank. Instant transfer cost 1% in transaction fees.\n\nHow it works: Download the app, associate your credit/debit cards or banking information.\n\nWhat it says: \"With our improved app, you'll get the convenience you want, paired with the secure transactions you've come to trust from PayPal.\"\n\nWhat it doesn't tell you: That it shares your transaction data with data marketing firms.\n\nHow it makes money: Credit card and instant transfer fees.\n\nComment: We asked PayPal why it was sharing our data with these firms, and it declined to answer specifically.\n\nOur grade: Despite the passing on our data to other firms, which we don't like, PayPal's usage is smooth, reliable and works among so many platforms. Pro tip: Security researcher Patrick Jackson suggests using PayPal on computers or the mobile web, where data won't get shared with others, like on mobile apps. We give it a B+.\n\nFollow USA TODAY's Jefferson Graham (@Jeffersongraham) on Twitter", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/03/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/07/11/50-worst-product-flops-of-all-time/36734837/", "title": "Product launch blunders: 50 worst flops of all time", "text": "Michael B. Sauter, Evan Comen, Thomas C. Frohlich and Samuel Stebbins\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nSome product launches can be spectacular failures, and Google Glass, an eyeglasses shaped head-mounted device with smartphone capabilities, failed in such a manner several years ago. It was meant to be the first piece of technology to connect the typical consumer to augmented reality.\n\nGoogle continues to attempt to find a place for the product, but its original launch was a definitive failure. In 2017, the internet giant announced the relaunch of the device to target to businesses rather than the general public, but whatever happens, it will be adopted by a meaningfully narrower audience.\n\nJust like success, failure is part of doing business. Entrepreneurs and large companies often take big risks, hoping for success but not always achieving it.\n\nThese failures take many different forms. When a product doesn’t sell, when it is recalled or discontinued, or when it otherwise does not come close to meeting a company’s expectations or plans, it can be marked as a failure. While failures are expected, some can be so catastrophic they can lead to permanent damage to a company’s reputation, layoffs, and even complete financial ruin.\n\nSometimes, it can take years, or even decades for a product flop to disappear from the market. This was the case with Betamax a video format which Sony introduced, expecting it to replace VHS. Despite being technologically superior to VHS, Betamax lost market share until it eventually vanished.\n\n24/7 Wall Street reviewed some of the greatest product launch blunders throughout history. Today, these product flops exist as case studies companies use to avoid future failure. They range from Ford’s Edsel in 1958 to 2016’s Galaxy Note 7. Many of these products led to losses in the hundreds of millions, and sometimes billions. In tech, film, the internet, the pharmaceutical industry, and more, these are the biggest product flops of all time.\n\nMore: Population migration patterns: US cities Americans are abandoning\n\n1. Google Glass\n\nCompany: Google\n\nGoogle Year introduced: 2013\n\n2013 What it was: Wearable technology\n\nGoogle first announced Google Glass -- an eyeglasses shaped head-mounted display with smartphone capabilities -- to the public in 2012. The announcement began with a statement of principle: “We think technology should work for you -- to be there when you need it and get out of your way when you don’t.” After two years of disappointing sales, it was clear consumers did not need Google Glass. Google stuck to its principle, and in 2015 discontinued the product’s development. Privacy concerns, reported bugs, low battery life, bans from public spaces, and an inability to live up to the hype all stymied public adoption of the technology.\n\n2. The Newton\n\nCompany: Apple\n\nApple Year introduced: 1993\n\n1993 What it was: Personal digital assistant\n\nWhile the personal digital assistant would become a popular consumer electronics product in the late 1990s, the first PDA was one of the biggest product flops of all time. One year after Apple CEO John Sculley coined the term “PDA” in 1992, the company released the Newton MessagePad. While the device incorporated innovative technology such as a pen-based touch screen and the ability to sync with software on a personal computer, Apple sold only 50,000 units of the product in its first four months on the market. The Newton product line was discontinued in 1998.\n\nMore: Budweiser, Coors Light, Bud Light top list of best-selling beers in America\n\n3. E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\n\nCompany: Atari\n\nAtari Year introduced: 1982\n\n1982 What it was: Video game\n\nSeveral video games have failed over the years, but arguably none as spectacularly as E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. The video game was created/developed shortly after the release of Steven Spielberg’s classic film. With only five weeks spent in development -- games typically take months, if not years, to program -- the game was notoriously difficult and sold miserably. Atari spent $21 million to purchase the rights to the franchise and $5 million on promotion of the game. The company made 4 million copies of the game, but sold only 1.5 million. Atari buried the leftover copies in a landfill.\n\n4. Satisfries\n\nCompany: Burger King\n\nBurger King Year introduced: 2013\n\n2013 What it was: French fries\n\nIn 2013, Burger King introduced a new menu item advertised as a healthy alternative to their traditional french fries. Satisfries used a less porous batter, which caused the fry to absorb less oil than regular fries during cooking. While Satisfries were made with a healthier recipe, Burger King failed to convey the difference to customers. The fries were also more expensive than Burger King’s regular french fries, and failed to gain traction with consumers. The company discontinued the fries in 2014, less than a year after they were introduced.\n\n5. Premier smokeless cigarettes\n\nCompany: RJ Reynolds\n\nRJ Reynolds Year introduced: 1988\n\n1988 What it was: Cigarette\n\nR.J. Reynolds, the second largest U.S. tobacco company, began marketing in 1988 a smokeless tobacco product that was intended to be a safer way to use a cigarette. In addition to concerns over the product's actual safety, smokers missed the familiar elements of traditional cigarettes -- the smoke, the burn, and the flick. Another issue was the widely-reported unpleasant chemical taste, which one user described as resembling “burning plastic.” Reynolds sunk close to $1 billion into the product before pulling it off the market within a year.\n\n6. Cheetos Lip Balm\n\nCompany: Frito-Lay\n\nFrito-Lay Year introduced: 2005\n\n2005 What it was: Lip balm\n\nPopular lip balm brands such as Chapstick, Blistex, and Burt’s Bees, have successfully sold their products to Americans for decades. Many prefer such flavored varieties as cherry, mint, and vanilla bean. Not every popular flavor can be successfully turned into a lip balm, however, a lesson PepsiCo subsidiary Frito-Lay learned the hard way in 2005. While Cheetos has been a popular snack for more than six decades, Cheetos-flavored lip balm failed to catch on with consumers.\n\n7. Terra Nova\n\nCompany: Fox\n\nFox Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: TV show\n\nEvery year, TV shows are cancelled before the end of their first season. While Terra Nova, which aired for one 13-episode season, is not unusual in this regard, it may go down as the most costly cancelled television show of all time. Documenting the time-traveling adventures of a 22nd century family fleeing a dystopian society for a prehistoric past, the pilot of the show alone cost Fox between $16 and $20 million to make. Terra Nova encountered numerous production mishaps while filming in Australia, including a flood that nearly killed a crew member. Ratings failed to meet expectations, and the show was not renewed for a second season. Fox is estimated to have spent more than $50 million on the failed show, not including marketing costs.\n\n8. Touch of Yogurt shampoo\n\nCompany: Clairol\n\nClairol Year introduced: 1979\n\n1979 What it was: Shampoo\n\nIn keeping with the 1970s trend of incorporating natural food ingredients like lemon, herbs, and honey into beauty and hygiene products, Clairol -- at the time a subsidiary of Bristol-Myers Squibb -- thought a yogurt shampoo was just what the American consumer wanted. It turned out the company had grossly miscalculated. Many consumers were apparently confused as to what they had bought, as there were reported cases of people eating the shampoo.\n\nMore: Jeep, Disney, Coca-Cola top survey list of America’s most patriotic brands\n\n9. New Coke\n\nCompany: Coca-Cola\n\nCoca-Cola Year introduced: 1985\n\n1985 What it was: Soft drink\n\nOver the 15 years leading up to 1985, Coca-Cola’s flagship cola drink had been losing market share to Pepsi Cola. To compete, the company changed the drink’s formula for the first time in 99 years -- but the move today is considered one of the greatest flops of all time. New Coke was met with public outrage and lasted only a few months. The company reintroduced its older formula, rebranded as Coca-Cola Classic.\n\n10. Windows Vista\n\nCompany: Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft Year introduced: 2007\n\n2007 What it was: Operating system\n\nIntroduced in 2007 as a follow-up to Windows XP, the Windows Vista operating system was everything its popular predecessor was not -- in all the wrong ways. Panned by customers and IT professionals alike, Vista reduced PC performance and caused a number of internet problems for users. As a result, Dell began offering Windows XP again on new laptops a few short months after Vista was introduced. Windows announced this month that it would no longer provide support for Vista, driving the final nail into the operating system’s coffin.\n\n11. Kitchen Entrees\n\nCompany: Colgate\n\nColgate Year introduced: 1982\n\n1982 What it was: Frozen meal\n\nMany of the worst product flops in recent memory were caused by otherwise popular brands wandering too far outside of their area of expertise. Colgate Kitchen Entrees may be the best example of such a product failure. When it came to pre-prepared frozen meals, Americans had plenty of options in the 1980s. Perhaps because consumers naturally associated the Colgate name with toothpaste, there was never much of an appetite for pre-made meals bearing the Colgate logo.\n\n12. Coors Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water\n\nCompany: Coors\n\nCoors Year introduced: 1990\n\n1990 What it was: Sparkling water\n\nCoors and Coors Light are two of the most popular beers in the United States. Introducing Coors Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water to the public in 1990, the Coors Brewing Company also sought to capitalize on the fast-growing bottled water segment in the United States. The water was Coors' first non-alcoholic product since Prohibition. The Coors brand name did not help to sell the product, however, as the beer-name branding may have confused or even frightened consumers. Coors let its trademark of Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water expire in 1997.\n\n13. Harley Davidson perfume\n\nCompany: Harley Davidson\n\nHarley Davidson Year released: 1994\n\n1994 What it was: Perfume\n\nHarley Davidson is one of the most iconic and valuable brands in the world. It is also one of the most masculine brands. The company has not deviated considerably from this manly personality, although it has tried. The company released Legendary Harley-Davidson, a cologne for men, among several other varieties, starting in 1994. Another perfume, Black Fire, hit the market as recently as 2005. All are now discontinued. In the 1990s, the company released a number of other products, including wine coolers and aftershave, which after failing miserably have also become classic cases of brand overextension.\n\n14. Persil Power\n\nHolding company: Unilever\n\nUnilever Year released: 1994\n\n1994 What it was: Stain remover\n\nUnilever introduced Persil Power detergent to the market in 1994. The product utilized a newly patented stain removal formula called Accelerator. The company was so confident in the Accelerator catalyst that it carried out its $300 million introduction of Persil Power without any formal test marketing. Over time, it became clear the detergent was damaging clothes at high temperatures. After nine months on the shelves, the company replaced Persil Power with Persil New Generation, a detergent without the Accelerator compound.\n\n15. Cosmopolitan yogurt\n\nCompany: Cosmopolitan\n\nCosmopolitan Year introduced: 1999\n\n1999 What it was: Yogurt\n\nCosmopolitan is a popular women’s magazine, full of fashion advice, dating tips, celebrity gossip, and horoscopes. What the magazine’s leadership was thinking when they expanded the brand’s reach from the magazine aisle to the dairy aisle remains a mystery. Few will likely remember the 1999 debut of Cosmopolitan’s yogurt line, as the short-lived product was only available for 18 months. Like many other products on this list, Cosmopolitan yogurt was a case of a brand reaching too far beyond its area of expertise.\n\n16. DH 106 Comet\n\nCompany: De Havilland\n\nDe Havilland Year introduced: 1949\n\n1949 What it was: Airplane\n\nWe now take jet travel for granted, but the development of a commercially viable jetliner involved a great deal of trial, error, and some utter failures. De Havilland, a British aircraft manufacturer, developed the Comet, the first commercial jet airliner. Unfortunately, within a few years of its 1949 debut, the Comet encountered several unexplained fatal crashes, including planes overrunning the runway and one exploding in midair. The Comet's reputation plummeted, and while De Havilland scrambled to redesign the plane, American companies Douglas and Boeing took over the industry.\n\nMore: Which manufacturers are bringing the most jobs back to America?\n\n17. DeLorean DMC-12\n\nCompany: Delorean Motor Company\n\nDelorean Motor Company Year introduced: 1981\n\n1981 What it was: Sports car\n\nIn 1973, auto executive John DeLorean left General Motors to form the DeLorean Motor Company. After years of production delays, the DeLorean DMC-12 was released in January 1981. The car’s unique design was poorly received, however, and by 1982 less than half of the 7,000 DeLorean units produced had been sold. The DeLorean is widely recognized due to its use as a converted time machine in the “Back to the Future” series. However, the first of these films was released in 1985, far too late to save the ill-fated brand. DeLorean filed for bankruptcy in 1982.\n\n18. EZ Squirt\n\nCompany: Heinz\n\nHeinz Year released: 2000\n\n2000 Company revenue when released: Ketchup\n\nBefore EZ Squirt, ketchup was always varying shades of red. To cater to kids, who were -- and still are -- among ketchup’s largest groups of consumers, Heinz began producing purple, green, and blue EZ Squirt ketchup in matching, vibrantly colored squeeze bottles. At first, the colorful ketchup was a huge success. The novelty wore off quickly, however, and not long after its introduction, sales of EZ Squirt began to decline. In January 2006, less than six years after its debut, Heinz halted production of the product.\n\n19. United States Football League\n\nCompany: USFL\n\nUSFL Year introduced: 1982\n\n1982 What it was: Sports league\n\nConceived as a way to satiate America's appetite for football in the spring and summer months, the United States Football League was introduced in 1982. The league originally consisted of 12 teams, one of which, the New Jersey Generals, was owned by President Donald Trump. The league was beset with problems, not the least of which was finding stadiums to play in. Ultimately, over half a dozen teams folded when the league’s brain trust decided to compete directly with the NFL by scheduling games in the fall. By 1985, the league was finished.\n\n20. Home\n\nCompany: Facebook\n\nFacebook Year introduced: 2013\n\n2013 What it was: Mobile phone app\n\nWith rising mobile phone use and social media engagement, Facebook in 2013 decided to launch a family of apps that combine these trends. Facebook Home converts the home screen of a smartphone into the Facebook news feed. While most of Facebook’s over 1 billion users log in to their accounts on a smartphone, the social media giant’s new product never caught on. Early users cited clunky operation, the inability to toggle between Facebook Home and the original phone interface, and lack of options for customization, among other snags.\n\n21. Edsel\n\nCompany: Ford\n\nFord Year introduced: 1957\n\n1957 What it was: Car\n\nFord spent a year aggressively marketing the Edsel -- named after Henry Ford’s son -- ahead of its 1957 release. It was to be the “car of the future,” made available on dealership lots on what Ford dubbed “E-Day.\" Despite the hype, the car was a commercial disaster. It was considerably overpriced, disappointingly not futuristic, and generally ugly. Ford ceased the car's production after only two years, losing an estimated $350 million.\n\n22. Friendster\n\nCompany: Friendster\n\nFriendster Year introduced: 2002\n\n2002 What it was: Social media site\n\nSocial media site Facebook is one of the biggest corporate success stories in recent memory. Unfortunately, when it comes to social media, for every success story there is at least one flop -- as in the case of Friendster. The site’s users suffered through slow page loading times and the company’s developers failed to scale up when the number of subscribers spiked. Ultimately, competitors such as Facebook provided a much better user experience. Introduced in 2002, Friendster discontinued its services in mid-2015.\n\n23. WOW! Chips\n\nCompany: Frito-Lay\n\nFrito-Lay Year introduced: 1998\n\n1998 What it was: Snack\n\nPepsiCo subsidiary Frito-Lay introduced its line of WOW! Chips in 1998. The chips, which were made with the fat substitute olestra, were marketed as a healthy snacking alternative. While WOW! Chips were an initial success with $347 million in sales in their first year -- the most of any new product in 1998 -- sales slowed when the unpleasant side effects of olestra, such as diarrhea and cramps, became better known. To add to the product’s problems, the Food and Drug Administration instituted labeling requirements for all products containing olestra to carry warnings of “abdominal cramping and loose stools,\" and by 2000, sales of WOW! Chips were roughly 60% of what they were in the year of their release.\n\nMore: Per capita government spending: How much does your state spend on you?\n\n24. Zune\n\nCompany: Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft Year introduced: 2006\n\n2006 What it was: MP3 player\n\nIn an attempt to compete with Apple's dominant iPod MP3 player, Microsoft released the Zune in 2006. As of November 15, 2015, Microsoft discontinued all streaming, downloading, and other music services for the Zune. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, Microsoft recorded a 42% decline in revenue in its non-gaming devices segment -- a decline largely attributable to the Zune’s poor performance. While the device might have been a reasonable choice for consumers, a number of reported bugs did not help sales. On December 31, 2008, most if not all 30GB Zunes stopped functioning simply because the underlying code had failed to account for the extra day in leap years.\n\n25. Relenza\n\nCompany: GlaxoSmithKline\n\nGlaxoSmithKline Year introduced: 1999\n\n1999 What it was: Influenza pandemic drug\n\nIn 1999, a flu pandemic fear caused by the spread of avian flu created demand for antiviral medications. The FDA approved two flu drugs during the pandemic -- Tamiflu and Relenza. The former went on to report massive sales, while the latter became one of the worst product flops in the pharmaceutical industry. The powder form of the drug caused respiratory problems in some patients and was only approved as a treatment for influenza rather than a preventative measure. GlaxoSmithKline sold just $13 million worth of the drug in the first quarter of 2006. By comparison, Roche reported $770 million in Tamiflu sales in the first half of the year.\n\n26. Google+\n\nCompany: Google\n\nGoogle Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: Social media site\n\nNo all product flops are necessarily discontinued. Sometimes, despite failing to live up to company expectations, they linger. Such is the case with Google+, the social media platform the Silicon Valley giant launched in 2011 to compete with Facebook. However, even with a monumental marketing campaign, Google+ failed to distinguish itself from Facebook and never took off in the same manner. While the site experienced an initial surge in subscribers, by April 2015, Google+ had experienced a 98% decline in user engagement. Today, Google+ has some active user groups and is often used to share photos.\n\n27. HP Touchpad\n\nCompany: Hewlett-Packard\n\nHewlett-Packard Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: Tablet computer\n\nThe TouchPad was Hewlett Packard’s attempt to compete with Apple’s wildly successful iPad. Hewlett Packard unveiled the device in the middle of 2011 with an extremely costly advertising campaign. The rollout incorporated numerous celebrity contracts. By late summer, however, box stores such as Best Buy were sitting on excess inventory, and HP began offering steep discounts. Many discounted TouchPads were sold at a loss, and it is estimated the company lost hundreds of millions on the product in all.\n\n28. Kellogg's Breakfast Mates\n\nCompany: Kellogg's\n\nKellogg's Year introduced: 1998\n\n1998 What it was: Breakfast food\n\nIn 1998, Kellogg’s introduced Breakfast Mates, an all-in-one package containing a serving of cereal, a small carton of milk, and a plastic spoon. The product was designed as a time saver that would appeal busy families with two working parents. The stated convenience of the all-in-one packaging did little to save time, largely because traditional cereal is already relatively convenient to consume. In a controlled test reported by The New York Times, preparing a bowl of cereal the traditional way took only one second longer than preparing a bowl of Breakfast Mates. To make matters worse, the product’s $30 million ad campaign sent a mixed message, depicting a family eating the supposedly portable cereal around the kitchen table. In August 1999, Kellogg’s announced Breakfast Mates would be discontinued due to low sales.\n\n29. Maxwell House Brewed Coffee\n\nCompany: Maxwell House\n\nMaxwell House Year introduced: 1990\n\n1990 What it was: Coffee\n\nMaxwell House Brewed Coffee was pre-brewed coffee sold in a carton with a picture of a hot mug of coffee on the packaging, a misleading visual cue for a product meant to be stored in the refrigerator. Adding to the product’s issues, the carton was lined with foil and could not be microwaved. For a product marketed for its convenience, this was an especially problematic feature for consumers. The product was discontinued shortly after it was released.\n\n30. Arch Deluxe\n\nCompany: McDonald's\n\nMcDonald's Year introduced: 1996\n\n1996 What it was: Hamburger\n\nMcDonald’s introduced several failed products throughout its 60-year history, but none so monumental as the Arch Deluxe. Introduced in 1996, the Arch Deluxe was marketed as a more gastronomic hamburger with “a grown-up taste.\" One commercial featured a child unable to enjoy the sophisticated burger, stripping its toppings to satisfy his unrefined palate. The Arch Deluxe’s advertising budget was an estimated $200 million, the most of any fast food product at the time. However, the approach failed and sales of the Arch Deluxe missed the $1 billion expectation set for its first year. The Arch Deluxe was eventually discontinued.\n\nMore: Wage potential: Highest paying jobs you can get without a college degree\n\n31. HD DVD\n\nCompany: Toshiba\n\nToshiba Year introduced: 2006\n\n2006 What it was: Media storage/playback device\n\nBlu-ray’s succession of the DVD was not preordained. Before Blu-ray was the dominant medium for video playback, it was competing with Toshiba’s HD DVD. Essentially the same product, HD DVD was effectively taken out to pasture when in January 2008, Warner Bros. announced it would only support Sony’s Blu-ray format. Toshiba was not the only loser in the battle against Blu-ray. Millions of Americans found themselves stuck with HD DVD players and laptops after the dust settled.\n\n32. Microsoft Bob\n\nCompany: Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft Year introduced: 1995\n\n1995 What it was: User interface\n\nMicrosoft released Microsoft Bob in March 1995. Intended as a simple, easy-to-use OS interface at the time, Bob presented the desktop as a house, with familiar objects corresponding with different computer applications. Clicking on the stationary lying on a desk, for example, opened the word processor. Despite its simple appearance, Bob required more processing power than most home computers had in 1995. Bob was also considered too expensive and poorly designed, and was overshadowed by the release of Windows 95 later that year. Bob was discontinued roughly a year after its release.\n\n33. 47 Ronin\n\nCompany: Universal Pictures\n\nUniversal Pictures Year introduced: 2013\n\n2013 What it was: Movie\n\nThe 2013 fantasy action film “47 Ronin”, starring Keanu Reeves, is now notorious as one of the biggest box office flops of all time. The movie lost nearly $150 million on a $225 million budget and left Universal Pictures in the red for the fiscal year. Insiders point to multiple rewrites of the screenplay as well as several post-production changes that were made as filmmakers and studio executives attempted to find creative balance while appeasing moviegoers. In the end, the film failed to strike a chord with audiences and critics alike.\n\n34. Qwikster\n\nCompany: Netflix\n\nNetflix Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: DVD rental service\n\nBefore Netflix became the media streaming giant we know today, it was exclusively a deliver-by-mail DVD rental service. In an ill conceived of strategy, CEO Reed Hastings announced in September 2011 the company's plan to spin off its DVD rental service into a separate company, known as Qwikster. The move, which was meant to allow Netflix to focus more on its streaming services, would have cost consumers about 60% more if they wished to continue to have access to both services. Unpopular with customers and widely criticized, Hastings scrapped the plan less than a month after it was announced.\n\n35. Virtual Boy\n\nCompany: Nintendo\n\nNintendo Year introduced: 1995\n\n1995 What it was: Portable game console\n\nVirtual Boy was game console maker Nintendo’s early foray into virtual reality technology. However, the company discontinued the portable console less than a year after its 1995 release, selling just 770,000 units globally. It is known as one of the company’s worst failures. To cut costs and reduce battery drain, Nintendo used only black and red shades in Virtual Boy games, which bothered some users. Using the Virtual Boy also caused eye strain in some users, which led Nintendo to include an automatic shutoff mechanism.\n\n36. MeeGo\n\nCompany: Nokia/Intel\n\nNokia/Intel Year introduced: 2010\n\n2010 What it was: Operating system\n\nUnlike Windows Vista, another operating system on this list, smartphone OS MeeGo was not necessarily a flawed product. By most accounts, the MeeGo operating system just came at the wrong time. Not long after its introduction, the operating system was dropped by then Nokia CEO Stephen Elop in favor of Windows Phone 7 operating system. Though it has not been used in years, MeeGo may find a second life as a tablet operating system.\n\n37. Crystal Pepsi\n\nCompany: Pepsi\n\nPepsi Year introduced: 1992\n\n1992 What it was: Soda\n\nCrystal Pepsi was introduced to soda lovers across the United States in 1992. The product tasted like regular cola but was clear and caffeine free in an attempt to convey purity and heath. Crystal Pepsi was heavily promoted, with the company even buying an ad slot during Super Bowl XXVII. Despite strong initial sales, the public’s interest quickly waned and the soda was discontinued less than two years after its release.\n\n38. Hot Wheels and Barbie computers\n\nCompany: Mattel / Patriot Computers\n\nMattel / Patriot Computers Year released: 1999\n\n1999 What it was: Toy computer\n\nIn 1999, Mattel announced that it had entered a licensing agreement to sell Barbie and Hot Wheels computers. The computers would be manufactured and sold by the Patriot Computer Corporation, a privately held company based in Toronto. The move was part of an attempt to reconcile the declining sales of Barbie dolls and growing sales of software and CD-ROMs.\n\nThe computers, however, had many manufacturing flaws, and the resources Patriot devoted to fixing and replacing broken computers drove it out of business. By December the following year, the company had fired its 200 employees and filed for bankruptcy.\n\nMore: How much did a personal computer cost the year you were born?\n\n39. LaserDisc\n\nCompany: Phillips\n\nPhillips Year introduced: 1978\n\n1978 What it was: Media storage/playback device\n\nLaserDisc was effectively a precursor to the DVD, offering consumers a higher quality picture and sound than VHS tapes. The product’s numerous drawbacks, however, outweighed any benefits. Unlike VHS players, LaserDisc players could not record television shows -- an important feature before the days of TiVo. LaserDisc players, as well as LaserDiscs themselves, were also relatively expensive. Introduced in the 1970s, LaserDisc made a brief comeback in the 90s, but ultimately failed to gain traction.\n\n40. Dreamcast\n\nCompany: Sega\n\nSega Year introduced: 1999 (North America)\n\n1999 (North America) What it was: Game console\n\nIn the 1990s, Sega was a dominant player in the consoles and games business. Sega had such success with its Sonic the Hedgehog games and Genesis console, that at one point the company held 60% of the North American market. The Dreamcast launched in 1999 in North America, within a few years of successful predecessors like the Nintendo 64 and Sony Playstation. Many consider the Dreamcast to have been ahead of its time -- it was the first console to introduce worldwide network compatibility -- but the system just never caught on. Dreamcast sold miserably and was discontinued after just over two years, in part due to the success of the PS2, which launched in 2000. While it was not Sega’s only failure, it may have been its most colossal, marking the end of the company’s attempts at game consoles.\n\n41. S&W Mountain Bikes\n\nCompany: Smith & Wesson\n\nSmith & Wesson Year introduced: 2002\n\n2002 What it was: Mountain bike\n\nGun manufacturer Smith & Wesson has been making police bicycles for about 20 years. The company also attempted to sell mountain bikes to the general public in 2002. Like many other products on this list, the company’s consumer bike segment likely failed because bicycles were too far beyond the scope of the Smith & Wesson brand and what most Americans associate with it.\n\n42. Lisa\n\nCompany: Apple\n\nApple Year introduced: 1983\n\n1983 What it was: Personal computer\n\nBefore Apple hit its stride in the 2000s and became the most profitable corporation in history, the company was responsible for some of the worst product flops of all time. Designed as a high-end personal computer with a graphical user interface for business customers, the Apple Lisa took three years and $50 million to develop before its release in 1983. However, the computer’s $9,995 price tag, which is equivalent to roughly $25,000 today, was too high for many consumers. After selling just 100,000 units in two years Apple discontinued the Lisa in 1985.\n\n43. Betamax\n\nCompany: Sony\n\nSony Year introduced: 1975\n\n1975 What it was: Video cassette format\n\nIn the early 1970s, videotapes were still a novel technology, and the VHS tape had yet to become the standard video cassette format. Sony introduced the Betamax format in 1975, one year before JVC introduced the VHS tape. While Betamax tapes had superior resolution and sound quality, Sony refrained from licensing its technology to other manufacturers, in turn limiting the variety of movies available on the format. Meanwhile, JVC licensed its VHS technology to any interested manufacturer. The Betamax’s share of the VCR market fell from 100% in 1975 to 10% in 1988, and continued to dwindle in the following years.\n\n44. Too Human\n\nCompany: Silicon Knights\n\nSilicon Knights Year introduced: 2008\n\n2008 What it was: Video game\n\nReleased in 2008 after years of costly development delays, “Too Human” failed to live up to expectation and became one of the worst flops in video game history. A legal ruling eventually removed the game from the marketplace and pushed Silicon Knights, the game’s developer, into bankruptcy. The game’s production budget skyrocketed to an estimated $100 million after the game engine developer, Epic Games, failed to deliver the engine on time, forcing Silicon Knights to build it own game engine. When Silicon Knights sued Epic Games for missing the deadline, the latter counter-sued, which resulted in a court order forcing the developer to destroy all unsold copies of the game.\n\nMore: Are these the worst cities to live in?

Mobile ESPN\n\nCompany: ESPN\n\nESPN Year introduced: 2006\n\n2006 What it was: Mobile phone service\n\nIn 2006, ESPN attempted to capitalize on the desire of sports fan to have access to sports stats, scores, and video on the go. Mobile ESPN required users to buy a specific phone, which would include access to ESPN content as part of the subscription. However, the only phone Mobile ESPN offered, a Sanyo, cost $400, and the service was $40 per month, too rich for many sports fans. The service shut down within a year. Disney, ESPN’s parent company, spent $150 million on the failed venture.\n\n46. Life Savers soda\n\nCompany: Life Savers\n\nLife Savers Year introduced: 1995\n\n1995 What it was: Soft drink\n\nThough Life Savers soda tested well in focus groups, it failed to gain traction with the broader consumer market. Many attribute the soft drink’s failure to the prevailing perception that it was liquid candy. The soda was available in some of the candy’s popular fruit flavors, including pineapple, orange punch, grape punch, and lime punch. Life Savers did not release a mint flavored soda, however.\n\n47. Mars Needs Moms\n\nCompany: Walt Disney Motion\n\nWalt Disney Motion Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: Studio film\n\nReleased in March 2011, Disney’s “Mars Needs Moms” grossed just $6.9 million in its opening weekend. Produced with a $150 million budget, “Mars Needs Moms” was one of the worst flops in cinema history. Film critics partially blame animation studio ImageMovers Digital for the film’s box office failure. The movie was animated using an expensive motion-capture process, a technology still in its infancy. According to one viewer, “The movie looked downright creepy.” ImageMovers Digital was closed after the studio wrapped production on the film.\n\n48. EONS\n\nCompany: Eons.com\n\nEons.com Year introduced: 2006\n\n2006 What it was: Social media site\n\nIn July 2006, Monster.com founder Jeff Taylor launched Eons.com -- a social network for baby boomers and other internet users over the age of 50. According to surveys conducted by Pew Research Center, an estimated 32% of seniors over the age of 65 used the internet at the time of the website’s launch compared to 86% of young adults aged 18 to 29. While the share of seniors on the internet has doubled over the past decade, Eons failed to gain traction and was sold to Crew Media in 2011.\n\n49. Supertrain\n\nCompany: NBC\n\nNBC Year introduced: 1979\n\n1979 What it was: TV show\n\nWhen NBC’s “Supertrain” premiered in 1979, it was the most expensive TV series ever aired. Set aboard a nuclear-powered train that travels between New York City and Los Angeles at speeds nearing 200 miles an hour, the show’s production required a model train set that cost around $3 million in today’s dollars. The model crashed during its first demonstration, and the show as a whole soon followed. Debuting to poor ratings and negative reviews, “Supertrain” was cancelled after just nine episodes.\n\n50. Galaxy Note 7\n\nCompany: Samsung\n\nSamsung Year introduced: 2016\n\n2016 What it was: Tablet phone\n\nSamsung, which has overtaken Apple in the smartphone market last year, also had one of (the larger and--optional) more recent product flops. The Note S7, a phablet that launched in August 2016, was initially well received. However, it had a serious flaw. A problem with the battery software resulted in the phones catching fire on several occasions, including once on a SouthWest Airlines flight, which had to be evacuated. Soon, the Department of Transportation made it illegal to bring a Note 7 on a commercial flight. By October, after an extremely expensive recall, Samsung suspended worldwide production of the Note 7. The company lost what is estimated to be over $3 billion due to the debacle, and Apple once again took the lead in the global smartphone market earlier this year.\n\nMore: Can you afford that new vehicle? 25 most expensive car models to insure\n\nDetailed findings and methodology\n\nHindsight is 20/20, and while many of these gaffes might not have been predictable at the time, the reasons for their failure are often much clearer today. The reasons for the failures often fall into one of a several categories: overpricing, timing, bad advertising, product flaws, and reaching beyond what consumers of a brand are willing to accept.\n\nSometimes products are sold at a premium because they offer features competitors do not, either perceived or actual. When customers do not feel a product is superior to another -- rightly so or not -- they will not pay the premium price. While Apple is able to sell computers at a premium today because of its brand perception, the Lisa, introduced in 1983, failed largely as a result of its nearly $10,000 price tag.\n\nMany of the products on this list could have been perfectly viable, possibly even a hit, if they had been introduced at a different time. Sega’s Dreamcast was the first major console to introduce global network connectivity, but this was before every home had a stable connection fast enough to make the Dreamcast viable at the time.\n\nFor some flops on this list, it appears poor market research doomed these products. McDonald’s Arch Deluxe was marketed as a burger for those with refined palates, turning away kids, as well as many adults, from the ill-fated item. Coca-Cola completely misjudged the desire of its customers when it changed its classic flavor and introduced New Coke.\n\nSometimes, brands overextend their reach, introducing products that clash with their image and target demographics. One does not need to dig too deep to understand why Colgate, a brand associated with toothpaste, failed to make its line of frozen dinner products a success. The same can be said for Cosmopolitan’s brand of yogurt, Smith & Wesson’s mountain bike line, or Harley Davidson’s perfume.\n\nOf course, many of the products on this list were simply poorly designed or faulty -- at times downright dangerous. Such was the case with Mattel’s line of seriously flawed Hot Wheels and Barbie computers, or the Galaxy Note 7, plagued by battery fires that caused the phone to be banned on airplanes, recalled, and eventually discontinued.\n\nDespite their disappointing launches, some of these products still exist today. Google’s Glass and Google+ each became the butt of jokes after failing to live up to lofty promises. One day, we may see one of these flops become the product it was meant to be.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

The day was darkened by a missile strike on an eastern Ukrainian train station which killed at least 22 people -- fulfilling warnings by Ukrainian officials.\n\nWhile previous years have been marked by celebrations and parades, Wednesday's commemoration comes exactly six months after Russia's invasion of the country began.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky marked the day with an emotional address that spoke of the Russian invasion as a new independence day -- the day Ukraine had to fight for its freedom, rather than simply voting for it at the ballot box.\n\n\"A new nation emerged on February 24 at 4 a.m. Not born, but reborn. A nation that didn't cry, didn't scream, didn't get scared. Didn't run away. Didn't give up. Didn't forget,\" Zelensky said Wednesday.\n\nHe added: \"Every new day is a new reason not to give up. Because, having gone through so much, we have no right not to reach the end. What is the end of the war for us? We used to say: Peace. Now we say: Victory.\"\n\nAcross the country, Ukrainians paid tribute to those who have been killed in military action since the invasion began. Foreign leaders, such as UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson , also visited Kyiv.\n\nIn the capital, Zelensky and first lady Olena Zelenska visited the Memory Wall of Fallen Defenders of Ukraine. In the Western city of Lviv, visibly emotional family members of fallen soldiers attended a ceremony at the memorial, the Field of Mars.\n\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and his wife Olena visit the Memory Wall of Fallen Defenders of Ukraine in Kyiv on August 24.\n\nBut Zelensky had also warned that Russia might step up efforts to launch attacks, including missile strikes, on \"infrastructure facilities or state institutions\" around the holiday. The US government joined the chorus of concern, telling Americans on Tuesday to leave the country immediately.\n\nOn Wednesday, those fears appeared to play out. Yuri Sak, an adviser to Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov, told CNN that Russia conducted \"missile strikes across Ukrainian territory.\"\n\n\"In other major cities of Ukraine, even those which are far away from the battlefield, there have been explosions, there have been missile strikes,\" Sak said, adding that Kyiv had at least eight air raid sirens on Wednesday.\n\nThe Chaplyne train station in the eastern Dnipropetrovsk Oblast was hit in a strike, killing at least 22 people and wounding 50 more, Zelensky said later on Wednesday. An 11-year-old was among those killed in the strike.\n\n\"Chaplyne is our pain today. As of this moment, there are 22 dead, five of them burned in the car. A teenager died, he was 11 years old, a Russian rocket destroyed his house,\" Zelensky added.\n\nAt least 50 people were injured in the strike at Chaplyne train stateion in eastern Ukraine. CNN could not independently verify this image.\n\n'Not that easily scared'\n\nIn lieu of a parade, wrecked and captured Russian military vehicles, including tanks, were placed on Khreshchatyk, Kyiv's main street, as a testament to Moscow's failed attempt to capture the capital in the early weeks of the war.\n\nOn the eve of Independence Day, crowds of people were seen in Khreshchatyk, inspecting the display. Some children crawled up the rusty metal carcass of a tank, while others posed for pictures by the mangled vehicles.\n\nLiubov, who asked for her last name to not be published, said she turned up to show the \"scrap metal parade\" to her 8-year-old son, Illia.\n\nAs Illia climbed on a Russian combat vehicle, Liubov described the parade as \"symbolic,\" saying \"a lot of people in Kyiv (have forgotten) about war, so I think this is a good reminder.\"\n\nLiubov says she won't leave Kyiv despite the risk of a Russian attack.\n\nHer husband, who is fighting on the front line, has implored her to leave the capital for their summer home 50 kilometers (31 miles) away, she said. But she has refused to go.\n\nEven if \"there are massive missile strikes on Kyiv (on Wednesday), we will not leave,\" she said, explaining she has an emergency bag at home, with enough clothes and overalls \"in case of radiation pollution ... in case of missiles. We are not that easily scared by them anymore.\"\n\n\"I don't feel festive about (Independence Day), I rather feel sad,\" she added. \"Because I understand what is going on and my husband and brother are on the front line.\"\n\nHolding a Ukrainian flag, another onlooker told CNN she also has relatives fighting against Russia.\n\n\"My father is on the front line, a lot of my relatives are on the front line ... so tomorrow is not a celebration per se, but honoring and feeling independence, because this time it will feel differently than for the previous 30 years,\" said Daria, 35, who declined to give her last name.\n\nFamily members of fallen soldiers attend a ceremony at the memorial, the Field of Mars.\n\nInternational solidarity\n\nUS President Joe Biden marked Ukraine's Independence Day Wednesday by reiterating the US' commitment to Ukraine with a new $2.98 billion investment in security assistance.\n\n\"This will allow Ukraine to acquire air defense systems, artillery systems and munitions, counter-unmanned aerial systems, and radars to ensure it can continue to defend itself over the long term,\" Biden said in a statement Wednesday.\n\n\"Today is not only a celebration of the past, but a resounding affirmation that Ukraine proudly remains -- and will remain -- a sovereign and independent nation,\" Biden said, adding that the US \"looks forward to continuing to celebrate Ukraine as a democratic, independent, sovereign and prosperous state for decades to come.\"\n\nIncluded in the security assistance package is VAMPIRE counter-unmanned aerial system -- or counter-drone system -- that uses \"small missiles essentially to shoot missiles out of the sky,\" Department of Defense Undersecretary for Policy Dr. Colin Kahl told reporters later on Wednesday.\n\nDignitaries and families attend a ceremony for the fallen soldiers of Ukraine on the Field of Mars on Wednesday in Lviv.\n\nWorld leaders joined Biden on Wednesday in pledging continuing support for Ukraine.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Johnson met with Zelensky during his visit. He announced a $66 million aid package for Ukraine, telling the country that it \"can and will win\" the war against Russia.\n\nPortugal's Foreign Minister João Gomes Cravinho was also among foreign leaders in Kyiv.\n\nIn Brussels, a giant Ukrainian flag was unrolled on Grand-Place during an event attended by President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen.\n\nIn a Twitter message on Wednesday, President of the European Council Charles Michel said: \"Your future is our common future.

He previously worked as an investigative reporter at the Moscow Tribune. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion on CNN.\n\n(CNN) On May 9 -- known as Victory Day in Russia -- President Vladimir Putin will need to make a bombastic and very public display to suggest he is winning the war in Ukraine.\n\nBut more than two months in, the war is going far from how Russia originally envisaged. May 9, then, might present Putin the occasion to declare a symbolic \"victory\" over Ukraine -- a great demonstration of patriotic ecstasy aimed at shoring up his manipulated, sanction-weary audience.\n\nThe date marks the day Nazi Germany surrendered to Soviet forces (the day after its capitulation to the Western allies, which is why the UK, US and their allies commemorate victory on May 8).\n\nMoscow initially partnered with Nazi Berlin to divide eastern Europe between the two totalitarian regimes. But after that partnership ended with the German invasion of the USSR in 1941, the Soviet human contribution to defeating Germany -- backed by enormous shipments of food aid and military equipment from the UK, US and Canada -- was critical.\n\nThe USSR lost tens of millions of soldiers and civilians in the course of the Second World War -- many of them in the then-Soviet republics of Ukraine and Belarus.\n\nOver the entirety of his regime, Soviet-leader Joseph Stalin killed more people both in his own country and in occupied territories than Adolf Hitler. But these days it is a crime in Russia to recall this history, or to compare the atrocities committed by the Soviet Union with those of Nazi Germany. Fresh flowers are still placed on Stalin's grave in Red Square -- where the May 9 victory parade is held.\n\nHow important is May 9 to Putin?\n\nVladimir Putin is an ultra-nationalist who does not believe Russia's territorial and political ambitions should end at its internationally recogniz​ed boundaries. The countries that used to make up the Soviet Union other than Russia are not considered sovereign by Russia -- by most Russians in fact , and especially by Putin.\n\nBut with no friendly tools to attract other countries available, to retain or regain an empire Russia needs a powerful army. May 9 is designed to show off to the home crowd, to intimidate the opposition and to please the dictator of the time (over the years, all secretaries-general of the Communist Party similarly stood on Lenin's mausoleum on Red Square acknowledging Russia's military might with satisfaction as it drove past and flew over).\n\nUkraine is deeply personal to Putin (but, fortunately, for the future of Ukraine, even more personal to Ukrainians). Its \"waywardness\" is a betrayal and its very existence an historical aberration, in the eyes of the Russian President. Something had to be done about Ukraine's Western ambitions and as Russian style diplomacy (read: coercion) had failed, Putin felt forced to turn to more muscular methods to \"restore rightness.\"\n\nWhat he didn't realize​ (although nor, to be fair, did most Western analysts) was how fundamentally corrupted and incompetent Russia's supposedly modernize​d and professionalized fighting force had become.\n\nUkraine's heroic resistance deserves every credit. But they couldn't have achieved it without the Russians army's inadvertent help. Meanwhile, such is the vertical nature of Russia's political structures, there is surely little accurate information circulating among the rest of Putin's elites on the state of play.\n\nWhat could this mean for the course of the war?\n\nIf Western analysts are correct that Putin has demanded victory by Victory Day, this means Russia's military commanders need to achieve something -- anything -- after the humiliating defeats in the first two months of this war.\n\nThe attempt to take Kyiv was repelled, the Russian fleet's flagship cruiser has been sunk by a country effectively without a Navy, and they have lost at least 15,000 soldiers -- far more than in all previous post-Soviet campaigns (Chechnya, Georgia, Syria, Ukraine 2014) combined.\n\nRussia's Plan B (or more likely plan F or G) is to redouble efforts and ground forces and focus on taking more of Ukraine's east; and hopefully for the Kremlin, but far less likely, the rest of the Black Sea seaboard.\n\nWhether this can be done in time for the May 9 parade is highly debatable. Ukrainians are still receiving weaponry and morale is high -- although Kyiv controls the information surrounding the war and we do not know the real state of their armed forces. Its greatest challenge (from the east) is yet to come however, and the next few weeks will see intensified fighting as Russia tries to capture more land in Donbas.\n\nThe question remains, however, whether Moscow will seek to continue the offensive beyond its minor territorial gains or choose to \"freeze\" positions on the ground -- dig into Ukrainian territory and sue Ukraine for peace as the war enters a new, more static, phase. Recent attempts to destabilize Moldova through its Russian-controlled breakaway territory Transnistria remind us that Moscow won't give up so easily.\n\nBoth sides are effectively maneuvering for a better position at the negotiating table when that time eventually comes. In military terms, the war might be reaching a stalemate in the coming weeks, where neither side has sufficient force to completely change the tide of war and achieve a decisive victory over the other.\n\nWhat appears to be Putin's strategy in Ukraine?\n\nRussia's tactics may have changed, but its strategy -- that is to say its overall goal -- has not. That goal is to ensure that Ukraine is no longer an independent country able to make its choice to be European and westward-facing.\n\nThe good news is the objective cannot possibly be realized. Ukraine's subjugation -- physically or politically -- is forever beyond Russia's grasp now. Russia has not performed well enough on the battlefield or in the political arena to make it so. The bad news is that Russia does not yet know this and so will continue to send its own men, and far too many Ukrainians as well, to their deaths.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nRussia does at least know that this is not solely a war against Ukraine, but against the rules-based international order, which it has not profited from. Russia has been saying this for over a decade. NATO knows this, too, but refuses to publicly recognize​ this to help prevent it from getting dragged in (discussions with NATO in private are a different matter).\n\nIf sanctions are maintained, Europe can continue to wean itself off Russian energy, and if foreign investors remain deterred, the Kremlin will run out of money later in the year -- this in turn may dictate an eventual change of policy. But not by May 9. None of these changes will be visible by then -- in the \"progress\" of the war or in the eyes of ordinary Russians.\n\nSo May 9 will be a show of strength as it always is.

Western officials believe Putin could formally declare war on Ukraine as soon as May 9, a symbolic day for Russia, paving the way for him to step his campaign.\n\nWhat is May 9?\n\nMay 9, known as \"Victory Day\" inside Russia, commemorates the Soviet Union's role in defeating Nazi Germany in World War II.\n\nVictory Day is marked by a military parade in Moscow, and Russian leaders traditionally stand on the tomb of Vladimir Lenin in Red Square to observe it.\n\n\"May 9 is designed to show off to the home crowd, to intimidate the opposition and to please the dictator of the time,\" said James Nixey, director of the Russia-Eurasia Programme at Chatham House told CNN.\n\nWestern officials have long believed that Putin would leverage the symbolic significance and propaganda value of the day to announce either a military achievement in Ukraine, a major escalation of hostilities -- or both.\n\nThe Russian president has a keen eye for symbolism, having launched the invasion of Ukraine the day after Defender of the Fatherland Day, another crucial military day in Russia.\n\nRussian military vehicles at a parade rehearsal on April 28.\n\nPreparing for mobilization?\n\nPutin has many options on the table, according to Oleg Ignatov, senior analyst for Russia at Crisis Group. \"Declaring war is the toughest scenario,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky -- who has not formally declared war on Russia -- imposed martial law in Ukraine when the Russian invasion began in late February.\n\nAnother option for Putin is to enact Russia's mobilization law, which can be used to start a general or partial military mobilization \"in cases of aggression against the Russian Federation or a direct threat of aggression, the outbreak of armed conflicts directed against the Russian Federation.\"\n\nThat would allow the government not just to assemble troops but also to put the country's economy on a war footing.\n\nRussian servicemen at a parade rehearsal on April 28.\n\nRussian forces have lost at least 15,000 soldiers since the beginning of the war, according to Nixey, and reinforcements will be needed if Moscow is to achieve its goals in Ukraine.\n\nMobilization could mean extending conscription for soldiers currently in the armed forces, calling on reservists or bringing in men of fighting age who have had military training, said Ignatov.\n\nBut it would also represent a big risk for Putin.\n\n\"It would change the whole Kremlin narrative,\" said Ignatov, noting that the move would force Putin to admit that the invasion of Ukraine has not gone to plan. Full-scale mobilization could also damage the struggling Russian economy, he said.\n\nIn addition, it could diminish support for Putin at home, as some Russians support the invasion of Ukraine without wanting to personally go and fight, the analyst said.\n\n\"If they declare full-scale mobilization, some people wouldn't like it,\" said Ignatov.\n\nIt could still be possible for Putin to enact the mobilization law without officially declaring war on Ukraine, he said.\n\nPutin could also impose martial law in Russia, suspending elections and further concentrating power in his hands, Ignatov said.\n\nThis would impose rules such as restrictions on men of fighting age leaving the country, which could also prove unpopular, he added.\n\nOn Wednesday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said there was \"no chance\" Putin would declare war on May 9.\n\nWhat else could happen?\n\nIf Putin doesn't declare war, he may look elsewhere to make a statement to mark Victory Day.\n\nOther options include annexing the breakaway territories of Luhansk and Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, making a major push for Odesa in the south, or declaring full control over the southern port city of Mariupol.\n\nThere are also indications that Russia could be planning to declare and annex a \"people's republic\" in the southeastern city of Kherson.\n\n\"He (Putin) will be able to declare that the Russian army had some victories in Ukraine,\" said Ignatov. \"He can try to use this date to solidify his support.\"\n\nHowever it is hard to predict what Russia and its president will do, the analyst added.\n\n\"All the decisions are made by one man and a couple of his advisers,\" said Ignatov.\n\nYet US State Department spokesman Ned Price said Monday there is \"good reason to believe that the Russians will do everything they can to use\" May 9 for propaganda purposes.\n\n\"We've seen the Russians really double down on their propaganda efforts, probably, almost certainly, as a means to distract from their tactical and strategic failures on the battlefield in Ukraine,\" Price said at a State Department briefing on Monday.", "authors": ["Jack Guy", "Anna Chernova"], "publish_date": "2022/05/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/14/world/gallery/ukraine-russia-crisis/index.html", "title": "Photos: Russia invades Ukraine", "text": "Dominika Zarzycka/NurPhoto/Getty Images Graves of fallen soldiers in Lychakiv Cemetery, Lviv, as Ukrainians celebrate Independence Day, and mark the six month anniversary of the Russian invasion, on August 24.

So that no citizen of Ukraine would have any doubt that I, as president, did not try to stop the war when there was even a small chance,\" Zelensky said.\n\nUkraine has said its air force shot down a cruise missile launched at Kyiv on Sunday from Belarus.

Full stop.\"\n\nKuleba said that, according to Ukrainian intelligence, even people within Putin's inner circle do not agree with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, \"because they understand the detrimental, the damaging, the devastating consequences this conflict will have for Russia itself.\"\n\nFighting in Kharkiv, missiles in Kyiv\n\nEarlier Sunday, residents of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, awoke to find the city still firmly under Ukrainian control, despite two massive explosions some 30 kilometers, or about 18 miles, south of the city lighting up the sky overnight.\n\nAnd fighting broke out on the streets of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, after Russian forces entered the city, Oleh Synehubov, the head of the Kharkiv Regional State Administration, said Sunday. \"Do not leave your shelters!\" he posted on Facebook, warning civilians not to go out on the streets.\n\n\"Intensive exchanges of rocket artillery overnight have been followed by heavy fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces in Kharkiv,\" an assessment by the UK's Ministry of Defence said.\n\nUkrainian forces had managed to deter the Russians from entering the northeastern city -- home to about 1.4 million people -- for the past three days. The city, which sits less than 20 miles south of the Russian border, was approached by Russian forces shortly after the invasion began.\n\nBut despite being far better equipped, Russia has failed to take control of key cities, as ordinary Ukrainians and reservists join efforts to defend their homes and families.\n\nOthers are fleeing the conflict. The United Nations estimates as many as 368,000 Ukrainians are now refugees.\n\nThe UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said late Saturday that the United Nations \"reports at least 240 civilian casualties, including at least 64 people killed\" in the fighting in Ukraine. Damage to civilian infrastructure has deprived hundreds of thousands of people of access to electricity or water, the statement added.\n\nIn a video message Sunday, Zelensky accused Russian troops of targeting civilians, including children, and called for an international investigation into the conflict.\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense has previously said it is targeting only military infrastructure, saying in a statement: \"The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation do not strike cities and towns, they take all measures to save the lives of civilians.\"\n\nBut Zelensky rejected this, saying: \"They lied when they said they would not target civilian population. Since the first hours of the invasion, Russian troops have been hitting civilian infrastructure.\"\n\nUkraine is \"documenting their crimes,\" he said, adding: \"This is terror.\"\n\nRussian offensive failing, Ukrainian PM says\n\nUkrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Saturday that Russia's offensive was failing and it was now deliberately attacking civilian infrastructure, including kindergartens, residential blocks and \"buses with children\" -- actions he labeled as \"war crimes.\"\n\n\"The Russian government doesn't understand they are not fighting only with the government, in fact they are fighting against the entire Ukrainian people,\" he added.\n\nRussian troops are facing a determined and highly-motivated Ukrainian resistance, resulting in significantly slower progress than Kremlin military planners had first anticipated, according to an assessment issued by Britain's Ministry of Defence late Saturday. After encountering strong resistance in Chernihiv, Russian forces were now bypassing the area to prioritize \"the encirclement and isolation of Kyiv,\" another British assessment said Sunday.\n\nRussia is facing unexpected difficulties supplying its forces , and is experiencing heavier losses in personnel, armor and aircraft than expected, two senior United States officials with direct knowledge told CNN.\n\nThe US continues to see Russian forces facing \"stiff resistance\" and their momentum has slowed in the northern part of Ukraine, a senior US defense official told reporters Sunday, citing fuel shortages and logistical issues.\n\nThe official noted that the Russians are having a \"little bit more success\" in the south, and would learn from their logistical issues and find ways to overcome them.\n\nUkrainian Maj. Gen. Borys Kremenetsky told reporters Saturday that Ukraine had captured around 200 Russian soldiers, some of whom were just 19 years old. They were not trained at all and were badly equipped, he said. CNN has not been able to independently verify this.\n\nOn Sunday, Russian authorities acknowledged a number of deaths and injuries in Ukraine for the first time since the beginning of the invasion.\n\n\"Russian servicemen are displaying courage and heroism in fulfilling combat tasks in the special military operation,\" Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said. \"Unfortunately, there have been deaths and injuries among our comrades.\"\n\nWithout providing precise numbers, Konashenkov also noted that the losses suffered by Russian troops were \"considerably lower\" than those by Ukrainian forces.\n\nRussia has yet to establish air supremacy over Ukraine, one US official said, as the Ukrainian Air Force and air defense systems fight for control of the airspace. Without uncontested control of the skies, it becomes more difficult for an army on the move to see and strike targets from the air.\n\nSo far these challenges have prevented the quick overthrow of major Ukrainian cities, including the capital, which US officials were concerned could play out in a matter of days. The city of Kharkiv near Ukraine's border with Russia also has not fallen to invading forces -- despite officials worrying that could happen on the first night of an invasion.\n\nA NATO official agreed that Russian forces were having problems.\n\n\"They lack diesel, they are proceeding way too slow and morale is obviously an issue,\" said the official.\n\nAsked whether Russians are likely to intensify their efforts, the official said they have no choice. \"They are way behind schedule,\" the official said. \"This is getting out of hand for them, every additional day is very painful.\"\n\nBut the Russians on Sunday countered reports of its military stalling, claiming the cities of Kherson and Berdyansk \"were completely blocked\" by Russian forces, and the city of Henichesk and the Chornobayivka airfield near Kherson, also known as Chernobayevka, had both been brought under control.\n\nMaj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, the Russian Ministry of Defense spokesperson, said a Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile regiment surrendered in the Kharkiv region and 471 Ukrainian servicemen were captured.\n\nCNN could not immediately verify those claims.\n\nUkrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov said on Sunday that checkpoints would be set up across the country to detect Russian troops and make their movements more difficult.\n\nAccusations of war crimes\n\nConcerns are now growing that Russia may look to deploy indiscriminate battlefield weaponry in civilian areas in an attempt to decisively crush Ukrainian forces.\n\nA CNN team spotted a Russian thermobaric multiple rockets launcher south of Belgorod, Russia, near the Ukrainian border early Saturday afternoon.\n\nThermobaric weapons have been used in Chechnya, with horrifying consequences, according to Human Rights Watch, and their use has been condemned by number of non-governmental organizations.\n\nThere is no evidence that thermobaric weapons have been used in the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nJUST WATCHED Russia moves in heavy flamethrower weapon Replay More Videos ...

There are currently no Russian troops in the capital, he added. The mayor extended a strict curfew across the city until Monday morning.\n\nAccording to a local hospital, a six-year-old boy died in heavy gunfire in a western district of Kyiv on Saturday evening.\n\nA woman was killed after a nine-story residential building in the eastern city of Kharkiv was hit by \"enemy artillery\" on Saturday night, according to Ukraine's State Emergency Service.\n\nPolish officials said Sunday that 187,000 people had entered Poland from Ukraine since the invasion began on Thursday.\n\nA defiant Ukraine\n\nAs the battle continues, a defiant Zelensky has released a series of videos from the streets of Kyiv urging citizens to defend their country.\n\nOfficials armed reservists with 18,000 guns and ammunition in Kyiv alone, and Ukrainian TV has broadcast instructions for making Molotov cocktails.

This is the beginning of a war against Europe, against European structures, against democracy, against basic human rights, against a global order of law, rules and peaceful coexistence,\" he said.\n\nThe Ukrainian military on Sunday claimed successful attacks by its Turkish-made force of drones against Russian forces. The Armed Forces of Ukraine released footage showing the destruction of armor by a drone and said that it was carried out against a Russian Buk surface-to-air missile system.\n\nValerii Zaluzhnyi, the Armed Forces commander-in-chief, said the drone attack took place near the town of Malyn, about 100 kilometers (or 62 miles) northwest of Kyiv.\n\nThe Ukrainian government began receiving the Bayraktar TB2 drones from Turkey last year.\n\nWestern powers have imposed several rounds of sanctions against Russia since Thursday, with more under consideration.

Announcing his resignation from the BBC on Twitter in November, the veteran presenter wrote that he was “keen to get my own voice back”. Moving to broadcast giant Global, which operates LBC, would allow him to deliver “fast-paced, very regular political journalism… with no filter”.\n\nHe will be joining fellow BBC departee John Humphrys at Global, where the former Today programme presenter now hosts a show on Classic FM. Following Marr’s resignation, Humphrys agreed that remaining impartial at the BBC was “a constraint”. “When I freed myself after 51 years, the limit on what I could say, which is rightly there, lifted,” said Humphry, who quit Radio 4’s Today in 2019.\n\nMarr will also “find the constricting stays of the impartiality girdle considerably loosened in his new role”, predicted Robin Aitken at The Telegraph. “And he will also be able to write opinionated articles for newspapers and magazines, forbidden territory for BBC journalists.”\n\nMarr’s departure is one of the latest moves in “a game of musical chairs among leading presenters and journalists at the BBC, with executives trying to find roles for them”, said The Guardian.\n\nAnother significant change was confirmed today by Laura Kuenssberg, who will step down as political editor in April next year.

He has spent the two decades since at the BBC, working on its regional desk at Westminster and as a political reporter for BBC Radio 5 Live.

A statement on the channel said the group fights for “justice, equality and freedom for everyone”, adding: “Our time is now, protect your children and family.”\n\nBeach boxing session\n\nThe Times reported that Alpha Men Assemble has hosted several meetings in recent weeks for “training and strategy tactics”.

Britney Spears is officially making her musical comeback.\n\nSpears is collaborating with rock icon Elton John on her first single since the pop star's 13-year conservatorship was terminated in November.\n\nThe song is titled \"Hold Me Closer\" according to a news release from Universal Music's Interscope Records. John notably has a song called \"Tiny Dancer,\" which contains the lyric \"hold me closer, tiny dancer.\" It is unclear whether \"Hold Me Closer\" will be a reimagining of the 1972 hit, which has sold 3 million copies in the U.S. to date.\n\nSpears teaming with John will mark the first time the 40-year-old singer has released new music since December 2020, when she collaborated with boy band Backstreet Boys on \"Matches.\" The song also coincided with the release of her 2016 album \"Glory,\" which was reissued in 2020.\n\nHere's everything we know about the new single.\n\nMaking waves:Britney Spears hits back after ex Kevin Federline claims their sons are 'not seeing' her\n\nOn the road:Elton John begins final US dates of farewell tour with set list surprises and singalongs\n\nWhat will 'Hold Me Closer' be released?\n\nThe new collaboration between John and Spears comes out Friday. Official art for the upcoming single was also released a week in advance featuring a young Spears dressed in a ballet outfit next to a black and white photo of a young John sitting at the piano.\n\nOn Instagram, Spears posted additional artwork for the song which features both her and John dressed in baseball uniforms. John was depicted in a black and white photo wearing a Dodgers Jersey and Spears was dressed in a sparkly baseball jersey with \"Elton\" across the chest.\n\nWhat have other celebrities said about 'Hold Me Closer?'\n\nThe new song already has a seal of approval from Spears' gal pal Paris Hilton, who revealed in a recent interview that she’s already heard the song.\n\n\"It’s going to be iconic,\" said Hilton in an interview with RTL Boulevard's Paul Barewijk published Aug. 2. \"I just heard it a couple of days ago in Ibiza and it’s insane.\"\n\nWhen John first posted news of the song, Spears' husband Sam Asghari commented: \"This is #1 already.\"\n\nWho else has Elton John collaborated with recently?\n\nSpears isn’t the only female pop star John has joined forces with lately.\n\nJohn collaborated with British singer Dua Lipa on \"Cold Heart (Pnau remix),\" taken from 2021's \"The Lockdown Sessions,\" which peaked at No. 7 on the Billboard Hot 100. John also linked up with pop juggernaut Lady Gaga on \"Sine From Above,\" which earned the two a top 20 dance hit.\n\n'Have fun and just be':Dua Lipa christens Truly's first hard seltzer taproom, new drinks\n\nJohn hasn't been shy about his love for pop princess Spears.\n\n\"I do like Britney Spears. I think she's cute. I think she's fun,\" said John, according to an excerpt of \"Elton John’s Words in the Wind.\" \"I think she makes great pop records.\"\n\nThe release of \"Hold Me Closer\" follows a whirlwind 2021 for Spears, which saw the end of her 13-year conservatorship in November.

Sharp-eared listeners will also catch nods to John's 1976 smash with Kiki Dee, \"Don't Go Breaking My Heart.\"\n\nHazy synthesizers and Auto-Tune color much of the song with John’s skillful piano most prominent during the coda.\n\nIt’s a little bit pop, a little bit disco and, as Spears’ fans will relish, a lot of her recognizable baby doll voice, seemingly unchanged even at 40.\n\nReview: Elton John begins final U.S. dates of farewell tour with set list surprises and singalongs\n\nThe presence of Spears is, of course, the headline here, as it marks her first new release since her 13-year conservatorship ended last November and she married Sam Asghari in June. Her last album, \"Glory,\" arrived in 2016.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, the pop star posted a video on social media where she spoke in a British accent from her bathtub as she addressed John about the song's quick success. \"I'm about to have the best day ever!\" she chirped.\n\nJohn already saw a resurgence of “Tiny Dancer” in 2000, when the sweet ballad was used in an integral singalong scene in Cameron Crowe’s “Almost Famous.”\n\nThe knighted piano maestro has always maintained an affinity for collaborations, although recently he’s been linked to newer artists, such as Lipa, with whom he scored a top 10 hit – his first since 1998 – with “Cold Heart (Pnau Remix).” Much like “Hold Me Closer,” John’s pairing with Lipa also included the marriage of two of his previous hits, with one from the '70s (“Rocket Man”) and the other from his more contemporary offerings (1989’s “Sacrifice”).\n\nIn 2021, John released “The Lockdown Sessions,” an album of alliances with music stars both current (Lil Nas X, Charlie Puth) and classic (Stevie Nicks, Stevie Wonder).\n\n'You guys saved my life': Britney Spears thanks fans for #FreeBritney\n\nJohn and Spears' relationship extends to 2014, when they met at John's annual AIDS Foundation Academy Awards viewing party. A year later, Spears tweeted about her love of \"Tiny Dancer,\" sparking the idea for a collaboration.\n\nThough their pairing took a while, both artists are giddy about the duet and shared their excitement in a joint release.\n\n\"She is truly an icon, one of the all-time great pop stars,\" John says of Spears, who expressed gratitude to John for \"the opportunity to work with you and your legendary mind.\"\n\nSpears’ elation about working with John is a contrast to her recent expressions of discontent with the music industry that pushed her to superstardom in the late-'90s and early '00s behind top 40 standards “…Baby One More Time,” “Oops! … I Did it Again,” “Toxic” and “Stronger.”\n\nIn December, Spears posted several lengthy, since-deleted messages on her Instagram page in which she said she was “scared” of the music business and “what they did to my heart was unforgivable.”\n\nJohn recently kicked off the last U.S. leg of his lengthy Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour, hitting stadiums around the country through the end of the year.\n\nBritney Spears' nude Instagrams are sparking concern:But they may be a form of empowerment", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/26"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/957760/quiz-of-the-week-20-26-august", "title": "Quiz of the week: 20 – 26 August | The Week UK", "text": "We will use the details you have shared to manage your registration.

The idiosyncratic singer/songwriter/producer also enlists Solange on Electric Lady, Esperanza Spalding on Dorothy Dandridge Eyes and kindred spirit Prince on Givin' Em What They Love.

That means working with producers Butch Walker, Nathan Chapman, Jay Joyce and Stargate, among others. Single Little Bit of Everything already has topped the country chart; you can bet Raise 'Em Up, a duet with Eric Church, eventually will, too.

Broadening his scope, the DJ, mixer and producer pumps emotion into dance-floor thumpers with guests from bluegrass queen Alison Krauss and rock band Blondfire to Swedish pop star Linnea Henriksson and indie folk-rocker Audra Mae. Also on board are Nile Rodgers, who produced Daft Punk's smash Get Lucky, and country's Mac Davis, writer of the Elvis Presley hit A Little Less Conversation. — Gundersen\n\nElvis Costello & The Roots\n\nWise Up Ghost\n\nIn his quest to keep pushing himself in new directions, Costello is teaming with The Roots' Ahmir \"?uestlove\" Thompson and Roots associate Steve Mandel to produce an album he describes in a release as \"the shortest distance between here and there\" and containing \"both rhythm and what is read.\" ?uestlove says his hip-hop group's 14-track collaboration \"is a moody, brooding affai,'' with \"cathartic rhythms and dissonant lullabies.''

A video for first single Walk Us Uptown was released in July. — Shriver\n\nJack Johnson\n\nFrom Here to Now to You\n\nHawaii's surf-rocker returns to the folk-pop sound that made him a star on his sixth studio album. For these 12 songs, he reunites not only with producer Mario Caldato Jr., who helmed 2005's In Between Dreams, but slide guitarist Ben Harper as well. Johnson wrote the album entirely on acoustic guitar, but the arrangements get fleshed out with Harper's Weissenborn guitar, ukulele, glockenspiel, melodica and the like. — Mansfield\n\nMGMT\n\nMGMT\n\nFor the electro-pop duo's third album, Andrew VanWyngarden and Ben Goldwasser retreated to a bare-bones studio in a secluded area of western New York and just let the creativity flow in jam sessions that went on for hours. The result: 10 tracks to keep their seasoned fans satisfied and recruit new ones. Out now is single Alien Days, a dreamy synth-pop ballad. — Lopez\n\nChris Young\n\nA.M.\n\nYoung came closer than he'd probably care to admit to having a posthumous release after being hospitalized for a bacterial infection in his left leg last month. That would have been a real shame, because he has become one of country's most reliable hitmakers below the superstar level. A.M., produced by James Stroud, takes a slightly more aggressive approach than past albums, as evidenced by single Aw Naw. Young co-wrote six of the album's 11 tracks — Mansfield\n\nSEPT. 24\n\nCher\n\nCloser to the Truth\n\nThe indestructible, indefatigable diva has been churning out hits since 1965, and she's not finished. Her first studio album since 2001's Living Proof boasts Pink-penned ballad Lie to Me, disco burner Take It Like a Man (a duet with Jake Shears of Scissor Sisters) and a heartfelt 9/11 anthem, Sirens. Timbaland produced I Don't Have to Sleep to Dream, written by Bonnie McKee, and Paul Oakenfold had a hand in writing No. 1 dance hit Woman's World, which Cher performed on the season finale of The Voice. Cher, 67, also dishes up a tune called Dressed to Kill. Watch out, pop amateurs. — Gundersen\n\nDrake\n\nNothing Was the Same\n\n\"This album is all about growth,\" Drake told Rolling Stone of his follow-up to 2011's Grammy Award-winner Take Care. Same's first single, the sweetly sexy Hold On We're Going Home, was co-produced by the Toronto-bred hip-hop star's longtime cohort Noah \"40\" Shebib and features Majid Jordan. Other guests include Jay Z and Lil Wayne, and among the song titles are Tuscan Leather (the intro track) and Connect. — Gardner\n\nIcona Pop\n\nThis Is ... Icona Pop\n\nSince single I Love It was featured on HBO's Girls, Swedish BFFs Aino Jawo and Caroline Hjelt have become the new faces of rave. With the recent release of second single All Night, the EDM duo hope to keep the party going. — Lopez\n\nElton John\n\nThe Diving Board\n\nWritten in five days and recorded in another five, The Diving Board returns to the simpler recording process of John's early career. On his first solo album in seven years, the focus is on his voice and piano, the core of John's finest work since his magical run of shows at L.A.'s storied Troubadour club. Longtime collaborator Bernie Taupin provides lyrics, and T Bone Burnett, who worked with John and Leon Russell on 2010's The Union, produces the set of 12 new songs and three piano interludes. — Gundersen\n\nJason Derulo\n\nTattoos\n\nSince Derulo suffered a severe neck injury in January 2012, the R&B singer has been busy getting his health back on track and crafting his third album. Lead single The Other Side peaked at No. 7 on USA TODAY's top 40 airplay chart. \"I wanted to make a record that I wanted to listen to all the time,\" he says. \"Not just this year, not just next year, but for a long time.\" — Lopez\n\nAlan Jackson\n\nThe Bluegrass Album\n\nIt took only about 15 years, but Jackson finally got around to making the bluegrass record he's always wanted to make. He got a top-flight band to help him cut it, too: Rob Ickes on Dobro, Sammy Shelor on banjo, Adam Steffey on mandolin, Tim Crouch on fiddle, Tim Dishman on bass, Scott Coney on guitar and Ronnie Bowman and Don Rigsby singing harmony. The album includes remakes of John Anderson's Wild and Blue and Jackson's own Let's Get Back to Me and You, but it's the originals that make the set, especially Blacktop, Jackson's answer to the current crop of \"dirt road\" country records. — Mansfield\n\nKings of Leon\n\nMechanical Bull\n\nSince the Followills released their last album, Come Around Sundown, in 2010, the guys got married, and Nathan, Caleb and Matthew became dads. On their new album, they take a lighter approach, stepping away from the solemn, yearning rock of earlier records. First singles Supersoaker and Wait for Me are evidence. — Lopez\n\nSting\n\nThe Last Ship\n\nSting's first album of new material in a decade is also a prelude to his first musical, which bears the same title and is expected on Broadway next year. Inspired by his youth in a Northern England shipbuilding community (which also informed his 1991 album, The Soul Cages), Last Ship features reflective, folk-based tunes delivered by the working-class-lad-turned-rock-star with other musicians from Britain's North East. — Gardner\n\nSEPT. 30\n\nLorde\n\nPure Heroine\n\nLorde (Ella Yelich-O'Connor) is the year's pop comet, propelled largely by the viral Royals, a Spotify record-breaker and global hit that sent the singer to No. 1 on Billboard's alternative radio chart — it's the first time a female artist has topped it in 17 years. Royals and Tennis Court have built excitement for her debut, and critics raved when Lorde, 16, recently performed new tracks White Teeth Teens, 400 Lux, A World Alone, Buzzcut Season and Ribs in her native New Zealand. — Gundersen\n\nJustin Timberlake\n\nThe 20/20 Experience — 2 of 2\n\nBecause no one can get enough of him, the legend of summer returns this fall with the second half of this year's best-selling album. Part 2 will feature 11 new tunes — including the already unveiled Take Back the Night, co-produced by Timberlake, Timbaland and Jerome \"J-Roc\" Harmon — plus a \"special surprise,\" according to a release. Tracks are set to include Murder, which may reunite him with fellow legend Jay Z, and Cabaret, featuring Drake. — Gardner\n\nOCT. 8\n\nMiley Cyrus\n\nBangerz\n\nThe artist formerly known as Hannah Montana embraces her raunchy, edgy image, which she described to MTV as \"white trash and Chanel.\" For Bangerz, she recruited the talents of producers and songwriters such as Pharrell Williams and will.i.am. While her summer anthem We Can't Stop boasts about her party stamina, her second single, love ballad Wrecking Ball, shows her softer side, despite the title. — Lopez\n\nOCT. 15\n\nThe Avett Brothers\n\nMagpie and the Dandelion\n\nThe North Carolina-based folk-rockers will roll out their eighth studio album, the follow-up to last year's The Carpenter, which was produced by Rick Rubin and earned them their first Grammy nomination (for best Americana album). Magpie contains more songs from those Rubin-led Carpenter sessions and is expected to explore themes of youthful wonder (hence the title) and societal woes. First single Another Is Waiting was released in August. — Shriver\n\nWillie Nelson\n\nTo All the Girls …\n\nWhen you're hot, you're hot — and it doesn't matter if you're 80. To further celebrate his significant birthday year, Nelson will release his third album in 16 months, this one containing 18 newly recorded duets with the crème de la femme of country music. Most of the country/gospel/pop titles are lesser-known, but his partners are anything but: Dolly Parton, Mavis Staples, Sheryl Crow, Loretta Lynn, Wynonna Judd, Rosanne Cash, Alison Krauss, Miranda Lambert, Tina Rose, Carrie Underwood, Emmylou Harris, Norah Jones, Secret Sisters, Brandi Carlile, Lily Meola, Shelby Lynne, Melonie Cannon and Paula Nelson. Potential collectors, take note: Willie now has more than 200 albums to his name. — Shriver\n\nPaul McCartney\n\nNew\n\n\"We can do what we want, we can live as we choose,\" McCartney sings on the title track of his 16th studio album. The tune, produced by Mark Ronson, is typical McCartney: melodic, bouncy, sunny. The 12-track New is his first set of fresh solo material since 2007's Memory Almost Full. In the interim, he released a live album, a ballet score, 2008's Electric Arguments as The Fireman and 2012's standards collection Kisses on the Bottom. And he's been on the road for the past year on his Out There! tour. For the 71-year-old former Beatle, living as he chooses does not include retirement. — Gundersen\n\nPearl Jam\n\nLightning Bolt\n\nMore than 22 years ago, Pearl Jam exploded with the definitive alt-rock thunderbolt, Ten. The durable Seattle band is set to celebrate that number again. Lightning Bolt, the group's 10th studio album, was produced by Brendan O'Brien, whose affiliation with Pearl Jam began as the producer and mixer for 1993's Vs. The July release of track Mind Your Manners, a tough, guitar-fueled blast of punk, set the stage for Bolt, the follow-up to 2009's Backspacer. The band also whet appetites with live performances of the title track and Future Days. — Gundersen\n\nOCT. 22\n\nKaty Perry\n\nPrism\n\nThe pop superstar's fourth studio album, the follow-up to 2010 hit machine Teenage Dream, got off to a roaring start with Roar, an irresistible pop anthem that racked up the year's tallest digital song sales week after selling 557,000 copies. Next up is Dark Horse, a single chosen by a fan vote for release Sept. 17. Produced by Dr. Luke and Circut and featuring Juicy J, the song was written by Perry and friend Sarah Hudson. Perry also wrote the high-energy Walking on Air, inspired by '90s deep house music. Early snippets hint at a shift from candied pop toward a wider stylistic menu. — Gundersen\n\nOCT. 29\n\nArcade Fire\n\nAs yet untitled\n\nSomebody light a match under these guys. The Canadian indie-rock group is playing extremely coy with releasing details about its fourth studio album, confirming only the release date and the fact that the members have been in the studio with producer James Murphy, the former frontman for LCD Soundsystem. Fans speculate that the new work — the band's first since 2010's The Suburbs (Grammy's album of the year) — could be called Reflektor after the group confirmed recently that it was behind a graffiti art campaign that incorporated that word. Can you say Arcade games? — Shriver\n\nToby Keith\n\nDrinks After Work\n\nKeith, one of country's most consistent acts, marks 20 years in the business with his latest album, which he produced himself. He had a hand in writing nine of the 10 tracks, working with longtime songwriting collaborators Scotty Emerick, Bobby Pinson and Rivers Rutherford. The deluxe edition has three additional cuts, including a remake of Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville with Sammy Hagar and a tribute to bandleader Chuck Goff, who died in a car wreck in February. — Mansfield\n\nLATE 2013\n\nAnother wave of big albums hits later this fall, kicking off with Eminem's eagerly awaited The Marshall Mathers LP 2 on Nov. 5, followed by Lady Gaga's Artpop on Nov. 11. Also on the way are Chris Brown's X, Rick Ross' Mastermind, R. Kelly's Black Panties and M.I.A.'s Matangi, plus albums by Britney Spears, One Direction, Jennifer Lopez, Wu-Tang Clan and T-Pain. In the possibility column: Beyoncé, Mariah Carey, Shakira, the Jonas Brothers and the Black Keys.

But it’s hard to say if she’s simply dispensing an assortment of YOLO anthems or issuing a cry for help, and the answer to that won’t come until later.\n\n“She Is Coming” is the first of three EPs from Cyrus, and the trilogy will ultimately combine to form the collection “She Is: Miley Cyrus.” So the new release could be the premise of a three-part story that might also include a second act (conflict?) and a finale (resolution?).\n\nBut however it all shakes out, “She Is Coming” is a trip-hop-pop-dance hallucination, laced with expletives, festive themes and an air that is both liberating and uneasy.\n\nCyrus teams up with RuPaul for the raunchy, campy “Cattitude” propelled by a reverberating beat. propelling her as she boasts, “Since I was 3, I’ve been banging the drum.” She also declares herself “a little bit unholy” on “Unholy” and calls herself nasty, a freak and a witch on the trippy “Mother’s Daughter.” shrugging it off with, “Must be something in the water or that I’m my mother’s daughter.”\n\nOn “D.R.E.A.M.” – which stands for “drugs rule everything around me” – Cyrus seems indifferent or giddy about waking up with strangers and finding new tattoos on her body, and she loses herself in an ethereal sea of echoing voices and innuendo on “Party Up the Street” featuring Swae Lee.\n\nThe EP’s droll excess finally comes to a focus with the affecting ballad/closer “The Most” as the 26-year-old, emoting with the world weariness of someone twice her age, humbly conveys that she’s undeserving of love.\n\nIs that a personal epiphany or a plea for intervention? We’ll find out later …\n\nMiley Cyrus\n\n\"She Is Coming\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nEgerton nails Elton on 'Rocketman'\n\nThere’s every reason to believe the new Elton John biopic “Rocketman” will extend Hollywood’s music-drama blockbuster streak fueled by last fall’s “Bohemian Rhapsody” and “A Star Is Born.”\n\nPlus this one is happier than the others: Elton John is still living among us, and he even performs a new song on the soundtrack, “(I’m Gonna) Love Me Again,” with Taron Egerton, who plays him in the film.For his part, Egerton holds his own with John on the duet and shines on the rest of the soundtrack as a believable alternative version of John rather than a pale imitation.\n\n“Rocketman (Music From the Motion Picture)” is a 22-track musical celebration of John featuring reimagined versions of most of his iconic songs as well as some of his less memorable ones.\n\nAnd fortunately, there’s no “Island Girl” to be found.\n\nThe soundtrack is campy (how could it not be?) and “Grease”-level cheesy at times, like with the wince-inducing renditions of “Saturday Night’s Alright (For Fighting)” and “Rock and Roll Madonna.” It also parallels “Mamma Mia!” in that some anticipated songs are prematurely truncated, including “Crocodile Rock,” “Pinball Wizard” and “Bennie and the Jets.”\n\nBut the frustrations and ho-hum moments seem inconsequential when Egerton and company elevate their game for spectacular (and sometimes entirely reinvented) versions of Elton John’s premium material.\n\nEgerton is impressive in the complicated structure of “Your Song” and commanding as “Rocket Man” escalates from a spacey sprawl into a boisterous sing-along. Meanwhile, the orchestrated “Tiny Dancer” and string-based “Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word” are emotionally on point. And just when the soundtrack verges on getting too dark with the histrionic “Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,” up pops Egerton with a playful “I’m Still Standing.”\n\nIt’ll leave you feeling like a little kid.\n\nvarious acts\n\n'Rocketman' soundtrack\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nRammstein hammers home theatrics\n\nIt might be an unexpected reaction to a Rammstein album, but the German band’s new self-titled release is oddly comforting.\n\nIrrespective of all the electric fury, disturbing themes and pervasive menace, “Rammstein” is sneakily melodic, the hooks and riffs are inescapably infectious, and the theatrics are rarely more threatening than that of a Disney villain.\n\nThese guys have been hanging together with the same lineup for a quarter of a century, and despite the decade-long gap since the last release, “Rammstein” is a seamless addition to the act’s discography – confident, otherworldly and distinct.\n\nIt’s also a good chance to practice your high-school German.\n\nOpening track/bombastic beauty “Deutschland,” where vocalist Till Lindemann wearily growls his ambivalent feelings for his homeland, re-introduces us to the gang and their trademark histrionics, blending metal and electronica to give a sidelong-glancing, dim view of humanity.\n\nThe Berlin-based band subsequently chugs through the mainstreamish “Radio,” propels across the operatic spectacle of “Zeig Dich” and rises from the sleazy miasma of “Auslander” for Lindemann’s spoken-theater wink at sleazy come-ons.\n\nLindemann serves more lessons from his pulpit, dovetailing into the dirty rock tease of “Sex” for a lewd proposal, and going even darker in the sister-as-sex-worker theme buried in suppressed whispers of “Puppe” and gliding along the horror-film score and child-abductor premise of closing cut “Hallomann.”\n\nYet even when he’s trying to lure someone into his car, presumably with the worst intentions, there’s something perversely inviting about it all.\n\nRammstein\n\n\"Rammstein\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nTodrick Hall ushers in Pride season\n\nTodrick Hall dropped his new “Haus Party, Pt. 1” just in time for Pride season across America, and he overflows with fitting confidence on the 7-track release.\n\nHall, who has become a music, Broadway, YouTube and “RuPaul’s Drag Race” star since competing on “American Idol” a decade ago, is entrenched in LGBTQ tropes on the playful “Haus Party, Pt. 1” – drag culture, nightclub life and sex-charged innuendo.\n\nIt’s celebratory and fun, even if most of these tracks are disposable novelty songs.\n\nHall commands focus immediately with “Attention,” a frenetic pep rally of a dance track that turns both salty and suggestive, as when he calls out, “Tell your new boyfriend to stay out of my DM.”\n\nThe subsequent snaky “I Like Boys” is a self-assured coming out proclamation – complete with lines like, “Tell them girls, ‘thank you, next’.” And drag is celebrated on the strutting showoff song “Nails, Hair, Hips, Heels” and more effectively on “Chapstick,” featuring “RPDR” all-star Trixie Mattel and a winking assertion that the full-blown drag look is “just a little Chapstick.”\n\nHall isn’t merely playing for laughs on “Haus Party,” either. He shows a sweeter, romantic side (well, with obvious sexual overtones) on “Glitter,” employing a fine R&B vocal for lines like, “I wanna dance with you for life.”\n\nAnd in a late pivot, he offers the nightclub-as-church themed “Amen” and the sweeping EDM of closer “Relove,” the latter of which would suit mainstream radio, down to his modulated vocals.\n\nYet a problem with “Amen” and “Relove” is that they’re too conventional, forgettable background music that feels lackluster compared to the first part of “Haus Party, Pt. 1.”\n\nMaybe Hall will rediscover his momentum for “Pt. 2.”\n\nTodrick Hall\n\n\"Haus Party, Pt. 1\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nJepsen soft sells 'Dedicated'\n\nCarly Rae Jepsen’s new “Dedicated” is like an asteroid sailing in and out of other pop-star orbits.\n\nThe track “Now That I Found You” sounds like an electro-dance song from Robyn; the jumbly party cut “Want You In My Room” could come from Taylor Swift’s playbook; and the quirky robo-love ballad “Everything He Needs” is ersatz Kylie Minogue. Jepsen even time-travels to a Prince-inspired Sheena Easton bygone era with the crunchy-flutter tease of “No Drug Like Me.”\n\nThe Canadian singer’s audience will surely hear other artists echoing throughout “Dedicated,” which is both a testament to her adaptability and an indication that her persona is not distinct. Her voice is serviceable, if anonymous, her focus is relentlessly on infatuations (which is exhausting for a 15-track album built on several sluggishly paced cuts), and her writing structure is shamelessly formulaic.\n\nAt the same time, her lyrical idiosyncrasies and offbeat twists in the arrangements deliver redeeming charm to “Dedicated,” be it in the Theremin-ly effects of the winking “Everything He Needs” or the cathartic build of “Too Much.” Also, her exasperations are relatable – “I don’t have the energy to risk a broken heart,” she sings on “Happy Not Knowing,” and ambivalence comes to a head on “Right Words Wrong Time” as she cautions, “Don’t you tell me now that you’re ready for me.”\n\nShe also compensates for several uneventful and/or shallow tracks with a disarmingly sincere “Real Love,” her voice betraying genuine wariness and vulnerability as she sings, “I just don’t know who to trust sometimes.”\n\nUltimately, the release is modestly alluring enough to have you rooting for Jepsen, even if you aren’t dedicated to “Dedicated.” And if you aren’t, she has a message on album-closer “Party for One”: “If you don’t care about me, I’ll just dance with myself.”\n\nCarly Rae Jepsen\n\n\"Dedicated\"\n\nRating: 3 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nLucette, Sturgill Simpson intoxicate\n\nWhen Canadian singer-songwriter Lauren Gillis, aka Lucette, launched her debut “Black Is the Color” five years ago, her career path looked clear. The release was produced by Dave Cobb, who produced country-music breakouts Sturgill Simpson and Jason Isbell, and featured folk noir songs. Simpson even played the title character in the video for the single “Bobby Reid.”\n\nBut the Edmonton singer’s sophomore release, produced by Simpson, is a pivot for both of them.\n\n“Deluxe Hotel Room” is a piano-and-electronica-steeped collection of quietly opulent, moody songs that sound like a cross-pollination of Lana Del Rey, Cowboy Junkies and Mazzy Star.\n\nIt’s both intoxicating and bare, and maybe not something you’d expect from neo-outlaw-country star Simpson. But consider: His singing persona and Lucette’s persona could be the quintessential star-crossed lovers, their lives intertwining in opposites-attract passion until the infatuation fades and the inevitable doom sets in.\n\n“Deluxe Hotel Room” could chronicle such a relationship, Lucette flush with irrational love (a la classic girl-group delusion) in the exuberant swells of “Angel.” Before then, she pines about being a kept woman on the title track, dreams of companionship in the sax-spiked brooding waltz “Out of the Rain” and teases at the dangerous excitement that can be found in unexpected places on the synth-soaked “Full Moon Town.”\n\nPost-“Angel,” the throaty Lucette sees the inevitable cracks in her soul, meditating on escape in the gospel-flavored “Fly to Heaven,” hinting at running away in the stark, vocal-centric “California” and reaching an epiphany with “Crazy Bird”: “You’re in the sky, I’m on the ground.”\n\nThere are sobering traces of mental instability on the reverberating “Talk to Myself” before the release concludes with the desperate plea “Lover Don’t Give Up on Me,” where she sings, “When it’s gone, there’s nothing left but searching for the light.”\n\n“Deluxe Hotel Room” rates an extended stay.\n\nLucette\n\n\"Deluxe Hotel Room\"\n\nRating: 4-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nBudokan Boys play with 'Dad'\n\nMusic has long been used for eccentric purposes, and electronica has been a particularly fertile ground for whimsical musicians, from Kraftwerk and Yello to Daft Punk and Kanye West.\n\nThe Budokan Boys – instrumentalist/programmer Jeff T. Byrd and vocalist/lyricist Michael Jeffrey Lee – further establish themselves as part of this would-be sub-genre of electro-performance-artists with “Dad Is Bad,” a follow-up to the duo’s “That’s How You Become a Clown.”\n\n“Dad Is Bad’s” eight tracks are mostly stories with bizarre twists and unhappy endings for some of its characters, skittering across an onslaught of playful technology and presented by Lee in a variety of modulated vocals.\n\nListeners will feel mixed emotions when Lee’s cartoonish voice somersaults over the off-kilter beat and menacing drone of “Sick Pick” to reach the sobering conclusion, “Always post a picture so you don’t die alone/You don’t want to die alone.” Later, Lee lets his Southern accent fly on “My Old Friend,” which sounds like a lighthearted exploration of sexual identity until his “old friend” ends up dead by suicide.: “I thought maybe he was gay, maybe he wasn’t, but now he’s dead, end of discussion.”\n\nThe Budokan Boys also kick up a whirlwind of wobbly percussion to talk about random God sightings on “God Today,” stretch out a taut style of stripped-down exotica for “The Hermit” and unfurl the weirdly wry tale of a model prisoner who gave up his life “to save the warden’s son” on “The Prisoner.”\n\nThe songs of “Dad Is Bad,” which are all distinct from each other, don’t lend themselves to singing along and, while stirring, they don’t lend themselves to dancing along, either. Yet their unique charm will encourage repeated listens.\n\nSo when Lee employs a hybrid human/robot voice on the churning “Rent Me” to offer his wide-ranging services – “You should rent me, I’m cheap!” – you’ll already know you want to keep him around.\n\nBudokan Boys\n\n\"Dad Is Bad\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nWords sometimes fail Antony Carle\n\nThe artistry behind Antony Carle’s new “The Moment” is fascinating: His elegantly ethereal voice weaves through a blend of classic chamber and pop music as well as thoroughly modern electronic soundscapes, the combination of which creates a mystical realm.\n\nHowever, the illusion is shaded by his slurry enunciation as he self-indulgently drops words into an aural blur – though to be fair, the lyrics that are clear are sometimes mundane, so perhaps he’s shielding his lines with deliberate obfuscation.\n\nRegardless, Carle’s moany/breathless delivery on “But You, Everybody Is” glides passionately above the soulful/New Age bliss, and the arrangement of “Icon” is as delicate and precise as a music box as Carle sings, “I got you on my mind – always … Big dreams on my mind – always.” Meanwhile, in the sophisticated EDM of “Save Face” he frets, “What will we do for money when it’s all gone?” and eventually hangs up in frantic repetitions of “When it’s all gone?!? When it’s all gone?!?”\n\nOne of the beauties of “The Moment” is that Carle takes risks, even if they don’t always pay off. For example, “Commitment” is a complicated cut anchored to an irregular beat as the singer rushes through lines with a talk/sing/rap flurry – “What is it going to take for you to grow up? … What do you take me for, do I look dumb to you?” – and the song becomes mired in nervous energy. Carle also takes the elevator up to the pulsing “Top Floor” and ultimately gets lost in an inconclusive end.\n\nYet even if Carle strays, his distinguishing characteristics consistently surface with compelling impact, such as when he contemplates transformation in the throbbing “Manifesto”: “For it to happen, I have to forget what I know.”\n\nAnd with only a slight mutation, his next release could be even more memorable than this.\n\nAntony Carle\n\n\"The Moment\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nMehldau takes improbable path\n\nJazz pianist Brad Mehldau goes on a wild bender with his new “Finding Gabriel,” an unexpected mix of quaint synthesizers, classical music, New Age, performance art and Muzak.\n\nThose individual components of sound may seem entirely incompatible with each other, but the familiar pieces merge together into something improbably transformative.\n\nIn addition to working with his more traditional keyboards, Mehldau uses an analog synthesizer to create riffs and passages worthy of a 1970s B movie. To that he adds strings and horns suitable for an elegant wedding and wordless, angelic vocals that could work for a stately funeral or perhaps an elevator ride. And songs drift through passages that could serve as background for meditation one minute and a sophisticated party the next.\n\nMehldau also adds biblical-inspired themes, because why not?\n\nBreakbeat, drones, trumpet and layered vocals kick off “Finding Gabriel” with the protracted opening track, “The Garden,” before the release moves on to the oddly crunchy interlude “Born to Trouble,” the gurgling buzz of the cinematic “Striving After Wind” and the thickened brew of “O Ephraim” (which sounds like the descendant of an Ennio Morricone composition).\n\n“Finding Gabriel” also makes a strong finish with the liquid electronica of “Make It All Go Away,” the lush strings and irregular beat of “Deep Water” and the comparatively bustling chaos of “Proverb of Ashes.”\n\nSometimes Mehldau’s more theatrical turns on “Finding Gabriel” are both challenging and rewarding: “St Mark Is Howling in the City of Night” and the title track could be performance art for a cocktail lounge, for instance. But when Mehldau throws all subtleties out the window on the Trump-bashing “The Prophet Is a Fool,” he gets heavy-handed and cheesy to the point the album’s mystique is diluted.\n\nFortunately, he moves on and restores the illusion.\n\nBrad Mehldau\n\n\"Finding Gabriel\"\n\nRating: 4 (out 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nCiara embraces 'Beauty Marks'\n\nCiara is a woman who got it together singing about getting it together on her new “Beauty Marks.”\n\nThe 33-year-old vocalist/model had a murky path to this clear-headed release. The Atlanta-based singer was still a teen in the mid-2000s when she rocketed to the front of the crunk/R&B movement with a quick string of hits such as “Goodies” and “1, 2 Step.” Then the hits faded, the sales slacked, and Ciara’s career took a backseat to her personal life – a public romance and breakup with Future followed by a public romance and marriage to Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson. And she had two children along the way.\n\n\"Beauty Marks,” her first release since 2015’s “Jackie,” finds Ciara comfortable in her skin, a middle-of-the-road performer who doesn’t stand out beyond her distinctly Janet-Jackson-like voice. The arrangements are modern but not pioneering, and fitfully clunky (“Set,” “Greatest Love”). Her lyrics are true yet familiar.\n\nCiara taps into the wobbly electronic throb of opener “I Love Myself,” singing “I’ve been to the bottom and I’ve seen the end” and expressing the epiphany that led to self-care (“I found the problem, and it starts with me”). Later, Kelly Rowland swings by for the playfully sleek woman-power anthem “Girl Gang,” and Ciara flexes her might in the brassy reverberations of the rewarding “Dose.”\n\nSexy songs balance the self-help mojo of “Beauty Marks” – Ciara battling urges in the catchy percolation of “Trust Myself,” flirting with Tekno in the playful throwaway “Freak Me” and embodying a 1980s-era Prince ingenue in the retro-fresh cool of “Thinkin Bout You,” where she tries to balance infatuation with caution.\n\nAnd naturally the release ends with the inevitable piano-and-strings title-track ballad, formulaic but well-executed. as she sighs, “Oh what a feeling to wake up every day, knowing I am loved by you.”\n\nPredictable, maybe, but it’s also reassuring.\n\nCiara\n\n\"Beauty Marks\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nA.A. Bondy's captivates with obscurity\n\nA.A. Bondy’s new “Enderness” is a subtly spellbinding listen that might catch listeners unawares.\n\nThe Alabama-native former alt-rocker (with the band Verbena) returns with his first solo singer-songwriter album in 8 years, switching from an acoustic-oriented foundation to an electronic-based sound that is vaguely indistinct and beautifully grim.\n\nWaves of ambient New Age drones and near-drones wash over the skeleton of a blues framework, creating a net result that conveys sad calmness. And Bondy’s dim view of the world, delivered in bleak and often spaced out vocals, is the finishing touch for an opioid-addled America. … There’s even a stark song about drug addiction, “Fentanyl Freddy.”\n\nYet though “Enderness” feels like that uncomfortable experience of being trapped in a drowsy limbo, unable to fall asleep or fully wake up, the trippy tone ultimately beguiles, beckoning the listener to surrender.\n\nBondy sings in social-media acronyms and broken thoughts in the meditative sprawl of opener “Diamond Skull,” hypnotizes with the ominous refrain of “I’ll never know every shape you can take” on “I’ll Never Know,” disappears in the soothing strains and scorched imagery of “#Lost Hills” and whispers in the muted, heartbeat pulses of “The Tree With the Lights.”\n\nElsewhere, instrumental tracks underscore the aura, from the brightening shimmer of “Pan Tran” to the lulling title-track closer, where the ebb and flow of long synthetic notes is nuanced by effects that facsimilate rolling waves … or distant thunder … or a far away, disintegrating glacier.\n\n“Enderless” is compellingly ambiguous, a new style of shoegaze music where what you see is too blurry to recognize.\n\nA.A. Bondy\n\n\"Enderness\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nMemphis band never gives up\n\nSouthern Avenue further establishes its foothold as a roots-music band of the future with “Keep On,” the Memphis band’s follow-up to its 2017 self-titled debut.\n\nThe group breathes new life into a venerable, thoroughly American, blend of blues, R&B and gospel with two distinctive signatures – the rock finesse of Israeli guitarist Ori Naftaly and the passionate delivery of American soul singer Tierinni Jackson.\n\nSouthern Avenue is full speed ahead from the start of “Keep On,” dispensing the title track with a jazzy brew of horns and stomping beat and Tierinni Jackson’s belted earworm refrain: “You get what you put out.” From there the band continues to emanate an infectious glow, from Naftaly’s teasing guitar that supplies tension for “Whiskey Love” to the singer’s beckoning offer on the smoky “Savior” to “put it all in my hands, oh baby let me save ya” to the funk-anchored groove of “Switchup.”\n\nSouthern Avenue ultimately hits a few potholes as the journey wears on, with Tierinii Jackson forced to sell the indistinct arrangement of “The Tea I Sip,” for example, and with a filler atmosphere taking over other tracks such as the directionless “Too Good for You” and the low-energy “We’ve Got the Music.”\n\nYet “Keep On” keeps on coming back, with the sweet romance of “Lucky,” the fired-up tempo of “Jive” and the rock-opera-esque climax of “She Gets Me High.”\n\nNo lull ever creates a protracted drag on “Keep On,” and the band’s effervescent spirit is a constant – all the way to the simmering optimism of the feelgood finale, “We’re Gonna Make It.”\n\nIndeed, it does seem like they’re going to make it.\n\nSouthern Avenue\n\n\"Keep On\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\n'Liberal rednecks' still stoke the fire\n\nThree years ago, Trae Crowder, Drew Morgan and Corey Ryan Forrester were knocking around Knoxville’s amateur comedy scene when an expletive-laden comic video rant by Crowder went viral on Facebook and beyond. Calling himself a liberal redneck, Crowder employed his authentic rural Tennessee accent to emphatically advocate for LGBTQ rights.\n\nThis was during the 2016 election campaign, and Crowder’s voice – which sounds like every stereotype of a close-minded bigot, though his perspective is on the opposite end of the ideological spectrum – caught fire as more viral videos followed. Crowder and his like-minded, similarly-accented comedy pals Morgan and Forrester have been on tour crisscrossing America together ever since, stoking their elevated visibility with national TV appearances, a collaborative book, a heightened social media presence and more.\n\nThe new audio release, “wellRED Live From Lexington,” finds the trio more frustrated than ever after two years of the Trump presidency and doubling down on their push for social equality while also poking fun at their own “good ol’ boy” upbringings and the internal conflicts they’ve had reconciling their affection for the South and their hate of bigotry.\n\nThe 90-plus minute “Live From Lexington” is broken into thirds, plus a short epilogue where the three jointly talked about a couple of hilarious shared experiences. The force-of-nature Forrester kicks off “Live” with an electric set, pitting his love for Chick-fil-A food against his disdain for the company’s support of anti-LGBTQ policy and then brushing on everything from pudding cups and Ramen noodles to North Georgia culture and illogical redneck arguments against gays in the military. Morgan follows with a gentler start, building a set about his church-based upbringing, sports and county fairs into an explosive bit about being high at a church Nativity ceremony.\n\nCrowder, who now lives in California, starts with a nod to Knoxville, saying he was unfazed to learn that in today’s political climate that WWE wrestler Kane was elected mayor of Knox County. He also takes down the arrogance and naivete of would-be enlightened Californians before he settles into brilliant tales about his poor upbringing and his gutsy-but-flawed “pillbilly” mother, stories even conservative rednecks could enjoy.\n\nThen Crowder, a married father of two, refocuses on family at the end by skewering parents who reject their gay kids: “It blows my mind that something like that could actually impact the way they feel about their child.”\n\nThis may be prickly humor – raw, raunchy and confrontational – but there’s a lot of heart at its core.\n\nTrae Crowder, Drew Morgan, Corey Ryan Forrester\n\n\"wellRED Live From Lexington\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nCranberries meet sad 'End'\n\nThere was no right way for The Cranberries to produce a final album with their late singer Dolores O’Riordan, but doing nothing at all would have been the worst move.\n\nO’Riordan, who died in January 2018 after drowning in a bathtub while intoxicated, had recorded vocal demos for new material before her death. Her band – brothers Noel (guitar) and Mike (bass) Hogan plus drummer Fergal Lawler – built up songs around her recordings to create the new “In the End.”\n\nThose vocals are decidedly unpolished and tentative at times, obviously because O’Riordan expected to finesse the process with additional recordings, and her bandmates decided to just make do with what they had rather than put her voice through unseemly processing in the studio.\n\nThe result is an “In the End” that sounds halting, albeit genuine, familiar and incredibly sad.\n\nThe group that created such 1990s hits as “Zombie,” “Linger,” Dreams” and “Ridiculous Thoughts” echoes their past – jangly alt-rock and catchy refrains, though nothing with “Zombie”-level voltage.\n\nO’Riordan, who died at age 46, maintains the childlike wonder in her voice here, shading the wistful and grim songs with hints of hope.\n\nAnd given her demise, the lyrics turn out to be a gut punch: “I know that time is moving fast” she muses in the darkness of “Lost,” while on the delicate “Illusion” she sings, “It’s all an illusion/This is my conclusion for now.” Also, “In the End’s” title track is a slow and ghostly finale where O’Riordan sings, “Ain’t it strange when everything you wanted was nothing that you wanted in the end?”\n\nFans would have wanted more than this collection of semi-memorable soft songs, just as they would have wanted more of O’Riordan, period. But as the singer herself would likely say, you take what you can get and make the most of it.\n\nThe Cranberries\n\n\"In the End\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nPink is pale on \"Hurts 2B Human\"\n\nThis was supposed to be Pink’s moment. The April 26 release of her eighth studio album was planned to put her squarely in the spotlight. … Until Beyonce made the surprise release of “Homecoming: The Live Album,” Taylor Swift released the surprise single “ME!” and even Madonna came out of the woodwork to release the surprise single “Medellin.” What’s more, Lizzo came out of seemingly nowhere to top Amazon’s sales charts with the April 19 release of her bold new album, “Cuz I Love You.”\n\nNow Pink’s new “Hurts 2B Human” feels like an afterthought - and an overly familiar one at that, partly because four of the songs have already been released as singles, and partly because most of the other tracks sound like something Pink has done before.\n\nShe’s again working with an army of top-shelf collaborators (including Max Martin, Shellback, Greg Kurstin, Beck, Ryan Tedder and Sia) and top-shelf guest artists (including Khalid Chris Stapleton and Cash Cash).\n\nPlus she sings her guts out, tapping into her trademark themes such as perseverance, heartbreak and isolation. Songs like “Walk Me Home” and the title track are classic “you and me against the world” numbers that take on extra weight and poignancy as Pink prepares to turn 40 in September.\n\nAnd to contrast the morose air, she spins through the catchy kiss-off “Hustle” (which stylistically/thematically mirrors Elle King’s “Ex’s & Oh’s”) and settles into the heavily synthesized “90 Days” (which should prompt Imogen Heap to consult her lawyers for its similarity to her hit “Hide and Seek”).\n\nBut mostly Pink is down, sad about her “young emotions that just won’t grow up” on “My Attic” and self-pitying with the revelation “maybe I’m just scared to be happy” on “Happy.”\n\nIndividual tracks are beautiful, even touching, but overall “Hurts 2B Human” is déjà vu depression.\n\nPink\n\n\"Hurts 2B Human\"\n\nRating: 3 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nBeyonce's bloated without visuals\n\nBeyonce seized the rapt attention of the masses with this week's release of her new Netflix visual/aural feast “Homecoming Live,” which shows the conceptualization and execution of her performances at Coachella in 2018.\n\nThere’s also an audio-only companion piece, “Homecoming: The Live Album,” which is simply a mess.\n\nBeyonce is a force of nature on “Homecoming,” and she shares the spotlight with husband Jay-Z, daughter Blue Ivy, sister Solange, Destiny’s Child bandmates Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams, dancers, fans, a drumline, other musicians. … And all that sharing fractures the “Homecoming” album experience, which stretches over 40 frustrating tracks that, at a running time of one hour and 49 minutes, sound both rushed and addled.\n\nWithout the visual context, the album’s focus is pulled by meandering medleys, excessive interludes and abruptly truncated songs (“Hold Up” only gets 46 seconds) – a sometimes unlistenable chaos of distractions and commotion.\n\nFortunately, Beyonce takes command of several showstoppers, revving up for her solo breakout “Crazy in Love” followed by the raw power of “Freedom,” delivering a one-two punch with the fierce delivery of “Don’t Hurt Yourself” and the clap-along “I Care,” drumming up late-album excitement with a boisterous “Get Me Bodied,” a lively “Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)” and an inspired rendition of “Love on Top.”\n\nFor his part, Jay-Z is a powerful match for his wife in the duet “Déjà Vu,” plus the three-song Destiny’s Child reunion – for “Lose My Breath,” “Say My Name” and “Soldier” - is a gratifying throwback.\n\nMore reviews:Anderson .Paak, Khalid, Billie Eilish and more\n\n“Homecoming Live” could have been edited into an incredible 12-track release, but as is, it’s a bloated collection that doesn’t stand on its own apart from the film.\n\nSo if you want to hear a great Beyonce album, listen to “Lemonade” instead.\n\nBeyonce\n\n\"Homecoming: The Live Album\"\n\nRating: 3 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nBTS sticks to the plan\n\nBTS is the most popular modern version on the quintessential boy band: wildly successful with the most fervent fan demographic – adolescents – and review-proof.\n\nYet the group of seven guys also breaks ground as the most successful K-pop band in American history, singing and rapping mostly in Korean. They’re currently unstoppable, at least until the inevitable splintering of the band members, and their new “Map of the Soul: Persona” was a guaranteed smash before it was even released.\n\nBut should it be?\n\nJimin, RM, V, Jin, Jungkook, Suga and J-Hope range in age from 21 to 26, and they’re a nonthreatening bunch of solid vocalists, because as always with boy bands, we don’t want any edgy men in the group to scare parents away.\n\nAnd when BTS slides into its very familiar groove, “Map of the Soul: Persona” offers a serviceable mix of soft dance, melodic pop and scruffy hip-hop … well-trodden territory for BTS, who isn’t trying to pioneer a new sound.\n\nHowever, the release is a scant 7 tracks, including unspectacular (cheesily produced) opening and closing rap/rock songs “Intro: Persona” and “Dionysys.”\n\nThe remaining five cuts are mostly satisfying, particularly the smoothly infections single “Boy With Luv” (featuring Halsey in a minor guest role) and the chilled hip-hop of “Home,” which slyly teases with “You know I want that … You know you got that.” Meanwhile, Ed Sheeran had a hand in co-writing the soft-focus, horn-accented romance of “Make It Right,” and “Mikrokosmos” floats in timeless-pop ether (and never quite comes in for a landing). The lethally slow melodrama “Jamais Vu” is the only clunker here, though rest-assured it will be embraced by fans all the same.\n\nGiven the moderate artistic quality of “Map of the Soul: Persona,” it’s hard to argue that BTS deserves all of their current success. But it’s even harder to argue that they don’t deserve at least some of it.\n\nBTS\n\n\"Map of the Soul: Persona\"\n\nRating: 3 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nLively Lizzo lets loose\n\nBrace yourself: Lizzo’s new “Cuz I Love You” is a sensory-overload assault of extremely friendly fire, an infectious and empowering release that checks subtlety at the door.\n\nThe Houston-native singer/rapper (and dancer) had previously held back on belting (she told Entertainment Weekly “I didn’t want to be that big black girl with a soulful voice”), but holding back isn’t in her nature, so now she belts with the best of them on “Cuz I Love You.”\n\nThe new release overflows with self-love and empowerment as Lizzo adds an exclamation point to nearly every line she delivers. Bumping against the heated dance groove of the jovial “Juice,” she proclaims, “Ain’t my fault that I’m out here makin’ news/I’m the pudding in the proof/Gotta blame it on my juice,” and she even contemplates marrying herself on the sizzling “Soulmate”: “I’m my own soulmate, I know how to love me … I’m never lonely!”\n\nAnd on the ultimate girl-power anthem, the blustery “Like a Girl,” Lizzo opens with “Woke up feeling like I just might run for president!” (Don’t even try to hold her back.)\n\nMeanwhile, Lizzo’s not a one-note phenomenon: She also channels her charisma into relationship songs, taking audible breaths between lines on the bold title track - and implying a huge “duh!” when she bellows “I’m cryin’ ‘cause I love you!” She also sends away an unsuitable suitor on “Jerome,” suggesting he, “come back when you’re grown.” And Lizzo dramatically erupts in the over-the-top, choir-backed “Heaven Help Me,” letting loose with, “If love ain’t dead, I’m gonna kill it/’Cause it’s killing me.”\n\n“Cuz I Love You” features notable guest appearances from Missy Elliott (“Tempo”) and Gucci Mane (“Exactly How I Feel”), but otherwise this is all about Lizzo, down to her sensual “Lingerie,” where she closes out the release with a saucy come-on: “Hair down, moonlit, look at my lipstick.”\n\nEven if you don’t fall in lust with Lizzo, you’re likely to fall in love.\n\nLizzo\n\n\"Cuz I Love You\"\n\nRating: 4-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nMatt Simons seems to be an unflappable guy. He’s a genial singer-songwriter originally from California, but now based in Brooklyn. He’s got a deceptive “Everyman” air about him, relatable and generally easygoing.\n\nSimons breezes through the songs of his new “After the Landslide” like a contestant killing it on “The Voice.” He’s a crowd-pleaser, even if you can see (almost) every line coming a mile away, and he sings with an unassuming delivery tweaked with natural-born soul.\n\nHe sounds a lot like John Mayer, and that’s OK.\n\nOn “Summer With You,” Simons earnestly sings about “that summer with you,” reminiscing about looking at meteor showers at 3 a.m. in search of the meaning of life. He employs transparent reverse psychology on “Not Falling Apart,” lying his way through lines like, “You’re not the girl in every song I write … You were never the one for me … There’s not a freckle on your face that I’m missing.”\n\nSimons usually keeps it positive – tapping into an infectious sing-along on “Made It Out Alright,” offering encouragement and support on “Open Up,” grandly putting his heart on the line on the moving title track and then slyly showing his best Mayer-esque confidence on “If I Was Your Man.”\n\nHe sounds genuinely casual most of the time, be it in “We Can Do Better’s” brassy call for positivity or even in the bluesy “It’s You,” which only makes the point that he can sing blues if he must (though it’s not his forte).\n\nAnd when Simons takes a dark turn, he’s soberingly effective. On “Dust,” featuring Betty Who, he sternly warns a troublesome ex, “Don’t kick the dust up, just ’cause you’re lonely.” And on the hymnal-ish “Amy’s Song,” Simons deals a gut-punch to those who reject LGBTQ family and friends in the name of religion: “Does your god really give a damn? Does it make her less of a woman? Does it make him less of a man?”\n\nUltimately, Simons is comfortably familiar and routinely satisfying.\n\nMatt Simons\n\n\"After the Landslide\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nMissyou's emotions are tough to hear\n\nMissyou’s “YourBody” sounds like the breakup album of Trent Reznor and Taylor Swift.\n\nThe alt-rock release is dark and electrified, with Missyou frontman Blaise Beyhan treading on grim sonic territory in the same realm as Reznor’s Nine Inch Nails, while thematically his bitter disappointment about a dysfunctional relationship aligns with Swift.\n\nExcept Beyhan isn’t shaking anything off. Instead of shrugging that “haters gonna hate,” he hangs up in the refrain “None of us are getting out alive” on the track “closetoyou.”\n\n“YourBody” is bleakly compelling like that, with Beyhan stewing in the emotional cauldron of betrayal and rage.\n\n“Are you with or against me now?” he demands in the stomping “Child 44” before seething about, “Using bullets like ‘I love you, but I’m not in love with you anymore’.” And fear and sensuality intertwine on the title track, a desolate song that sounds like ambient music for a funeral pierced by static and flashes of rock, while Beyhan issues something that feels more like a threat than an invitation: “Neither one of us is going to sleep tonight.”\n\nHowever, the threat level drops on this dense melodrama as Beyhan gets so twisted in his passion that the songs can’t breathe.\n\nThe mopey “Anything” is raw at first – “What happened to me and you? What happened to telling the truth?” – and then Beyhan’s unmitigated pain collapses into “Would’ve done anything for you.” Meanwhile, his obsessions ultimately force “Timid & Timbuktu” to get lost in space, and the unchecked nervous energy of the self-indulgent “Know It All” results in an uncomfortable listening experience.\n\nTo be fair, it isn’t realistic to wrap feelings of anger and pain in tidy three- and four-minute packages. It’s harder than that to move on from hurt, as difficult as that is to hear.\n\nMissyou\n\n\"YourBody\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nIcelandic-Canadian singer is universal\n\nLindy Vopnfjord is from a small and very specific community that many may never have heard of – he’s an Icelandic-Canadian from Manitoba – but his music couldn’t be more universal.\n\nVopnfjord, who now lives in Toronto, gets in touch with those Icelandic roots on his new “You Will Know When It’s Right,” a collaboration with the Icelandic band Nydonsk recorded in Reykjavik. The release also includes a live version of Vopnfjord’s song “Lover Sister,” performed with Nydonsk at Reykjavik’s Eldborg Harpa concert hall.\n\nThe first few notes of opening cut “Love Me Like That” show that Vopnfjord could be from anywhere; the track’s jangly flow and well-branded refrain are trademarks of folk-pop-rock songs around the world.\n\nThe nostalgia of “You Will Know It’s Right” is broadly relatable, and Vopnfjord does hint at his background at times, as on the full-bodied “Standing on the Sea” where he wistfully sings, “The nights are cold here, cold as hell,” and adds, “It’s a nice place to visit, but you wouldn’t want to stay.” However, there’s a distinctly American/country-music twist to ‘How Did We Get Away,” a bittersweet reflection on lost friendship.\n\nBeatles said it’s all you need.” And though there are clear Beatles influences in Vopnfjord’s melodies, his voice is more akin to Rod Stewart, distinctively raspy and endearing.\n\nHe also charms with his call for understanding and togetherness. On the quirky ballad “I’m So Hi,” he sings, “Speak your mind across party lines if you’ve got something to say.” And on the more romantic “Our Greatest Irony,” he offers, “It could be I’m just right for you, even if I’m against you.”\n\nThere’s some sameness to the tracks that slows the flow of the low-key “You Will Know When It’s Right.” But the audience’s warm auction to the live rendition of “Lover Sister” provides a comforting finale.\n\nLindy Vopnfjord\n\n\"You Will Know When It's Right\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/04/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2021/07/01/iowa-state-fair-grandstand-concert-lineup-2021-tickets-chris-stapleton-blake-shelton-styx-beach-boys/5299507001/", "title": "Iowa State Fair Grandstand 2021: Your concert lineup guide", "text": "From country artists Chris Stapleton and Sam Hunt to rhythm and blues group Boyz II Men, Christian artists Casting Crowns, classic rockers Styx, metal's Five Finger Death Punch and the good old Beach Boys and Doobie Brothers, the 2021 Iowa State Fair Grandstand lineup has something for everyone.\n\nHere's a closer look at the acts and what it'll cost to see them at the Grandstand:\n\nCasting Crowns with special guest Jordan Feliz\n\nShowtime: 8 p.m. Thursday, Aug.12\n\nGenre: Christian\n\nTicket prices: $25-$50\n\nThe award-winning Christian music group Casting Crowns consisting of Mark Hall (lead singer/songwriter), Melodee DeVevo (violin, cello, vocals), Brian Scoggin (drums), Megan Garrett (piano, keyboards, vocals), Juan DeVevo (guitar, vocals), Chris Huffman (bass guitar, vocals) and Josh Mix (lead guitar, vocals) have sold more than 11 million albums to date.\n\nCasting Crowns has earned several notable accolades, including a Grammy in 2005 for \"Lifesong,\" 18 GMA Dove Awards and four American Music Awards.\n\nTheir Christian radio hits include \"Who Am I,\" \"Praise You In This Storm\" and \"Voice of Truth.\" Casting Crowns' tours have taken them to 140 cities around the world.\n\nSpecial guest Jordan Feliz moved up the gospel music ranks with his first radio single, \"The River.\" The track was named American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers' Christian Music Song of the Year for 2017 and earned Feliz his first gold record certification.\n\nMore:Iowa State Fair free stage lineup features the Nadas, Tony!

He killed it, he killed it.\"\n\nZac Brown Band long ago proved their badass bona fides at Summerfest, as one of the most frequent amphitheater headliners over the past decade.\n\nSo in the battle of back-to-back bearded country star Summerfest headliners, who was better?\n\nWell, both acts put on smoking two hour sets for packed crowds. But I’m going to have to give Stapleton the edge this time, for one reason: Zac Brown Band was at a slight disadvantage, with two members missing.\n\nRELATED:Summerfest 2021: Nelly, G-Eazy, Lindsey Stirling, Wilco, and the best and worst of the Milwaukee music festival's Day 2, Weekend 2\n\nRELATED:Summerfest 2021 lineup: Here's the schedule by date, time and stage for the Milwaukee music festival\n\nRELATED:What to know about Summerfest 2021 tickets, COVID-19 rules, shuttle changes, bag policy, new areas and more\n\nRELATED:Here are 14 ways to get into Summerfest 2021 in Milwaukee for free\n\nRELATED:27 must-see acts at Summerfest 2021 in Milwaukee, from Megan Thee Stallion to Guns N' Roses to Chris Stapleton\n\nGuitarist, organist and pianist Coy Bowles, and bassist Matt Mangano, were both absent Friday. No explanation was given on stage, and there’s been no explanation circulating on social media. We emailed the band’s publicists Friday night but did not hear back.\n\nFormer ZBB bassist John Driskell Hopkins, a multi-instrumentalist since 2014, easily slipped back into the role Friday, while Clay Cook compensated for Bowles as best he could on guitar and piano.\n\nBut with Hopkins stuck on one instrument, the band’s signature jam sessions inevitably weren’t quite as extensive Friday, nor quite as frequent. But they were hardly non-existent.\n\nThree songs in, there was ZBB's signature spin on \"The Devil Went Down To Georgia.\" Jimmy De Martini practically channeled the spirit of Charlie Daniels with his hellfire-flirting fiddling, matched for a moment by Brown's own rapid guitar picking, the band huddling together to rock out and raise the heat.\n\nHopkins supplied droll baritone vocals for the Appalachian-inspired \"It's Not OK,\" with several players racing through a lightning round of \"top my riff.\" It served as a tasty appetizer for an extended cover of Marshall Tucker Band's \"Can't You See,\" with Cook on lead vocals, that bounced from Brown's string-plucking guitar solo, to a simmering percussion solo from Daniel De Los Reyes, to Chris Fryar's funky drum display.\n\n\"Can't You See\" also showcased a new addition to the touring band this year, Caroline Jones, who busted into some sweet harmonica and chimed in with ethereal vocals. Jones also led a cover of Fleetwood Mac's \"Big Love\" with some big vocals and added a rich new layer to a sublime five-part harmony section for \"Day That I Die.\"\n\nDown a few hands, hearty singalongs like that one became the stars of the show Friday. The crowd reaction to \"Colder Weather\" was so warm Brown was practically glowing, clapping for the crowd, blowing them kisses and pounding his chest in appreciation. The singalongs for escapist anthems \"Knee Deep\" and \"Toes,\" and their signature hit and natural show closer \"Chicken Fried,\" were just as loud and passionate.\n\nThe band also used the set list to preview their forthcoming album \"The Comeback,\" due out next month. Brown was pushing it pretty aggressively, saying he worked harder on it than anything else, and new songs like the anthemic \"Slow Burn,\" the whimsical \"Same Boat\" and the '50s R&B-flavored \"Old Love Song\" were slickly presented Friday, but it's going to take several more listens until they become set-list favorites.\n\nBut to fill out the encore, ZBB did something really inspired, playing a medley of covers everyone in the crowd knew by heart, with a different member fronting each one. Hopkins brought the menace over towering guitars for Metallica's \"Enter Sandman.\" Fryar kept the rhythm while singing Cheap Trick's \"I Want You To Want Me,\" while De Los Reyes relished his rare opportunity to be center stage on Ritchie Valens' \"La Bamba.\"\n\nBrown sang Elton John's \"Rocket Man,\" Jones covered Phil Collins' \"In the Air Tonight,\" and Cook took the reins for 4 Non Blondes' \"What's Up?\" And for about 60 glorious seconds, the amphitheater felt like Camp Randall on game day when De Martini rapped the Badgers' unofficial anthem, House of Pain's \"Jump Around.\"\n\n\"We've been daydreaming about this for a long time,\" Brown said at one point, relishing the harmonious roar of thousands.\n\n\"This is the America that I know.\"\n\nGabby Barrett battles sound issues\n\nZac Brown Band traditionally hasn’t brought out a buzzy opening act for their tours, but they nabbed one of Nashville’s brightest new talents with Gabby Barrett.\n\nOn Thursday, the former “American Idol” contestant nabbed four CMA Award nominations — more than any other female artist this year — for song and single of the year (for “The Good Ones”), new artist and female vocalist.\n\nSo what a shame you could barely hear her vocals over her thunderous three-piece backing band for the first few songs of her 45-minute set.\n\nOnce the bass-rattling drummer took a breather, Barrett’s pristine vocals filled the room for an acoustic medley of hymns (performed with her husband, former “Idol” contestant Cade Foehner, on vocals and guitar) that peaked with a stunning version of “How Great Thou Art” that recalled Brandi Carlile in its vocal splendor.\n\nIt was one of several covers Friday, performed with mixed results. Barrett got to play rock star for Guns N’ Roses’ “Paradise City” and Journey’s “Don’t Stop Believin’” with stadium-shaking vocals that would impress Axl Rose and Steve Perry — but her cover of Miranda Lambert’s “Little Red Wagon” missed the sass of the original.\n\nAnd by the time she closed with her huge crossover hit “I Hope” — a love song on the surface before the cruel and clever lyrical twist in the chorus — the sound issues had been remedied, although Barrett relinquished vocal control to thousands of fans belting along.\n\nZac Brown Band set list\n\n1. “Homegrown”\n\n2. “Keep Me In Mind”\n\n3. “The Devil Went Down To Georgia” (Charlie Daniels Band cover)\n\n4. “No Hurry”\n\n5. “It’s Not OK”\n\n6. “Same Boat”\n\n7. “As She’s Walking Away”\n\n8. “Can’t You See” (Marshall Tucker Band cover)\n\n9. “Tomorrow Never Comes\"\n\n10. “Day That I Die”\n\n11. “Knee Deep” (acoustic)\n\nIntermission\n\n12. “Someone I Used To Know”\n\n13. “Old Love Song”\n\n14. “Big Love” (Fleetwood Mac cover)\n\n15. “Colder Weather”\n\n16. “Slow Burn”\n\n17. “Toes”\n\n18. “Beautiful Drug”\n\nEncore\n\n19. “Enter Sandman” (brief Metallica cover)\n\n20. “I Want You To Want Me” (brief Cheap Trick cover)\n\n21. “In the Air Tonight” (brief Phil Collins cover)/\n\n22. “La Bamba” (brief Ritchie Valens cover)\n\n23. “Jump Around” (brief House of Pain cover)\n\n24. “What’s Up?” (brief 4 Non Blondes cover)\n\n25. “Rocket Man” (brief Elton John cover)\n\n26. “Chicken Fried”\n\nContact Piet at (414) 223-5162 or plevy@journalsentinel.com.

Pitchfork raved that Brettin \"does an interesting job crafting elaborately layered songs that still have a sort of four-track sound. When Brettin reaches in this way, his tunes leave DeMarco at the door and instead seek the territory explored by bands like under-appreciated ’90s Brian Wilson worshippers the High Llamas.\"\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Thursday, Sept. 1.

And they're still going strong two albums later, touring on \"Let Me Get By,\" which inspired a PopMatters writer to rave that it's \"finally the record that capitalizes on the promise this collective has had from the start.\"\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Friday, Sept. 2.

Hits include \"Forever,\" \"Find Your Love,\" \"Make Me Proud,\" \"Take Care,\" \"Started From the Bottom,\" \"Hold On, We're Going Home\" and last year's five-times-platinum \"Hotline Bling,\" the song that launched a million remixes.

Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band.” But by the time it hit the streets in 1968, the Zombies had already broken up. Their masterpiece’s reputation just kept growing, though. And they eventually got back together, entertaining several generations worth of fans with some of rock and roll’s most timeless songs. Their newest release, the aptly titled \"Still Got That Hunger,\" is the fourth album of new material since keyboardist Rod Argent and singer Colin Blunstone reunited in 2001.

You can imagine the shy kids dance parties the album will soundtrack, but Pool is also an introspective record, tailormade for lonesome nights.\" Spin also liked it, writing, \"There is almost always an underlying inorganic sound that’s either ominous, nauseous or both, and it’s the only thing that guarantees that none of the slower tracks will unknowingly be embraced in dentists’ waiting rooms next to classic soft rock.\"\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Tuesday, Sept. 13.

And to celebrate, the three surviving members hit the studio with Adam Schlesinger and came out with their strongest, most consistently engaging album since the '60s. “Good Times!\" features music written for the Monkees by the likes of Rivers Cuomo (Weezer), Ben Gibbard (Death Cab for Cutie) and Andy Partridge (XTC) in addition to an old Neil Diamond song with lead vocals from Jones. Released in May, the album hit the charts at No. 14, their best showing since the 1968 release of the \"The Birds, The Bees & The Monkees. Now, Dolenz and Tork are comin' to your town with a multi-media production, screening vintage footage from their Emmy-winning series.\n\nDetails: 7:30 p.m. Thursday, Sept. 15. Mesa Arts Center, 1 E.

The award was for \"The Muscle Shoals Recordings,\" which inspired PopMatters to rave that \"Everything that makes the SteelDrivers, fundamentally, the SteelDrivers, is present and laid out on the table totally disrobed, with no frilly affectations or studio voodoo accentuating their raw mix.\" Or maybe you'd be swayed more by Adele, who says, “They’re a blues, country, bluegrass, swagger band, and they are brilliant.”\n\nDetails: 7:30 p.m. Thursday, Sept. 15.

Nick has been the Jonas most likely to succeed from the day he and his brothers signed a major-label deal (although Joe may have been the most crush-worthy to younger Jonas Brothers fans). The point is Nick is solo now, touring an album called “Nick Jonas,” which has spawned two major pop hits.\n\nDetails: Friday, Sept. 16.

This is what we had to say about their set at Viva PHX: Crystal Castles had a huge crowd dancing to their throbbing beats while bearing witness to one of their first live performances since Alice Glass left the group in 2014. New singer Edith Frances proved an energetic onstage presence, flailing her hair as she hopped up and down on a stage bathed in smoke. And her heavily processed vocals sounded great in a set whose highlights included “Baptism,” “Untrust Us” and “Not In Love,” while Ethan Kath supplied those memorable synth hooks with a touring drummer rounding out the lineup.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Friday, Sept. 16.

Another reason you should go? This is the final tour and album with this lineup, after which Michael Gira has said, \"I'll continue to make music under the name Swans, with a revolving cast of collaborators ... touring will definitely be less extensive.\"\n\nDetails: 8:30 p.m. Friday, Sept. 16.

The reviewer at Mojo hailed it as “his most succinct and affecting work since the near-perfect 'Wit’s End,' the album that 'Mangy Love' now replaces as his finest.” I featured a track from the album, \"Medusa's Outhouse,\" on a recent playlist of 12 songs you need to hear right now, where I wrote: \"He puts his upper register to brilliant use on this atmospheric ballad, investing the lyrics with vulnerability and soul from the opening line.”\n\nDetails: 7:30 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 17.

Mascis made the Alternative Nation safe for speaker-shredding, fuzz-drenched Neil Young-style guitar heroics on Dinosaur Jr. albums as essential as \"You're Living All Over Me,\" \"Bug\" and \"Green Mind.\" And he's definitely tapped into the essence of those classics in the bittersweet guitar jams that constitute the bulk of this year's stunning \"Give a Glimpse of What Yer Not,\" on which he offers more than just a glimpse of what he's kinda always been. Of course, it helps that it's the fourth consecutive release to boast the classic lineup – Lou Barlow on bass and Murph on drums – since they got back together and blessed us with \"Beyond\" in 2007.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Monday, Sept. 19.

Founding drummer Bill Ward left the fold in 2012, saying he wouldn’t return until he was given a “signable contract.” But Ozzy Osbourne, Tony Iommi and Geezer Butler carried on, releasing “13” in 2013, and embarking on a world tour, which was pretty amazing.

Q Magazine responded to the album with \"While Vance's pipes are impressive – a mix of Van Morrison and John Fogerty – it's his lyrical googlies that hook you in.\" And really, it's not every day an artist comes along who can inspire members of the British rock press to sing the praises of their googlies.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Wednesday, Sept. 21.

And they apparently dined heavily on \"Beggars Banquet,\" given the Jaggeresque vocals. But like Royal Trux before them, Twin Peaks take the Stones' unpolished essence as a starting point, arriving at a sound that's even more unpolished. In a good way. It's a low-key brand of rock and roll, the kind that sounds like it was captured as the sun was coming up after a long night of living the rock-and-roll lifestyle. The next time a self-loathing Boomer wants to tell you rock-and-roll is dying, throw this on and leave the room so they come to terms with the fact that it's not rock and roll that's dying.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Thursday, Sept. 22.

I'm on board with her singing. And so was the PopMatters critic who wrote: \"Queasy carnival music, hoodoo blues stomps, country waltz ballads, primitive rock and jazzy inflections coalesce and flow around the anchor of Hernandez's rich voice, a contralto rife with character and heartrending soul.\"\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Friday, Sept. 23.

Skiba’s first onstage appearance with the band was hailed in OC Weekly as “the best they’ve sounded in over a decade.” So there's that. They've topped the Modern Rock charts three times, with \"All the Small Things,\" \"I Miss You\" and this year's \"Bored to Death,\" their first release with Skiba.

And they're still going strong with a great new album \"Silence in the Snow.\" It's their seventh release and as the review in Alternative Press was right to note, \"the Florida foursome still manage to top themselves with each outing.\" The twin-guitar solos alone would make this album — and this concert — worth your while.\n\nDetails: 7:30 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 24.

But they broke through in a big way in 2013 when a synth-pop song called \"Closer\" topped the U.S. dance charts, giving them their first Top 40 entry on the Hot 100 in the process. The synth-driven pop sensibilities driving \"Closer\" up the chart are also very much on display on their new album, \"Love You to Death,\" from the candy-coated New Wave soul of \"Boyfriend\" to the album-closing \"Hang On to the Night,\" a dreamy synth-pop ballad that could be their most contagious track yet.\n\nDetails: 7 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 24.

But that also means it's wildly entertaining, like the Blues Brothers playing the soundtrack to \"The Little Shop of Horrors,\" as Mark Ronson would produce it. Kelvin Swaby definitely has the vocal grit to tap into that classic Memphis soul vibe. And they clearly know their way around a memorable hook.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 24.

Of course they both sold out before we even made it to September. These shows are part of the \"Sunshine Superman\" 50th anniversary, but whether that means he'll be playing the entire album is a bit unclear. The psychedelic icon says, “I am delighted to be going on tour throughout North America, to thank all who have followed my work from the beginning -- and all who have just discovered me now. I celebrate my 50th year in music to re-affirm my poet’s role to unite us with our deeper conscious Self.

Bassist Matthew Whipple says of the album, “We wanted to make a more energetic record. I personally looked to artists like Springsteen, '70s Bowie, the Smiths, the Cure, Neil Young as inspiration for — not really for sound as much as for that dichotomy of bands who were entertainers still making, at times, weird dark music and writing songs that seem totally over-the-top by today's rock band standards.”\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Tuesday, Sept. 27.

But after hitting No. 3 with 1996’s “MTV Unplugged,” they fell on hard times as Layne Staley struggled with the drug addiction that would claim his life in 2002. Primary songwriter Jerry Cantrell, founding drummer Sean Kinney and bassist Mike Inez, who joined in 1993, got back together three years after Staley’s death with a new singer, William DuVall. Since then, they’ve sent four singles to the top of Billboard’s mainstream-rock chart — “Check My Brain,” “Your Decision,” “Hollow” and “Stone.” Their latest album, “The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here,” debuted at No. 2 on Billboard’s album chart while earning a rave from No Ripcord, whose writer weighed in with “ ‘The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here’ is up there with the best Alice in Chains albums, with each track a conquest of structure and composition.”\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Friday, Sept. 30.

And they conquered alternative radio with \"Fall In Love,\" which filters the best parts of disco and bachelor-pad music through a more contemporary sensibility with the added value of a timeless melody and the sense that there's something emotional at stake on the lyrical front.

Of course, by this point, they’ve left the alternative-country and indie-folk labels by the wayside. They’re just what they are. And by the time this concert rolls around, they'll have released \"Away,\" their first album in three years, which we're told is a \"radically different\" affair. Sheff recorded the album with an almost entirely new cast of musicians, most coming from the jazz and avant-garde worlds, and the result is a stripped-down embodiment of Sheff's revival through music after a period of significant loss and change.\n\nDetails: 8:30 p.m. Friday, Sept. 30.

And it's not because the nerdy stuff I tend to favor was in short supply. Their tracks are just that good, especially the Gomez song, \"Bad Liar,\" which came really close to winding up at No. 1.\n\nHere's a look at those titles as well as local tracks from Jane N' the Jungle, Playboy Manbaby and Serene Dominic.\n\n1. Shabazz Palaces featuring Thaddilac, 'Shine a Light'\n\nWhen you start with a sample as deeply soulful as the richly orchestrated snatch of Dee Dee Sharp’s “I Really Love You” that underscores this single, you’ve already won my vote. Rather than sampling Sharp’s vocal performance, they layer their own vocal melody over the string part, Thaddilac singing, “Shine a light on the fake / This way my peeps can have it all” in an aching falsetto.\n\nIt’s a breathtaking backdrop for Ishmael Butler’s words, which flow freely, unhampered by linear thinking. “Street profit / Sweets geeked off it,” Butler aka Palaceer Lazaro begins, “Seek profit / Cook styles, eat off it / Think unique, tyres squeak, jewels blink / Defy critique, high peaks, comped suites / She said I'm too deep, then she fell asleep.”\n\nThis is the first track they’ve shared from their new album, “Quazarz: Born on a Gangster Star,” introducing the title character, a “sentient being from somewhere else” who finds himself trapped in the “ethers of the Migosphere here on Drake world.”\n\n2. Selena Gomez, 'Bad Liar'\n\nAt 24, she has one of the sexiest voices in mainstream pop. And that's important on a track like this – much like on last year’s most contagious actual pop hit, the smoldering “Hands to Myself.”\n\nI love that she not only borrows a bassline from a classic Talking Heads song (“Psycho Killer\" of all things) but slips in a lyrical reference to the Trojan War (\"Just like the Battle of Troy, there's nothing subtle here\").\n\nAnd I am not the only aging music nerd thinks this song is pop gold. David Byrne of Talking Heads responded with a Tweet that said, “I really like the song...and her performance too.”\n\nOK, yes, he used to seem more eloquent. The point remains, he likes the single, which was written over Tina Weymouth’s classic bassline. Justin Tranter, who collaborated on the song with Gomez and Julia Michaels, explained how they ended borrowing a 40-year-old bassline in a conversation with Variety:\n\n“Selena and Julia are Talking Heads-obsessed. So when we all got together in one room, Julia suggested, ‘Why don’t we just write over the bassline from ‘Psycho Killer?’ and we were all going, ‘That sounds great!'” It really does.\n\n3. Everything Is Recorded feat. Sampha, 'Close But Not Quite'\n\nXL Records founder Richard Russell built this track, the first we’ve heard from his new project, on a deeply soulful Curtis Mayfield sample, the soul legend bringing his trembling falsetto to bear on a richly orchestrated chorus. “Of these words I try to recite,” he pleads, “they are close but not quite.”\n\nMost singers wouldn’t want to have to measure up to that. But U.K. soul sensation Sampha more than made it clear on last year’s \"Process,\" his achingly beautiful full-length debut, that he is not most singers.\n\nSampha effortlessly rises to the challenge here with a vocal that’s almost as vulnerable as Mayfield’s, especially when he slips into his own falsetto in the middle of the line, “I feel like I don't have the words” and then again, on the bridge, where he repeats the line, “I’m so misunderstood.”\n\nIt’s a stunning pairing that breathes new life into a timeless melody Mayfield laid to tape in 1970, 18 years before his duet partner (who wasn’t even that familiar with the Mayfield catalog before he cut this track) was even born.\n\nIf the process of making this record gets Sampha inspired to dig a little deeper into what people like Mayfield were doing in the early ’70s, then the future of soul is in even more capable hands than it already seems to be.\n\n4. The Downtown Boys, 'A Wall'\n\nThis isn’t the first time these Rhode Island punks have made my singles of the month list. This time, they’re raging against the Trump administration’s fabled border wall with conviction to spare on an explosive track that’s all forward momentum, Victoria Ruiz shouting \"A wall is a wall / A wall is just a wall / And nothing more at all.”\n\nThe implication, of course, is that it’s one more artificial boundary when we should be building bridges.\n\nThe track is driven by a throbbing post-punk bassline — and horns! — as Ruiz sneers the words with righteous indignation, demanding to know, “Am I under arrest? And do I have the right?” after leading her bandmates in a chant of “You can’t pull the plug on us.” Meanwhile, group members her punctuate her thoughts with well-placed expletives.\n\n5. LCD Soundsystem, 'Call the Police'\n\nIt’s been six years since LCD Soundsystem played what was supposed to be their final concert. And if you’re like me at all, you’re pretty happy when artists go back on their word and come out of retirement, especially when they come back strong with new material that only adds to – rather than subtracting from – their legacy.\n\nWhich brings us to “Call the Police” and “American Dream,” a new LCD Soundsystem single released as a digital double A-side.\n\n“Call the Police” is a feedback-laden rocker with a throbbing post-punk bassline and an urgent, emotional vocal from James Murphy, who sets the tone with a mantra of “We all, we all, we all, we all know this is nothing.”\n\nThe lyrics are riddled with tension, reflecting the current political climate without naming names or engaging in anything obvious. “The old guys are frightened and frightening to behold,” Murphy sings. “The kids come out fighting and still doing what they're told.”\n\nIn the song’s most lacerating verse, he sings, “Well, there’s a full-blown rebellion but you’re easy to confuse / By triggered kids and fakes and some questionable views / Oh, call the cops, call the preachers / Before they let us and they love / When oh, we all start arguing the history of the Jews / You got nothing left to lose / Gives me the blues.”\n\nAnd then he signs off with “The first in line, they’re gonna eat the rich.”\n\n6. LCD Soundsystem, 'American Dream'\n\n“American Dream” isn’t nearly as explosive as \"Call the Police.\" A melancholy synth-pop waltz, it finds Murphy reflecting on shattered American dreams and sex and drugs (but loveless sex and drugs that sure don’t sound like they’ve been getting anybody high). Mostly, it’s about the existential dread that so often accompanies aging.\n\n“Find the place where you can be boring,” he sighs. “Where you won't need to explain that you're sick in the head and you wish you were dead / Or at least instead of sleeping here you prefer your own bed.”\n\nAnd he punctuates one of his sadder vignettes (“So you kiss and you clutch but you can’t fight that feeling / That your one true love is just awaiting your big meeting / So you never even asked for names”) with musical touches that make it feel more like a moment of triumph.\n\n7. (Sandy) Alex G, 'Sportstar'\n\nThis auto-tuned piano ballad constitutes a pretty huge departure from the country-flavored trappings of the first two singles I heard from his forthcoming “Rocket” (“Proud” and “Bobby”). At the same time, it’s probably closer in spirit to the sort of music any reasonable person might expect from an artist who has worked with Frank Ocean.\n\nThis is haunting, emotional stuff with odd experimental touches as he crushes on a sports star with little regard for own emotional well-being, singing, “Let me tie your Nikes / Holding on for sport star / Let me wear your jersey / If you want to hurt me, hurt me.”\n\n8. Waxahatchee, 'No Curse'\n\nThis fuzz-laden indie-pop waltz was written too late for inclusion on “Out in the Storm,” their forthcoming album. I hate when that happens. Anyhow, they shared it via Shaking Through, an interactive series that shares the raw audio files, mix stems, recording notes and final mixes with members to download, remix and re-imagine at will.\n\nA breakup song whose most inspired moment may be Crutchfield’s vocal on “You were too much to unscrew,” the track was recorded the day after the Trump inauguration.\n\n“It’s so important to make art and be visible as an artist,” Katie Crutchfield says. “In moments of political turmoil, you should bring your skills to the table in a way that affects change or benefits people.”\n\n9. Bishop Briggs, 'The Way I Do'\n\nThis song is here by virtue of a very odd new music video. The track, from the singer's self-titled EP, is a soulful yet experimental ballad of the sort I was hoping Adele might have come up with on her latest album rather than the more conventional adult-contemporary fare with which she stole that Grammy out from under “Lemonade.”\n\nBut I digress.\n\nThis single is a tour de force for Briggs, her gospel-flavored vocals soaring toward emotional catharsis on a track built on a low-pitched vocal loop and finger pops like something Moby might have done on “Play.”\n\nIt’s a heartbreaking record, especially when she sings, “But you will never know this love / Will never know this pain / Never know the way I feel for you / You will never know this touch / Will never know this shame / Will never know the way I want you to.”\n\nAnd here’s what’s weird. It’s not a breakup song. As Briggs told the Fader, that feeling of loss was inspired by a musician friend telling her she was ready to give up on music.\n\n“I just looked at her and felt in my bones and in my soul, if you leave now, you'll never know this pain,” she said. “You'll never know this love. You'll never feel the way I do. That's where the whole song began and it's just about the ache that comes with all of this, and the whole point is sticking it out. Of course there are moments when you have doubt. Every time I sing this song, sometimes we start the set with this song, it always reminds me of how thankful I am that I keep going.”\n\n10. Mac DeMarco, 'One More Love Song'\n\nDeMarco’s brand of understated soft rock is the perfect backdrop for a breakup song about how “After all this time, it turns out all you found is one more love out to break your heart / Set it up just to watch it fall apart.”\n\nAnd when it comes to breaking hearts, DeMarco really hits his stride when he sizes up that faded love as just “another dream you’re putting down,” by which I do not think he means setting down on a table to dream another day.\n\n11. Big Sean, 'Jump Out the Window'\n\nOf course, he’s only threatening to jump out the window to let you know he cares. But people do that. This Auto-Tuned slow jam is told from the perspective of someone who’s ready to turn a woman’s lover back into her friend. “We already wasted too much time,” he Auto-Croons. “And your time is the only thing I wish was mine. So yeah, oh yeah, I think I’m ready to jump out the window.”\n\nTo be fair, the boyfriend does sound like an awful human being, as opposed to Big Sean’s narrator, who’s more endearingly dysfunctional.\n\nAs for the music, it sounds like a vintage arcade game. In a good way. And he fleshes it out with a reference to Mario Kart.\n\n12. Serene Dominic, 'Subterranean Heaven'\n\nI've known Dominic for years. He's freelanced countless articles for azcentral (and assorted other local publications). His band and my band have been known to share a bill. We've even written songs together (although, to be clear, like Elton John and Bernie Taupin, we were never in the same room at the time). But I'm also a fan of his work, and that's what brings us here.\n\nThis is among my favorite highlights of the album this local performer is about to drop. “Silver Alert” is full of Dominic’s reflections on aging, ageism, sex and the nagging fear that there are more days behind you than ahead.\n\nTaking the rhythmic propulsion of Buddy Holly’s “Peggy Sue,” who gets married in this case to a far more wistful melody, this single is his tribute to a friend who ran a record store. And much like the titular character of the Smokey Robinson heartbreaker, “Tears of a Clown,” the singer sets his cleverness aside just long enough to break your heart with his fond memories of a lost friend.\n\n“Michael, remember the magic of downtown?,” he begins. “There was no surfing / You had to shop around / An album I'd searched for / Maybe 10 years or more / I bought it at your store / With your seal of approval.”\n\nThe Zombies would be proud to call this song their own. As would the Kinks. And I don’t say that lightly. This could be his finest hour.\n\n“It's for Michael Carlucci,” the singer explains. “I was lucky enough to get to play with him in my last band in New York. Before that he played in a band called Winter Hours in the ‘80s, a true college band. They played here at Long Wong's and I think they sounded like the Tempe sound before there was one.\n\n\"Anyhow, he owned a record store in Greenwich Village called Subterranean Records and he loved Tom Verlaine and Television and Clarence White of the Byrds and he was so inventive with his playing. We'd do all that weaving, interlocking stuff. We stayed in touch, but every time I’d go back to New York, it'd get harder and harder to meet up.\"\n\nThe store eventually closed and Dominic learned through Facebook that his friend had passed.\n\n\"It's just mashing that brief time into a three-verse song,\" he says. \"But it's a love song to guitar-weaving, record stores and that last band, all kinda gone things. I guess I associate the ‘Peggy Sue’ rhythm with that something in the remote past and I tried putting something Television-y over it.”\n\n13. Playboy Manbaby, 'Cheap Wine'\n\nThis horn-driven highlight of “Don’t Let it Be” is ‘60s soul as filtered through the nervous energy that made the mod revival of the Jam feel like a natural extension of the punk scene. Any slower and the accents wouldn’t hit with that excitement. Any faster and it wouldn’t groove. It's just the sort of energy that lends itself to Robbie Pfeffer’s cult of personality.\n\nThe singer makes his entrance with a monologue, his delivery suitably over the top, like something out of “Little Shop of Horrors\" if John Waters had directed it.\n\n“Now lemme tell you something about myself,” he says, “that I think that you should know darling / ‘Cause it ain’t all peaches and cream / Hell I can’t even keep my apartment clean.”\n\nThen he runs down a list of the ways he’s made a mess of things, from burning down his house to drinking moldy beer before concluding “I’m really s---ty as my own adult / But it’s all OK because it’s not my fault.”\n\nThe mood is completed by a video that features Pfeffer and his bandmates as a ‘60s girl group, making their way through a series of synchronized dance moves in cartoonish drag and combat boots.\n\n14. Harry Styles, 'Sign of the Times'\n\nI love Noel Gallagher. But if his cat, as he contends, could have written this song in about 10 minutes, I’d suggest he bring his cat in as a co-writer the next time he’s putting an album together. Because this song is pop perfection of the sort that made Oasis matter in the first place. And Gallagher’s wife is right to have told him “It’s like Prince.” That’s the first thing I thought when I heard it. It’s just “Purple Rain” enough. And Styles’ falsetto does a brilliant job of tapping into the emotion of the lyrics, whose inspiration he explained to Rolling Stone.\n\n“‘Sign of the Times’ came from ‘This isn’t the first time we’ve been in a hard time, and it’s not going to be the last time’. The song is written from a point of view as if a mother was giving birth to a child and there’s a complication. The mother is told, ‘The child is fine, but you’re not going to make it.’ The mother has five minutes to tell the child, ‘Go forth and conquer.'”\n\nIt does go a little too over-the-top on the drama at a certain point, but by the time it got there, I was way too hooked to care.\n\n15. The National, 'The System Only Dreams in Total Darkness'\n\nThey set the tone with a bed of ethereal harmonies that could pass for the Beach Boys haunting a cathedral. Then the beat kicks in and the song settles into a brooding post-punk swagger on its way to the soaring release of a chorus hook that finds Matt Berninger repeating the line, “I can’t explain it any other, any other way.”\n\nFor some reason, the beat leaves me thinking of “Sympathy for the Devil” as U2 drummer Larry Mullen Jr. might have played it while Aaron Dessner, who also produces, punctuates the track with a recurring five-note outburst on guitar before taking flight on a brilliantly constructed solo.\n\nAs a taste of what’s to come on “Sleep Well Beast,” their first album since “Trouble Will Find Me” arrived in 2013, it has me thinking this could be the one on which they manage to capture the urgency of the live show.\n\nI’m not sure what the system is that only dreams in total darkness, but in an interview with Pitchfork, Berninger said: “That one, for me, is a hibernation — the dark before the dawn sort of thing. That one’s less about relationships than it is more of the strange way our world and our idea of identity mutates — sometimes overnight, as we’ve seen recently. It’s an abstract portrait of a weird time we’re in.”\n\n16. Japanese Breakfast, 'Machinist'\n\nSpoken-word monologues. They’re not just for tracks that attempt to recapture the magic and innocent charms of ‘60s girl-group records anymore. This melancholy – some would argue hopeful – track takes the art of the monologue back to the future (as the future sounded when “Back to the Future” was a thing, with atmospheric synths and robot voices).\n\nAnd that suits the science-fiction subtext of Japanese Breakfast's second album, \"Soft Sounds From Another Planet.\" It also suits the actual lyrics of the track itself, in which the narrator is in love with a machine and seems to be expecting an emotional return on that investment. Cue the chilly synth.\n\n17. DJ Khaled, feat. Justin Bieber, Quavo and Chance the Rapper and Lil’ Wayne, 'I’m the One'\n\nI was convinced this song would be the summer jam to beat, but after only one week at the Top of Billboard’s Hot 100, it was overtaken by another track that also features Justin Bieber, Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee’s “Despacito.”\n\nOh well, I like that song, too. But this one feels more like the quintessential summer jam it's clearly meant to be. It’s all about that bass, by which I do not mean what Meghan Trainor meant.\n\nChance’s delivery is just loopy enough to make me almost want to not point out the casual misogyny at the heart of nearly every verse, but if you're into stuff that sounds like this you're used to that by now. And Bieber’s chorus hook is nothing shy of undeniable.\n\n18. Jane N’ the Jungle, 'Faded Stars'\n\nThese local rockers have self-directed a strikingly colorful video that features singer Jordan White covered in paint as a representation, she says, of “life experiences that color and change you.”\n\nWhite co-directed the video with bandmate Brian Dellis, using an iPhone 7 and what looks to be a lot of paint.\n\n\"Faded Stars\" is a bittersweet ballad whose reflective verses make the most of the vulnerability White is so good at conveying as she sets the scene with \"One rock thrown at my window, 2 a.m. / Three chords strumming for the beating of our hearts.\"\n\nThe words describe the singer's loss of innocence, she says, “and feeling guilty for being a sinner and realizing that it's a coming of age and we all share in the same journeys.”\n\nThe majestic chorus finds her repeating the line “Turn around,” which White says “represents having the choice to make a change to overcome those obstacles and let go, cleansing yourself.”\n\nThere a slight hint of Queen to the harmonies on the bridge, which gives way to a soaring guitar lead on a track that makes excellent use of dynamics, guaranteeing that each chorus kicks in like it should to get the full effect.\n\n19. Sorority Noise, 'No Halo'\n\nThis is the latest single from “You're Not As _____ As You Think,” an album haunted by the death of several friends Cameron Boucher has lost since the release of “Joy, Departed,” which as the title suggests, was no day at the beach.\n\nThis particular track was a heartbreaking rocker whose inspiration Boucher shared when he checked in with Stereogum. “We were in Sean’s neighborhood, but Sean had been passed away for about a year,” he said. “But I didn’t remember that. And so I was like, I’m gonna drive by Sean’s house and just stop by and say hi. And then I drove to his house, and when I pulled up in front, I realized he wasn’t there. That’s what that chorus of the song is about, and the whole song in general… I think I literally just sat in my car and wrote 90 percent of the lyrics right there.”\n\nOf course, that story only makes it that much more chilling to experience the chorus: “So I didn’t show up to your funeral / But I showed up to your house / And I didn't move a muscle / I was quiet as a mouse / And I swore I saw you in there / But I was looking at myself.”\n\nFleet Foxes, 'Fool’s Errand'\n\nFleet Foxes give their inner Crosby, Stills & Nash the wheel on the breathtaking chorus of this latest “Crack-Up” focus track as Robin Pecknold weighs in on the dream he’s chasing with “It was a fool's errand / Waiting for a sign.”\n\nLike many of their more inspired moments, while the harmonies seem to be channeling Crosby, Stills & Nash, the melodic sensibilities and complexity of composition are closer in spirit to Brian Wilson after “Pet Sounds.”\n\nAlso much like many of their more inspired moments? It’s the heartache in Pecknold’s delivery that ultimately seals the deal here, especially on that devastating yet beautiful chorus.\n\n“Crack-Up” is Fleet Foxes’ first album since “Helplessness Blues” hit the streets in 2011.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/05/09"}]}

The determination will be for one quarter.\n\nStudents who test positive for COVID-19 will be required to do virtual leaning until it is safe to return.\n\nStudents must wear masks when in school. Masks can only be removed for eating and some limited physical activities. Students also need to do self-health check every 24 hours.\n\nBrown Deer School District\n\nFamilies in Brown Deer will choose between a full virtual learning option or a five-phase gradual return to face-to-face learning.\n\nThe first day of school will be Sept. 1 and all students K4-12 will start learning virtually from home. On Sept. 21, which is Phase 2, students in grades K4-5, 6 and 9 will return to school two days a week and learn virtually three days a week, while students in grades 7, 8 and 10-12 will continue with all virtual learning. The plan further details three more phases to return more students to school and for more days, which will depend on the state of the coronavirus in the community.\n\nMore details of the plan can be found on the Brown Deer School District website.\n\nCedarburg School District\n\nStarting Sept. 8, students will have the option of either attending school in-person five days a week or virtual learning five days a week from home, the district's updated re-opening plan says.\n\nThe district plans to have a Monday through Friday schedule with the primary mode of instruction taking place at school with social distancing measures. The updated plan was presented at the Cedarburg School Board's July 29 meeting. .\n\nStaff and students will be required to wear masks when indoors and/or when social distancing can't be maintained. The Cedarburg School Board voted 5-1 to require masks for everyone after a petition was started by Cedarburg High School students. It had 1,462 signatures.\n\nStaff and students are also expected to monitor for any respiratory symptoms such as cough and shortness of breath, new loss or taste of smell every morning and throughout the day. These are common symptoms of COVID-19. If students are experiencing any symptoms, they should stay home from school. Signs encouraging hand washing and sanitizing, as well as hand washing/sanitizing stations, will be within schools.\n\nThe window to select either the in-person or virtual learning option begins July 31 and runs through Aug. 7. The board is planning to have a final plan approved Aug. 19.\n\nCudahy School District\n\nThe Cudahy School Board approved a plan July 27 providing families with two options: an in-person learning model with remote/blended learning as needed to maintain safety measures, as well as a full-time, virtual learning model.\n\nThe in-person model would see elementary and middle school students attend school four days a week Monday through Thursday. Students would do independent learning activities at home on Friday, which would also be used as a day to clean all school buildings. Cudahy High School students will attend school in-person two days a week and virtually two days a week. Students whose last names begin with A-L will attend school in-person on Monday and Tuesday and students whose last names begin with M-Z will attend on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nFor more information on the plan, visit www.cudahysd.org/district/ReOpening.cfm.\n\nElmbrook School District\n\nThe district's reopening plan will include a return to full, in-person instruction five days a week, the Elmbrook School Board decided in a narrow 4-3 vote Aug. 11.\n\nThe district will open the first week of school Sept. 1-4 in a soft start mode to learn safety protocols and risk mitigation procedures for in-person instruction and transition to five-days-a-week in-person and virtual instructional models beginning Sept. 8.\n\nParents and staff will receive surveys asking them to declare their learning model preference, in-person or virtual. Staff will have until Aug. 14 and parents will have until Aug. 16 to decide.\n\nMore information can be found at www.elmbrookschools.org/community/learninghub.\n\nFox-Point Bayside School District\n\nThe Fox Point-Bayside School Board approved on July 28 a hybrid model to reopen its schools.\n\nThe main model, according to a letter from Superintendent Jeff Dellutri, is an A/B day cohort model with students in the first half of the alphabet (keeping households together) attending in-person Monday and Wednesday, and for virtual instruction Tuesday and Thursday and unstructured learning Friday. Students in the second half of the alphabet (also keeping households together) will attend in-person Tuesday and Thursday while having virtual instruction Monday and Wednesday and unstructured learning Friday. The only difference from the A/B cohort model schedule is that K4 and K5 students will attend four days per week, Monday through Thursday, with unstructured learning Friday.\n\nAny student can opt out of the A/B day cohort model and attend the virtual only model, every day, Mondays through Thursdays with unstructured learning Fridays.\n\nThe district is also requiring masks to be worn by all students, staff and school visitors on all district property to start the school year.\n\nFranklin Public Schools\n\nThe district plans to return to in-person instruction five days a week this fall and follow its regular schedule for student attendance. Students with medical conditions or students who live with a family member with a medical condition that could be at risk due to COVID-19 are eligible for virtual learning at home.\n\nA majority of parents supported a full and consistent five-day-a-week return to school over a schedule that mixes virtual and in-person instruction, according to a report on a survey.\n\nUniversal precautions will focus on modified movement patterns, protocols for hand washing/sanitizing and personal protective equipment. Staff are required to wear masks or face shields when they come within 6 feet of someone with additional protocols for where and when they can be removed. Students are required to wear masks during portions of the day, including passing times, entry/exit into the building and other high traffic areas. Additional student mask wearing protocols will be developed closer to the start of school.\n\nGermantown School District\n\nThe district will have both a face-to-face classroom experience and virtual option for students. The plan is still being finalized. A survey will be sent to all parents on which option they prefer.\n\nGlendale-River Hills School District\n\nThe district will start the school year virtually. A plan is being developed to phase students into on-campus learning.\n\nGrafton School District\n\nStudents will return to school for face-to-face instruction, with health measures, with a virtual learning option available.\n\nThe district also changed the wording of its policy on masks from \"students will wear face coverings\" to \"students must wear face coverings,\" but gave staff discretion as to when to require students to wear face masks.\n\nSpecifically, students will wear masks when its not feasible to social distance indoors, while riding the school bus, when arriving at school and classrooms and during dismissal while walking from classrooms to outdoors, if exhibiting symptoms of illness (including fever, chills and loss of taste). Staff members are required to wear face masks while moving through the schools and in classrooms or outdoors when social distancing is not feasible.\n\nElementary students, whether attending virtually or in person, will be assigned a homeroom teacher. Virtual learners will take their reading, writing and math classes live and will do other classes, such as science and social studies, on their own time. At school, physical education classes will be held either outdoors or in gyms with more space.\n\nSecondary students who are doing the virtual learning option will also take their classes live and will follow the schedule consistent with in-person learning. Virtual students may be assigned alternative activities based on the specific material needs to complete in-person tasks. The experience of performance-related courses such as automotives, culinary, music, STEM and art may be significantly different in the virtual setting.\n\nGreendale School District\n\nGreendale Schools is offering families a choice of in-person or fully digital learning when school resumes Sept. 1, according to its reopening plan, which can be found here.\n\nFor elementary school students, in-person learning will be four days a week in-person, with Wednesdays being a digital learning day for 'specials classes' and a deep-cleaning of the school buildings, according to Kitty Goyette, communications director for Greendale Schools.\n\nFor middle and high school students, students who are enrolled for in-person learning will be divided into groups, so appropriate social distancing can occur. Those groups will meet in-person two days a week, with digital learning planned for the other three days, and Wednesday being designated for deep cleaning.\n\nAt all levels, students learning in-person will be placed in learning groups of approximately 15 students in a regular classroom to allow for physical distancing, Goyette said.\n\nStudents who are enrolled in digital learning will be assigned to a fully digital class from 8:45 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. each day.\n\nThe health guidelines for the district can be found here.\n\nGreenfield School District\n\nGreenfield will begin with an all virtual setting at all grade levels, with a gradual phase-in to in-person learning beginning with elementary students, followed by middle school, and then high school, according to a school board document.\n\nThe start date for the year will also move back a week to Sept. 8.\n\n\"The virtual learning environment will be significantly different from what students experienced this spring during the time of emergency remote learning and all learning will be facilitated by School District of Greenfield teachers, using the district’s curriculum,\" the document said.\n\nThe board will meet on Sept. 28 to plan when to phase back to in-person classes.\n\nParents can also choose to send their children to school virtually for the entire fall semester if:\n\ntheir child/children has a documented, underlying health condition that will require them to learn virtually.\n\nthey are not comfortable sending their child/children to school.\n\nHamilton School District\n\nFamilies will be given a choice between traditional in-person or virtual online instruction. District officials are asking families to make a selection during online registration Aug. 3-10.\n\nDuring the traditional classroom setting, students will attend classes five days a week, but with many safety measures to improve social distancing and prevent the spread of COVID-19.\n\nClassrooms will look different to provide social distancing, masks will be required and the use of common supplies and equipment will be minimized. If schools are closed because of the coronavirus, students will learn at home until it is safe to return to school.\n\nIf there is an extended school closure, school will be in session five days a week with teachers posting new instruction virtually Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday. Wednesday will be set aside for reteaching, class meetings, small groups, one-on-ones, feedback and check ins.\n\nDuring virtual learning, students will work with peers and teachers online and also independent offline. Lessons will be scheduled each day to include a whole class, small group and individual activities.\n\nStudents who choose a virtual option will be able to return to an in-person model at the semester.\n\nHartland Lakeside School District\n\nParents will have the option to chose between in-person, blended and virtual learning options, according to a reopening plan.\n\nFor those who choose in-person, students will attend class five days a week. The blended option includes two days a week in person, and three days virtual. The virtual option includes five days a week virtual learning.\n\nThe first day of school for students is Sept. 1.\n\nParents who choose the in-person option will need to perform a daily health check, according district guidelines. Students who attend virtually will be expected to also interact with the classroom.\n\nThe school year will start with a \"soft start,\" as students will be divided into two groups to attend the first week of school on two separate days.\n\n\"A soft start will allow teachers to meet with smaller groups of students as they acclimate them to the new routines and transition them back to school,\" according to the reopening plan.\n\nKettle Moraine School District\n\nThe district plans to start the school year with face-to-face instruction that includes health measures while allowing students at all grade levels the option to continue virtual learning.\n\nStudents returning to school for in-person instruction will have education on hand-washing, covering coughs, physical distancing and more directed movement.\n\nThe district will provide masks and face shields in its facilities. Plexiglas \"sneeze shields\" will also be installed in high-traffic areas such as office spaces and health rooms. Cleaning will be increased and drinking fountains will be turned off. Only bottle-fill stations will be used. Use of cubbies, lockers and locker rooms will be eliminated or modified. Arrival, dismissal and passing times will also be staggered. No field trips or visitors will be allowed. Students and staff are also expected to screen themselves at home for symptoms.\n\nIsolation rooms will also be set up for students and staff who are symptomatic at school to stay in until they're allowed to go home. People in contact with someone who tests positive for COVID-19 will be quarantined for 14 days to mitigate the spread. Students who repeatedly disregard safety protocols will be assigned alternate learning environments and could face other repercussions.\n\nElementary students will be kept with their homeroom class all day, including recess and lunch. Art, music and physical education classes will be held on a weekly rotation.\n\nLake Country School District\n\nStudents have three options: in-person, hybrid -and virtual access to the regular classrooms live feed of instruction, discussion and peer group virtual interaction from home. In-person instruction will be five days a week. Students can change their preference of in-person or virtual at any time.\n\nMore information will be on the district's website at www.lcs.k12.wi.us.\n\nMaple Dale-Indian Hill School District\n\nSchools will reopen on Sept. 1 with a hybrid model that combines in-person learning two days per week and virtual learning three days per week.\n\nOne group of students will attend in-person on Mondays and Tuesdays, and another group of students will attend in-person on Thursdays and Fridays. Both groups will attend virtually on Wednesdays.\n\nThe district is tentatively planning to resume five-day, in-person learning on Oct. 5. The district will also allow a virtual option for families.\n\nMenomonee Falls School District\n\nThe Menomonee Falls School Board approved a plan July 27 to offer two choices to students and their families.\n\nThe first choice is instruction that could move between three models — in-person, hybrid or virtual — using a decision matrix of health indicators and attendance. No parent action is required.\n\nThe second choice is a fully-virtual learning model for a one-semester commitment. Registration was required before Aug. 3.\n\nMore information about the instructional models can be found here.\n\nMequon-Thiensville School District\n\nThe district has decided to start the school year with virtual learning after previously deciding to start in-person.\n\nIn a letter to district parents, district superintendent Matthew Joynt said the Mequon-Thiensville School Board voted Aug. 17 to start the year virtually due to the current state of COVID-19 spread in the Mequon-Thiensville zip codes.\n\nJoynt said the district's goal remains to return to on campus instruction for the 2020-21 school year as soon as possible, saying the district will continue to provide updates on its website.\n\nMerton School District\n\nThe district will discuss and vote on its reopening plan at its Aug. 3 school board meeting.\n\nAt this time, the district is continuing to plan its schools around the idea of Waukesha County's “Stay Safe to Stay Open.” The district will comply will all state mandates such as the mandatory mask mandate.\n\nThe district will have as much social distancing as possible, restructure staff and student movement throughout the day before and after school, new hand washing, sanitizing and cleaning practices throughout the district and develop instructional methods and practices to maintain distance between students and staff.\n\nMilwaukee Public Schools\n\nStudents will begin the year online and return to the classroom in phases when the coronavirus has subsided.\n\nThe Milwaukee Public Schools board approved the $90 million plan July 16.\n\nThe school year will begin on virtual platforms on Aug. 17 or Sept. 1, depending on their school calendar. The online phase is projected to last 30 to 45 days, after which students would alternate two days in school and three online at home, and then fully return to classes once that was deemed safe.\n\nMukwonago Area School District\n\nAs of July 27, when the school board affirmed its approach with coronavirus mitigation measures, Mukwonago schools plan to open to face-to-face, five-day-per-week in-person learning on Sept. 1.\n\n\"While we will seek a traditional reopening to the greatest extent possible, clearly there will be mitigation measures in place to ensure the safety of our students, staff, and community,\" the district said on its website.\n\nThe district will, however, offer a virtual learning option for concerned parents. The website includes links to a slideshow presentation of that option for 5-year-old kindergarten through sixth grade and another for grades 7 to 12. A form for virtual learning options is also accessible from the website.\n\nAs for the mitigation plans, the district, noting its actions will be based on CDC guidelines, includes detailed links of what will be involved to keep school buildings relatively safe.\n\nIt's all covered in the pandemic information portion of the district website.\n\nMuskego-Norway School District\n\nAll schools will allow students to return virtually or in-person this fall using a three-tiered plan, the Muskego-Norway School Board decided July 13.\n\nEnrollment applications were made available to parents through a survey July 20. Students will automatically be enrolled in the district’s in-person program unless a virtual learning application has been submitted.\n\nPrecautions being taken at schools for the return of in-person learning include: provided thermometers and face masks, isolation rooms for individuals with COVID symptoms, fresh air intake, sneeze guards where distancing is limited, outdoor learning areas, virtual field trips, staggered entry and exit points and more.\n\nParents must reserve bus service, as the district is planning to reduce ridership. Students will be assigned seats and must wear face masks. The bus windows will remain open within reason, and a ventilation system will help to circulate the air.\n\nTier 1 of the plan offers families in-person and remote options. The start of the school year will be used to teach and practice distancing protocols. Face coverings will be provided for students and staff.\n\nTier 2 — which would begin if coronavirus concerns increase — would see elementary and middle school students attend in-person classes in small groups using virtual instruction. High school students would alternate weekly between in-person and virtual instruction.\n\nTier 3 would have all students learning from home.\n\nAccording to the district’s survey data, 82% of parents and 79% of staff prefer in-person learning.\n\nNew Berlin School District\n\nThe New Berlin School Board approved in-person learning five days a week with a virtual learning option available for the first semester during an administration and re-entry task force presentation July 20.\n\nThe district will require staff to wear face masks; however, students are only encouraged to wear them, according to the district’s presentation draft. Administrators will consider mandatory mask wearing for students in grades four through 12 based on guidance from health officials.\n\nSafety recommendations made during the presentation include: open classroom doors, assigned bus seats, encouraged distancing during recess, designated lunchtime eating areas with grab-and-go school-provided meals, signs to remind students not to share supplies and more.\n\nA hybrid learning model will be considered if health concerns become heightened. This method would assign students to two groups, with one group learning in person Mondays and Tuesdays and the other on Thursdays and Fridays. All students would learn virtually on Wednesdays while the building is deep-cleaned.\n\nFamilies will receive a survey July 27 that includes virtual and in-person enrollment options for fall. According to a school district family survey with 3,055 responses, in-person learning was preferred by 63.5% of elementary respondents and 56% of secondary respondents.\n\nNicolet Union High School District\n\nThe Nicolet School Board voted July 27 to start the school year with remote learning with the goal of eventually progressing to phase three, an in-person model, when health and safety allow for it.\n\nDuring the remote model, all classes will have an expectation to engage in both real-time, face-to-face or recorded or self-paced, learning activities. Students will have set learning expectations and regular daily attendance, grades, work and assessments will all be tracked.\n\nIn phase two, students split time between in-school and remote learning. Students would be divided into two groups, A and B, attending school on A and B days. Half the district's students would attend in-person classes in the morning on A days, while the other half — the B group — would learn remotely. The roles would flip on B days and the B group would attend in-person classes in the morning and the A group would learn remotely. All students would learn remotely in the afternoon every day. A remote-only learning option will be available for families who do not feel comfortable having their children return to school.\n\nDuring phase three, all students spend their time in the school building and resume a mostly normal school day schedule. This would involve enhanced cleaning protocols, adjustments to how students enter and exit buildings and changes to lunch services. A remote-only learning option will also be available during this phase.\n\nNorth Lake School District\n\nThe school will reopen for students for in-person instruction five days a week beginning Sept. 1.\n\nDesks and tables will be positioned 3 to 6 feet apart to provide protection for staff and students, according to the district's website.\n\nThe district will also have yellow tape in the building to ensure two-lane traffic in the hallways.\n\nThe district is also allowing virtual learning for special circumstances.\n\nOak Creek-Franklin School District\n\nAfter originally deciding to return in-person five days a week, the Oak Creek-Franklin School Board has decided to start the year remotely and implement phases for returning face-to-face due to current COVID-19 rates in the community.\n\nIn a letter to parents on the district's website, the district said its teachers will provide a daily schedule with instructional time, office hours for students and parents, synchronous (live) and asynchronous (non-live) instruction with specified minutes and implement grade level learning requirements for remote learning. Live lessons will be recorded for students to review if they are not able to attend the synchronous lesson. Asynchronous instruction will consist of recorded instruction with learning activities to be completed and submitted to teachers. Student engagement and completion of assignments will be part of a student's attendance.\n\nThe district said it considers attendance an important measure of student engagement and a predictor of student success. Students will be considered absent if they do not attend the synchronous lessons or complete assignments or asynchronous assignments. Staff will follow-up with absent students.\n\nMore information is available on the district website.\n\nOconomowoc Area School District\n\nThe Oconomowoc School Board voted 5-2 Aug. 4 to start the school year with a cohort model at the elementary level and an every other day, split attendance model called the Purple and Gold Model at the intermediate and high school levels, with the board revisiting this decision every two weeks when school is started after a review of local health conditions and school level health data with input from the district's medical advisory committee.\n\nThe elementary level plan will see a group of students assigned to one primary teacher. The students will remain as static as possible throughout the day. Specials staff will rotate into the primary classroom of the cohort unless a classroom or learning space is deemed safe for use (i.e. outdoor learning space, multi-purpose room, gymnasium).\n\nThe intermediate level plan will see students divided into two groups, Purple and Gold, based on their last name. Students with last names starting with A through K will be in the Purple Group while those with last names L through Z will be in the Gold Group. Students will attend school for a full school day on their designated group day at school. On the opposite day when an intermediate student is not at school and is working virtually, he or she will take part in both synchronous, or live, experiences and asynchronous, or non-live, learning experiences.\n\nThe high school level plan also sees students divided into two groups, Purple and Gold, based on their last names. Students with last names A through K will be in the Purple Group and students with last names L through Z will be in the Gold Group. Students will attend school for a full school day on their designated group day and then virtually on their assigned group day for that model. Some days will be College, Career and Life Readiness Days in which specific grade levels report to campus for Career, College and Life Readiness activities.\n\nMore information about the elementary level plan can be found here; the intermediate plan here and the high school plan here.\n\nPalmyra-Eagle School District\n\nAs of early August, PEASD has chosen to hold classes five days a week in-person once school begins, though there will be a virtual option available \"for those who are not ready to send their students yet,\" said Caitlin Kirchner, the district's public relations coordinator.\n\nIt will be an unusually tidy atmosphere that students find at school, with some outdoor classes to give students a break from mask-wearing.\n\n\"We are requiring masks by all, and upping our sanitation and cleaning practices,\" Kirchner said. \"We hope to implement lots of outdoor learning to ease the mask requirements as we do have plenty of land for everyone to spread out safely. Our plans are to make it as safe as possible, and feel we have an advantage with our smaller class sizes.\n\nPewaukee School District\n\nPewaukee has developed two models, giving parents the option of either enrolling their children in an all-virtual program for nine-week increments or allowing them to begin under a hybrid model that district officials have called a \"soft-open.\"\n\nThe plan, spelled out in a 28-page document on the district's website, describes the in-person hybrid model in which students attend school partly in a virtual setting and partly in-person, progressing through a series of three phases ending in full daily attendance.\n\n\"The reason for the 'soft-open' approach is we will have an extensive plan of procedures, protocols and alterations to our practices that will take some time for staff and students to learn, apply and refine,\" Superintendent Mike Cady said. \"This is far more manageable with smaller numbers of students on campus at any one time. Furthermore, fewer students allows much greater flexibility to employ social distancing and other virus mitigation strategies.\"\n\nThe first phase would involve half the students getting face-to-face instruction on Monday and Tuesday, virtual learning on Thursday and Friday, while the other half would learn their lessons on the opposite schedule. Wednesday would be fully virtual for all students during the first phase, allowing for what district officials call a \"deep cleaning\" of school buildings.\n\nDuring the second phase, in-person learning would take place every day but Wednesday.\n\nThe all-virtual option would require nine-week commitments. The plan also has provisions for emergency remote learning.\n\nPort Washington-Saukville School District\n\nStudents in the Port Washington-Saukville School District will be phased into the classroom through a four-step system.\n\nEach phase is dependent on local health conditions. The school district will work with stakeholders to decide when the district should advance to the next phase.\n\nThe district will start with full-time virtual learning. In the second phase, one group of students will attend in-person class on Mondays and Tuesdays, and another group of students will attend in person on Thursdays and Fridays. Both groups will attend virtually on Wednesdays.\n\nThe third phase will bring students back to the classroom four days per week, with a virtual learning option for students who are unable to attend in-person instruction.\n\nThe fourth phase of the plan will bring students back to school for full-time, in-person instruction five days per week.\n\nStudents will be given the opportunity to temporarily remove their masks when the staff determines it can be done so safely.\n\nStudents who refuse to wear a mask when asked will be referred to virtual education and will need to wait until the start of the next semester to apply for in-person learning.\n\nRichmond School District\n\nStudents in the Richmond School District can choose virtual or in-person learning. If it is done virtually, they will be in that environment for a trimester.\n\nMasks will be required and sanitizing stations upon entering and existing buildings will be utilized for in-person instruction. Only one grade will be in the cafeteria at lunch with social distancing and sanitizing before and after lunch. Large indoor and outdoor spaces will be used for learning to increase social distancing.\n\nVirtual instruction will be assigned if a child tests positive for COVID-19 as well as if someone in the same household does or if someone has been in close contact with someone who tests positive for COVID-19.\n\nShorewood School District\n\nStudents will start the school year with a virtual+ learning model, the Shorewood School Board unanimously approved July 28.\n\nThe first day of school will be Sept. 8, and the virtual+ learning model will be in effect at least through Nov. 6, when the district will reassess using gating criteria, a news release from the district said.\n\nThe virtual+ learning model will provide live video classes in which students will have structured schedules to attend live classes with teachers, along with time for teachers and students to check in on any questions and concerns.\n\nThere will also be scheduled in-person access to school buildings and staff for small group and individual education, therapy and counseling services. Masks, social distancing and cleaning of indoor spaces between uses will be required when students and staff are on campuses.\n\nThere will also be limited student supervision at school for families who cannot be home during daytime virtual learning hours. Due to the district's limited capacity, the service is only for students and families who have no other options for child supervision during the school day.\n\nSouth Milwaukee School District\n\nStudents will start the first six weeks of school learning remotely, the school board approved Aug. 5.\n\nAn update will be provided by the board by Sept. 25.\n\nThe fall virtual learning program differs from the spring program. New remote teaching additions include: daily assignments, scheduled live classes, monitored attendance and engagement, required classwork and more.\n\nMeetings with parents, students and teachers will also be virtual through “launchpad meetings” for elementary families between Sept. 1-11, and morning meetings/closing circles for teachers and students at the start and end of each school day.\n\nVirtual plan schedules for elementary and high school students can be seen on pages 13 and 26, respectively, of the South Milwaukee School District’s presentation.\n\nSt. Francis School District\n\nThe St. Francis School District will start the school year virtually with a reassessment date of Sept. 15, according to Mark Elworthy, superintendent of the St. Francis School District.\n\nHowever, for anyone on school property now, all individuals must wear face coverings unless the person is alone in a private office.\n\nStudents will use the educational platforms SeeSaw (K4-3) and Schoology (4-12). These platforms will provide a conferencing solution that will be used by teachers, the district says.\n\nIf in-person instruction resumes, the district is asking families to self-screen their symptoms every day before attending school.\n\nStone Bank School\n\nThough the details are far from final as of Aug. 1, Stone Bank School in Oconomowoc has told parents in a letter that it plans on offering a mix of face-to-face, blended and virtual learning once the school year begins.\n\nAccording to the letter by Superintendent Ryan Krohn, those plans will be finalized in the weeks ahead, following an Aug. 17 school board meeting. A survey that will be sent to parents on Aug. 18 will also help the district finalize its plans.\n\nThe survey will query what options parents prefer and what safety precautions matter most for each student in their households.\n\nKrohn acknowledged the situation is somewhat fluid, for now.\n\nEither way, any in-person instruction will involve a mix of face mask requirements, social distancing and hand sanitation initiatives based on guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Waukesha County Public Health Department, Krohn said in the letter.\n\nVirtual and blended-learning plans are in the works as well, though very little information was available as of early August.\n\nSwallow School District\n\nAccording to Superintendent Melissa Thompson, the school board's goal remains to reopen Swallow School for face-to-face instruction five days per week, but \"with the understanding that a flexible virtual option will likely be needed for some students all of the time, and a fully virtual option may be needed for all students some of the time.\"\n\nThe Hartland school will use strategies set forth by the Waukesha County Health Public Department and CDC.\n\nWaukesha School District\n\nOn Aug. 12, the school board opted for a hybrid model for middle and high school students, who will attend classes virtually on Monday and alternate between in-person and virtual learning Tuesday through Friday.\n\nFor elementary school grades, students will learn in-person all week, with the district allowing parents to opt for all-virtual learning to alleviate their concerns.\n\nIn a 5-4 vote, the board opted for those details and opted not to adapt a phased-in opening plan that would have began with virtual learning and slowly worked learning plans back to daily in-person classroom settings.\n\nEven with face-to-face learning, the scene won't be quite like the traditional classroom setting. According to a chart previously explaining the options facing parents, it would involve virus mitigation efforts, including required face coverings for both teachers and students, social distancing and temperatures checks of each student, and plenty of hand sanitizing.\n\nWauwatosa School District\n\nThe Wauwatosa School Board voted 6-1 on July 27 to start the school year with two options: a phased, in-person option and a virtual learning option.\n\nThe first phase will see staff get used to the learning environment and safety procedures. Phase two will see students get used to the learning environment and safety procedures and include student and staff cohorts. Student cohorts would attend school two days a week. Phase three is the first full week of school, and it involves a hybrid model. Phase four involves ongoing learning. Options available depending on a medical/public health advisory panel's standards and metrics include classroom learning, which would see a five-day, in-person instruction model; a hybrid model in which students learn at school two days per week and learn virtually from home three days per week, and a virtual learning option in which students do online learning from home four days a week.\n\nStudents and staff will be required to wear masks, which will be provided to those who don't have one. Breaks and other strategies such as contests and games will be incorporated to help the transition at the lower levels. Other health measures include the installation of extra hand-washing and sanitation stations, improving air circulation and quality, increased cleaning and sanitizing of school buildings, student and family self-screening for symptoms and social distancing measures such as furniture reconfiguration in classrooms.\n\nWest Allis-West Milwaukee School District\n\nStudents will return to school Sept. 8 in an all virtual learning format, the West Allis-West Milwaukee School Board on July 27 decided.\n\nThen, depending on health metrics, the district plans to move to distance learning, with two days per week in school and finally in-person learning, which would be five days per week for elementary students and four days per week for secondary students, a district news release said.\n\nParents are asked to select a specific option for their children so the district can plan for once it moves past being all virtual.\n\nStudents and staff will be required to wear masks in schools or on buses when social distancing isn't possible. The district has the inventory to provide each staff member and student with two masks and will provide clear face shields for students and teachers when educationally necessary.\n\nWhitefish Bay School District\n\nWhitefish Bay students will resume school with a hybrid model that combines in-person learning two days per week and virtual learning for three days per week. The district will also allow a full virtual option for families.\n\nStudents with last names starting with A through L will attend school in-person on Monday and Tuesday, and the remainder of the students will attend school in-person on Thursday and Friday. Both groups of students will attend virtually on Wednesday.\n\nThe school district plans to use the hybrid model until the end of the first quarter, at which point the school board will determine whether a change in format is appropriate.\n\nClassrooms will be limited to 13 desks to provide enough space for physical distancing. Face coverings will be required for everyone inside the buildings, except students who need medical exceptions.\n\nVisitors will be limited those deemed as essential. Meetings will be held virtually when possible.\n\nThe full plan is available on the district website.\n\nWhitnall School District\n\nThe Whitnall School Board voted Aug. 17 to approve its reopening plan of in-person learning with health measures, along with a virtual option for families who want it, a letter to parents said.\n\nDuring the first week of school Sept. 1-4, students, regardless of whether they chose the in-person or virtual learning option, will attend school one day that week. This will allow students to meet their teachers, access the new learning management system with teacher support and pick up their technology/supplies.\n\nAll students will attend school daily beginning Sept. 8.\n\nMore info can be found at www.whitnall.com/district/covid-19-response-.cfm.\n\n- Reporters Annysa Johnson, Jim Riccioli, Cathy Kozlowicz, Evan Casey and Jeff Rumage contributed to this report.\n\nContact Alec Johnson at (262) 875-9469 or alec.johnson@jrn.com.

The latest news is at the top.\n\nSymptoms of COVID-19 can include fever, cough and breathing trouble. Most develop only mild symptoms. But some people, usually those with other medical complications, develop more severe symptoms, including pneumonia, which can be fatal.\n\nTuesday, July 21, 2020\n\nDespite the COVID-19 pandemic, the financial outlook for the Burlington International Airport is stable, the airport announced Tuesday.\n\nMoody's Investors Service affirmed the airport's Baa2 credit rating with the stable outlook earlier this month. The rating, according to Moody's, means the airport's obligations are medium-grade and subject to moderate credit risk, but that it has a strong ability to repay short-term debt obligations.\n\n________________\n\nProperty taxes for Williston residents will be a bit higher than expected this year due to effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe pandemic delayed construction in the town, which impacted property values, the town stated in a news release. As a result, grand list increases were less than initially estimated.\n\nThe new rate is set to $0.2750, meaning that for every $100,000 in property value, municipal taxes will be $275, the town said. The deadline for the first property tax payment has been postponed from Aug. 15 until Sept 15. The other two deadlines will remain the same.\n\n________________\n\nMonday, July 20, 2020\n\nThree full-time staff were laid off at Colchester Parks and Recreation due to diminished demand for camps and recreation programs during the pandemic, Town Manager Aaron Frank announced last week.\n\n\"Please do what you can to help towards positive changes in COVID outcomes that will allow us to bring back these valuable programs and staff that help make Colchester a great place to live, work and play,\" Frank wrote in a newsletter.\n\nOn a more upbeat note, the town announced that rehabilitation work on the Colchester Causeway is moving along ahead of schedule. If the trend holds, the breathtaking walk/bike trail across a portion of Lake Champlain will re-open by early September.\n\n________________\n\nTen new cases of COVID-19 were reported to the state's health department Monday morning, bringing the cumulative state total to 1,360.\n\nThree people are currently hospitalized with the virus, the same number as yesterday.

July 16 The number of people tested displayed in the dashboard dropped by less than 300 people due to a new method being used that improves the quality of the demographic information about people tested and removes duplicates. The change also affects the numbers in the 'Total People Tested' graph and 'People Tested by Day' graph. A new map on the dashboard, 'Percent of Population Tested by County,' shows the percent of residents by county that have been tested.\"\n\n___________\n\nTakeaways from Gov. Scott's Friday news conference include the following:\n\nVermont's Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine gave an update on the Manchester situation (with 59 people who had positive antigen tests): 17 had PCR tests, \"which is recommended to confirm the positive antigen result.\" Of this group, two tested positive .\n\nSchool re-openings: Scott said he expects Vermont will use a hybrid model featuring remote and in-person learning. Dr. William Raszka with the UVM Health Network noted children seem less likely to transmit the virus that causes COVID-19. State Epidemiologist Dr. Patsy Kelso named strategies like: daily screenings; testing symptomatic people; contact tracing; using physical distancing and facial coverings.\n\n\n\n___________\n\nThe Fletcher Free Library announced updated services in a July 16 news release.\n\nThese include allowing scheduled computer time, \"brief visits to collect materials and receive library support\" and outdoor seating (\"when staffing allows\").\n\nThe library has a Kids' Open Air Hours service that will allow youth to pick and chat about books.\n\n\"Weather permitting, the FFL Youth Department will staff a table on the library lawn in front of the historic Carnegie building at 235 College Street on Saturdays from 10:30 am to 12:30 pm and Wednesdays from 1 to 3 pm,\" the news release stated. \"FFL requests that participants wear masks and maintain social distance.\"\n\nThe library also has mystery bags with youth books.\n\n\"The bags are available at Open Air Hours and at the front desk and the list of themes is on the Kids’ webpage at fletcherfree.org,\" the news release stated. \"There is no bag limit.\"\n\n___________\n\nThursday, July 16, 2020\n\nNine new cases of COVID-19 were reported to the Health Department.

Imposter fraud has been on the rise across the country, according to the labor department.\n\n\"Individuals may ask the Department’s call center representative to provide further information to identify themselves, or if they do not feel comfortable providing information to the representative, the claimant can call the trusted Claimant Assistance Line at 877-214-3332 and select ‘Identity Confirmation’ from the menu options to connect with a call center representative,\" the release states.\n\nThose who do not validate their identity when contacted may see a delay in payments.\n\n__________\n\nThe Burlington city building at 625 Pine St. is open for limited, in-person services.\n\nBurlington residents can do business with Public Works, Permitting & Inspections and Parks, Recreation & Waterfront Tuesday through Friday, 7 a.m. to 3 p.m.\n\nVisitors are required to wear masks, not to exceed four customers in the lobby and sign a log book.\n\n\"While the City still encourages the public to conduct as much business over the phone or internet as possible in the interest of public health, we also recognize the value of serving the public directly,\" the news release says.\n\nHow to contact (online, email and phone):\n\n__________\n\nTuesday, July 14, 2020\n\nGov. Phil Scott announced Tuesday that Vermont's Health Care Provider Stabilization Grant Program will launch on Friday, July 17. The program utilizes up to $275 million from the federal Coronavirus Relief Fund to provide direct cash grants to eligible health care and human service providers who have lost revenue or incurred increased expenses because of the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nThe Agency of Human Services and the Department of Vermont Health Access will host a webinar on Monday, July 20, to explain the grant application process, eligibility requirements and the documents providers should plan to submit when applying for a grant. Sign up here to receive an email when the application is open.\n\n_________\n\nFour new cases of COVID-19 were reported Tuesday morning by the Vermont Department of Health, bringing the cumulative total for the state to 1,305.\n\nTwo people were hospitalized with the virus — the same number as the previous day. Eight hospitalizations are under investigation. Deaths remain at 56.\n\nThe health department is reporting 1,099 Vermonters who have recovered from the disease, with a total of 77,624 people have been tested.\n\n_________\n\nA preliminary outbreak of COVID-19 cases in Windham County was announced by state officials Tuesday during Gov. Phil Scott's weekly news conference.\n\nOver 30 \"presumptively positive\" cases have been reported by Manchester Medical Center, said Health Commissioner Mark Levine, after the center's urgent care conducted a series of antigen tests to regional residents.\n\nThose that test positive on antigen tests, which differ from PCR tests, are \"not considered to be a lab-confirmed test\" said Levine. Antigen tests tend to not be included in Vermont's number of cases, and those that were either confirmed positive or \"false negatives\" would need to be tested by the Health Department.\n\nLevine stated that the Health Department has already set up a pop-up site in Londonderry for July 15, and he encouraged those that tested positive, as well as others in the region to attend it.\n\nIn regards to the outbreak, Mike Smith, secretary of the state's Agency of Human Services, cautioned Vermonters against failing to quarantine after traveling to \"hotspots\" outside of the state's designated safe areas. He further went on to recommend residents should not attend social events or gatherings following those trips where they know they are \"bound to have close contacts\" with other people.\n\n\"It is a pattern that I'm starting to get a little concerned about,\" said Smith.\n\n\"We all need to do our part. Risky behavior can lead to outbreaks.\"\n\nBoth Levine and Smith were hesitant to call it \"the Manchester outbreak\", citing that where people were getting tested did not reflect where they had contracted the virus.\n\n_________\n\nGov. Phil Scott announced Tuesday that he would be extending Vermont's state of emergency through August 15. The action will not roll back opening-up procedures, Scott said — but will provide a mechanism through which the administration can update guidelines as necessary.\n\n_________\n\nTwo statewide grant programs — aimed at providing relief to Vermont's dairy industry and health care system — were announced Tuesday.\n\nThe Vermont COVID-19 Agriculture Assistance Program will be offering a total of $25 million in federal funding to dairy producer and processors stating Friday, July 17.\n\nThose eligible include dairy farmers and processors who were operating as of March 1 and were subsequently impacted by the pandemic, either through income loss, additional expenses or market disruption of dairy prices.\n\nAn estimated 25 Vermont dairies have closed operations since March 1, according to Anson Tebbetts, secretary of the sate's Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets, during the governor's news conference. Prior to the pandemic, the state saw a loss of 1.5 farms per month.\n\n\"This has been a direct result of what happened when the markets went away for our dairy farmers,\" Tebbetts said.\n\nApplications are available via the Agency's website, and must be completed by Oct. 1.\n\n--------------\n\nThe Health Care Stabilization Grant Program is additionally set to launch this Friday, intended to give $275 million of financial assistance to Vermont health care providers.\n\nApplications must be completed by August 15, and will be evaluated and distributed based on \"demonstrated need\", as opposed to a first come, first serve basis.\n\nThe program is intended to cover a wide variety of providers, organizations and small-scale practices including health centers, dentists, mental health and substance abuse treatment providers, physical therapists, and emergency medical service providers.\n\n\"We want to continue to meet the needs of providers during and after this time of crisis,\" said Mike Smith, secretary of the state's Agency of Human Services. \"If providers are not certain if they are eligible, we want them to apply anyway.\"\n\nCash grants for the first round of this program will cover expenses between March 1 and June 15. The second round is expected to launch in October, and will cover between June 16 to Sept. 30.\n\n_________\n\nBurlington School District will host a series of town hall meetings this week, inviting community members to learn about and participate in the district's plans to reopen schools this fall.\n\nThe meetings will be conducted virtually via Zoom and split between two days to allow both families and staff the opportunity to ask questions and hear from school administrators about the reopening.\n\nThe town hall meeting for families will meet 7 p.m. on July 15, whereas a meeting for staff will be conducted the following day, at 7 p.m. on July 16.\n\n“This is a key moment in our planning process,\" said Tom Flanagan, the new superintendent for Burlington School District when began his tenure on July 1st.\n\n\"We need to hear from the community in order to finalize our plans and inform our families so they can start planning their lives.\"\n\nFor more information, those interested can visit the district's website via this link. The meeting will also be aired live through the district's YouTube and Facebook pages. Interpreters will be available to translate the meeting.\n\nMonday, July 13, 2020\n\nSix new cases of COVID-19 were reported Monday by the Vermont Department of Health, which brings the cumulative total for the state to 1,301.\n\nTwo people were hospitalized with the virus — the same number as the previous day.

There has not been a COVID-related death in Vermont since June 18.\n\nThe health department is reporting 1,096 Vermonters who have recovered from the disease.\n\n76,581 people have been tested for the virus.\n\nNOTE: The Free Press noticed the numbers regarding new and total case counts didn't align from July 11 to July 13 and subsequently reached out to the Health Department. Ben Truman with the department said in an email that this is why there is a notice that this data is preliminary. He provided an example: A person who tested positive might no longer get counted if it is learned that they don't live in Vermont.\n\n_________\n\nSunday, July 12, 2020\n\nFourteen new cases of COVID-19 were reported Sunday by the Vermont Department of Health, which brings the cumulative total for the state to 1,296.\n\nTwo people were hospitalized with the virus — the same number as the previous day. Fifteen hospitalizations are under investigation.\n\nDeaths remained the same at 56. There has not been a COVID-related death in Vermont since June 18.\n\nThe health department is reporting 1,089 Vermonters who have recovered from the disease.\n\n75,851 people have been tested for the virus.\n\n__________\n\nSaturday, July 11, 2020\n\nSix new cases of COVID-19 were reported Saturday by the Vermont Department of Health, which brings the cumulative total for the state to 1,283.\n\nTwo people were hospitalized with the virus — the same as yesterday. Sixteen hospitalizations are under investigation.\n\nDeaths remained the same at 56. There has not been a COVID-related death in Vermont since June 18.\n\nThe health department is reporting 1,066 Vermonters who have recovered from the disease.\n\n75,032 people have been tested for the virus.\n\nFriday, July 10, 2020\n\nThe Governor announced $30 million in housing assistance for those impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe money would be allocated Federal CARES Act funding: $25 million for renters and landlords and $5 million for homeowners behind on making payments. Those interested in receiving assistance can begin applying online starting Monday July 13 for the rental assistance program or mortgage assistance program.\n\nRenters' assistance money could be used for rent or security deposits as well as make up for landlord losses from the period starting March 1, 2020. Funding can be re-applied for and is given out on a first-come, first-served basis. Proof of payment delinquency will be required.\n\nThe mortgage assistance program prioritizes the lowest income, highest risk of foreclosure homeowners who have missed at least two payments. Homeowners could apply for up to three missed mortgage payments; funds will be paid directly to the mortgage lender.\n\n__________\n\nKinney Drugs and a Walgreens in Essex will soon begin COVID-19 testing at their pharmacies.\n\nGov. Phil Scott asked other local companies to join the effort. Health Commissioner Mark Levine said having testing locations at local pharmacies takes some of the burden off the health department so they can focus on outbreaks and vulnerable populations.\n\n___________\n\nFive new cases of COVID-19 were reported Friday by the Vermont Department of Health, which brings the cumulative total for the state to 1,277.\n\nTwo people were hospitalized with the virus — down one from yesterday. Nine hospitalizations are under investigation.\n\nDeaths remained the same at 56. There has not been a COVID-related death in Vermont since June 18.\n\nThe health department is reporting 1,066 Vermonters who have recovered from the disease.\n\n74,098 people have been tested for the virus.\n\n__________\n\nThe ECHO, Leahy Center for Lake Champlain will be regularly open starting July 10, Fridays through Mondays from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Timed tickets are required for two different time slots, 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. and 1 to 3 p.m.\n\n_________\n\nIn a news conference Friday afternoon, Burlington Mayor Miro Weinberger said Vermont is doing well combatting the coronavirus, but emphasized that we are only in the second inning of a nine inning game, using a baseball analogy to make the point that there’s a long way to go before the crisis is over.\n\nWeinberger echoed the same point made during the call by Dr. Stephen Leffler, president and chief operating officer of University of Vermont Medical Center, who said, “There’s a lot of coronavirus in front of us.” Leffler said he understands that people are fatigued by the effort to deal with the virus, but “we have to be in this for the long term.”\n\nLeffler used a different spots analogy, saying we just finished the first quarter of the effort to fight the disease.\n\n_________\n\nAirport Director Gene Richards also joined the mayor’s call to give an update on measures being taken Burlington International Airport against COVID-19. The airport has added thermal imaging that can pick up abnormally high body temperatures, indicating a fever, in groups of up to 20 people. Richards said if someone is “running warm” a red square shows up on her image rather than a green square.\n\nRichards explained that a person who possibly has a fever is notified and advised to check with a physician, but no further steps are taken. “We don’t want to get into people’s personal business at this point,” Richards said. “It’s very voluntary.”\n\nRichards said about 4,000 people are passing through the airport weekly, up from a low of 800 at the start of the pandemic. Normally, Burlington International Airport would be seeing as many as 17,000 people passing through weekly at this time of year, before the coronavirus struck the nation.\n\nThursday, July 9, 2020\n\nThe Vermont Cheesemakers Festival announced it is canceling the 12th annual event planned for Sunday, Aug. 9 at Shelburne Farms.\n\n\"We have been pondering what to do – postpone the festival, offer alternative events, etc. – and found is that there really is no alternative to the festival given the current conditions and our interest in keeping both our vendors’ and attendees’ safety prioritized,\" reads a note on the festival's website.\n\nThe Vermont Cheese Council, which plans the event, has had to focus in recent months \"trying to help cheesemakers keep their doors open, helping them find grant and other emergency funds, redirecting and identifying new sales strategies to try to make up for the 25-75% losses most of them have experienced, helping them navigate the changing regulations related to operating within our industry at this time, and marketing their products as widely as possible,\" according to the website.\n\n_________\n\nVermont Humanities and the Vermont Arts Council have wrapped up their Cultural Relief Grant Program that distributed nearly $750,000 in emergency relief grants to 122 Vermont cultural organizations, including museums, libraries, performing-arts venues and other cultural centers, the council announced in a news release.\n\nThe program, which concluded May 31, supported humanities and arts organizations struggling to survive through resulting economic fallout from the pandemic. The grants are for general operating expenses of $5,000 to $10,000 depending on organization size.\n\nThe program was seeded by more than $700,000 from the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act of 2020.\n\nThe Opera Company of Middlebury canceled its planned June production of Tchaikovkiy's \"Maid of Orleans,\" causing nearly 60 Vermont singers, musicians and staff members to go without a paycheck.\n\n“This grant supports our plan to produce an innovative, socially-distanced video production this fall, putting these talented people back to work, and bringing opera once again to the Vermont audience,” artistic director Douglas Anderson said in a news release.\n\n_________\n\nThe Shelburne Museum will re-open to the public July 30.\n\nFree admission will be offered to patrons visiting by September 6. Online ticket reservations will be required and can be can be obtained at shelburnemuseum.org.\n\nThe museum will be open four days a week — Thursday through Sunday — from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Occupancy limits will be imposed on both outdoor and indoor spaces.

The demographic with the largest growth in positive cases is people aged 18 to 44.\n\nLevine said the spikes in these states have been widely attributed to “a breakdown in the willingness of the public to adhere to the simple precepts of avoiding mass gatherings, hence an inability to physically distance; and to wear facial coverings.”\n\nResidents must still follow these guidelines despite the hot weather and Vermont’s success so far in lowering the number of new cases per day, Levine said. Guidelines also recommend regular hand-washing and staying home when sick.\n\n“We can’t lose track of the fact that the virus hasn’t gone anywhere,” Levine said.\n\n_____________\n\nAn inmate who was being brought into the Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility in South Burlington has tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nAgency of Human Services Secretary Mike Smith said officials believe the inmate had contact with some staff members and some other inmates before the test came back positive on Saturday. It is unclear whether the inmate was in contact with others in the general population. Health Department officials are conducting contact tracing.\n\nCorrections officials have been testing inmates for COVID-19 upon intake to facilities throughout the state, Smith said. All inmates and staff in the South Burlington prison will be tested.\n\nAnother inmate last week tested positive after being brought into the Marble Valley Regional Correctional Facility in Rutland. Smith said that testing over the weekend turned up no other positive cases at the facility. A second mass-test of the Rutland facility will be conducted next week.\n\nIn late May and early June, the Department of Corrections had tested all staff and inmates in its facilities and reported no new positive cases. An outbreak in March at the Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans Town was the only recorded spread of the virus in a Vermont prison.\n\n___________\n\nThe number of cases associated with an outbreak of COVID-19 in Winooski and Burlington has risen to 110, Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine said Monday.\n\nLevine said he believes health officials have been successful in identifying those who could have been affected to try to suppress the outbreak, but the outbreak will not be over until there is no new activity that can be connected back to those involved.\n\n“It’s so common to use the forest fire analogies these days, so I would use the term ‘smoldering,’” Levine said. He added, “We’re doing what we can to contain it, and we’re doing a great job actually, but the bottom line is, to say that it’s fully contained. It’s not quite there yet.”\n\nLevine gave the following breakdown of the cases associated with the Winooski outbreak:\n\nThe median age of those affected is 24.\n\n65% of the cases were adults, and 35% were children.\n\n30% of the 110 cases reported having COVID-19 symptoms.\n\n126 people have been contacted by contact tracers. 19 of those contacts have gone on to be positive cases.\n\n____________\n\nThe VNA & Hospice of the Southwest Region (VNAHSR) is re-opening its outpatient therapy clinic in Manchester, the health group reported Monday.\n\nAppointments physical and occupational therapy will be staggered to minimize coronavirus exposure to patients and staff, according to a news release.\n\nPatients who seek appointments are encouraged to contact their health providers, or call the clinic directly at (802) 362-6509.\n\n============\n\nSunday, June 21, 2020\n\nA dozen new cases of COVID-19 were reported Sunday by the Vermont Department of Health, bringing the total cases in Vermont to 1,159.

A month later, after 35 deaths, Scott ordered flags to be lowered on the eighteenth of every month until the end of the year.\n\nFifty-six people in Vermont have died from the disease; the most recent death was reported on June 18.\n\n____________\n\n============\n\nWednesday, June 17, 2020\n\nNo new cases have been reported in Vermont, which currently has 1,129 cases, according to the Vermont Department of Health's dashboard Wednesday.\n\nSo far, about 915 people have recovered from the virus and 53,663 people have been tested.\n\nOne person is in the hospital for COVID-19 and four are hospitalized under investigation.\n\nNo additional deaths have been reported — that total remains at 55, according to the data.\n\n_________\n\nThe Farmers To Families nutrition assistance program has been extended through August, Vermont's congressional delegation announced Wednesday.\n\nA pair of Vermont-based organizations, Willing Hands and the Abbey Group, secured contracts to continue the food box-delivery program for two more months, according to news release from Sen. Patrick Leahy, Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Peter Welch.\n\nThe program will bring an additional $8.5 million in aid from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to Vermont and the Upper Valley with New Hampshire, much of which will go toward buying produce and dairy from local farms, the news release stated.\n\nDetails on how to sign up to receive food boxes can be found on the Vermont Department of Emergency Management’s website: https://vem.vermont.gov.\n\n_________\n\nThe recent decline in new cases of COVID-19 after an oubreak in Winooski and Burlington's Old North End earlier this month is a positive sign, Burlington Mayor Miro Weinberger said during a press briefing Wednesday afternoon.\n\nParticularly for Burlington, Weinberger noted, the low number of new cases in the past week bodes well that an influx of college students moving in on June 1 didn't lead to an additional surge in cases.\n\n“If they were bringing the virus with them and infecting others I think we’d be seeing that now reflected in these numbers,\" Weinberger said.\n\nDr. Stephen Leffler, president of the UVM Medical Center, said he was \"sure there were asymptomatic people that came\" to Burlington during that time period but Vermont's efforts to curb the spread of the coronavirus — unlike other states —probably limited the impact.\n\n\"Vermont’s still really doing it right,\" Leffler said. \"People are in general all masking, we’re social distancing well. We’re being smart about how we open up our businesses.\n\n“There’s pretty good evidence now that shows each of us wearing a mask helps us prevent spread to someone else,\" he said. \"It’s a relatively small sacrifice that each of us can make and we can keep transmission down.\"\n\n_________\n\nAlso during Wednesday's briefing, Weinberger explained Burlington's plans to allocate resources to \"racial equity and police transformation” effforts.\n\nOn top of an immediate commitment of $300,000 to the city's Fund for Racial Equity and Police Transformation, paid for via cuts to the police department, Weinberger said he's confident similar savings could expand that amount closer to $1 million during the next fiscal year.\n\nAdditionally, the city has another $300,000 in small business relief and rental assistance that it will look into spending \"through the lens of racial justice,\" he said.\n\nAnd the city will explore using an anticipated $1 million in federal funds marked for community investment next year to serve anti-racism efforts, Weinberger said.\n\n“I think there’s some real opportunity looking at all these funds about how to make progress with racial justice,\" the mayor said.\n\n_________\n\nTuesday, June 16, 2020\n\nThe Working Lands Enterprise Board, affiliated with the Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food & Markets, has announced that 16 businesses will receive over $250,000 in COVID-19 Response Business Development Grants in agriculture and forestry. The awards will focus on business response, shifting marketing strategies, or other activities that may improve business recovery.\n\nOne grant recipient, The Royal Butcher of Braintree, intends to respond to the surge in demand for slaughter and meat processing. Current bottlenecks in processing will require urgent need to meet the local demand for this butcher’s services.\n\n“These dollars will allow us to expand our business while helping farmers who need our services during the pandemic,” Justin Sauerwein of The Royal Butcher said in a news release. The Royal Butcher, established in 2003, is a USDA inspected slaughterhouse and meat processor, attending to the needs of local livestock and dairy farms.\n\n_________\n\nThe New England Foundation for the Arts announced the launch of the New England Arts Resilience Fund, part of the nationwide United States Regional Arts Resilience Fund, an initiative of the U.S. Regional Arts Organizations and The Andrew W.

The Fund was created in response to the impact of COVID-19 on the nation’s arts infrastructure and will support New England nonprofit arts and cultural organizations with recovery and planning capital for a post-pandemic future.\n\nThe New England Arts Resilience Fund will provide approximately 50 non-matching grants, generally in the range of $10,000-$75,000, with potential for a small number of grants up to $100,000. The fund prioritizes organizations, communities, populations and art forms that have historically had less access to major financial resources for sustainability and seeks in particular to support organizations that are led by and deeply engage communities of color.\n\n_________\n\nTravelers looking to make a trip to Canada or Mexico will have to wait at least another month after the Department of Homeland Security extended border closures with both countries due to the coronavirus pandemic, USA Today reported.\n\nThe borders, including Vermont's border with Quebec, will remain closed to nonessential travel until July 21.\n\n\"Based on the success of the existing restrictions and the emergence of additional global COVID-19 hotspots, the Department will continue to limit non-essential travel at our land ports of entry with Canada and Mexico,\" Chad Wolf, acting Secretary of Homeland Security, said in a statement. \"This extension protects Americans while keeping essential trade and travel flowing as we reopen the American economy.\"\n\n“This is a decision that will protect people on both sides of the border as we continue to fight COVID-19,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said.\n\n_________\n\nVermont State Treasurer Beth Pearce announced the launch of the Municipal Emergency Statewide Education Property Tax Borrowing Program to assist municipalities as they manage their finances and cash-flow needs during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBased on eligibility, the program will cover interest incurred for short-term borrowing meant to manage the effects of statewide education property-tax delays as a direct result of COVID-19.

Tests with “real-time” results might conceivably be required for entrance to large sports or entertainment venues.\n\nThe “Sara Alert” app used by the Health Department is a tool for communication between Vermonters and the Department of Health – and is not a “tracking app” that reports the user’s location, Levine said. The state has no plans to implement detailed case-tracking software.\n\n_________\n\nUpcoming governor's news conference topics this week:\n\nWednesday: Long-term health facilities.\n\nFriday: Health guidance on K-12 school re-openings.\n\n============\n\nSunday, June 14, 2020\n\nTwo additional positive cases of COVID-19 were reported in Vermont on Saturday, bringing the pandemic total to 1,127, according to Vermont Department of Health data.\n\nAt the same time, 909 people have recovered from the virus and 50,982 people have been tested, the data showed.

Sauter\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nSchool district quality is one of the most important factors homebuyers consider when looking for a place to live – particularly for new or expecting parents. A good school district can greatly increase a child’s chances of future success.\n\nOf course, the influences that can shape a child’s future are not strictly limited to the classroom. Conditions in the home and the broader community also have an effect.\n\nUsing data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the National Center for Education Statistics, 24/7 Wall St. developed an index of measures, including the child poverty rate, the teacher-to-student ratio, per-pupil spending, the share of adults with a college education, and the high school graduation rate to determine the school district where students are most likely to succeed in every state. In our analysis, we also reviewed a number of measures of district outcomes, including college entrance exam performance and subject proficiency tests from education and community data clearing house, Niche. While favorable rankings in these measures will not alone ensure children's chances for success through their school years and into adulthood, they can provide them with considerable advantages.\n\nOne of the most important predictors of a child’s academic success is their poverty status. Children living below the poverty line are more likely to report poor physical health and have reduced ability to concentrate and retain information. Childhood poverty increases the likelihood of low test scores and reduces a student’s chances of completing high school. For this reason, the child poverty rate was selected as a component in the index. Here is a state-by-state look at the child poverty rate.\n\nIt is important to note that education policy is decided largely at the state level, and partially as a result, the difference in school district quality across a state can be lower than it is between states. A district that ranks as the best in a given state will not necessarily rank favorably among districts in other states. Here is a list of the states with the best and worst schools.\n\nInvesting:What's a bear market and why are stocks about to enter one?\n\nTesla milestone:Elon Musk congratulates electric vehicle manufacturer on making 1 million electric cars\n\n1. Alabama: Mountain Brook Schools\n\n• Location: Jefferson County\n\n• Annual per student spending: $13,303\n\n• Adults with a bachelor's degree: 85.1%\n\nAlabama's Mountain Brook School District, located just outside of Birmingham, educates over 4,000 students in grades K-12 in six different schools. While there is no direct link between school spending and outcomes, schools with greater financial resources can often offer students with a broader range of opportunities. Per pupil spending in the Mountain Brook district is over $13,000 per year, the most of any district in Alabama.\n\nChildren in the district are also less likely than most to be disadvantaged outside of the classroom. For example, the stresses associated with living in poverty can hurt academic performance, and in Mountain Brook, just 6.5% of school-age children live below the poverty line, well below the 17% U.S. child poverty rate.\n\n2. Alaska: Juneau School District\n\n• Location: Juneau City and Borough\n\n• Annual per student spending: $16,494\n\n• Adults with a bachelor's degree: 39.5%\n\nA child's academic performance tends to increase with parental educational attainment – and in the Juneau School District, parents are more likely to have a college education than parents nationwide. An estimated 39.5% of adults 25 and over in the district have a bachelor's degree, well above the 31.5% national rate.\n\nStudents in the Juneau district are also more likely to be enrolled in Advanced Placement classes than those in any other district in the state. Of the nearly 5,000 students in the district, 7.9% are enrolled in an AP class.\n\n3. Arizona: Catalina Foothills School District 16\n\n• Location: Pima County\n\n• Annual per student spending: $7,070\n\n• Adults with a bachelor's degree: 70.1%\n\nThe Catalina Foothills School District 16, located in the northern part of the Tucson metropolitan area, ranks as the best district in Arizona. The district has one of the most affluent populations in the country, as well as one of the most highly educated – approximately 70% of adults have a bachelor's degree. Students who grow up in an affluent household with college-educated parents are more likely to achieve academic success.\n\nThe school district's per student spending per year is lower than many of the school districts on this list, at just over $7,000 per pupil.\n\n4. Arkansas: Valley View Schools\n\n• Location: Craighead County\n\n• Annual per student spending: $8,692\n\n• Adults with a bachelor's degree: 45.3%\n\nValley View School District, located in northeastern Arkansas, enrolls about 3,000 students across four schools. The district's ranking on this list is due in large part to positive educational outcomes, as over 90% of high school freshman graduate in four years.\n\nThe greater likelihood of academic success in the district is partially due to factors outside the classroom. For example, children raised by college-educated parents are more likely than most to do well in school. Across Valley View District, 45.3% of adults have a bachelor's degree or higher, well above the comparable 31.5% share of adults nationwide.\n\n5. California: Palo Alto Unified School District\n\n• Location: Santa Clara County\n\n• Annual per student spending: $19,648\n\n• Adults with a bachelor's degree: 83.8%\n\nPublic school spending on a per student basis is nearly $20,000 per year in the Palo Alto School District. The high spending is due in part to high revenue from property taxes as Palo Alto is one of the wealthiest parts of the country with relatively expensive real estate.\n\nWhile high per student spending does not necessarily translate to positive outcomes, the district boasts a near perfect graduation rate. Additionally, over 95% of students who take one or more AP exams pass at least one.\n\n6. Colorado: Aspen School District\n\n• Location: Pitkin County\n\n• Annual per student spending: $16,820\n\n• Adults with a bachelor's degree: 69.4%\n\nAs a highly affluent school district, Colorado's Aspen School District 1 relies relatively little on state or federal revenue to fund its schools. In 2017, 83.8% of the district revenue came from local sources, close to double the average among districts nationwide of 45.8%.\n\nLiving in poverty can be a major obstacle for childhood development, and in the district, just 3.4% of children 5 to 17 live in poverty, a lower child poverty rate than the vast majority of school districts nationwide and well below the national child poverty rate of 17%.\n\n7. Connecticut: Darien Public School District\n\n• Location: Fairfield County\n\n• Annual per student spending: $21,648\n\n• Adults with a bachelor's degree: 81.3%\n\nDarien is one of the wealthiest school districts in the country, with a median annual household income of over $210,000. Likely partially as a result, per-pupil spending in the district of $21,648 exceeds the national per pupil spending average of $12,201.\n\nThe district ranks sixth out of 130 districts in the state in Niche's ranking of teacher quality. Darien High School, the only high school in the district, has an average SAT score of 1310 and an average ACT score of 30, well above average scores for high school students nationwide.\n\n8. Delaware: Appoquinimink School District\n\n• Location: New Castle County\n\n• Annual per student spending: $12,567\n\n• Adults with a bachelor's degree: 37.2%\n\nDelaware's Appoquinimink School District – which is located in the northern part of the state, approximately 20 miles south of Wilmington – ranks as the best in the state. The district's per student spending of $12,567 is in the middle of most of the districts on this list, although still slightly higher than the national per pupil spending figure of $12,201.\n\n9. Florida: St. Johns County School District\n\n• Location: St. Johns County\n\n• Annual per student spending: $8,331\n\n• Adults with a bachelor's degree: 43.7%\n\nThe St. Johns County School District is located along Florida's Atlantic coast and covers the city of St. Augustine. The school district's 88.6% graduation rate is the highest in the state and well above the 70.8% average graduation rate across all Florida school districts.\n\nChildren who grow up in financially stable households with college-educated parents are at a considerable advantage academically. In the St. Johns County School District, 43.7% of adults have a bachelor's degree, and just 6.5% of children live below the poverty line – compared to the 29.2% and 18.4% respective state averages.\n\nAcademic achievement:The best public high school in your state\n\nDegrees ahead:Boston, Seattle headline the cities with the most college graduates in every state\n\n10. Georgia: City Schools of Decatur\n\n• Location: DeKalb County\n\n• Annual per student spending: $11,657\n\n• Adults with a bachelor's degree: 72.5%\n\nGeorgia's Decatur school district spends $11,657 per student per year, well above the $10,205 statewide average. The greater school spending likely contributes to the smaller class sizes, as the district has about one teacher per 14.2 students – well below the one teacher per 15.2 students across Georgia.\n\nStudents in the Decatur District are far more likely to graduate high school than the typical student in Georgia. About 85.5% of high school students in Decatur graduate within four years, a far larger share than the 69.9% state average.\n\n11. Hawaii: Hawaii Public Schools\n\n• Location: Honolulu County\n\n• Annual per student spending: $14,322\n\n• Adults with a bachelor's degree: 32.5%\n\nHawaii is the only state to have a single school district manage every public school. Therefore, the district's ranking on this list is by default only. Still, by several measures, public school students in Hawaii have some advantages over students nationwide. For example, per student spending in the state is $14,322 compared to the national average of $12,201. Higher-spending districts often have smaller class sizes, and in Hawaii, the average student-teacher ratio of 15 to 1 is slightly lower than the 16.1 to 1 national average.\n\n12. Idaho: Moscow School District 281\n\n• Location: Latah County\n\n• Annual per student spending: $9,970\n\n• Adults with a bachelor's degree: 55.3%\n\nIdaho's Moscow School District 281 enrolls about 2,400 students in part of the northwestern section of the state. High school students in the district are more likely to be enrolled in an AP course than the typical high schooler in Idaho. Some 24% of high schoolers are taking an AP class compared to 17.4% of high school students across the state.\n\nChildren of college-educated parents are more likely to be academically successful than children of parents who never went to college. Across the Moscow School District, 55.3% of adults have a bachelor's degree, well above the 26.9% share of adults across the state as a whole.\n\n13. Illinois: Indian Prairie School District 204\n\n• Location: DuPage County\n\n• Annual per student spending: $15,738\n\n• Adults with a bachelor's degree: 63.4%\n\nCompared to most of the districts on this list, Indian Prairie Community Unit School District in Illinois is relatively large, with over 28,000 students and 33 operational schools in total. The district serves wealthy Chicago suburbs such as Naperville.\n\nStudent achievement is quite high in the large district, with Niche reporting an average SAT score across district students of 1300 and an average ACT score of 29, both well above the national averages. An estimated 37.1% of high school students in the district take at least one AP course, well above the 21.5% of high school students nationwide. Teachers are also well-compensated, with the average teacher earning over $70,000.\n\n14. Indiana: Zionsville Community Schools\n\n• Location: Boone County\n\n• Annual per student spending: $9,073\n\n• Adults with a bachelor's degree: 70.6%\n\nChildren of parents with a college education are more likely to have higher academic achievement than the typical student. In Indiana's Zionsville school district, located just north of Indianapolis, 70.6% of adults have a bachelor's degree or higher, well above the 25.9% of adults across the state as a whole. Zionsville also boasts a near perfect high school graduation rate.\n\n15. Iowa: Gilbert Community School District\n\n• Location: Story County\n\n• Annual per student spending: $9,733\n\n• Adults with a bachelor's degree: 63.5%\n\nWhile per pupil spending isn't as high as many of the other districts in the district, Iowa's Gilbert Community School District, north of the city of Ames, has some of the best student outcomes in the country.\n\nLike a number of the best school districts in each state, Gilbert Community School District has a near-perfect graduation rate. Additionally, according to Niche, 95% of students in the district test as proficient in reading, and 97% test as proficient in math. The average SAT scores among students in the district is 1420, far higher than the national average SAT scores.\n\n16. Kansas: Blue Valley Schools\n\n• Location: Johnson County\n\n• Annual per student spending: $9,850\n\n• Adults with a bachelor's degree: 70.2%\n\nThe Blue Valley Unified School District has one of the highest graduation rates of any school district with at least 500 students. Nearly all ninth graders in the district – over 96% – graduate high school in four years, well above the 84.5% statewide graduation rate.\n\nChildren of college-educated parents are more likely to be academically successful than children of parents who never went to college. Across the district, 70.2% of adults have a bachelor's degree, well above the 32.9% share of adults across the state as a whole.\n\n17. Kentucky: Beechwood Independent Schools\n\n• Location: Kenton County\n\n• Annual per student spending: $8,964\n\n• Adults with a bachelor's degree: 57.3%\n\nChildren growing up in poverty face unique hardships and stressors that can have a negative impact on academic performance. However, such conditions are rare in Kentucky's Beechwood Independent School District. Just 4.1% of area children live below the poverty line, a fraction of the 20.5% statewide child poverty rate.\n\nWith most students not saddled with financial hardship, certain academic outcomes are indeed better than average in the school district. For example, the district's high school graduation rate is over 93%.\n\n18. Louisiana: Orleans Parish Schools\n\n• Location: Orleans Parish\n\n• Annual per student spending: $12,761\n\n• Adults with a bachelor's degree: 36.8%\n\nThe Orleans Parish School District in Louisiana, which covers much of the greater New Orleans area, ranks as the district where students are most likely to succeed in the state. Public school spending per student in the district is $12,761, above the $11,199 average spending across the state as a whole.\n\nWhile higher spending does not necessarily translate to better outcomes, the higher spending likely contributes to smaller class sizes in Orleans Parish. The district's student-to-teacher ratio of 16.9 to 1 is well below the 17.8 to 1 state ratio.\n\n19. Maine: Falmouth School Department\n\n• Location: Cumberland County\n\n• Annual per student spending: $15,663\n\n• Adults with a bachelor's degree: 69%\n\nSmaller class sizes have been linked to better outcomes. In Maine's Falmouth School District, located in Cumberland County just outside of Portland, there are 11.5 students per teacher, below the 12.2 to 1 state average ratio and the 16.1 to 1 national average ratio.\n\nStudents enrolled in the district are also more likely than those in most other Maine public school districts to graduate high school. More than 90% of high school ninth graders in Falmouth graduate in four years.\n\nHealth or a paycheck?:Workers with no paid sick leave face tough choice amid coronavirus scare\n\nGas prices:'Oil price war,' coronavirus could drive gasoline below $2 gallon\n\n20. Maryland: Howard County Public School System\n\n• Location: Howard County\n\n• Annual per student spending: $15,921\n\n• Adults with a bachelor's degree: 61.4%\n\nMaryland's Howard County School district, located just outside of Baltimore, ranks as the best in the state due in large part to conditions outside of the classroom. For example, while the stressors associated with serious financial hardship can detract considerably from academic performance, just 5.7% of children in the district live below the poverty line, compared to 11.4% of children statewide. Additionally, children of college-educated parents are more likely to be academically successful than children of parents who never went to college. Across the district, 61.4% of adults have a bachelor's degree, the largest share of any school district in Maryland.\n\n21. Massachusetts: Public Schools of Brookline\n\n• Location: Norfolk County\n\n• Annual per student spending: $20,250\n\n• Adults with a bachelor's degree: 83.7%\n\nPer pupil spending is not a guarantee of good student outcomes, but higher spending can come with certain advantages. And at Massachusetts' Brookline public school system, per pupil spending exceeds $20,000 annually, roughly $8,000 greater than national per pupil spending.\n\nAs is usually the case in high-spending districts, Brookline – a suburb of Boston – is a relatively affluent community, with a median household income of $113,515. Students who grow up in an affluent household with college-educated parents have a greater chance to succeed academically. Among the district's adults, 83.7% have at least a bachelor's degree, one of the 10 highest shares of any school district in the United States.\n\n22. Michigan: East Grand Rapids Public Schools\n\n• Location: Kent County\n\n• Annual per student spending: $9,975\n\n• Adults with a bachelor's degree: 78.4%\n\nWhile the East Grand Rapids Public School District has lower than average per pupil spending and a higher than average student-to-teacher ratio, conditions outside the classroom give children in the area an academic advantage. For one, 78.4% of adults in the school district have a bachelor's degree, well above the 28.6% share of adults across Michigan as a whole – and children of college-educated parents are more likely than average to be successful academically. Indeed, the district has a high school graduation rate over 95%.\n\n23. Minnesota: Edina Public Schools\n\n• Location: Hennepin County\n\n• Annual per student spending: $11,815\n\n• Adults with a bachelor's degree: 72.7%\n\nMinnesota's Edina Public Schools, just southwest of Minneapolis, comprises 12 schools that enroll nearly 9,000 students. The best district in the state, Edina's high school graduation rate is over 92%.

Data on per pupil spending in 2017 came from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Annual Survey of School System Finances and was included in the index. Data on the ratio of students to teachers in the 2017-2018 school year came from the National Center for Education Statistics and was included in the index. The average freshman graduation rate for the 2009-2010 school year also came from the NCES and was included in the index. Data on the percentage of children aged 5 to 17 living in poverty in 2018 came from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates program and was included in the index. Finally, five-year data on the percentage of adults 25 and over with at least a bachelor’s degree by school district in 2018 came from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey and was included in the index. Only school districts with at least 500 students and four of the five data points included in our index were considered.\n\nData on Advanced Placement enrollment and the percentage of students who took and passed at least one AP exam in the 2015-2016 school year came from the U.S. Department of Education’s Civil Rights Data Collection program and were aggregated from the school level to the district level using only schools with students in grades nine through 12 exclusively.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Sauter\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nAccording to a survey conducted in August, about half of U.S. school districts planned to reintroduce full-time in-person learning this fall, with the remainder either resuming the virtual learning processes introduced during the early months of the COVID-19 outbreak or using a hybrid model.\n\nMany schools throughout the country that have attempted to start the year with full in-person classes have already had to revert to virtual learning. With regional cases high in many parts of the country and the possibility of cases resurging in the future in others, it is unclear how long before normal in-person classes will resume nationwide. Also unclear is the long-term effects that school closure and virtual learning will have on student development.\n\nAlready, the public education system in the United States lags behind the schools of many wealthy nations. According to an annual study conducted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the U.S. trails 24 other countries – Australia, Canada, China, Germany, Japan, and the U.K. among them – in student performance in core subjects.\n\nNationwide, only about 33% of public school students about to enter high school are considered proficient in math, and 32% are considered proficient in reading, according to the National Assessment of Educational Progress.\n\nThese figures offer a grim assessment of the general state of American schools. Encouragingly, however, there are still public schools all over the country that offer a well-rounded and high-quality education, and where student achievement is high.\n\nEateries adapt:As winter weather approaches, restaurants get creative with outdoor dining\n\nStimulus payments:IRS extends deadline, giving millions more time to get Economic Impact Payments\n\n24/7 Wall St. reviewed rankings for all public schools from school data clearinghouse Niche and identified the best public high school in every state. Niche’s school rating system accounts for a range of factors, including student and parent survey responses, teacher absenteeism, standardized test scores, and other measures of academic performance. A full methodological breakdown is available here.\n\nNearly half of the schools on this list are either charter or magnet schools. Unlike regular public high schools, where place of residence is typically the only factor in enrollment, many of these schools have competitive admissions processes that are designed to select only the most motivated and talented students from both inside and outside of the school district. Unlike normal public high schools, magnet and charter schools often receive additional funding through private sources such as tuition and donations.\n\nIn many non-charter or magnet schools on this list, high student achievement is often due not only to school quality, but also to advantages outside of the classroom. For example, children of better-educated parents are themselves more likely to succeed academically. The vast majority of non-charter or magnet schools on this list are located in school districts where adults and parents are far more likely to have a four-year college education than the typical American adult. These school districts also tend to be relatively wealthy.\n\nAlabama: Loveless Academic Magnet Program High School\n\n• Location: Montgomery\n\n• Number of students: 513\n\n• Student-teacher ratio: 15-to-1\n\n• Avg.
