In California, the operator that manages most of the state’s power grid issued an alert Thursday calling on residents to set thermostats to 78 degrees or higher, avoid using major appliances and turn off all unnecessary lights in the evening. In neighboring Nevada, residents have also been urged to reduce electricity usage due to a significant reduction in the available energy supply. The National Weather Service said the heat will end “abruptly and unusually” in some parts of Southern California after a rare hurricane makes a close pass by the region. Climate experts say the storm will likely create an alarming combination of extreme heat, flash flooding, damaging offshore winds and an increased fire threat through Saturday.\n\n2. United Nations\n\nThe two brothers identified as suspects in connection with a mass stabbing in Canada this week have died. One of the brothers was found dead a day after the attacks, which left 10 dead and 18 others injured in Saskatchewan, Canada, police said. The other brother died Wednesday after going into “medical distress” after his arrest, authorities said. The 10 victims ranged in ages from 23 to 78 years old, and all but one are from the Indigenous community of James Smith Cree Nation. It remains unclear what motivated the stabbings and how or whether the brothers knew any of the victims. Police say some of the victims were apparently targeted while others may have been attacked randomly.\n\n3. Congress\n\nA shooting rampage in Memphis, Tennessee, left four people dead and three others wounded across multiple crime scenes on Wednesday. A 19-year-old suspect was arrested after streaming at least one of the attacks on Facebook Live, police said. The shootings prompted authorities to issue a citywide shelter in place order as police searched for the gunman. The Memphis Area Transit Authority also suspended bus and trolley service Wednesday, citing danger from the shooter. Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland expressed anger over the spate of violence at a press conference. “I am angry for our citizens,” he said. “The people of our city were confronted with the type of violence no one should have to face.”\n\n4. Trump revelations\n\nSeveral recent revelations have shed light on then-President Trump and his supporters’ plans to subvert the Constitution and keep him in power after the 2020 election. These revelations are likely to be of high interest to the House select committee investigating the January 6 insurrection. For instance, a newly revealed memo shows a conservative lawyer working with Trump’s legal team tried to convince then-Vice President Mike Pence that he could overturn the election results on January 6 when Congress counted the Electoral College votes. The six-step scheme, which included throwing out electors from seven states, was outlined in a two-page memo obtained by Washington Post journalists Bob Woodward and Robert Costa for their book, “Peril.” The memo was then obtained by CNN.\n\n5. Immigration\n\nSteve Bannon, a former aide to ex-President Donald Trump, is expected to surrender later today and plead not guilty on charges related to an effort to raise money to fund the construction of a wall along the southern US border. The New York state charges allege Bannon and three others defrauded donors in the border wall effort, which raised more than $25 million. The Manhattan district attorney’s office launched a criminal investigation into Bannon’s “We Build the Wall” crowd-fundraising activities early last year after then-President Trump pardoned Bannon on federal fraud charges relating to the same alleged scheme. Presidential pardons, however, do not apply to state investigations.\n\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\n\nAdidas plans to take over college sports, sign endorsement deals with up to 50,000 student athletes\n\nOh baby, baby!

The President is slated to announce that the Environmental Protection Agency will issue an emergency waiver permitting year-round sales of E15 gasoline, which contains a 15% ethanol blend. The sale of E15 gasoline is usually prohibited from June to mid-September because of air quality concerns.\n\nTODAY’S NUMBER\n\n$6.02\n\nThat’s the price Krispy Kreme will charge for a dozen original glazed doughnuts tomorrow – matching the price of a gallon of regular gas. Each week, the chain says they will use Monday’s national average gas price to set the promotional price for its doughnuts every Wednesday from April 13 through May 4. And that’s a good deal: A dozen original glazed would typically go for at least $10 at Krispy Kreme.\n\nTODAY’S QUOTE\n\n“I don’t know if I’m allowed to say this, but I finally started talking to a therapist after Indian Wells.”\n\n– Vice President Kamala Harris, emphasizing that the White House is actively trying to help lessen Americans’ medical debt burden. In remarks yesterday, Harris noted that some people are contending with the rising cost of living while still trying to pay off hospital bills from years ago. In response, the Biden administration laid out a four-point plan to help protect consumers, which builds on the President’s recent executive order on increasing access to affordable health care coverage.\n\nTODAY’S WEATHER\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Severe storm threat expands for Central US as West sees heavy April snow 02:39 - Source: CNN\n\nCheck your local forecast here>>>\n\nAND FINALLY\n\nEngineering the Most Annoying Sound Ever\n\nToilet paper challenge\n\nChances are high you probably woke up to an alarm this morning (and maybe even hit snooze at least once.)

Kansas voters rejected an amendment that would have removed the right to an abortion from the state’s constitution. This is the first time citizens have been able to weigh in on the issue at the polls since Roe v. Wade was overturned, and the high turnout in Kansas could be a sign that voters will continue to show up to make their disagreement known. In Missouri, disgraced former Gov. Eric Greitens lost his Republican primary after a controversial attempt to reenter politics. Several election deniers backed by former President Donald Trump were on the ballot in Arizona, Michigan and Washington. Some of these races are still too close to call, but Trump-backed Tudor Dixon is projected to become Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s challenger in November.\n\n2.

Mosley was injured in a car crash last week that had left him paralyzed from the shoulders down and in critical condition. Mosley starred in more than 150 episodes of “Magnum, P.I.” alongside Tom Selleck in the crime-adventure series, which aired for eight seasons from 1980 until 1988.\n\nTODAY’S NUMBER\n\n$799\n\nThat’s the length of Google Equiano, an underwater internet cable designed to deliver high-speed broadband along the west coast of Africa.

Liz Truss\n\nAfter a disastrous six-week tenure, Liz Truss announced her resignation as Britain’s prime minister on Thursday, making her the UK’s shortest-serving prime minister ever. When Truss ascended to the top job, her economic policy proposals caused the British pound to sink to its lowest level against the US dollar in decades. The turmoil caused government bond prices to soar and negatively impacted people’s pension funds. The rise in interest rates also forced up mortgage repayments, and lenders scrambled to pull their products from the market – dashing the hopes of prospective homeowners almost overnight. Faced with the fury of her own party, Truss fired her finance minister, lost her home secretary, and created even more divisions in the Conservative Party. Another election is due to take place within a week, with the next prime minister expected to be announced on October 28.\n\n2. Ukraine\n\nThe EU and the UK have separately announced new sanctions on Iran, which denies supplying Russia with drones used to carry out deadly attacks in Ukraine this week. Iran has repeatedly said it has not been involved with providing “kamikaze” drones to Russia despite mounting evidence to the contrary. On Thursday, the White House said Iranian military personnel have visited Crimea to assist with Russian operations targeting civilian infrastructure in Ukraine using drones. John Kirby, the communications coordinator at the National Security Council, said the presence of Iranian personnel was evidence of Tehran’s direct engagement in the conflict. “They can lie to the world but they certainly can’t hide the facts,” he said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN reporter gets pinned down in Russian artillery strike 03:22 - Source: CNN\n\n3. Covid-19\n\nA flurry of new Covid-19 variants appears to be gaining traction globally, raising fears of a winter surge. New numbers show coronavirus cases in the US are dropping, but several emerging variants accounted for almost 1 in 3 new infections nationwide last week, according to estimates from the CDC. Some experts think this convergence means we’ve entered a new phase in the evolution of the virus, one that will see the circulation of several variants at the same time. Updated booster vaccines and antiviral drugs like Paxlovid are expected to continue to be protective against severe outcomes from Covid-19 infections caused by the new variants, experts say.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Will approaching winter mean new Covid-19 surge? 04:20 - Source: CNN\n\n4. Student loans\n\nThe Supreme Court has denied an attempt to block President Joe Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan from taking effect. Justice Amy Coney Barrett declined to take up an appeal brought by a Wisconsin taxpayers group that argued Biden doesn’t have the legal authority to implement the program. In the court filing, lawyers for the group argued that the program would be a “staggering blow” to the US Treasury and taxpayers. The independent Congressional Budget Office has estimated that Biden’s program could cost $400 billion. The Biden administration, meanwhile, argues that Congress gave the secretary of education the power to discharge debt in a 2003 law known as the HEROES Act. Student loan debt cancellations, worth up to $20,000 per eligible borrower, could begin on Sunday.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Biden's student loan forgiveness plan: Who it helps, who it doesn't 04:06 - Source: CNN\n\n5.

No action was taken against the gunman or to help those trapped inside for more than an hour after he started firing. Nineteen children and two teachers were killed in the shooting.

The other brother died Wednesday after going into “medical distress” after his arrest, authorities said. The 10 victims ranged in ages from 23 to 78 years old, and all but one are from the Indigenous community of James Smith Cree Nation. It remains unclear what motivated the stabbings and how or whether the brothers knew any of the victims. Police say some of the victims were apparently targeted while others may have been attacked randomly.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Eastern Ukraine prepares to defend against Russian forces 01:56 - Source: CNN\n\n3.

A 19-year-old suspect was arrested after streaming at least one of the attacks on Facebook Live, police said. The shootings prompted authorities to issue a citywide shelter in place order as police searched for the gunman. The Memphis Area Transit Authority also suspended bus and trolley service Wednesday, citing danger from the shooter. Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland expressed anger over the spate of violence at a press conference. “I am angry for our citizens,” he said. “The people of our city were confronted with the type of violence no one should have to face.”\n\n4. Trump revelations\n\nSeveral recent revelations have shed light on then-President Trump and his supporters’ plans to subvert the Constitution and keep him in power after the 2020 election. These revelations are likely to be of high interest to the House select committee investigating the January 6 insurrection. For instance, a newly revealed memo shows a conservative lawyer working with Trump’s legal team tried to convince then-Vice President Mike Pence that he could overturn the election results on January 6 when Congress counted the Electoral College votes. The six-step scheme, which included throwing out electors from seven states, was outlined in a two-page memo obtained by Washington Post journalists Bob Woodward and Robert Costa for their book, “Peril.” The memo was then obtained by CNN.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Grocery price hikes: 'We're going to feel the effect for months' 03:12 - Source: CNNBusiness\n\n5.

The records obtained by the committee show incoming and outgoing calls, and the calls’ date, time and length.

And it’s simple and it’s now. It’s easy,” Biden said in remarks from the White House alongside Education Secretary Miguel Cardona. “This is a game changer for millions of Americans … and it took an incredible amount of effort to get this website done in such a short time.”\n\nIndividuals seeking to apply for student debt relief can now fill out the form in English or Spanish at Studentaid.gov. The form includes information on the debt relief, who qualifies for it and how it works. It asks applicants for information including their full name, Social Security number, date of birth, phone number and an email address. Borrowers have until December 31, 2023, to submit an application.\n\nBiden in August announced his decision to cancel up to $10,000 in student loan debt for individuals making less than $125,000 a year or as much as $20,000 for eligible borrowers who were also Pell Grant recipients.\n\nBorrowers must have federally held student loans to qualify. In addition to federal Direct Loans used to pay for an undergraduate degree, federal PLUS loans borrowed by graduate students and parents may also be eligible if the borrower meets the income requirements.\n\nThe Biden administration has said that applicants who are “more likely to exceed the income cutoff” will be required to submit additional information, like a tax transcript. And while borrowers will not have to pay federal income tax on the student loan debt forgiveness, it’s possible that some borrowers may have to pay state income tax on the amount of debt forgiven.\n\nThe Department of Education has also said it already had income information for nearly 8 million borrowers, likely because of financial aid forms or previously submitted income-driven repayment plan applications. Those borrowers will automatically receive the debt relief if they meet the income requirement, unless they choose to opt out. The department has said it will email borrowers who will be considered for debt relief but don’t need to apply.\n\nThe formal launch of the application marks the next phase of a massive technical undertaking for federal agencies and student loan servicers to provide broad relief to tens of millions of borrowers. A beta version of the website was launched on Friday evening and Biden said over 8 million Americans used the website over the weekend to fill out their applications.\n\nThe President credited “a talented group of data scientists and engineers across the federal government” who “built and tested and launched this new application in just weeks.” In the few days of beta testing the application, Biden said, the website “handled more than 8 million applications without a glitch or difficulty.”\n\n“As millions of people fill out the application, we’re going to make sure the system continues to work as smoothly as possible so that we can deliver student loan relief for millions of Americans as quickly and as efficiently as possible,” he added.\n\nThe Department of Education is facing several lawsuits challenging the student loan forgiveness policy. A US district judge could soon decide whether to temporarily block the program from taking effect after hearing a motion for a preliminary injunction last week. That could put student loan cancellation on hold until the judge issues a final ruling on the case.\n\nAsked at the end of his remarks about litigation challenging the plan, Biden said he thinks the administration’s plan will hold up in court. He also took aim at Republican critics of his student debt relief plan, calling their outrage “wrong” and “hypocritical.”\n\n“I will never apologize for helping working Americans and middle-class people as they recover from the pandemic. Especially not the same Republicans who voted for a $2 trillion tax cut in the last administration, mainly benefited the wealthiest Americans and the largest corporations and didn’t pay for a penny of it and racked up the deficit,” he added.\n\nBorrowers whose federal student loans are guaranteed by the government but held by private lenders, many of which were made under the former Federal Family Education Loan program and Federal Perkins Loan program, are currently excluded – unless a borrower applied to consolidate those loans into Direct loans by September 29.\n\nThe Education Department initially said these privately held loans would be eligible for the one-time forgiveness action – but reversed course in September when six Republican-led states sued the Biden administration, arguing that forgiving the privately held loans would financially hurt states and student loan servicers.\n\nAsked by CNN’s MJ Lee about those with privately held loans being ineligible for the mass relief, Cardona said the administration is “moving as quickly as possible to provide relief to as many people as possible.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.", "authors": ["Maegan Vazquez Sam Fossum Betsy Klein", "Maegan Vazquez", "Sam Fossum", "Betsy Klein"], "publish_date": "2022/10/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/31/politics/biden-student-loan-forgiveness-faq/index.html", "title": "Everything you need to know about Biden's student loan forgiveness ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nFederal student loan borrowers can now apply for up to $20,000 in debt forgiveness, thanks to a new plan announced by President Joe Biden in late August.\n\nThe administration officially launched the application on October 17, following a brief “beta period” during which its team assessed whether tweaks were needed.\n\nNot every student loan borrower is eligible for the debt relief. First, only federally held student loans qualify. Private student loans are excluded.\n\nSecond, high-income borrowers are generally excluded from receiving debt forgiveness. Individual borrowers who make less than $125,000 a year and married couples or heads of households who make less than $250,000 annually will see up to $10,000 of their federal student loan debt forgiven.\n\nIf a qualifying borrower also received a federal Pell grant while enrolled in college, the individual is eligible for up to $20,000 of debt forgiveness. Pell grants are awarded to millions of low-income students each year, based on factors including their family’s size and income and the cost charged by their college. These borrowers are also more likely to struggle to repay their student debt and end up in default.\n\nHere’s what else borrowers need to know about the new student loan forgiveness plan:\n\nWhen will I receive my debt relief?\n\nThe Biden administration has said it could take weeks to process an application once it is submitted. Officials expect to be able to grant relief before payments are set to resume in January, when the pandemic-related pause expires, for borrowers who apply by mid-November.\n\nCurrently, the administration must hold off on canceling any student loan debt while the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals hears a legal challenge to the program.\n\nIf and when the court lifts the stay on the program, an estimated 8 million borrowers may receive debt relief automatically because the Department of Education already has their income on file. Those borrowers may begin to see their debt canceled after November 14, according to emails sent to eligible borrowers from the Department of Education.\n\nBorrowers can apply online here: https://studentaid.gov/debt-relief/application.\n\nApplicants can expect to receive an email confirmation once their application is successfully submitted. Then, borrowers will be notified by their loan servicer when the debt cancellation has been applied to their account.\n\nBorrowers have until December 31, 2023, to submit an application.\n\nWhat kind of federal loans are eligible?\n\nThere are a variety of federal student loans and not all are eligible for relief. Federal Direct Loans, including subsidized loans, unsubsidized loans, parent PLUS loans and graduate PLUS loans, are eligible.\n\nBut federal student loans that are guaranteed by the government but held by private lenders are not eligible unless the borrower applied to consolidate those loans into a Direct Loan by September 29.\n\nThe Department of Education initially said these privately held loans, many of which were made under the former Federal Family Education Loan program and Federal Perkins Loan program, would be eligible for the one-time forgiveness action – but reversed course in September when six Republican-led states sued the Biden administration, arguing that forgiving the privately held loans would financially hurt states and student loan servicers.\n\nDefaulted Federal Family Education Loans and defaulted Perkins Loans are still eligible for the debt relief even if they are privately held.\n\nWhat year is the income threshold based on?\n\nEligibility is based on a borrower’s adjusted gross income for either tax year 2020 or 2021. Adjusted gross income can be lower than your total wages because it considers tax deductions and adjustments, like contributions made to a 401(k) retirement plan.\n\nA taxpayer’s adjusted gross income can be found on line 11 of IRS Form 1040.\n\nHow will the government know what my income was?\n\nThe Department of Education says it already had income information for nearly 8 million borrowers, likely because of financial aid forms or previously submitted income-driven repayment plan applications. Those borrowers will automatically receive the debt relief if they meet the income requirement, unless they choose to opt out. The department has said it will email borrowers who will be considered for debt relief but don’t need to apply.\n\nMillions of other borrowers will need to apply for student loan forgiveness if the Department of Education doesn’t have their income information on file. When they submit the application, borrowers are required to self-attest that their income is under the eligibility threshold. They are required to certify that the information provided is accurate upon penalty of perjury.\n\nThe Biden administration has said that applicants who are “more likely to exceed the income cutoff” will be required to submit additional information, like a tax transcript. Officials expect that just 5% of borrowers with eligible federal student loans would not qualify due to the income threshold.\n\nWill I have to pay taxes on the amount of debt canceled?\n\nBorrowers will not have to pay federal income tax on the student loan debt forgiven, thanks to a provision in the American Rescue Plan Act that Congress passed last year.\n\nBut it’s possible that some borrowers may have to pay state income tax on the amount of debt forgiven. There are a handful of states that may tax discharged debt if state legislative or administrative changes are not made beforehand, according to the Tax Policy Center. The tax liability could be hundreds of dollars, depending on the state.\n\nI’m a current student. Am I eligible for forgiveness?\n\nYes, some current students are eligible. Eligibility for borrowers who filed the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, known as the FAFSA, as an independent will be based on the individual’s own household income.\n\nEligibility for borrowers who are enrolled as dependent students, generally those under the age of 24, will be based on parental income for either 2020 or 2021.\n\nI have student debt from graduate school. Am I eligible for forgiveness?\n\nYes, if your income meets the eligibility threshold.\n\nI’m a parent and took out a Parent PLUS loan. Am I eligible?\n\nYes, if your income meets the eligibility threshold. A parent borrower with federal Parent PLUS loans for multiple children is still only eligible for up to $20,000 of loan forgiveness.\n\nBut a parent is only eligible for up to $20,000 in debt relief if he or she received a Pell grant for his or her own education. If only the child received a Pell grant, the parent is eligible for up to $10,000 in forgiveness.\n\nHow do I know if I ever received a Pell grant?\n\nMost borrowers can log in to Studentaid.gov to see if they received a Pell grant while enrolled in college. Information about Pell grants received is displayed on the account dashboard and on the My Aid page. This is also where borrowers can find out how much they owe and what kind of loans they have.\n\nBorrowers who received a Pell grant before 1994 won’t see their Pell grant information online, but they are still eligible for the $20,000 in student loan forgiveness.\n\nAs long as borrowers received at least one Pell grant, they are eligible.\n\nThe Biden administration has said that eligible borrowers who have received Pell grants will automatically receive the additional debt relief.\n\nAm I eligible for forgiveness if my loans are in default?\n\nYes, defaulted federal student loans are eligible for debt relief.\n\nFor borrowers who have a remaining balance on their defaulted student loans after the cancellation is applied, there will be an opportunity to get out of default once payments resume in January 2023 as part of what the Department of Education is calling its “Fresh Start” initiative.\n\nCould Biden’s forgiveness plan be struck down in court?\n\nThe Biden administration is facing several lawsuits over the student loan forgiveness program. Many of the plaintiffs argue that the Department of Education is overstepping its authority.\n\nIt’s hard to say right now what the chances are that a court overturns Biden’s action.\n\nA federal appeals court put a temporary, administrative hold on the program on October 21, barring the administration from canceling loans covered under the policy while the court considers a challenge brought by six Republican-led states.\n\nThe states are asking the 8th US Circuit Court of Appeals for a preliminary injunction, which could halt the policy until a final ruling is issued. A lower court judge dismissed the lawsuit on October 20, ruling that the plaintiffs did not have the legal standing to bring the challenge.\n\nOn the same day as the lower court dismissal, Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett rejected a separate challenge to Biden’s student loan forgiveness program, declining to take up an appeal brought by a Wisconsin taxpayers group.\n\nThe Biden administration is also facing lawsuits from Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich and conservative groups including the Job Creators Network Foundation and the Cato Institute.\n\nLawyers for the government say that Congress gave the secretary of education “expansive authority to alleviate the hardship that federal student loan recipients may suffer as a result of national emergencies,” like the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a memo from the Department of Justice.\n\nHow will my payments change going forward?\n\nBorrowers who have debt remaining after either $10,000 or $20,000 is wiped away could see their monthly payment amounts recalculated if they are enrolled in a standard repayment plan. Under a standard repayment plan, borrowers pay a fixed amount that ensures loans are paid off within 10 years.\n\nBorrowers who are already enrolled in an income-driven repayment plan are not likely to see their monthly payment amounts change due to the forgiveness, because their payments are based on household income and family size.\n\nBorrowers have not been required to make payments on their federal student loans since March 2020 because of the government’s pandemic-related pause. Biden has extended the pause through the end of this year, and payments will resume in January 2023.\n\nWhat about Biden’s new income-driven repayment plan?\n\nAlong with Biden’s August announcement about canceling some federal student loan debt, he also said he would create a new plan that would make repayment more manageable for borrowers.\n\nThere are currently several repayment plans available for federal student loan borrowers that lower monthly payments by capping them at a portion of their income.\n\nThe new income-driven repayment plan that Biden is expected to propose would cap payments at 5% of a borrower’s discretionary income, down from 10% that is offered in most current plans, as well as reduce the amount of income that is considered discretionary. It would also forgive remaining balances after 10 years of repayment, instead of 20 years.\n\nBiden is also proposing that the new plan cover the borrower’s unpaid monthly interest. This could be very helpful for people whose monthly payments are so low that they don’t cover their monthly interest charge and end up seeing their balances explode, growing larger than what was originally borrowed.\n\nBut we don’t know when these changes will take effect. The Department of Education has not provided any sense of timing, but has said it will propose a new rule to create the repayment plan. The department’s formal rule-making process usually includes soliciting public comments and can take months, if not more than a year.\n\nCan I get a refund for what I paid during the pandemic pause?\n\nYes. Borrowers have not been required to make payments on their federal student loans since March 13, 2020, because of the pandemic-related pause. But if borrowers did make payments, they are allowed to contact their loan servicer to request a refund.\n\nHow can I opt out of the loan forgiveness program?\n\nBorrowers who do not want debt relief must contact their loan servicer by November 14 to opt out of the program.\n\nBorrowers can log in to StudentAid.gov or call 800-4-FED-AID to verify which company services their loans. For those with multiple servicers, borrowers have to tell just one of them that they want to opt out.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.", "authors": ["Katie Lobosco"], "publish_date": "2022/08/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/19/politics/student-loan-debt-forgiveness-repayment/index.html", "title": "Biden's latest student debt move will bring 3.6 million borrowers ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe Department of Education is making more changes to the federal student loan system that will help bring millions of borrowers – some of whom may have previously been in forbearance – closer to receiving debt forgiveness.\n\nThese new actions, announced Tuesday, are the latest moves by the Biden administration to make it easier for federal student loan borrowers to receive forgiveness that they may already be entitled to under existing programs.\n\nBy the end of March, more than 700,000 of the 43 million federal student loan borrowers had seen their outstanding debt discharged under President Joe Biden, totaling more than $17 billion in relief. He recently extended a pandemic-related payment pause for federal student loans until August 31.\n\nTuesday’s actions will bring more than 3.6 million borrowers at least three years closer to receiving forgiveness through what’s known as the income-driven repayment program, or IDR. The program, which offers four types of repayment plans, allows borrowers to avoid loan default by lowering their monthly payments based on their income and family size.\n\nIDR also promises loan forgiveness after 20-25 years of payments are made. Several thousands of borrowers will immediately see forgiveness through the IDR program after Tuesday’s actions are fully implemented, according to the Department of Education.\n\nAnother 40,000 borrowers will receive immediate forgiveness through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program because they will get credit for more of their payments.\n\n“Student loans were never meant to be a life sentence, but it’s certainly felt that way for borrowers locked out of debt relief they’re eligible for,” said US Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona in a statement.\n\n“Today, the Department of Education will begin to remedy years of administrative failures that effectively denied the promise of loan forgiveness to certain borrowers enrolled in IDR plans,” he added.\n\nDemocratic senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Dick Durbin of Illinois called on the Department of Education last week to investigate mismanagement of the IDR program and to provide borrowers with debt relief. The lawmakers’ letter cited a recent report from NPR that found that very few borrowers were able to get the loan forgiveness they were promised by the IDR program.\n\nFixing past errors\n\nThe changes announced Tuesday will help federal student loan borrowers who did not get accurate information from their loan servicers about their repayment options and were steered into forbearance – which allows for a temporary stop in payments – when they could have been enrolled in an IDR plan.\n\nForbearance can be a quick and easy solution to help borrowers struggling to make their monthly loan payments to stay out of default. But sometimes it’s better for borrowers to enroll in an IDR program instead. That way they can make a lower monthly payment while also getting credit toward forgiveness.\n\nA Department of Education review suggests that loan servicers placed borrowers into forbearance in violation of department rules, even when a borrower’s monthly payment under an IDR plan could have been as low as $0.\n\nThe Department of Education will be conducting a one-time account adjustment that will count time spent in forbearances of more than 12 consecutive months or for more than 36 months cumulative toward forgiveness under IDR and the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. PSLF cancels debt after 10 years for eligible public sector workers who make qualifying monthly payments.\n\nThe agency will also increase oversight of loan servicers’ use of forbearance going forward.\n\nThe Department of Education has also found flaws in the way payments are tracked by both loan servicers and its own office of Federal Student Aid, suggesting borrowers are missing out on progress toward IDR forgiveness. To address past inaccuracies, the agency will conduct a one-time revision of IDR payments and reform the Federal Student Aid’s tracking system.\n\nBiden’s piecemeal approach to loan forgiveness\n\nBiden has resisted pressure from other Democrats to grant broad student loan forgiveness. Instead, his administration has taken several actions to make loan cancellation easier under existing programs.\n\nLast year, the administration temporarily expanded eligibility for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program until October 31, 2022. So far, the Department of Education has identified more than 113,000 borrowers with about $6.8 billion in loans who are eligible for student debt cancellation due to the waiver.\n\nThe department has also been chipping away at a backlog of forgiveness claims filed under a policy known as borrower defense to repayment that allows former students who were defrauded by their colleges to seek federal debt relief. Under that policy, the Biden administration has canceled about $2 billion in debt held by more than 105,000 individuals who attended for-profit colleges and another $1.2 billion for borrowers who attended ITT Technical Institutes before it closed.\n\nThe department also improved efforts to reach borrowers eligible for debt relief because of permanent disabilities, canceling $7.8 billion for more than 400,000 borrowers.", "authors": ["Katie Lobosco"], "publish_date": "2022/04/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2021/12/15/student-loan-forgiveness-repayment-restart/8802355002/", "title": "Student loan payments are restarting: When your payment is due", "text": "WASHINGTON – For nearly two years, most student loan borrowers have been spared the obligation of making payments on their balances. Their interest rate has been frozen, and for the millions in default, the collection calls have stopped.\n\nThat officially ends in February. As President Joe Biden's administration promised, the payment process will restart for 41 million Americans, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said last week during a news briefing. More details about how the restart will work will be released in the coming weeks, the Education Department said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nSome borrowers had hoped the pause on payments would be extended. There is precedent. President Donald Trump's and Biden's administrations had extended the moratorium weeks before payments were expected to resume. Wednesday, liberal Democrats asked Biden to issue another extension, citing the economy and uncertainty around the omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus, Politico reported.\n\nThe administration has long broadcast its plan to resume payments Feb. 1. \"A smooth transition back into repayment remains a high priority for the Administration,\" the Education Department said Wednesday.\n\nWhile payments were paused, the nation’s $1.7 trillion student loan debt portfolio kept growing. Left-leaning lawmakers have pushed Biden to use his executive power to forgive student loan debt en masse. Critics of loan forgiveness say such a move would be a one-time solution and disproportionately benefit those with higher wages and loan balances.\n\nWhen do student loan payments resume? What if I can't afford them?\n\nThat answer will vary from borrower to borrower, but many payments will resume in February. The Education Department said borrowers will receive some form of notice at least 21 days before their first payment is due. Borrowers can contact their loan servicer for the exact date their payments restart.\n\nThose seeking relief from their student loan payments – for instance, because they don't think they can afford them – will probably have to rely on one of the government’s income-based repayment programs. The federal government has started informing borrowers about the income-based repayment plans available to them.\n\nIn a statement Wednesday, the Education Department said it was working with servicers to ensure they're ready to help borrowers when payments restart.\n\nWhat will happen to interest rates?\n\nDuring the pandemic pause on payments, the federal government set interest rates at 0% on student loans – leading some borrowers to pay down their loans aggressively. The standard rate is set to resume in February as well. Rates vary by loan, but that information should be available on loan servicers' websites or on the Department of Education's financial aid website.\n\nAs payments restart, roughly 1 in 3 borrowers will have a new loan servicer. The Education Department started emailing affected borrowers, and people should check their email or physical mail for updates.\n\nA move to a new servicer may mean that borrowers who had automatic payments enabled may need to update their bank information. Those enrolled in income-driven repayment plans will still be eligible with their new servicer.\n\nWhat about student loan forgiveness?\n\nThe Biden administration is expected to release more information about repayment steps in the coming weeks, but it's unlikely to include information about widespread loan forgiveness. Biden said he is in favor of erasing up to $10,000 in loans per borrower, though some liberal lawmakers want that figure at $50,000.\n\nEither way, details about widespread forgiveness remain sparse. Deep disagreements among Democrats make concrete action seem far off.\n\nPsaki shifted blame to Congress Tuesday when asked about the president's initial plan to forgive debt.\n\n\"If Congress sends him a bill, he’s happy to sign it,\" Psaki said. \"They haven’t sent him a bill on that yet.\"\n\nThe Biden administration has expanded the government's sometimes-rigid relief programs for struggling borrowers. For example, the federal government expanded debt relief for those who were defrauded by their colleges or are permanently disabled. It loosened some of the requirements around Public Service Loan Forgiveness.\n\nStudent loan forgiveness:Who is eligible and how to apply under Biden’s overhauled relief program\n\nThousands of borrowers applied for forgiveness through the program, but most were turned away. The federal government estimated its changes would allow more than half a million borrowers to have their debts erased more quickly, and tens of thousands of borrowers would receive immediate relief.\n\nBorrowers who think they may be eligible for Public Service Loan Forgiveness under the administration’s new rules have until October 2022 to apply for inclusion in the program.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/12/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/04/politics/student-loan-forgiveness-application-rules/index.html", "title": "Biden's student loan forgiveness application is coming soon. Here's ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe application for President Joe Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan is expected to go live as soon as this week.\n\nAnnounced in late August, the plan will deliver federal student loan forgiveness to millions of low- and middle-income borrowers.\n\nIndividuals who earned less than $125,000 in either 2020 or 2021 and married couples or heads of households who made less than $250,000 annually in those years will see up to $10,000 of their federal student loan debt forgiven.\n\nIf a qualifying borrower also received a federal Pell grant while enrolled in college, the individual is eligible for up to $20,000 of debt forgiveness.\n\nIn addition to federal Direct Loans used to pay for an undergraduate degree, federal PLUS loans borrowed by graduate students and parents may also be eligible if the borrower meets the income requirements.\n\nFacing mounting legal challenges to the student loan forgiveness policy, the Biden administration announced some last-minute changes to the program last week. Borrowers are still awaiting final details on the policy.\n\nThe Department of Education regularly updates the Federal Student Aid website with information on the forgiveness program.\n\nHere’s what we know so far:\n\nHow to apply\n\nThe application has not been released yet but the Biden administration has said it will come out sometime in October.\n\nThe online application will be short, according to the Department of Education. Borrowers won’t need to upload any supporting documents or use their Federal Student Aid ID to submit the application.\n\n“Once you submit your application, we’ll review it, determine your eligibility for debt relief and work with your loan servicer(s) to process your relief. We’ll contact you if we need any additional information from you,” the department said an email to borrowers last week.\n\nBorrowers will have more than a year to apply. The deadline will be December 2023.\n\nTo be notified when the process has officially opened, sign up at the Department of Education subscription page.\n\nWhen will forgiveness start?\n\nAbout 8 million people are expected to receive student loan forgiveness automatically because the Department of Education already knows what their income is, likely due to previously submitted financial aid forms or income-driven repayment plan applications.\n\nIt’s unclear when exactly debts will be discharged. But due to ongoing lawsuits, the government has agreed in court to hold off canceling any federal student loan debt before October 17.\n\nLast-minute eligibility change\n\nThe Biden administration scaled back eligibility for the program last week, as it faces mounting legal challenges to the policy.\n\nThe program will now exclude borrowers whose federal student loans are guaranteed by the government but held by private lenders. The administration has said the change could affect about 700,000 people.\n\nThe Department of Education initially said these loans, many of which were made under the former Federal Family Education Loan program and Federal Perkins Loan program, would be eligible for the one-time forgiveness action as long as the borrower consolidated his or her debt into the federal Direct Loan program.\n\nBut the agency has reversed course after six Republican-led states sued the Biden administration, arguing that forgiving the privately held loans would financially hurt states and student loan servicers.\n\nNow, privately held federal student loans must have been consolidated before September 29 in order to be eligible for the debt relief.\n\nBorrowers can opt out of the program\n\nThe White House clarified last week that borrowers will be able to opt out if they don’t want to receive the debt forgiveness.\n\nThe Biden administration’s announcement came hours after a borrower sued, arguing that he would be forced to pay state taxes on the amount canceled – an expense he would otherwise avoid.\n\nThere are a handful of states that may tax the debt discharged under Biden’s plan if state legislative or administrative changes are not made beforehand, according to the Tax Foundation.\n\nOngoing legal challenges\n\nThere are currently at least three significant lawsuits aiming to block the Biden administration from implementing its student loan forgiveness plan.\n\nRepublican states are leading the charge. In addition to the lawsuit filed by six Republican-led states that say they could be hurt financially by the forgiveness plan, Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich also filed a lawsuit last week.\n\nBrnovich, a Republican, argues that the policy could reduce Arizona’s tax revenue because the state code doesn’t consider the loan forgiveness as taxable income, according to the lawsuit. The complaint also argues that the forgiveness policy will hurt the attorney general office’s ability to recruit employees. Currently its employees may be eligible for the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, but some potential job candidates may not view that as a benefit if their student loan debt is already canceled, the lawsuit argues.\n\nA federal judge has already denied the request in the third lawsuit – from a borrower who sued arguing that they would incur a bigger state tax bill due to the loan forgiveness. The plaintiff, a public interest lawyer at the Pacific Legal Foundation, has until October 10 to file a revamped lawsuit.\n\nHow much will the program cost?\n\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said in a report released last week that the student loan cancellation could come at a price of $400 billion but noted that those estimates are still “highly uncertain.”\n\nThe Biden administration argues that the CBO’s cost estimate should be viewed over a 30-year time period and came out with its own analysis two days later. It said the program will cost an average of $30 billion per year over the next decade and $379 billion over the course of the program.\n\nBeware of scams\n\nThe Department of Education is warning borrowers of scams related to the student loan forgiveness program that ask for payment in return for help getting debt relief.\n\n“Make sure you work only with the US Department of Education and our loan servicers, and never reveal your personal information or account password to anyone,” it said in an email to borrowers.", "authors": ["Katie Lobosco"], "publish_date": "2022/10/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/11/politics/student-loan-forgiveness-website-preview/index.html", "title": "Biden administration previews student loan forgiveness website ...", "text": "Watch Jake Tapper’s exclusive interview with President Joe Biden on CNN Tonight with Jake Tapper at 9 p.m. ET Tuesday.\n\n\n\nCNN —\n\nThe Biden administration on Tuesday offered a preview of the student loan forgiveness application website, which it described as “short and simple” ahead of its launch expected later this month.\n\nIn August, President Joe Biden announced his decision to cancel up to $10,000 in student loan debt for individuals making less than $125,000 a year or as much as $20,000 for eligible borrowers who are also Pell Grant recipients.\n\nOfficials said the website will be live “later this month” and applications will be open through December 2023 but declined to provide a specific launch date. The form was shared with reporters via a PDF file on Tuesday as preparations are underway to begin the process.\n\n“We’ve worked really hard to make this application simple and straightforward. We kept the number of questions to a minimum and designed it in collaboration with user testing. Borrowers will not need to log in with their FSA ID. They will not need to upload any documents. The application will be available on both computers and mobile devices. It will be available in both English and Spanish and of course accessible to people with disabilities,” a senior administration official briefing reporters said Tuesday.\n\nThe form to apply includes information on the debt relief, who qualifies for it and how it works. It asks applicants for information including their full names, Social Security number, date of birth, phone number and an email address.\n\nA second administration official said that the “vast majority of borrowers, nearly 95% with qualifying loans, meet the income requirement,” adding that there will be “strict fraud prevention measures in place.”\n\nThe form said that the Department of Education will determine eligibility and get in contact with applicants if more information is needed.\n\nWho is eligible?\n\nBorrowers must have federally held student loans to qualify. In addition to federal Direct Loans used to pay for an undergraduate degree, federal PLUS loans borrowed by graduate students and parents may also be eligible if the borrower meets the income requirements.\n\nBorrowers whose federal student loans are guaranteed by the government but held by private lenders, many of which were made under the former Federal Family Education Loan program and Federal Perkins Loan program, are currently excluded – unless a borrower applied to consolidate those loans into Direct loans by September 29.\n\nIndividuals who earned less than $125,000 in either 2020 or 2021 and married couples or heads of households who made less than $250,000 annually in those years are eligible for up to $10,000 of their federal student loan debt forgiven. The income thresholds are based on adjusted gross income.\n\nIf a qualifying borrower also received a federal Pell grant while enrolled in college, the individual is eligible for up to $20,000 of debt forgiveness. The Department of Education already has information on file about who has received a Pell grant and borrowers won’t need to provide proof they received the aid in order to receive the additional relief.\n\nHow soon will borrowers receive debt relief?\n\nAfter submitting the application, most qualifying borrowers are expected to receive debt relief within weeks.\n\nOfficials said that the “goal” is to begin to get the debt relief processed ahead of next January, when student loan payments will begin after a multi-year freeze amid the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n“We hope and expect to deliver student debt relief to millions of Americans before the loan repayments restart. And we expect the process from a completed application to debt relief for the vast majority of borrowers to happen in a matter of weeks,” the first official said.\n\nThe Department of Education is facing several lawsuits challenging the student loan forgiveness policy. A US district judge could decide Wednesday whether to temporarily block the program from taking effect.\n\nAdministration officials confirmed Tuesday that they still expect the application to be available in October.\n\nHow borrowers can verify that they qualify\n\nThe Department of Education already has information on file about who has a qualifying federal loan. For some borrowers, it also has their income information, due to previously submitted financial aid forms or income-driven repayment plan applications.\n\nBut the Department of Education does not have income information for millions of borrowers.

Around 770,000 people will be affected by the change, according to an administration official.\n\nThe Department of Education initially said these loans, many of which were made under the former Federal Family Education Loan program and Federal Perkins Loan program, would be eligible for the one-time forgiveness action as long as the borrower consolidated his or her debt into the federal Direct loan program.\n\nOn Thursday, the department reversed course. According to its website, privately held federal student loans must have been consolidated before September 29 in order to be eligible for the debt relief.\n\nBorrowers with privately held federal student loans who have not consolidated yet are currently out of luck, though the Department of Education said it “is assessing whether there are alternative pathways” to provide relief.\n\nBorrowers with privately held federal student loans represent a small portion of the 43 million federal student loan borrowers. There are about 4 million borrowers with Federal Family Education Loans, but not all of those people are likely eligible for the loan forgiveness plan, which also includes an income requirement.\n\n“Our goal is to provide relief to as many eligible borrowers as quickly and easily as possible, and this will allow us to achieve that goal while we continue to explore additional legally-available options to provide relief to borrowers with privately owned FFEL loans and Perkins loans, including whether FFEL borrowers could receive one-time debt relief without needing to consolidate,” the Department of Education said in an emailed statement.\n\n“Borrowers with privately held federal student loans who applied to consolidate their loans into Direct Loans before September 29, 2022 will obtain one-time debt relief. The FFEL program is now defunct and only a small percentage of borrowers have FFEL loans. This is a completely different program than Direct Loans,” the statement said.\n\nLawsuit argues forgiveness will hurt loan servicers\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in a federal court in Missouri by state attorneys general from Missouri, Arkansas, Kansas, Nebraska and South Carolina, as well as legal representatives from Iowa.\n\n“In addition to being economically unwise and inherently unfair, the Biden Administration’s Mass Debt Cancellation is another example in a long line of unlawful regulatory actions. No statute permits President Biden to unilaterally relieve millions of individuals from their obligation to pay loans they voluntarily assumed,” Nebraska Attorney General Doug Peterson’s office said in a news release.\n\nThe plaintiffs argued that student loan servicers – including the Higher Education Loan Authority of the State of Missouri, known as MOHELA – are harmed by Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan. It argues that the plan creates an incentive for borrowers to consolidate Federal Family Education Loans owned by MOHELA into Direct Loans owned by the government, “depriving them (MOHELA) of the ongoing revenue it earns from servicing those loans,” according to the lawsuit.\n\nBut the Department of Education’s move to exclude borrowers with privately held federal loans from the student loan forgiveness plan could weaken that legal argument, said Luke Herrine, an assistant law professor at the University of Alabama who previously worked on a legal strategy pushing for student debt cancellation.\n\nThe White House continues to argue that its student loan forgiveness plan is legal.\n\n“Republican officials from these six states are standing with special interests, and fighting to stop relief for borrowers buried under mountains of debt,”said White House spokesman Abdullah Hasan in an emailed statement.\n\n“The President and his administration are lawfully giving working and middle class families breathing room as they recover from the pandemic and prepare to resume loan payments in January,” he said.\n\nFederal student loan payments have been paused since March 2020, thanks to a pandemic-related benefit. The pause expires on December 31.\n\nEarlier this week, a public interest lawyer who is also a student loan borrower, sued the Biden administration over the student loan forgiveness plan, arguing that the policy is an abuse of executive power and that it would stick him with a bigger state tax bill.\n\nHow Biden’s plan will work\n\nUnder Biden’s plan, individual borrowers who earned less than $125,000 in either 2020 or 2021 and married couples or heads of households who made less than $250,000 annually in those years will see up to $10,000 of their federal student loan debt forgiven.\n\nIf a qualifying borrower also received a federal Pell grant while enrolled in college, the individual is eligible for up to $20,000 of debt forgiveness. Pell grants are awarded to millions of low-income students each year, based on factors that include their family’s size and income and the cost charged by their college. These borrowers are also more likely to struggle to repay their student debt and end up in default.\n\nThe administration is expected to roll out the first wave of student loan forgiveness in October.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimated this week – before the administration excluded FFEL borrowers – that Biden’s plan could cost the government $400 billion but warned that the estimate relies on several assumptions and is “highly uncertain.”\n\nEstimating the cost of student debt forgiveness is complicated because loans are generally paid back over several years. The White House argues that the CBO’s estimate should be looked at over a 30-year time frame.\n\nUntested legal waters\n\nBiden announced the forgiveness plan in August, after facing mounting pressure from Democrats to forgive some student loan debt. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren repeatedly called on the President to cancel up to $50,000 in student loan debt per borrower.\n\nBut canceling federal student loan debt so broadly is unprecedented and, until now, has yet to be tested in court. Biden initially urged Congress to take action to cancel some student debt, rather than wade into a murky legal area himself, but Democrats don’t have the votes to pass such legislation.\n\nIn a Department of Education memo released in August, the Biden administration argued that the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act of 2003 – or Heroes Act – grants the Education Secretary the power to cancel student debt to help address the financial harm suffered due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Heroes Act, which was enacted in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks, “provides the Secretary broad authority to grant relief from student loan requirements during specific periods,” including a war, other military operation or national emergency, according to the memo.\n\nThe lawsuit filed Thursday argues that the Heroes Act does not grant the President such broad authority.\n\nWhat happens next\n\nAdditional lawsuits challenging Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan could be forthcoming. Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, a Republican, has said he is working on developing the best legal theory to sue the administration over the action.\n\nA conservative advocacy group called the Job Creators Network is also weighing its legal options, planning to file a lawsuit once the Department of Education formalizes the student loan forgiveness plan next month.\n\nBut some legal experts are skeptical that a legal challenge to Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan could be successful.\n\nAbby Shafroth, staff attorney at the nonprofit National Consumer Law Center, previously told CNN that she believes the merits of the Biden administration’s legal statutory authority are strong and that it’s unclear who would have legal standing to bring a case and want to do so. Standing to bring a case is a procedural threshold requiring that an injury be inflicted on a plaintiff to justify a lawsuit.\n\nIf the standing hurdle is cleared, a case would be heard by a district court first – which may or may not issue a preliminary injunction to prevent the cancellation from occurring before a final ruling is issued on the merits of the hypothetical case.\n\nSeveral recent US Supreme Court decisions have touched on executive power, limiting the federal government’s authority to implement new rules. While the Supreme Court takes up a small number of cases each year, lower courts may look at what the justices have said in those cases when assessing the Department of Education’s authority.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.", "authors": ["Katie Lobosco"], "publish_date": "2022/09/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/24/politics/student-loans-joe-biden-white-house/index.html", "title": "Biden announces student loan relief for borrowers making less than ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Wednesday announced historic new steps to address student loan debt, which includes forgiving up to $20,000 for millions of borrowers and extending the payment freeze one final time until the end of the year.\n\n“Education is a ticket to a better life. … but over time that ticket has become too expensive for too many Americans,” Biden said during a speech from the White House. “All this means that an entire generation is now saddled with unsustainable debt in exchange for an attempt, at least, at a college degree. The burden is so heavy that even if you graduate you may not have access to the middle-class life that the college degree once provided.”\n\nThe President’s sweeping plan on student loans follows extended, down-to-the-wire negotiations at the White House among stakeholders and lawmakers ahead of when payments were set to resume at the end of this month. The decision is already disappointing many, with those on the left arguing that the President should have provided even more loan forgiveness and those on the right asserting that Biden is punishing Americans who avoided going into debt. But it fulfills one of Biden’s campaign promises, issuing major reforms to America’s student loan system and providing relief to millions of current and future borrowers.\n\nBorrowers who hold loans with the Department of Education and make less than $125,000 a year are eligible for up to $20,000 in student loan forgiveness if they received Pell Grants, which are given to students from low- and middle-income families. Individuals who make less than $125,000 a year but did not receive Pell Grants are eligible for $10,000 in loan forgiveness.\n\nBiden said that the administration’s “targeted actions are for families that need it the most: working and middle class people hit especially hard during the pandemic making under $125,000 a year,” emphasizing that “about 90% of the eligible beneficiaries make under $75,000.”\n\n“I understand not everything I’m announcing is going to make everybody happy,” Biden said. “Some think it’s too much – I find it interesting how some of my Republican friends who voted for those tax cuts think we shouldn’t be helping these folks. Some think it’s too little, but I believe my plan is responsible and fair. It focuses the benefit of middle-class and working families, it helps both current and future borrowers and it’ll fix a badly broken system.”\n\nThe Department of Education will announce details on how borrowers can claim this relief through an application in the coming weeks. Millions of borrowers will be able to receive relief automatically based on existing income data.\n\nAdditionally, the department is proposing a federal rule aimed at making the student loan system more manageable for current and future borrowers.\n\nThe proposed rule would change income-based repayment for student loans, cutting in half the amount borrowers would have to pay each month on their undergraduate loans, “while borrowers with both undergraduate and graduate loans will pay a weighted average rate.”\n\nThe proposal would also “raise the amount of income that is considered non-discretionary income and therefore protected from repayment.” And it would forgive loan balances after 10 years of payments rather than 20 years under many income-driven repayment plans for borrowers with original loan balances of $12,000 or less, the department said.\n\nThe proposed rule includes other changes, like simplifying borrowers’ choices among loan repayment plans.\n\nUnintended consequences\n\nBiden on Wednesday argued that “the whole economy is better off” as a result of his new plan.\n\n“By resuming student loan payments at the same time we provide targeted relief, we’re taking an economically responsible course. As a consequence, $50 billion dollars a year will start coming back into the Treasury because of the resumption of debt,” he said, later adding, “There is plenty of deficit reduction to pay for the programs … many times over.”\n\nAlthough student debt cancellation will deliver financial relief to millions of Americans, it would shift the cost to Uncle Sam.\n\nA one-time cancellation of $10,000 for each borrower earning up to $125,000 a year could cost the government nearly $300 billion, according to an estimate from the Penn Wharton Budget Model. Additional forgiveness for Pell grant recipients was not included in the estimate.\n\nPlus, loan cancellation won’t address the root of the problem: college affordability. There is currently $1.6 trillion of outstanding federal student loan debt. The amount of outstanding debt would return to that level in just four years after $10,000 per borrower was canceled, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\n\nWhite House officials on Wednesday could not provide a topline price estimate for the plan, saying too many unknowns exist to calculate how much the plan might eventually cost.\n\nSusan Rice, the White House’s domestic policy adviser, said it would depend on how many eligible borrowers sign up through the Department of Education to have their loans relieved.\n\n“If 43 million borrowers take it up, that’ll be different than if 50% of those 43 million take it up,” Rice said.\n\nStudent loan cancellation also could increase inflation – though many experts say the effect would be modest, because borrowers generally pay back their student loans over time. They wouldn’t receive a lump sum of money if some of their debt is canceled. They would instead be required to pay less money each month toward their student loan payments.\n\n“The inflationary impact its certainly positive, but I don’t think it would be much. We’re talking about a pretty small impact,” said Kent Smetters, faculty director of the Penn Wharton Budget Model.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Commentator reacts to Biden's student loan forgiveness plan 02:21 - Source: CNN\n\nWarnings over inflation\n\nLarry Summers, a former Treasury Secretary who served as the director of the National Economic Council under President Barack Obama, argued ahead of the announced plan that relief would contribute to inflation.\n\n“I hope the Administration does not contribute to inflation macro economically by offering unreasonably generous student loan relief or micro economically by encouraging college tuition increases,” Summers tweeted on Tuesday, later adding, “Student loan debt relief is spending that raises demand and increases inflation. It consumes resources that could be better used helping those who did not, for whatever reason, have the chance to attend college. It will also tend to be inflationary by raising tuitions.”\n\nJason Furman, the chairman of former President Barack Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers, added, “Pouring roughly half trillion dollars of gasoline on the inflationary fire that is already burning is reckless. Doing it while going well beyond one campaign promise ($10K of student loan relief) and breaking another (all proposals paid for) is even worse.”\n\nMarc Goldwein, the senior vice president and senior policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget – a nonpartisan group that tracks federal spending – argued against the plan in an interview with CNN’s Poppy Harlow on “Newsroom” Tuesday morning.\n\nHe believes that canceling $10,000 of debt for each borrower will likely increase inflation, undermine the stated goal of Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act and will not significantly decrease the racial wealth gap.\n\n“The Inflation Reduction Act saves maybe $300 billion dollars in the first 10 years. If we cancel $10,000 of debt and just extend the pause a few months, we’re going to be at about that much in terms of new cost,” he said. “All the deficit reduction will be wiped out. At the same time, we’re probably going to do more to increase inflation from debt cancellation than any inflation reduction from the Inflation Reduction Act.”\n\nIt’s also not easy to target loan forgiveness to those who need it the most and exclude borrowers with higher salaries. An income threshold that cuts off borrowers who earn more than $125,000 a year could help make sure a bigger proportion of the relief goes to low-income borrowers. But some doctors and lawyers, who will eventually be making high incomes, may also reap the benefits.\n\nThe Penn Wharton Budget Model also breaks down the share of forgiven debt by income group assuming that $10,000 is canceled for borrowers earning less than $125,000 per year and households earning less than $250,000.\n\nIt found that one-third of the canceled dollars would go to households who earn less than $50,795 a year. A little more than half of the debt relief would go to those earning between $50,795 and $141,096.\n\nRoughly 14% of the canceled dollars would go to households earning more than $141,096 a year.\n\nPolitical pressure\n\nBiden has been facing political pressure from the left to broadly cancel student loan debt since taking office.\n\nKey Democratic lawmakers, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, had called on Biden to cancel $50,000 per borrower. The President spoke with Schumer, Warren and Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia on Tuesday ahead of the expected announcement.\n\nSchumer and Warren said in a joint statement that the decision is “a giant step forward in addressing the student debt crisis.”\n\n“The positive impacts of this move will be felt by families across the country, particularly in minority communities, and is the single most effective action that the President can take on his own to help working families and the economy,” they added.\n\nEarlier this week amid reports of Biden’s plan, NAACP President Derrick Johnson called the reported provisions insufficient and “not how you treat Black voters.”\n\nA senior administration official on Wednesday suggested that the relief it will help “narrow the racial wealth gap.”\n\nAnd Biden, in his remarks, acknowledged that the burden of student debt “is especially heavy on Black and Hispanic borrowers, who on average have less family wealth to pay for it. “\n\nBiden has consistently pushed back on canceling that much, suggesting he would support wiping away $10,000 for borrowers below a certain income threshold. On the campaign trail, Biden called for immediately canceling a minimum of $10,000 in student debt per person as a response to the pandemic, as well as forgiving all undergraduate tuition-related federal student debt from two- and four-year public colleges and universities for those borrowers earning up to $125,000 a year. But he had also said he preferred Congress to take action rather than using executive power to do so.\n\nAnd on the right, Republican lawmakers blasted Biden’s new relief plan.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said the plan is “yet another way to make inflation even worse” and “reward far-left activists.”\n\n“President Biden’s student loan socialism is a slap in the face to every family who sacrificed to save for college, every graduate who paid their debt, and every American who chose a certain career path or volunteered to serve in our Armed Forces in order to avoid taking on debt,” he continued. “This policy is astonishingly unfair.”\n\nAppearing to counter his critics – particularly Republicans who voted for the Trump tax plan – the President said on Wednesday he would “never apologize for helping … working Americans and the middle class – especially not to the same folks who voted for a $2 trillion tax cut that mainly benefited the wealthiest Americans and the biggest corporations.”\n\nBiden said no one complained that the $700 billion in forgiven small business loans as a part of former President Donald Trump’s Covid-19 relief would make inflation worse.\n\nAsked if the debt cancellation was fair to those who had already paid their loans or never took them out in the first place, Biden responded: “Is it fair to the people who, in fact, do not own multi-million businesses and see these guys getting all the tax breaks?”\n\nBiden has already canceled billions of dollars in student loan debt\n\nIn the meantime, Biden has taken a more targeted approach to student debt relief. Most of his efforts have been meant to expand and streamline existing federal student loan forgiveness programs.\n\nBiden’s administration has authorized the cancellation of $32 billion so far – more than any other administration – largely for borrowers who were defrauded by their for-profit colleges and for permanently disabled borrowers.\n\nHe has also temporarily expanded the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program that forgives the debt of government and nonprofit workers after 10 years of payments, and made changes to the income-driven repayment plans, bringing millions of borrowers closer to forgiveness.\n\nBut the programs are complicated and don’t always work the way they should. A recent Government Accountability Office report found that few people have qualified for forgiveness under an income-driven repayment plan, for example. The Department of Education had approved forgiveness for a total of 157 loans as of June 1, 2021. Meanwhile about 7,700 loans in repayment may have already been eligible for forgiveness.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Department of Education said in its statement that the administration is “proposing long-term changes” to the PSLF program.\n\n“Specifically, the Department proposed allowing more payments to qualify for PSLF including partial, lump sum, and late payments, and allowing certain kinds of deferments and forbearances – such as those for Peace Corps and AmeriCorps service, National Guard duty, and military service – to count toward PSLF,” the release states.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Phil Mattingly Katie Lobosco Maegan Vazquez", "Phil Mattingly", "Katie Lobosco", "Maegan Vazquez"], "publish_date": "2022/08/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/24/politics/biden-student-loan-forgiveness-qualify/index.html", "title": "How to qualify for Biden's new student loan forgiveness plan | CNN ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Wednesday announced his plan to address student loan debt, which includes debt forgiveness for certain borrowers and extending the pandemic-related payment pause.\n\nThe Biden administration has already canceled nearly $32 billion of the $1.6 trillion in outstanding federal student debt by expanding existing forgiveness programs for public-sector workers, disabled borrowers and students who were defrauded by for-profit colleges.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Biden forgave $10K in student debt.

A federal Pell grant is only given to undergraduate students who “display exceptional financial need and have not earned a bachelor’s, graduate, or professional degree” and “does not have to be repaid, except under certain circumstances,” according to the Department of Education’s Federal Student Aid office. Per data cited by the White House, Pell grants currently only cover a third of the cost of a four-year public college degree, which has led to increased borrowing.\n\nIndividual borrowers who make less than $125,000 yearly and married couples or heads of households who make less than $250,000 yearly will have up $10,000 of their federal student loan debt forgiven if they did not receive a Pell grant as an undergraduate student, per the FSA website.\n\nIndividual borrowers who make less than $125,000 yearly and married couples or heads of households who make less than $250,000 yearly but did receive a Pell grant as an undergraduate student will have up $20,000 of their student loan debt forgiven.\n\nWhat steps do eligible borrowers have to take?\n\nNearly 8 million borrowers may be able to receive debt forgiveness automatically because the Department of Education already has their income information, FSA says.\n\nThe Biden administration will launch an application in the coming weeks for borrowers to provide their income information or if borrowers are unsure if the department has their income information already. The application will be available by early October, a senior administration official told CNN. After a borrower completes the application, the individual can expect the student loan relief within four to six weeks, the official also said.\n\nTo be notified when the application is open, borrowers can sign up at studentaid.gov.\n\nFSA says the application will be available before the federal student loan repayment pause ends on December 31. Borrowers are advised to apply before November 15 in order to receive relief before the repayment pause expires, but the Department of Education will continue to process applications even after the pause expires, the official noted.\n\nBorrowers can sign up for updates on when the application is open at the Department of Education’s subscriptions page.\n\nHow will future repayments for remaining debt work?\n\nStudent loan repayment will be paused again until December 31, 2022, with repayments starting in January 2023.\n\nThe Biden administration is also proposing a rule to create a new income-driven repayment plan in which borrowers pay no more than 5% of their monthly income on undergraduate loans, a decrease from the current 10% threshold.\n\nThe rule would also increase the amount of income that is considered “non-discretionary income” so no borrower earning below 225% of the federal poverty level will have to make a monthly payment.\n\nFor borrowers with loan balances of $12,000 or less, loan balances would be forgiven after 10 years of payments instead of the current 20-year mark, under the proposed new income-driven repayment plan.\n\nAnd to help prevent a borrower’s loan balance from growing while the individual makes monthly payments, under the proposed rule the Biden administration would cover unpaid monthly interest, even if the monthly payment is $0 due to the borrower’s income level.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.", "authors": ["Chandelis Duster"], "publish_date": "2022/08/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/08/24/biden-student-loan-debt-forgiveness-updates/7867780001/", "title": "'Debt and no degree': Biden cancels $20K in student loan debt: recap", "text": "WASHINGTON – Millions of Americans saddled by student loan debt breathed a sigh of relief Wednesday.\n\nDelivering on a key campaign promise, President Joe Biden announced he would cancel at least $10,000 in student loan debt for millions of borrowers, as well as $20,000 to Pell Grant recipients.

Click here to share.\n\nWhy the White House won’t say how much loan forgiveness will cost\n\nWhite House officials said they could not put a price tag on the loan forgiveness program in part because they don’t know how many eligible borrowers will apply for relief.\n\n“Realistically, we're not going to get to 100%. But the question is, how far short of 100% are we going to be?” said Bharat Ramamurti, deputy director of the National Economic Council.\n\nVoices:Biden's student loan forgiveness is a good start, but it falls short for borrowers like me\n\nIn addition, the amount of money the government expects to collect on outstanding debt in the future fluctuates based on economic conditions and other factors. If a borrower was never going to repay the $10,000 that will now be forgiven, Ramamurti said, then “it's not reasonable to say that the cost of that is $10,000, because we were not realistically going to collect anywhere close to $10,000 from it.”\n\nThe administration also wants to factor in the economic benefits it says will flow from relieving debt burdens. If more people will be able to start businesses or buy a home, that creates new tax revenue which offsets the front-end costs of the program, Ramamurti said.\n\n“The bottom line here is that there's all these different factors that go into the cost,” he said. “Standing here today, I can't tell you how all of those are going to shake out.”\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nPreventing future tuition increases?\n\nThe Education Department will keep an eye on whether schools raise their tuition in expectation that changes to the loan program will make it easier for students to take on more debt, White House officials said.\n\n“This is something the Department of Education is aware of,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters. “This is something that we’re monitoring.”\n\nSusan Rice, Biden’s domestic policy adviser, said too many colleges have jacked up prices while making wild promises about how much students can earn after getting a degree. She said the Education Department will publish annually a list of institutions that are “the worst actors.”\n\nRice also emphasized that the 2021 coronavirus relief package included both state and local funding, as well as money targeted to higher education, that she said should be used “to make sure that public institutions don't increase their tuition and expenses greater than the rate of inflation.”\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nWhite House 'happy' to debate fairness of policy\n\nRice said the administration is eager to take on criticisms that loan forgiveness is unfair to some, including people who paid off their loans without help or found other ways – such as military service – to finance their education.\n\n“This is a debate we are happy to have,” she said.\n\nRice said everyone in the nation benefits when the middle and working class do well. This relief will be targeted to those who need it most, she said.\n\nPeople who paid off their loans deserve credit for doing so, she added.\n\n“That’s fantastic,” she said. “But that doesn’t mean that because some were able to do so, nobody should help those who weren’t.”\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren lauds Biden's action\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and other progressive Democrats had been pushing Biden for months to cancel up to $50,000 in debt per borrower. If she was disappointed with Biden's announcement, however, she didn’t show it.\n\n“The cancellation the president is offering is historic,” Warren said. “It will be life changing for tens of millions of people. I will keep pushing to raise the numbers, but we need to pause for a minute to recognize just how powerful the president’s announcement today is.”\n\nWarren also gave credit to Biden for limiting how much borrowers will have to pay on their loans through income-driven repayment plans. Ultimately, she said the debt cancellation is a bet on the country’s future.\n\n“This is America saying that our people, even people who don’t have a lot of money, are our best investment,” she said. “And we’re just going to keep right on investing. I love it.”\n\n– Chris Quintana\n\nRepublicans attack Biden’s plan\n\nCongressional Republicans attacked President Joe Biden’s decision to forgive up to $20,000 in student loans as a giveaway to the left wing of the Democratic party.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy called Biden’s plan a “debt transfer scam,” charging that Americans who have already paid their debts will be forced to foot the bill for the forgiven loans.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell described the move as a “slap in the face” to Americans who chose not to go to college or already paid their debt.\n\n“This is the one consistent thread that connects Democrats’ policies: Taking money and purchasing power away from working families and redistributing it to their favored friends.”\n\nSenator John Barrasso of Wyoming, chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, called the move “an insult to every American who played by the rules and worked hard to responsibly pay off their own debt.”\n\n“Once again, the Biden administration is selling out working families to appease the far-left wing of the Democrat party,” Barrasso said in a statement.\n\nThe Republican National Committee said the decision will immediately increase inflation while costing taxpayers $300 billion.\n\n– Maureen Groppe and Ella Lee\n\nBiden to fight to double Pell Grant, says relief is about 'possibilities'\n\nBiden said he is going to continue to fight to double the Pell Grant. “I didn't get that done this time,” he said.\n\nHe added that his announcement on relief is “about opportunities.”\n\n“It's about giving people a fair shot,” he said. “It's about the one word America can be defined by, possibilities. It's all about providing possibilities.”\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nIncome-based loan repayment\n\nBiden also introduced a plan for paying back loans based on discretionary income.\n\nDiscretionary money is what's left after paying taxes and necessary cost-of-living expenses. It's different from disposable income, which is simply the amount left after paying taxes.\n\nKnowing what discretionary income is important because many federal student loan repayment plans are income-driven and have payments that are based on discretionary income.\n\n“It’s a game changer,” Biden said.\n\n– Ella Lee and Medora Lee\n\nBiden said debt relief is 'economically responsible'\n\nBiden said the relief to some student loan borrowers is “an economically responsible course.”\n\n“As we provide targeted relief, we’re taking an economically responsible course,” Biden said, pushing back on concerns of how the relief will impact inflation.\n\n“Independent experts agree that these actions taken together will provide real benefits for families without meaningful effect on inflation,” Biden said.\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nBiden: ‘It’s time for the payments to resume.’\n\nBiden said the moratorium on student loan payments will be extended one last time to Dec. 31.\n\n“We’ve wound down pandemic relief programs like the ones, unemployment insurance and small businesses. It’s time we do the same thing for student loans,” Biden said. “It’s time for the payments to resume.”\n\n– Kenneth Tran\n\n'Three key factors' to Biden's student loan response\n\nBiden announced three key components of his student loan relief plan: an extension on the student loan moratorium to Dec. 31, the cancellation of $20,000 in debt for Pell Grant recipients and $10,000 for other borrowers and “fixing the student loan system itself.”\n\n“All this means people can finally crawl out from under that mountain of debt, to get on top of their rent and utilities, to finally think about buying a home or starting a family or starting a business” Biden said. “When this happens, the whole economy is better off.”\n\n– Ella Lee\n\nCanceling debt is a ‘Band-Aid;' advocates want college to be more affordable\n\nSome education advocates are saying they want to see more from the Biden administration to address future student loan debt.\n\nWhile the National Parents Union, an education policy advocacy group, praised the Biden administration for taking steps to cancel student loan debt, “there is still much work to be done.”\n\n\"Canceling $10,000 in student loan debt merely puts a Band-Aid on the real problem of reforming the system that has landed us in this mess — and within years we will be right back at the same point,” they said.\n\nThe group noted that the average debt is $12,000 for a borrower who is white. However, Black women on average have more than $52,000 in debt.\n\n“While this will take some of the immediate burden away from many families, addressing those inequitable conditions, including the lack of generational wealth and additional support resources that many are forced to make up for through additional borrowing, we have not seen enough to address the underlying inequity of these systems that perpetuate economic inequality,” the group said.\n\nThe group said they want to see lawmakers make college more affordable and accessible.\n\nBraxton Brewington, spokesperson for the Debt Collective, a group that has organized demonstrations calling for total student loan debt cancellation, said today’s action was a first step worth celebrating but it fell “short of what economic and racial justice demands.”\n\n“The even better news is that Biden’s authority to cancel student debt doesn’t disappear after one executive use — he can and should simply cancel more student debt, which would boost the economy, narrow the racial wealth gap and grant real financial freedom to communities across the country for whom $20,000 or $10,000 of cancelation offers little relief,” Braxton said.\"\n\n– Rebecca Morin and Chris Quintana\n\nA tough decision:How soaring inflation is complicating Biden's decision whether to forgive student loan debt\n\nPell Grants at 50: Loss of buying power has Congress rethinking ways of paying for college\n\nWho will be affected?\n\nAccording to the Education Department, about 90% of those receiving relief, and who aren’t in school, make less than $75,000 a year.\n\nAmong eligible borrowers, 21% are 25 or younger and nearly half are between the ages of 26 and 39. More than a third are over 40, including 5% of whom are senior citizens.\n\n– Chris Quintana\n\nMarket and corporate America eye Biden plan with caution, as inflation specter looms\n\nCorporations and the wider market have had mixed reactions to Biden's student loan forgiveness plan. Backers of the move see it as a smart way to give consumers more money to buy homes and goods. Other market watchers are concerned that investors would see negative stock portfolios if the economy shrinks in response to wiped out loan debt.\n\nIf forgiveness sparks more inflation, it could also pressure the value of the dollar. The Brookings Institution has calculated that a $10,000 reprieve would add up to a wipeout of debt larger than many social safety nets combined, including WIC, SNAP and federal school lunch plans.\n\n– Riley Gutiérrez McDermid\n\nFuture payments for lower- and middle-income borrowers could be cut in half\n\nThe Education Department is proposing to halve the monthly payments for some borrowers from 10% to 5% of discretionary income — the amount that borrowers have to pay each month on their undergraduate loans. The proposal also would raise the amount of income considered \"nondiscretionary\" — which means it's protected from being used for repaying loans.\n\nFor some types of loan repayment plans, balances would be forgiven after 10 years of payment instead of 20. And, the rule would fully cover the borrower’s unpaid monthly interest, so a borrower’s loan balance wouldn't grow if they are making required payments.\n\nThe department said the proposal will be published in the near future in the Federal Register and open for comments for 30 days.\n\n– Nirvi Shah\n\nEducation Department: Millions of borrowers' student loans will be forgiven automatically\n\nThe Education Department said nearly 8 million borrowers are likely to get their loan forgiven automatically because the agency already has information about their income.\n\nMore details will be coming in the next few weeks.\n\nOther borrowers will have to apply for loan forgiveness, and the applications will be available “no later” than when the freeze on student loan payments ends later this year.\n\n– Chris Quintana\n\nAn unprecedented move\n\nThe mass cancellation of student loans is unprecedented in the nation's history of student borrowing — but there has been little precedent in the student loan landscape for more than two and a half years.\n\nAt the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, then-President Donald Trump paused student loan payments, set interest rates at zero percent and stopped collection attempts on overdue debts. Both Trump and Biden extended the moratorium multiple times. The most recent extension was April 6, less than 30 days before payments had been scheduled to start in May. It was set to expire Aug. 31, with some borrowers getting notices that were later retracted about payments resuming Sep. 1.\n\nThe administration already has erased roughly $32 billion in student debt for 1.6 million borrowers by widening the eligibility requirements for pre-existing relief programs. It cleared the debt of those who attended predatory colleges and the permanently disabled. It also has canceled more than $10 billion in student debt for those working in the public sector.\n\nBiden's latest plans mean forgiving billions more in student loan debt for millions of borrowers, eclipsing the administration’s past actions. Yet millions of Americans will be left with student loan debt, especially those who pursued advanced degrees or had less financial support from their families or scholarships to pay for college.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/24"}]}

Recalling the man behind the scars and how different he was away from the game, Finley added: “I have many fond memories of the grace, respect, and special effort he took with all those close to him.”\n\nAnd that was the paradox of Ted Lindsay, who died at 93 years old, while under hospice care, on Monday morning, according to his family. Off the ice, he was a gentleman who had many friends. And he was a philanthropist who became deeply involved in his community.\n\nOn the ice, Lindsay was cocky and abrasive and would do anything to win. He was a highly unusual player in the post-World War II National Hockey League, a brainy boat-rocker who repeatedly challenged the conservative league establishment. Those qualities — plus his enormous talent — made him one of the most memorable and controversial players in NHL history and a fan favorite for decades in metro Detroit, where he lived for more than 70 years.\n\nMore:Ted Lindsay facts: He started a Stanley Cup tradition, players' union\n\n“I hated everybody I played against, and they hated me,” Lindsay was fond of saying. “That’s the way hockey should be played.”\n\nAway from the game Lindsay was patient, generous and even tender. Despite his super-star status, he drove through winter nights to appear at countless sports banquets across Michigan and Ontario, and thought nothing of driving even to Sault Ste. Marie for the night to make a speech about hockey. He devoted a lot of time to charity. When the 9-year-old son of a friend was diagnosed with autism, Lindsay established a foundation to raise money for autism research.\n\n“Ted never let fame go to his head,” said Joe Lapointe, a longtime sportswriter for the Free Press and New York Times.\n\nLindsay was only 5-foot-8 and 165 pounds, and people who met him often expressed surprise someone so small could be such a terror. “When I put my skates on I’m 6-foot-5,” he told them.\n\nLindsay punched far above his weight for 14 seasons with the Red Wings and three seasons with the Chicago Blackhawks between 1944 and 1965. When Lindsay was at his peak, in the early 1950s, the Wings were the team to beat in the NHL, winning four Stanley Cups in six years.\n\nIn 1964, four years after he retired as a Blackhawk, he made a one-season comeback with the Wings at 39, surprising critics with his skills and endurance.\n\nRebel with a cause\n\nDuring his prime, Look magazine described Lindsay, darting about the ice in the crimson Detroit uniform, as “a blood-red flash of cold fury” and “a picture of unmitigated villainy.”\n\nThe Free Press wrote that hockey fans pictured Lindsay “as a cross between Jack the Ripper and Al Capone.”\n\nLindsay mocked opponents, pushed referees and argued with Jack Adams, the tyrannical Detroit coach and general manager whom most players feared. Lindsay blasted the disciplinary hearings of NHL president Clarence Campbell, a former war-crimes prosecutor, as a “kangaroo court” and shocked NHL owners when he filed an anti-trust lawsuit against the league during his attempt to form a players’ association in the late 1950s.\n\nMore:Ted Lindsay dies: Hockey world mourns on social media\n\nThe suit was a daring move, and while the union effort fell short, it set the stage for the founding of the NHL Players’ Association in 1967. Adams traded Lindsay for masterminding the union drive (with Montreal’s Doug Harvey), and it soured the once-close friendship between Lindsay and Gordie Howe, who voted against the union.\n\n“Lindsay represented everything Clarence Campbell abhorred in a hockey player: cockiness, irreverence and disrespect,” wrote the authors of “Net Worth,” an authoritative book on NHL finances that was turned into a 1995 Canadian movie in which Lindsay was the hero and Adams the villain.\n\nBy 1958 the campaign for an association had ended, though the NHL met some of the players’ demands. A permanent players’ association was formed in 1967, and today, the association bestows the Ted Lindsay Award annually to the NHL’s most outstanding player, as voted by association members.\n\n“When I did it the NHL was a dictatorship. I just wanted to give us a voice. We had no voice,” Lindsay told the authors of “Net Worth.”\n\n“I’d do it again. I was not a crusader, I wasn’t trying to change hockey. It was just something we as players needed as a vehicle to be able to discuss things. The effort was not a failure, because we did make a few gains and we paved the way” for the players’ association.\n\nIn retirement, Lindsay was estranged from the Wings, owned at the time by Bruce Norris, who bitterly fought Lindsay during the unionization drive. But in 1977, Norris hired him to be general manager and, later, coach.\n\nAt the time, the Florida-based Norris, the dissolute scion of the family that had owned the team since 1932, was bankrupting the family fortune, and the “Dead Wings” were one of the NHL’s worst teams. Lindsay set off a buzz among Detroit fans with his initial marketing slogan, “Aggressive Hockey is Back in Town,” but his three years in the front office were a failure in almost every respect, the opposite of his storied career.\n\nThe Production Line\n\nIn 1,068 regular season games, Lindsay scored 379 goals and had 472 assists for 851 points. He added 47 goals for 96 points in 133 playoff games. When he retired for the first time in 1960, the only players who had amassed more points than him were two all-time greats, Howe and Montreal’s Maurice (The Rocket) Richard.\n\nIn 2017 an NHL panel named Lindsay one of the 100 best players in league history. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1966. The Red Wings retired his No. 7 jersey in 1991 and unveiled a statue in his honor in Joe Louis Arena in 2008.\n\nLindsay’s aggressiveness as a player and insolence toward NHL authority figures endeared him to hockey fans in rough-and-tumble Detroit during the city’s postwar go-go years. Fans in other NHL cities heckled Lindsay, and he heckled them back. On at least one occasion, Lindsay tussled with a spectator.\n\nDuring Lindsay’s 14 seasons with the Red Wings, they won 10 league championships in addition to their four Stanley Cups. Lindsay, who served as team captain even though Adams worried about his influence on other players, was often among league leaders in both scoring and penalty minutes. Beyond his belligerence, he was an excellent skater, shooter and passer. He was, in many respects, the perfectly well-rounded NHL player: a highly skilled leader who is the craziest and hardest-working guy on the team.\n\nLindsay starred with center Sid Abel and right wing Howe on the Wings’ famed Production Line, one of the league’s greatest trios, which tormented the NHL from 1947 to 1952.\n\nIn the 1949-50 season, Lindsay, Abel and Howe finished 1-2-3 in league scoring, and the Wings won their first Cup of the decade. In 1949, during a seven-game semifinal playoff series against Montreal, the line accounted for 12 of 17 Red Wing goals. After Abel was traded in 1952, Lindsay and Howe continued their tear, accounting for roughly one-third of all Red Wing goals over a nine-year period.\n\n1950 Cup Final, Gm7: Cup-Hoisting\n\n\"They are both unorthodox, crisscrossing on the ice so that no one really is a right wing, a center or left wing,” Abel said in 1957.\n\nAs a player, Lindsay stopped at little. Even elbowing and kneeing were part of his arsenal until the NHL made them two-minute penalties. He used his stick as a cudgel and a sword.\n\nOne of Lindsay’s most infamous confrontations took place in January 1951 with Bill Ezinicki of the Boston Bruins, a frequent opponent since junior hockey. The two, the most penalized players in the NHL the previous season, started with shoving, then moved on to swinging sticks at each other’s heads before they slugged it out — for a full minute.\n\nThe clash finished when Ezinicki charged Lindsay from behind. Lindsay suddenly spun, flattening Ezinicki with one lightning punch. Ezinicki was left unconscious on the ice and needed 19 stitches in his face. He also suffered a broken nose and lost a tooth. Lindsay had bleeding knuckles.\n\nReferee George Gravel handed Lindsay and Eziniki rare match penalties for “deliberately injuring an opponent.” Campbell suspended each player for the next three games between their two teams.\n\n“It was a rousing battle as hockey fights go, but was a sickening and disgusting display of sportsmanship,” wrote Marshall Dann, the Free Press hockey writer.\n\nLindsay’s assertive attitude also is behind a celebrated NHL tradition — the parading of the Stanley Cup on the ice by players after they win the post-season playoffs. It first happened at Olympia Stadium in Detroit in 1950 after the Wings defeated the New York Rangers in seven games, including a double-overtime victory in the seventh game. Lindsay spontaneously hoisted the shining trophy and skated around so fans could see it.\n\n\"I recognized who was paying my salary. It wasn't the owners,” Lindsay told the Toronto Globe and Mail in 2013. \"I saw all the people sitting there so I picked it up and took it to them.”\n\nLindsay took the initiative in his private life, too. In the early 1950s, when many hockey players worked menial jobs to earn extra cash in the summer, Lindsay saw a way to make real money, and he established a plastics businesses in Livonia with teammate Marty Pavelich and, for a time, Howe.\n\nLindsay had lived in southeast Michigan since the mid-1940s. Multiple generations of Detroiters came to know him as an approachable presence at Red Wings’ games, local rinks, restaurants and charity functions, always willing to strike a humorous pose with his fist clenched against the jaw of a smiling fan.\n\nLindsay was calm and serious, but he laughed easily. He sometimes sounded gruff when he talked, often expressing belief in such old-fashioned virtues as hard work and honesty. He criticized modern athletes — and hockey itself — for being soft.\n\nHe was generous with his time. Over the years, Lindsay served as chairman of the Easter Seals campaign and coached the hockey team at Hillsdale College, driving frequently to Jackson, where the team practiced, charging only expenses.\n\nSince 2001, the Ted Lindsay Foundation has raised more than $4 million for autism research, while using only 13 percent of its donations for operating expenses, the foundations says. In December, the foundation pledged $1 million to support Oakland University’s autism outreach efforts.\n\nLindsay was a physical fitness devotee who for years after his final NHL game continued playing hockey, in men’s leagues or pick-up games, just like legions of metro Detroiters have done for years. At one point, he was rising at 3 a.m. to make an early game in Windsor.\n\nIn the late 1970s, when Lindsay was the Wings’ general manager, he joined a weekly pickup game at Olympia for anyone who worked in the building, from media to Zamboni drivers. Lindsay was more than twice the age of some players, but he still dominated the games with his skating and puck control. He bought beer for the players after games yet never stayed around to drink it with them.\n\n“Ted Lindsay would check you into the boards!” said Tom Henderson, a veteran journalist who played in those games. “If you grew up in Detroit — that was unbelievable. That was like Ty Cobb spiking you.”\n\nAt one morning game in Southfield in 1976, Ted and his 21-year-old son, Blake, skated on opposing teams. At one point, Blake complained about getting high-sticked by another player.\n\n“What’s wrong, cant you take it?” his father yelled at him.\n\n“You’re a good one to say that,” Blake responded. “What did you do, leave your brains in your locker?”\n\nTed stalked off the ice, showered, left the rink and refused to speak to Blake for three weeks.\n\n“He did that only because he loves you,” Marty Pavelich, a former Wing and close Lindsay friend, told Blake. “He would have killed anybody else for saying that.”\n\nTaunting Toronto fans\n\nLindsay gained a national audience in the 1970s when he served as a color commentator for games on NBC. He also hosted his own sports show on Saturday evenings before Hockey Night in Canada telecasts on what was then CKLW-TV in Windsor. Even on television, Lindsay had a polarizing effect, not unlike commentator Don Cherry in recent times. One of Lindsay’s memorable expressions was “laying on the lumber,” a phrase he used when a player hit another player with his stick.\n\n“Since NBC signed him up, Lindsay’s devotion to violence, brutality and mayhem on the ice has been drummed into American living rooms with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer,” a Philadelphia sportswriter wrote in 1975.\n\nAs a player, Lindsay defended his tactics as necessary to survive at his size in the six-city NHL, in which teams played each other 14 times a season, traveled by train and no one — not even goalies — wore helmets or face shields.\n\n“I’ve been slashed, speared, elbowed, board-checked, butt-ended and hit on the head as much as anyone,” Lindsay said in a 1976 interview. “I just like to keep the ledger balanced.”\n\nOne game that encapsulated Lindsay’s nerve, ability and flamboyance took place in Toronto on March 24, 1956, during a tough playoff series against the Maple Leafs.\n\nThe Wings led, 2-0, after two games in Detroit. Leafs’ fans seethed after Toronto’s Tod Sloan was injured during a run-in with Howe. As the series shifted to Maple Leaf Gardens, an unidentified man called Toronto newspapers and said, “Don’t worry about Howe and Lindsay tonight. I’m going to shoot them if they play.”\n\nAuthorities took no chances. The Gardens was crawling with police that night, and the threat was big news, intensifying the tension that surrounded the series. Howe and Lindsay suited up, and Lindsay got revenge by scoring the tying goal late in the third period and then notching the winner in overtime, when he took a pass from behind the net from Bob Goldham and shot it past goalie Harry Lumley.\n\nAfter the final buzzer, Lindsay taunted Toronto fans by putting his stick blade under his shoulder and holding the shaft as if it were a long gun. Skating around the ice, he mimicked a machine gun, yelling, “rat-tat-tat-tat.”\n\n“We figured it was a crank call and didn’t take it seriously,” Lindsay said at the time. Added Howe: “We were lucky nobody threw a firecracker or Ted and I would have dug a fox hole in the ice.”\n\n'Aggressive hockey is back in town'\n\nRobert Blake Theodore Lindsay was born in Renfrew, Ontario, near Ottawa, July 29, 1925. The youngest of nine children, Lindsay moved with his family during the Depression to Kirkland Lake, Ontario, a small gold-mining town 600 miles north of Detroit that produced several NHL players, including Mickey Redmond, the Red Wings broadcaster. As a child, Lindsay listened to Wings’ games via the powerful signal of Detroit’s WJR-AM that reached northern Ontario on cold, clear nights.\n\nLindsay’s father, Bert, was a goalie for the Montreal Wanderers and Toronto Arenas in the early years of the NHL. Ted was the first player in the NHL who was the son of a former player.\n\nBy 1944, the 19-year-old Lindsay was a star for Toronto St. Michael’s in Ontario junior hockey, and in those pre-draft days, NHL clubs signed players directly from Canadian junior teams. But the Maple Leafs managed to overlook Lindsay, despite his playing in their backyard. Adams, the Red Wings’ coach and general manager, swooped in and asked Lindsay to sign a Detroit contract. Even as a teenager, Lindsay was bold, demanding he play four-fifths of the Wings games and not be sent to the minors. Adams put it in writing, and gave him a $2,000 bonus.\n\nConn Smythe, the Leafs’ principal owner, fumed for years over Lindsay’s signing with Detroit. To rub it in, Lindsay would point to Smythe’s seat, smirking, whenever he scored or tangled with a Maple Leafs player.\n\nLindsay’s first retirement lasted fours seasons. In 1964, Abel, then the Wings coach and general manager and always a big-brother figure to Lindsay, suggested he consider making a comeback with the Wings. Lindsay came to camp and made the team.\n\n“It’s the blackest day in hockey,” said Campbell, the NHL president, “when a 39-year-old man thinks he can make a comeback in the world’s fastest sport.”\n\nLindsay played in all but one game that season, scoring 14 goals and 14 assists, and was instrumental in the Wings’ finish atop the NHL for the first time since he was traded to Chicago eight years earlier.\n\nCampbell apologized.\n\nIn the final game of his career, Lindsay scored a goal and received a 10-minute misconduct for yelling at referee Art Skov.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, a decade into Lindsay’s retirement, the once-mighty Wings found themselves in disarray. The Norris family had owned the franchise since 1932, but the family business was careening toward financial collapse and a sense of entropy permeated the hockey organization. The Wings had qualified for the playoffs only twice in 17 seasons and burned through eight coaches — many of them former Detroit players — in as many years. Jimmy Skinner, a former coach who hung on as an assistant general manager, said later he often sought advice from the portrait of Adams, who died in 1968.\n\nPressure grew from fans and Detroit sportswriters to hire Lindsay. Finally, late in the 1976-77 season — when the team had won only three of its previous 40 games — Norris relented and made Lindsay the general manager. In his first news conference, Lindsay slammed Norris, the front office, the players and the scouts, but he begged the fans to stick with the Wings.\n\n“Don’t give up on us,” he said. “I don’t expect to instill in these modern-day athletes the pride we had in our great days here — we were a different animal — but somewhere along the line, I’d like to instill it a little.”\n\nHockey fever — along with cascades of octopus and other sea creatures — returned to Detroit in 1977-78 as the Wings made the playoffs for the first time in nine years and won a playoff series for the first time in 12 years. Lindsay was named executive of the year.\n\nThe next season, though, the Wings reverted to pre-Lindsay form, finishing third worst in the NHL.\n\nAs criticism mounted, Lindsay was demoted to coach at the end of the 1979-80 season, and stripped of his general manager duties after he had put an excessive number of players under contract and blundered by signing goalie Rogie Vachon from the Los Angeles Kings without settling on compensation. That led to the Wings temporarily losing star center Dale McCourt, which resulted in a complex and time-consuming legal battle and a poisoned atmosphere in the Detroit locker room.\n\nIn November 1980, when the Wings had won only three of their first 20 games, Norris fired Lindsay.\n\nLearning how to treat others\n\nIn “Seven,” a tribute book published in Lindsay’s honor by the Red Wings in 2008, Lindsay discussed people who had helped him in his career, both as a player and a person. He brought up Larry Aurie, a Red Wing from 1927 to 1938 who was small, like Lindsay.\n\n“He showed me a lot of things about hockey,” Lindsay recalled. “He showed me how a little guy could survive. He showed me how a little guy could go out there and make little guys out of big guys.\n\n“But the most important thing he taught me was how to treat others. I’ve tried to live that way. You see, the people in my sport are very gifted. I was one of the gifted. I had a chance to make a living at the thing I love, and I have always appreciated that and I have always wanted to give something back.”\n\nBill McGraw worked as a reporter, sportswriter, editor and columnist for the Free Press for 32 years.

Guests were greeted by Paul Brown, operations manager at the Santa Claus House. “It’s always exciting to see so many of Santa’s helpers come visit him here at his house in North Pole, Alaska,” Brown said. Couples clad in red, white and green renewed wedding vows in the house with help from an ordained minister from Florida dressed as Santa. He, too, got married during the event.\n\nArizona\n\nMesa:The metro Phoenix light rail line’s latest extension opened Saturday, along with two new stations and a park-and-ride transit center. Valley Metro Rail opened the 2-mile extension of the line eastward along Main Street in Mesa to Gilbert Road, lengthening the system to 28 miles. Dignitaries participating in the ceremony included Mayors John Giles of Mesa and Kate Gallego of Phoenix and U.S. Rep. Greg Stanton, a former Phoenix mayor. The system extends westward from Mesa across Tempe and much of Phoenix, passing through downtown areas of all three cities and providing service to Arizona State University campuses in Tempe and Phoenix. The extension and transit project was funded by $173.5 million in federal funding and $10.5 million in local funding from Mesa.\n\nArkansas\n\nBentonville: Walmart has released additional plans for its new 350-acre northwest Arkansas campus that will include four quadrants connected by bike and walking paths, an on-campus child care facility and a fitness center. The world’s largest retailer said Friday that new buildings will be designed and constructed in the next two years, with a goal of opening the site in phases between 2020 and 2024. The new site is blocks away from its current Bentonville Home Office, which was built in 1971. Walmart says its new headquarters will include solar panels on some buildings and parking decks. It’ll also have “flexible workspaces” and various dining options. Walmart announced it was moving its headquarters in 2017. It has not said how much it will cost to replace the old office.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: A growing number of shipping companies are slowing down as they approach San Francisco and other ports along the state’s coast so they are less likely to injure or kill whales. Marine experts say four of the 10 gray whales found dead near San Francisco this year were killed by ships, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. When the campaign started about six years ago, only 17% of incoming ships were slowing down, said Greater Farallones National Marine Sanctuary superintendent Maria Brown. Now 45% are throttling down by half, to 10 knots. There are no speed limits at sea, so vessels can zip along as fast as they want, usually 20 knots, or about 23 mph. The large vessels often travel through national marine sanctuaries to get to their destination ports.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Gov. Jared Polis has signed legislation aimed at lowering prescription costs by importing drugs from Canada. The Denver Post reports the bill signed Thursday will require federal approval before it can take effect. Polis says he has spoken with President Donald Trump, who has praised a similar plan in Florida. The law tasks the Colorado Department of Health Care Policy and Financing with creating a plan for safely importing Canadian drugs and presenting a proposal to U.S. Health and Human Services by September 2020. Rep. Jaquez Lewis, a Boulder-area Democrat who sponsored the bill, says too many Coloradans have to choose between feeding their families and paying for life-saving drugs. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar has called the proposal a gimmick, and some are skeptical it will lower prices.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: Women who lost children to gun violence were among a crowd that gathered to break ground over the weekend on a new garden that will honor hundreds of victims killed by firearms dating back more than 50 years. The New Haven Register reports nearly 100 people took part in the ceremony Saturday at the New Haven Botanical Garden of Healing Dedicated to Victims of Gun Violence. The garden is expected to open by the spring of next year and include garden beds and bricks with information on the victims. Celestine Bradley, whose son was killed in a shooting, says the garden will be a peaceful place to remember loved ones. Officials say the garden will honor more than 600 gun violence victims killed in New Haven since 1968.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Prison officials are investigating allegations that a group of correctional employees including a warden verbally and physically harassed a woman overseeing a group of preschool children during a park outing. The May 10 incident involved a dispute over a parking spot at Glasgow Park in northern Delaware, where the prison workers were having a barbecue to celebrate National Correctional Officer Appreciation Week. Amanda Hobson of Elkton, Maryland, says the prison workers, including Warden Carole Evans, targeted her with vulgar language and obscene gestures in front of the preschoolers because they thought they were entitled to the parking space she was using. Hobson was forced to call police after the prison workers blocked in her car with one of their vehicles and with a meat smoker.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Four demonstrators arrested after a weeks­long protest inside the Venezuelan Embassy have been formally charged in federal court. Prosecutors say Kevin Bruce Zeese, Margaret Ann Flowers, Adrienne Pine and David Vernon Paul appeared before a judge Friday. They say an arrest warrant was issued last week, and the four were arrested Thursday at the embassy in Georgetown. The U.S. attorney’s office in Washington says they’ve been charged with interfering with the protective functions of the State Department. The protesters consider Nicola Maduro the legitimate Venezuelan president. But the U.S. and more than 50 other countries say Maduro’s recent re-lection was fraudulent and are backing congressional leader Juan Guaidos claim to the presidency.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: The state will build three new major toll highways through mostly rural areas under a bill signed Friday by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, despite objections raised by environmentalists. The legislation was Republican Senate President Bill Galvano’s top priority. He wants the highways to spur job growth in rural areas, relieve congestion on Interstates 75 and 4, and provide new hurricane evacuation routes. One will connect Collier County in the southwest to Lakeland, located between Tampa and Orlando. Another would extend the Suncoast Parkway from Citrus County to Jefferson County, which borders Georgia. The other would extend from the north end of the Florida Turnpike to the Suncoast Parkway.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A billionaire technology investor and philanthropist says his family is providing grants to wipe out the student debt of the entire 2019 class at Morehouse College. Robert F. Smith made the announcement Sunday morning in front of nearly 400 graduating seniors and elicited the biggest cheers of the morning. Smith received an honorary doctorate from Morehouse during the ceremony. He had already announced a $1.5 million gift to the school. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports the pledge to eliminate the student debt for the class has been estimated at $40 million. Morehouse College is an all-male historically black college. Smith is the founder and CEO of Vista Equity Partners, a private equity firm that invests in software, data and technology-driven companies.\n\nHawaii\n\nKailua-Kona: A CT scan performed on a Hawaiian monk seal at a hospital has shown that the animal is suffering from muscle inflammation and infection, officials say. The scan performed April 21 at North Hawaii Community Hospital in Waimea discovered the 3-year-old female seal’s inflammation and infection in her back flippers spread to her bloodstream and caused a wide range of other problems, West Hawaii Today reports. The endangered mammal, identified as RH38, is one of only 1,400 alive in the wild. The seal is receiving antibiotics, pain medications and laser therapy at the Marine Mammal Center on the Big Island, where she has been under care since March 12. Officials suspect trauma as the initial cause of the injury based on the location and extent of the muscle damage.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Federal officials plan to release 45 wild horses later this month in an event that’s open to the public. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management said in a news release Friday that the horses will be released in three different locations south of Marsing, in southwestern Idaho. Those interested should meet at the I-O-N Truck Plaza in Marsing at 10 a.m. May 29 to drive to the release location. The agency says 279 wild horses were captured in 2015 following the 436-square-mile Soda Fire. Eighty of those horses were adopted by private entities. The horses being returned to the area were cared for at the Boise Wild Horse Corrals and the Bruneau Off-Range Corrals while the burned areas recovered.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Metra says kids may ride for free this summer when accompanied by a parent. Suburban Chicago’s commuter rail agency says up to three children age 11 and under will be able to ride for free with an adult from Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day weekend. Metra CEO Jim Derwinski says traveling on Metra is “a great opportunity to spend time together as a family without having to worry about traffic and parking.” Metra is offering early “getaway trains” out of Chicago on May 24 to start the holiday weekend. The agency’s $10 weekend pass will be good on Memorial Day as well as on Saturday and Sunday. There will be no service on the North Central Service, Heritage Corridor and SouthWest Service lines on Memorial Day.\n\nIndiana\n\nEllettsville: A southern Indiana nature preserve is reopening with a new boardwalk for visitors to cross through a marsh area. The boardwalk goes for a half-mile on a 1.5-mile loop trail through the Beanblossom Bottoms Nature Preserve near Bloomington. The preserve was closed last summer so Sycamore Land Trust volunteers and contractors could build the elevated boardwalk with nonslip plastic decking. Sycamore’s Chris Fox tells The (Bloomington) Herald-Times that 550 posts were set into the marshy ground, with ramps and turnarounds built to make it more accessible to people with limited mobility. The group says the area is home to some of Indiana’s endangered species, including the Indiana bat, Kirtland’s snake, crawfish frog and rare orchids.\n\nIowa\n\nDubuque: The top prosecutor in Dubuque County says he has no immediate plans to file charges against a group that’s been violating state law by distributing sterile needles to intravenous drug users. The group Dubuque Harm Reduction has been open about its activities, sending a letter to county supervisors earlier this month that detailed the group’s services and included an offer to be a resource to the county. The Telegraph Herald reports that the nonprofit provides medical-grade clean injection supplies and offers HIV and hepatitis C testing, wound care kits and fentanyl-testing strips. A bill legalizing such services in Iowa failed to advance during the recent legislative session. The prosecutor, County Attorney C.J. May III, says it’s obvious there’s a public health issue involved.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Abused and neglected children are again sleeping overnight in the offices of foster care contractors in the state because homes cannot be found for them quickly enough. According to the Department for Children and Families, more than 70 children have been kept overnight in the offices of the two nonprofit agencies providing foster care services beginning in January, when Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly took office. Her Republican predecessor’s administration kept children from sleeping in offices during its final months. The state agency provided statistics in response to questions from the Associated Press after it received a tip that the practice had returned. Kelly, legislators and child welfare advocates have repeatedly cited the practice as a sign of serious problems in the child welfare system since it came to light in 2017.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A former Miss America is among 19 candidates running in down-ballot races that include secretary of state, agriculture commissioner, treasurer and auditor. In several races where the candidates agree on most issues, biography likely will matter to voters. Heather French Henry, who was crowned Miss America in 2000, has said her experience running the Department of Veterans Affairs, with its 900 employees and $100 million budget, has given her the experience she needs to run the secretary of state’s office. She’s a Democrat. That open seat drew the most challengers for the May primary, with four Democrats and four Republicans seeking to succeed Democratic incumbent Alison Lundergan Grimes. She can’t run again due to term limits.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A new lion exhibit is opening at the Audubon Zoo. During a recent tour, the African lions were seen lounging in the shade of an enormous rock surrounded by open grass and tree limbs. The scene is reminiscent of the African savanna and is part of the new exhibit that opened Saturday. Visitors will be able to see critically endangered lions – three females and a full-maned male – from the safety of a fictional train station. Rail cars with glass-fronted openings to the “savanna” include informational displays about threats facing lions in the wild, such as poaching and habitat loss, as well as efforts underway to save them. Zoo curator and Vice President Joel Hamilton says there are only about 20,000 lions left in Africa.\n\nMaine\n\nVinalhaven: The foundation dedicated to turning pop artist Robert Indiana’s island home into a museum is ready to engage with local residents about the details of the project. Star of Hope Foundation Chairman Larry Sterrs says the process gets underway with a visit to Vinalhaven on Monday, the day after the anniversary of Indiana’s death. Sterrs will be meeting with community leaders and discussing their concerns. Indiana is best known for his iconic “LOVE” series. He died May 19, 2018, on Vinalhaven Island. Sterrs says the foundation is continuing its work even as a lawsuit against Indiana’s estate heats up. The suit accuses Indiana of agreeing to unauthorized reproductions. About $66 million in Indiana’s estate is tied up because of the lawsuit.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Johns Hopkins Hospital has filed thousands of lawsuits since 2009 against patients with unpaid medical bills. The Baltimore Sun reports The Coalition for a Humane Hopkins says a large portion of the lawsuits target residents of low-income neighborhoods around the hospital’s East Baltimore campus. The coalition is made up of activists, patients and groups such as the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations. Its report says the hospital has been filing an increasing number of cases over the years. The Sun reported in 2008 that dozens of Maryland hospitals sued over unpaid bills between 2003 and 2008 and won at least $100 million. It found that the hospitals pursued the lawsuits even as they charged other patients higher rates to cover costs of uninsured or low-income patients.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: State marijuana regulators have approved of a plan to slowly roll out “cannabis cafes” where adults could use pot in a social setting. The 3-2 vote by the Cannabis Control Commission on Thursday calls for an initial test program in as many as a dozen communities where licenses would be granted for social consumption establishments. Marijuana use might also be allowed at certain outdoor public events. The program, however, could not move forward without a change in state law that would give local communities the power to authorize cannabis cafes. Bills are pending in the Legislature to do that. The commission is recommending stringent rules to prevent people under 21 from entering social consumption sites, plus training for employees to recognize when a patron is too high to drive safely.\n\nMichigan\n\nBrooks Township: The Michigan Nature Association says 40 acres have been purchased in Newaygo County’s Brooks Township for the Brooks Oak-Pine Barrens Nature Sanctuary, part of a Karner blue butterfly mitigation project. The nonprofit says the endangered butterfly is one of Michigan’s rarest. It requires dry-sand prairie and oak-barren habitats that can support wild lupine, a native wildflower. The larvae of the Karner blue butterfly feed exclusively on wild lupine. Michigan Nature Association conservation director Andrew Bacon says there are no Karner blue butterflies at the new sanctuary, but “it is an excellent candidate for butterfly restoration given the high-quality habitats that are present and the close proximity of existing Karner blue butterfly populations.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: A new report using U.S. Census Bureau data shows the price of housing in the seven-county Twin Cities region is more expensive than cities such as Austin, Texas; Nashville, Tennessee; and St. Louis, Missouri. Minnesota Public Radio News reports the Family Housing Fund study indicated the region is on a path to becoming as costly as Denver or Seattle. The report also found there is a substantial lack of housing in the Twin Cities to accommodate a burgeoning workforce. Family Housing Fund President Ellen Sahli says 1 in 5 employees in the Twin Cities region pay over 30% of their income each month for a place to live. The report says that the housing shortfall could result in nearly 50,000 fewer jobs in the region in 20 years.\n\nMississippi\n\nOcean Springs: This city on the Gulf Coast is moving ahead with plans to build a new sidewalk by a beach, after homeowners lost a legal battle to block the project. The Mississippi Press reports Ocean Springs is receiving $384,000 from the Mississippi Department of Transportation for the East Beach sidewalk. The city will contribute another $96,000, and work could begin after Oct. 1. Mayor Shea Dobson says the sidewalk will improve beach access for all residents. Two East Beach homeowners opposed the project for years, and that led to six legal actions and three trips to the Mississippi Supreme Court. Justices issued a final ruling in November. They said that the beach belongs to the state and that people living by it have no ownership rights.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Lawmakers have passed a measure that could send former President Harry Truman back to the U.S. Capitol. The measure given final approval Thursday would put Truman’s statue in place of one of former Sen. Thomas Hart Benton, who was instrumental in the nation’s westward expansion. State lawmakers passed something similar last year. But it was vetoed by Gov. Mike Parson because the version sent to him mistakenly referenced the accomplishments of Benton’s great-great nephew, a famous painter by the same name. All states are allotted two statues in the Capitol. Missouri’s other Capitol statue features former Sen. Francis Preston Blair Jr., who was instrumental in keeping Missouri out of the Confederacy. The likenesses of Blair and Benton both have been on display in Washington, D.C., since 1899.\n\nMontana\n\nRed Lodge: Highway crews have been working for more than a month to clear snow from the Beartooth Highway south of Red Lodge. Crews hope to have the seasonal road open by May 24 – the start of Memorial Day weekend. Montana Department of Transportation crews are clearing snow from an 11-mile stretch of the road to the top of Beartooth Pass, on the Wyoming border. The National Park Service maintains the rest of the scenic road as it dips into Wyoming, back into Montana and into Yellowstone National Park at Cooke City. The Billings Gazette reports road maintenance crews also remove fallen rocks and repair guardrails damaged over the winter.\n\nNebraska\n\nGrand Island: A technologically advanced van is helping the city determine how to keep its streets in good shape and save taxpayer money in the process. Grand Island has hired an Illinois-based firm, Engineering & Research International, to complete the project. The street assessment van going up and down the more than 300 miles of Grand Island streets is equipped with high-resolution cameras, ground-penetrating radar, global positioning systems and onboard computers. The van equipment will look at such things as cracks in the roads and roughness. The survey information helps determine which sections of pavement to overlay – something of vital interest to the public, says John Collins, the city public works director. Using the data to prioritize can save the city up to $400,000 annually, he says.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Elected officials in rural Nye County say they support moving forward with a long-studied but mothballed national nuclear waste repository in the state, unlike their counterparts in urban Las Vegas, about 90 miles away. But the Las Vegas Sun reports residents who live close to Yucca Mountain are split on whether storing approximately 70,000 tons of nuclear waste there is a good idea. Spanning more than 18,000 square miles, Nye County is the largest county by area in Nevada, with a population of 44,200 people. Some see the proposed repository as a potential bringer of economic development and jobs to a county where nearly 19% of residents live below the poverty line. Others say the environmental and human health risks of transporting and storing the nation’s most radioactive material are too high, and unjust, considering that Nevada doesn’t produce nuclear energy.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: The family of a video game pioneer from the city has started a scholarship fund. The Ralph H. and Dena W. Baer Scholarship Fund at the New Hampshire Charitable Foundation will help students from Manchester Central High School who want to study in technology-related fields. Ralph Baer created both the precursor to “Pong” and the electronic memory game Simon, and he led the team that developed the first home video game console. His work as chief engineer for Sanders Associates, now BAE Systems, led to The Brown Box, a console that connected to a television that was licensed by Magnavox in the early 1970s. Baer’s basement lab has been recreated at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington. Earlier this month, a sculpture of Baer was unveiled in Arms Park.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTeaneck: A small migratory bird has found an unusual place to make her nest – near the south goal of an artificial turf soccer field in the township’s busiest park. The killdeer, a brown bird with bands of white and black, laid its eggs about two weeks ago on a patch of synthetic grass at Votee Park. Although the killdeer is not a threatened species, the birds are protected under the American Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Canadian Migratory Birds Convention Act. When the clutch of white and brown speckled eggs was discovered, township workers asked state officials for guidance. They were told it would likely take a couple of months to get a permit to move the nest. “We thought, let’s just accommodate this little situation,” Councilman Jim Dunleavy said. “Teams have been told they have to stay away from the soccer field until nature takes its course.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: More than 101,000 public school students will gain access to a variety of extended learning opportunities beyond the traditional school year starting this summer, Public Education Secretary Karen Trujillo announced Friday. Reforms approved and signed in April by first-year Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham provided up to $181 million in annual spending for two programs – money that won’t be nearly exhausted during the coming school year. About $76 million has been awarded to schools. One program is a flexible 10-day addition of learning time to the school year at any grade level, likely to reach some 101,000 students. A second program, a proven model for lengthening the elementary school year by five weeks, is expected include about 24,000 students for the coming school year, up from 18,000.\n\nNew York\n\nWatkins Glen: Organizers of the Woodstock 50 festival are signaling progress toward resolving a financial crunch after a falling-out with backer Amplifi Live. The festival announced Friday that investment bank Oppenheimer & Co. has signed on as a financial adviser to pull money together. Meanwhile, organizers say preparations continue. The anniversary event is scheduled Aug. 16-18 in Watkins Glen. Amplifi Live put up $49 million before clashing with organizers over attendance, budget and other issues. Amplifi announced April 29 that it was canceling the festival and took back about $18 million. Organizers retorted the show was still on. They sued Amplifi. A judge ruled Wednesday that Amplifi couldn’t singlehandedly cancel the festival but didn’t have to put the $18 million back in while the dispute goes to arbitration.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The N.C. Wildlife Resources Commission is asking the public to report any sightings of nine-banded armadillos to the agency. Commission biologists are seeking observations to help them determine the range expansion of armadillos in the Tar Heel state. To participate, volunteers who spot an armadillo in the wild should upload and share their photos on the NC Armadillo project, which launched May 17 on the free online platform iNaturalist. Volunteers can upload their photos via a computer at iNaturalist.org, or they can download the free iNaturalist app, available for iPhone and Android. They can also send their armadillo observations to armadillo@ncwildlife.org. The email should include a photo of the armadillo and when and where it was observed, preferably by GPS coordinates.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: A red panda who escaped his compound at a zoo has been found, grooming himself in a tree outside the facility. Sheffield the red panda was reported missing from the Red River Zoo in Fargo on Thursday. KFGO reports he was found a day later perched in a tree near the zoo. Workers lured him from the tree with food and restored him to his home in the zoo. The red panda is an endangered species. Officials say more than 25% of Chinese red pandas found in zoos across the country were born at the Fargo zoo.\n\nOhio\n\nCambridge: What’s 4 feet tall, 125 pounds and covered in hair? No, it’s not Cousin Itt of the Addams Family. It’s Hoss, the giant ball of human hair. Hoss, named after Dan Blocker’s character from “Bonanza,” is an oblong creation from the donations of hundreds of people, so its exterior is an ever-changing mess of different colors and textures. The hair ball was created by Steve Warden, a hairstylist from Cambridge, who began crafting it after years of conversations with his four children about trying to get into the “Ripley’s Believe It or Not” book. Once the ball reached the enormous weight of 97 pounds, Warden reached out to Ripley’s to donate his masterpiece last year. Kurtis Moellmann, exhibit and interactive coordinator for Ripley’s, says Warden’s hair ball has quickly become one of the company’s most popular items.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state House, Senate and governor’s office each received huge funding boosts under the state’s new spending plan, including a more than doubling of the governor’s budget. Budget documents released Friday show new Gov. Kevin Stitt will receive a $2 million increase, a 121% increase over last year’s spending level. While most state agencies received an average increase of 5%, the Senate budget increased by 25%, and the House received a nearly 60% boost. The general appropriations bill passed the House on Friday and is scheduled in the Senate this week. Stitt spokeswoman Donelle Harder says the increase is to hire more staff and pay many of the governor’s Cabinet members who are currently working without a salary. Harder says some of the increase is a one-time cost for office furniture.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:The state Capitol’s famous flowering cherry trees are safe. A months­long study to determine whether the trees’ roots might be causing damage to the roof of the state’s underground parking structure found other causes were to blame. The double row of cherry trees has lined the Capitol Mall since 1991, when the strip was excavated for the 1,200-space underground parking area. Last fall, the Oregon Department of Administrative Services hired a consultant to find the source of leaks in the parking structure. If the results had pointed to the trees, they would have needed to be removed. The consultant determined the main reason for the leaks is that a water-resistant membrane has failed and can’t prevent irrigation and storm runoff from entering the structure. The consultant recommended improvements to the storm sewers and irrigation system.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: The University of Pittsburgh is getting a spooky addition – the archives of late iconic horror filmmaker George A. Romero. Romero’s horror flicks date back to the 1968 film “Night of the Living Dead,” and many consider him the godfather of zombie cinema. The university announced the acquisition last week. The archives will be available to scholars, students and filmmakers and include the original annotated “Night of the Living Dead” script and a foam latex zombie head. University officials say the collection will be used to build an international resource for the study of horror and science fiction. Romero came to Pittsburgh in the late 1950s to study graphic art. He launched his career with commercials and shorts, including work for “Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nEast Providence: A skate park has been dedicated to a former professional BMX rider who set a world record for the longest power-assisted bicycle backflip. The Providence Journal reports a skate park in East Providence has been christened the Kevin “K-Rob” Robinson Memorial Skate Park. The 45-year-old East Providence native suffered a stroke and died suddenly in December 2017. His wife, Robin Adams Robinson, attended the dedication ceremony with the couple’s three young children. She said the family “couldn’t be happier” at the honor. Robinson’s nonprofit K-Rob Foundation paid to have the public skate park built at the Onna Moniz-John Neighborhood Park. Robinson earned gold medals in the X Games and retired from competition in 2013. He made his world record, 84-foot jump in Providence in 2016.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: The College of Charleston has rebranded its 800-plus-acre former plantation to reaffirm its “commitment to diversity, inclusion and community.” The college’s Board of Trustees voted unanimously last month to support interim President Steve Osborne’s recommendation to rename Dixie Plantation as the College of Charleston at Stono Preserve. The Post and Courier reports Osborne said the college had discussed the name change for about a year, and he fully supported the move. The decision comes just two months after Osborne dealt with a walkout by hundreds of students protesting an online video in which some students joked about slavery. He says the incident didn’t factor into the name change. Instead, Osborne says the new name better fits with how the college uses the site.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: A local man who wrote a book about Congressional Medal of Honor recipients is now opening a museum to honor them. The Rapid City Journal reports John L. Johnson’s museum is to open Aug. 1 at the Rushmore Mall. It will have individual plaques for the more than 3,500 people recognized for valor in combat with the nation’s highest military honor. Johnson, who works for the public school district, published a book about medal recipients in 2007 that was updated in 2010. He says it’s important to remember and honor a part of the nation’s military history that he believes is being lost. Museum admission will be free. Johnson is funding the effort through his own money, donations, other fundraising and proceeds from an artist’s market he runs in the mall.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Cult-favorite musician Tav Falco, who came to Memphis four decades ago to materialize a blues-infused, rockabilly-charged, punk-simpatico and so-called art-damaged brand of musical “conjuration” that has sustained a career of remarkable longevity, returns to the city for a Tuesday night performance at Lafayette’s Music Room in Overton Square. The show promotes Falco’s latest album, “Cabaret of Daggers,” but also recognizes the 40th anniversary of his band, Panther Burns, which debuted its underground sound in 1979. “We’re calling the show the ‘40th Anniversary Howl’ because panthers howl; they howl in the night,” Falco says. The show will go on despite some recent bad luck: Two weeks ago, a thief or thieves stole Falco’s IDs, passport, stage wardrobe, filmmaking equipment and signature 1966 black-painted Höfner electric guitar. Local business owners have helped to replace some of the gear and duds.\n\nTexas\n\nLongview: Actor Matthew McConaughey has finally received his high school diploma, more than 30 years after graduating. McConaughey was given his original diploma Friday night when he returned to his alma mater to address the class of 2019. A Longview High School spokeswoman told the Longview News-Journal that graduates normally receive diploma holders during commencement ceremonies and that the actual diplomas must be picked up later. She said McConaughey never got his. The 49-year-old graduated from Longview in 1988. He responded to receiving his diploma with one word: “proof.” McConaughey, who lives in Austin, won an Oscar for his performance in “Dallas Buyers Club.” He told the new graduates he’d succeeded because he followed his heart, and they should guard and follow theirs.\n\nUtah\n\nLehi: At 15 years old, Ethan Blood’s Boy Scout sash sports an impressive number of badges. Earning each one required time and dedicated effort, but Ethan has taken on more than ever before with his Eagle Scout project. At first, Ethan thought he would raise a flagpole as a meaningful patriotic gesture. But his local church leader offered up another idea: making a trail that would connect a subdivision in Traverse Mountain, Lehi, to the Ignite Entrepreneurship Academy. The school is only accessible to kids in nearby neighborhoods who walk or whose parents drive them a mile and a half around to the school entrance. The other option is scaling a 50-foot cliff. Ethan has three younger siblings at Ignite and takes pride in knowing his siblings can use the 450-foot trail to get to school safely once it’s completed.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The Vermont Department of Corrections says the composting of food scraps in the state’s prisons keeps 572,000 pounds of food waste out of landfills every year. The Caledonian Record reports the 11,000 pounds of food scraps that are composted each week are used to feed the soil at farms and gardens throughout the state. Bryan Mitofsky, the food service supervisor at the Northeast Correctional Complex in St. Johnsbury, says the kitchen staff has set up an easy system to collect food scraps and separate them from the regular trash. Environmental Conservation Commissioner Emily Boedecker says she hopes the effort of the Department of Corrections inspires others to donate, divert and compost to reduce the volume of material sent to landfills.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: More than 200 women attended a town hall meeting this past weekend to promote women of color running for local and statewide office in the commonwealth. The event Saturday at Virginia Union University was hosted by She the People, a national progressive group. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports speakers included two African American women who are exploring gubernatorial runs: Sen. Jennifer McClellan, a Democrat from Richmond, and Del.

The building is almost a century old and accounts for more than half of the hotel rooms in the park. The renovations brought the building up to seismic code, fixed where the foundation had sunk, installed new fire safety systems, and included electrical and plumbing upgrades. The last time the electrical system was updated was during President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s administration in the 1950s. The park’s operations manager, Melinda Simpson, who started working at the inn’s pantry in 1973, says she’s excited that the floors no longer creak and that the windows all open and have screens that stay put.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nWheeling: Officials say major repairs are planned for the state’s oldest bridge. The Intelligencer reports the state Division of Highways plans to rehabilitate the Elm Grove Stone Arch Bridge in Wheeling in a $5.8 million project that begins early next year. The 202-year-old span crosses Little Wheeling Creek and has seen major deterioration in its stone masonry since it was built in 1817. Sondra Mullins with the Division of Highways says the work is needed to keep the bridge open for vehicles. The agency says the bridge is “a unique and a rare example of a stone arch that features the elliptical style of arch geometry.” Traffic would be detoured while the work is taking place. Officials are hoping to finish repairs in early 2021.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee:The Great American Lobster Fest is coming to the city for the first time Aug.16-18. The festival is the Midwest’s largest lobster and seafood festival and is organized by Chicago-based Green Curtain Events. Organizers will be shipping between 4,000 and 5,000 pounds of lobster fresh from the East Coast for Milwaukeeans to enjoy during the festival weekend. “We think there is something special about bringing seafood into the Midwest,” said Green Curtain Events owner Nick Pobutsky. “Milwaukee is good proximity to Chicago and fits our vision for expansion for the next five to six years.” Milwaukee is the third city to hold the festival. Green Curtain Events hopes to expand it to other Midwestern cities. The fest will have nearly a dozen vendors selling about 20 types of seafood.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The Wyoming Democratic Party has requested for a prosecutor to investigate allegations of voting difficulties on the Wind River Reservation last year. The Casper Star-Tribune reports the party asked Fremont County Attorney Patrick LeBrun on Wednesday to conduct a formal probe into the possible violations of state elections law. The party says tribal members might have experienced difficulty voting early after an employee at the county clerk’s office said they needed valid state driver’s licenses. The party says a poll worker also asked voters to read aloud an oath on election procedures, possibly violating a state law banning literacy tests. The Wyoming Secretary of State’s office said in a statement that eligible voters were not denied the right.\n\nFrom staff and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/20"}]}

The two companies have a combined 710,000 workers – most of them unionized in an industry with low union rates – nearly 5,000 stores and more than $200 billion in sales. The companies say they reach 85 million households.\n\nThe retail industry has consolidated in recent years, and merging would give the companies greater scale to fend off competition from Amazon (AMZN), Walmart (WMT) and other retail giants. Traditional supermarkets have been pressured by these companies and others – discount chains such as Dollar General (DG) and Aldi, warehouse clubs like Costco (COST), and online grocers.\n\nThe merger “accelerates our position as a more compelling alternative to larger and non-union competitors,” Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen said in a statement Friday.\n\nIf the deal is completed, it would be one of the largest mergers in US retail history – dwarfing Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods in 2017 for $13.7 billion. The company would become the third largest retail chain in America by sales. Its combined market share in the $1.4 trillion grocery industry would be 13.5%, according to Morgan Stanley, making it the second largest grocer behind Walmart’s 15.5% share.\n\nThe move also comes as companies battle higher costs and food inflation reaches its highest level in decades. Prices at grocery stores continued to soar last month. The food at home index, a proxy for grocery store prices, increased 0.7% in September from the month prior and 13% over the last year.\n\nKroger said the deal would benefit consumers and it will use half a billion dollars in cost savings from the merger to invest in lower prices. Albertsons is known for having higher prices than Kroger and analysts say Kroger may try to lower the chain’s prices.\n\nKroger (KR) will buy Albertsons for $34.10 a share — a roughly 30% premium above the grocery chain’s average share price over the course of the past month. Shares of Kroger (KR) slid 5% in early trading Friday, while Albertsons dropped 7%.\n\nThe two companies operate dozens of grocery chains. Kroger operates Ralphs, Harris Teeter, Dillons, Fred Meyer and others, while Albertsons owns Safeway and Vons. The companies said they will spin off nearly 400 stores to form a new rival in an effort to gain antitrust clearance.\n\nAnalysts expect some store closures if the deal goes through and also say it will be a significant hurdle to pass antitrust scrutiny.\n\n“A deal of this size that has a direct impact on consumers would face significant scrutiny from regulators and take a long time period to be approved,” Joseph Feldman, an analyst at Telsey Advisory Group, said.\n\nConsumer watchdogs, unions, and Democrats have already come out strongly against the deal. They say it would harm consumers by raising prices and driving out competition. It could also spur a new wave of consolidation in the industry among smaller companies attempting to compete.\n\nThe United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW), which represents 1.3 million workers in grocery stores, meatpacking plants and other essential industries along the food supply chain also voiced some concern about the proposed merger.\n\n“The proposed merger has serious implications for hundreds of thousands of our UFCW members and America’s families who are more concerned than ever about inflation’s impact on the price of their food and groceries, prescription drugs, and gas. As America’s largest union of essential workers, protecting the livelihoods of this nation’s grocery workers, union and non-union, is our highest priority,” UFCW International president Marc Perrone, said in a statement Friday.\n\n“To be clear, the UFCW will oppose any merger that threatens the jobs of America’s essential workers, union and non-union, and undermines our communities,” he said.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders called it a “absolute disaster” and called on the Biden administration to reject the deal. The American Economic Liberties Project, an anti-monopoly organization, said the “merger would be disastrous for market competition, small businesses, and especially – consumers’ pockets.”\n\nFTC chair Lina Khan is critic of corporate consolidation, and the regulator has blocked large retail mergers in the past, including Staples’ attempts to combine with Office Depot.\n\nThe FTC is currently looking into anti-competitive practices in the grocery industry and requested information last year from Kroger and others on the causes of empty shelves and surging prices in the United States.", "authors": ["Nathaniel Meyersohn Jordan Valinsky", "Nathaniel Meyersohn", "Jordan Valinsky"], "publish_date": "2022/10/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/17/business/kroger-albertsons-merger-groceries/index.html", "title": "Kroger-Albertsons merger: What it could mean for grocery prices ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nIn a mega-deal that could have a huge impact on grocery shopping in America, Kroger and Albertsons announced Friday plans to merge.\n\nIf approved by regulators, the nearly $25 billion deal would be one of the biggest in US retail history.\n\nThe proposed merger, which the companies expect to complete in 2024, would combine the fifth and tenth largest retailers in the country.

Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n\nThere’s no guarantee the deal will go through, however.\n\nThe merger will face intense scrutiny from the Federal Trade Commission and other regulators. Opponents, Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, have already called on regulators to block the deal. The companies say they will divest hundreds of stores in areas where they overlap to win regulatory approval.\n\nHere’s how the mega-merger could impact grocery shopping in America.\n\nLower prices…for now\n\nPrices at the grocery store are a major concern for shoppers right now.\n\nGrocery prices increased 13% in September over the last year, the fastest pace in decades.\n\nThe companies say that they will be able to use $500 million in cost savings from the deal to reduce prices for shoppers and tailor promotions and savings. They will also invest $1.3 billion in Albertsons, including on lowering prices.\n\n“Our expanded portfolio, along with more personalized promotions and benefits, will help customers save… and help to relieve the inflationary pressures facing shoppers across the country,” Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen said Friday.\n\nAlbertsons stores are concentrated more on the West Coast, while Kroger is dominant in the Midwest.\n\nAlbertsons has higher prices than Kroger and other grocers, analysts say, and they predict Kroger will try to reduce Albertsons prices to be more competitive against discount chains like Aldi.\n\n“This deal could provide some food pricing relief for consumers,” said Ken Fenyo, a retail analyst at Coresight Research. “With Aldi, Lidl and other discount grocers coming in, this positions Kroger to drive the market forward.”\n\nBut supermarket mergers can also lead to higher prices for shoppers.\n\nA 2012 study published in the Journal of Economics and Management Strategy found that “mergers in the supermarket industry can result in significant increases in consumer prices and thereby harm consumers” in highly concentrated markets.\n\nMergers in less concentrated markets are most often associated with price decreases, the study found.\n\nAntitrust advocates say the merger would force out competition and concentrate power among the largest chains, driving up prices.\n\n“A Kroger-Albertons deal would squeeze consumers already struggling to afford food,” said Sarah Miller, the executive director of the American Economic Liberties Project, a policy group against concentrated economic power.\n\nMore store brands\n\nKroger and Albertsons have each been building out their own exclusive food brands in recent years as alternatives to big-name brands.\n\nKroger, for example, offers its own brands such as Private Selection and Simple Truth, while Albertsons has O Organics, Open Nature and others.\n\nThe two companies’ brands generated a combined $43 billion in sales last year.\n\nThis is an important strategy for these stores because it’s more profitable to sell their own brands than national labels, and it helps keep big brands’ prices in check.\n\nBy merging, the companies plan to expand their own brand selection and lower production costs.\n\nStore closures and pain for mom-and-pops\n\nGrocery stores in the United States are on the decline.\n\nThe number of US grocers fell by roughly 30% from 1993 to 2019, according to a report last year by Food & Water Watch, a consumer advocacy group.\n\nAnalysts say that Kroger and Albertsons are likely to close some of their overlapping stores, particularly in some cities where they are heavily concentrated, such as Los Angeles and Chicago.\n\n“There will, no doubt, be some closures if a merger goes ahead,” said Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData Retail. “Over time, the rate of closures may be more pronounced as the combined chains seek to minimize duplication,” he said.\n\nAdvocates fear the merger would harm small grocery stores. Jason Armond/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images\n\nAnalysts and advocates also say that a merger would make it harder for smaller grocers and mom-and-pop stores to stay in business.\n\nThe National Grocers Association, which represents small retailers and wholesalers, said the merger would put smaller competitors at an “unfair disadvantage” and increase “anticompetitive buyer power over grocery suppliers.”\n\nThis would disproportionally hurt cities and rural areas, where independent stores are typically located.\n\n“This deal would almost certainly put more rural towns and Black and Latino neighborhoods in cities at risk of becoming ‘food deserts’ as more local grocers are driven out of business,” said Stacy Mitchell, the co-director at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a research and advocacy organization that challenges economic concentration.\n\nMerger frenzy\n\nThe food industry in America has consolidated in recent decades.\n\nThe top five grocers – Walmart, Kroger, Costco, Ahold Delhaize and Amazon – control about half the market, according to UBS.\n\nA Kroger-Albertsons merger would spark a fresh wave of mergers and acquisitions as companies seek to keep up, analysts predict.\n\nThe proposed deal “accelerates the ongoing consolidation of the sector,” said UBS retail analyst Michael Lasser.\n\nAmazon “has aspirations to be larger in the space,” he said. “The warehouse clubs, hard discounters, strong [regional grocers] and specialty players will look to fortify their positions.”", "authors": ["Nathaniel Meyersohn"], "publish_date": "2022/10/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2022/10/19/kroger-albertsons-merger-what-does-deal-mean-grocery-shoppers/10542674002/", "title": "Kroger-Albertsons merger: What does deal mean for grocery ...", "text": "In a mega-deal that could create a grocery behemoth, Kroger announced Friday plans to acquire rival Albertsons.\n\nThe $24.6 billion deal, if approved by regulators, would unite two of the country’s largest grocers to create a supermarket giant with nearly 5,000 stores and annual revenue of about $200 billion.\n\n\"We are bringing together two purpose-driven organizations to deliver superior value to customers, associates, communities and shareholders,\" Kroger Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rodney McMullen, who will continue his role for the combined company, said in a statement.\n\nKroger and Albertsons want to combine to be more competitive against giants like Walmart and Amazon.

They will also invest $1.3 billion in Albertsons to “enhance the customer experience.”\n\nLawmakers and experts, however, worry that the merger will lead to higher costs for shoppers, who are already grappling with soaring food prices.\n\n“They have a lot of statements about how there is going to be an enhanced consumer experience,” said Christine Bartholomew, a University at Buffalo law professor and antitrust scholar. “But the materials are a little quiet about how they're actually going to reduce costs for consumers.”\n\nA 2008 study found that in four of the five mergers evaluated, prices increased between 3% and 7%. The authors noted, however, that the study isn’t representative of the impact of all transactions.\n\nAny increase in food prices could have a huge impact on consumers. The cost of food in the U.S. increased 11% last month compared to the same period last year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n“Even though every merging company says, ‘This merger is going to reduce price costs,’ it just doesn't manifest in actual pocketbook saving for consumers,” Bartholomew said.\n\nKroger CEO answers:Why is Kroger buying Albertsons, and how will it affect shoppers?\n\nMcMullen told The Cincinnati Enquirer, part of the USA TODAY Network, that he expects the impact for consumers “to be very limited.”\n\n“The thing that it will allow us to do is obviously bigger-scale,” McMullen said. “We'll be able to continue to invest in our associates on pay and invest in the customers on pricing.”\n\nWill Kroger and Albertsons close stores?\n\nTogether, the companies currently employ more than 710,000 people and operate a total of 4,996 stores across 48 states and Washington D.C.\n\nTo appease regulators, the new combined company is expected to divest 100 to 375 stores that will be spun out into a separate company that will be established as an Albertsons subsidiary.\n\nBartholomew said the combined company may close down some stores in areas where they overlap.\n\n“Without knowing specifically the plans in terms of which closures they might need to take, I have concerns about this merger creating even more food deserts,” Bartholomew said.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nThe deal is expected to close in early 2024 after regulatory and anti-trust review.\n\nSens.

Here's what you need to ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nThe United States is on the brink of a retirement crisis. The primary savings tool for Americans – your 401(k) – isn’t helping.\n\nBy the end of the decade, about 21% of the country’s population will be 65 or older, up from 15% in 2016, according to forecasts by the Census Bureau. Most non-retired adults have some type of retirement savings, but only 36% think their savings are on track.\n\nNow, Congress is looking to help Americans save by bolstering 401(k) programs – the tax-deferred, company-sponsored retirement accounts to which employees can contribute income, and employers can match their contributions.\n\nA new bill, expected to reach President Joe Biden’s desk by the end of the year, could require most employer-sponsored retirement plans to enroll their workers automatically, making it easier for student-loan borrowers to save, and for older workers to make catch-up contributions. It will also lower costs for smaller businesses.\n\nRetirement savings in the United States were long thought of as a three-legged stool. Americans had pension plans, Social Security benefits, and defined contribution plans like the 401(k). Not any more.\n\nPension plans are nearly extinct. About half of private sector workers were covered by those so-called defined-benefit plans in the mid-1980s, but by 2021 only 15% of private sector workers had them.\n\nSocial Security payments still provide about 90% of income for a quarter of older adults, according to Social Security Agency surveys. But the Social Security trust fund is facing a 75-year deficit, and without intervention it will be depleted by the mid-2030s. Lawmakers have faced a decades long political stalemate on how to fix it.\n\nWhat’s left is the 401(k), which 68% of private industry workers have access to, but only 50% use.\n\n“I don’t think it was ever anticipated that this would be the primary leg of the stool,” said Jonathan Barber, head of compensation and benefits policy research at Ayco Personal Financial Management, a unit of Goldman Sachs that provides investment services to hundreds of US companies and more than a million corporate employees.\n\nIndeed, the 401(k) was never designed to be the primary retirement tool for Americans when it was introduced into the US tax code in 1978. “When it works, it works really well,” said Sri Reddy, senior vice president of retirement and income solutions for Principal Financial Group.\n\nThe 401(k) naturally appeals as a savings vehicle to Americans who bring in more money, say critics. Under the current plan, an employee in the highest tax bracket saves 37%. But an employee in the lowest tax bracket would gain a pre-tax advantage of saving only 10% on deferred income.\n\nThe tax breaks for these retirement savings are expected to cost the government nearly $200 billion this year, with most of those benefits going to the top 20% of earners, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nLess than 40% of lower-paid workers have retirement accounts, compared with 80% of middle- and upper-income families, according to Vanguard. Making a 401(k) plan more accessible doesn’t help Americans who don’t have money to save in the first place.\n\nStill, Congress thinks there’s a solution.\n\nIn late 2019, one of the most significant pieces of retirement legislation in the past 15 years, was signed into law by President Donald Trump: the bipartisan Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement, or SECURE Act. The bill removed maximum age limits on retirement contributions, provided tax credits for small businesses to offer their employees 401(k) plans, and extended retirement benefits to some long-term but part-time employees.\n\nLast week Congress almost unanimously passed another bill, SECURE 2.0, that has even broader changes. The Senate is expected to pass its version in the coming weeks.\n\nHere’s a look at how the primary retirement savings plan in the US may soon change.\n\nAutomatic enrollment\n\nIn what would be the largest change to the 401(k) program, SECURE 2.0 would require employers to automatically enroll all eligible workers into their 401(k) plans at a savings rate of 3% of salary. (Many employees currently have to opt in and then choose their contribution level.) The new rule also applies to the 403(b), a similar program for employees of certain public and tax-exempt organizations.\n\nEnrolled workers’ contribution rates would be automatically increased each year by 1% until their contribution reaches 10% annually.\n\nWhile workers have the option to opt out of the plan or change their contribution level after they enroll, automatically enrolling workers into these plans would make a huge change in younger and low-waged employees’ participation in the program.\n\nA 2012 study cited in the SECURE 2.0 bill found that, “[t]he most dramatic increases in enrollment rates are among younger, low-paid employees, and the racial gap in participation rates is nearly eliminated among employees subject to auto-enrollment.”\n\nAbout one in six of employers already offer automatic enrollment, and about 90% of new hires who use them participate in retirement plans, compared with just 28% under voluntary enrollment, according to a recent study by Vanguard, the largest provider of mutual funds in the United States.\n\nPre-retirees save more\n\nOlder workers who are between the ages of 62 and 64 can increase their catch-up contributions to $10,000 a year, up from $6,500 now. Beginning in 2023, these catch-up contributions would be taxed as Roth contributions, meaning they’d be taxed before being invested for retirement, though earnings would be indexed to inflation.\n\nPeople generally earn more as they age, said Reddy, and people in their 60s are typically earning more than they spend. Giving them the ability to increase their contributions makes a huge difference in retirement savings. “If you have people who are motivated and have incremental means, it’s a wonderful way of helping them get caught up for retirement,” he said.\n\nBarber, who heads up benefits research at Goldman Sachs’ Ayco Personal Financial Management, worries that this change may be overly complex.\n\nCurrently, most 401(k) contributions come from employees’ paychecks pre-tax, so investors don’t really feel the bite until they’re ready to withdraw their savings. Under the new plan, the catch-up contribution will be raised, but employees must pay taxes before they contribute.\n\nFor investors, “that might be a shock to some people who don’t understand the financial impact of that, especially if they’ve never had a Roth account,” said Barber.\n\nAbout 43.4 million borrowers in the United States have federal student loan debt, totaling a whopping $1.7 trillion, and many employees tend to forgo saving for retirement until they pay their loans in full.\n\nPay off student loan debt while saving\n\nLosing out on those early years of potential savings puts them at a significant disadvantage. The plan has a solution to that.\n\nEmployers could treat student loan repayments as elective retirement account deferrals, and provide a matching contribution to their 401(k). So if you pay off $1,000 in student loan debt, it would be the same as putting $1,000 into a retirement plan, as far as matching goes. If a company matches by 6%, that’s an extra $60 in savings.\n\n“The earlier you do [invest], the more those investment gains can multiply,” said T. Lake Moore V, an employee benefits attorney at McAfee & Taft.\n\nDelay mandatory withdrawals and limit tax penalties\n\nAmericans are retiring later and living longer. Secure 2.0 lifts the minimum age at which enrollees must begin withdrawing money from their accounts each year to 75 from 72. That allows for three additional years of tax-free growth on their retirement investments.\n\n(The penalty for those who fail to withdraw the required minimum from their account after 75 would be halved, to 25% from 50%.\n\nPart-time workers can contribute\n\nUnder the proposed act, companies that offer a 401(k) plan would be required to allow part-time employees who work at least 500 hours a year for two years, (the equivalent of just under 10 hours a week) to contribute to a retirement account. That would include part-time workers, gig employees, freelancers, caregivers and independent contractors.\n\nAdditional provisions\n\nThe plan would also extend tax credits to small businesses for providing greater access to retirement plans for their workers, and create an online database for Americans to locate lost retirement funds.", "authors": ["Nicole Goodkind"], "publish_date": "2022/04/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/14/economy/yield-curve-bonds-recession/index.html", "title": "US economy flashes a recession warning sign | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nSurging oil and gas prices have raised recession alarm bells around the world. But another economic indicator is starting to look ominous: The yield curve is flattening.\n\nWall Street closely watches the difference, or spread, between short-term government bond yields, most notably the 2-year Treasury, and longer-term bond rates like the 10-year Treasury.\n\nAs that spread diminishes, investors worry that the yield curve could eventually invert, meaning that short-term rates would be higher than long-term yields. As of Friday, the difference was just 0.25%, with the 10-year yield at around 2% and the 2-year yielding 1.75%.\n\nThe gap widened a bit Monday, as the 10-year rose to 2.1% and the 2-year yield was up to about 1.82%, making the spread 0.28%.\n\nInverted yield curve often occurs before recessions\n\nAn inverted yield curve has often been a potential recession signal. The yield curve inverted in 2019 before the 2020 Covid-induced recession. It also did so in 2007 before the 2008 Global Financial Crisis/Great Recession. And it inverted in early 2000 right before the dot-com/tech stock meltdown.\n\nUS Labor Secretary Marty Walsh told CNN’s Poppy Harlow that a recession is “a real likelihood” but he added that “we have a very strong economy” and noted that the job market in particular is healthy.\n\nWhen investors want higher rates for short-term bonds, it’s an indication that bondholders are nervous. Typically, rates for long-term bonds are higher because you have to wait longer to get paid back.\n\nSo how worried should investors be that the yield curve might invert?\n\nSome argue that the only reason this is happening is because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting spike in commodity prices.\n\n“The risks of a recession are building but not necessarily immediate unless the global geopolitics dramatically deteriorate from this delicate starting point,” Jim Reid, a strategist with Deutsche Bank, said in a report.\n\nThe Federal Reserve, which is widely expected to raise interest rates later this week, may be careful to not raise rates so aggressively that short-term yields increase even further and wind up flipping the yield curve.\n\nThat could cause a slowdown in the job market. And the Fed is supposed to keep an eye on unemployment rates as well as inflation.\n\n“Chair [Jerome] Powell will make it clear that the Fed is aware of its dual mandate and does not want to invert the yield curve and produce a recession,” Jay Hatfield, chief investment officer at ICAP, said in a report.\n\nInflation concerns existed before Russia-Ukraine\n\nAlthough geopolitical tension could be distorting prices, inflation pressures were already building before the Russian attack on Ukraine.\n\n“Russia/Ukraine is only pulling forward the natural slowing in the economy that would have occurred as the Fed tightened policy,” said Tom Essaye, founder of Sevens Report Research, in a note last week.\n\nEssaye argues that Fed rate hikes and a slowing economy would have likely led to an inverted yield curve at some point later this year even if Russia and Ukraine weren’t in the headlines.\n\n“The looming rate hikes (which are still coming) will combine with the growth slowing impulse of higher commodity prices and higher inflation to bring a sooner than previously expected slowing of growth,” he said.\n\nRising short-term rates could also create problems for large Wall Street firms. Although higher rates tend to boost profits for loans, they also make trading, particularly for bonds, more of a gamble.\n\n“The recent flattening of the yield curve and volatility in capital markets are emerging risks; thus, we are more cautious on the largest banks,” analysts at research firm KBW said in a recent report.\n\nThe fact that bond yields are low isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Rates fall when investors are buying bonds. So traders are clearly still finding US Treasury debt to be stable enough to keep flocking to it. But it is unusual to see short-term rates fall this sharply.\n\nOne strategist noted that it doesn’t matter if investors are buying bonds because they perceive them to be safe. There is still a lot to worry about.\n\n“The recession drumbeat is gaining in volume,” Nancy Tengler, CEO and CIO of Laffer Tengler Investments, said in a report. “Of course there are many reasons to be concerned.

You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link.\n\nLondon CNN Business —\n\nPoliticians are under huge pressure to fight inflation as a rapid uptick in prices hits consumers’ wallets and offsets wage hikes.\n\nThat could fuel a tougher stance from regulators on mergers, as leaders like US President Joe Biden try to show they’re on the side of anxious voters.\n\n“This administration, they see various challenges, inflation being one of them,” Andre Barlow, a partner specializing in antitrust law at Doyle, Barlow & Mazard in Washington, told me. “And they’re going to scrutinize various transactions that come in front of them.”\n\nWhat’s happening: Spirit and Frontier Airlines on Monday announced a $6.6 billion merger. The combination of the two low-fare carriers would create America’s fifth largest airline. Shares of Frontier jumped 8%, while Spirit rallied 17%.\n\nBut there’s already speculation that the tie-up could run afoul of antitrust regulators. The Biden administration has made increasing competition in the industry a priority.\n\nExecutives from Spirit and Frontier went on CNBC Monday to emphasize that the deal “is the type of transaction the administration should in fact support.”\n\n“It’s beneficial to the consumer. It’s beneficial to the employees, beneficial to the communities that the airlines serve,” said Bill Franke, Frontier’s chairman. “And at the end of the day, even on combination, these two airlines will control less than 10% of the market.”\n\nTed Christie, Spirit’s CEO, added that the “objective is to continue to push for lower fares across the United States to stimulate more activity.”\n\nYet Savanthi Syth, airline analyst at Raymond James, said she expects “some objection” due to “the Biden administration’s ‘big is bad’ approach.”\n\nThe administration has shown a willingness to be aggressive. In September, the Justice Department sued to block an alliance between American Airlines and JetBlue to consolidate their operations in Boston and New York City.\n\nOther industries are in the crosshairs, too. In January, the US Federal Trade Commission sued to block the $4.4 billion purchase of Aerojet, which supplies missile propulsion systems, by Lockheed Martin, the country’s top defense contractor.\n\nAnd last week, the Justice Department and the US Department of Agriculture launched a new online portal for reporting concerns about potential violations of competition laws in the meat and poultry industry — part of a broader effort to boost competition in the sector and lower prices for consumers.\n\n“Capitalism without competition isn’t capitalism,” Biden said last month after meeting with family-owned and independent farmers and ranchers. “It’s exploitation.”\n\nOn the radar: Airline fares rose 2.7% between November and December, according to US government data.\n\nThe Spirit-Frontier deal could still get done. But Tuesday brought a reminder that not all do.\n\nSoftBank’s record-breaking sale of British chip designer ARM to Nvidia has officially been called off due to “significant regulatory challenges.”\n\nLate last year, the Federal Trade Commission sued to stop the $40 billion deal, saying it would stifle competition and give the combined company too much control over chip technology and designs. National security concerns were also raised in the United Kingdom.\n\nStep back: The Biden administration may be getting tougher. But last year still brought more announcements for mergers and acquisitions than ever before. Global M&A activity totaled $5.9 trillion, an increase of 64% and the strongest period on records from Refinitiv dating back to 1980.\n\nPeloton’s shakeup has arrived\n\nPeloton (PTON) is replacing embattled CEO John Foley in an effort to rebuild the flailing fitness company.\n\nThis just in: Foley, Peloton’s CEO since he co-founded the startup about a decade ago, will transition to executive chair. Barry McCarthy, the former chief financial officer of Spotify and Netflix, will become CEO and president.\n\nThe company will also lay off about 2,800 employees. Twenty percent of corporate positions will go.\n\n“I’m incredibly proud to have worked with such talented teammates over the years who have helped me build Peloton into what it is today, and I’m confident that Barry is the right leader to take the company into its next phase of growth,” Foley said in a statement.\n\nPeloton reports earnings after markets close on Tuesday.\n\nThese changes could indicate that Peloton wants to remain independent, rather than selling itself to a suitor — at least for now. Shares are down 6% in premarket trading. They gained 21% on Monday following reports that Amazon and Nike were exploring bids for the company. Analysts have also suggested that Apple could be interested.\n\nRemember: Peloton’s shares have collapsed over the past year as people started returning to gyms and industry competition ramped up. The company has come under renewed pressure in recent weeks following a report that it had stopped manufacturing new bikes and treadmills.\n\nBlackwells Capital, an activist investor, recently said it has “grave concerns” about Peloton’s performance and called on its board of directors to fire Foley and explore a sale.\n\nBumper oil profits revive calls for windfall tax\n\nNews that Britain’s biggest oil companies made $32 billion in profit last year is stoking calls for the government to impose a temporary tax on their earnings to help households pay soaring energy bills, my CNN Business colleague Mark Thompson reports.\n\nThe latest: BP (BP) posted an annual profit of almost $12.9 billion on Tuesday. Shell reported a profit of $19.3 billion last week after what it described as a “momentous” year.\n\nBoth companies have been boosted by a huge rebound in oil and natural gas prices after they collapsed at the start of the pandemic. The bumper earnings have allowed them to accelerate investments in lower carbon and renewable energy projects while also handing back billions of dollars to investors in the form of dividends and share buybacks.\n\nShares of BP are up 24% in 2022, while Shell’s stock is 25% higher. The FTSE 100, for comparison, has climbed less than 3%.\n\nNot everyone is happy, though. For weeks, anti-poverty campaigners and opposition politicians have been calling for the UK government to introduce a one-off levy on major oil and gas companies to provide financial relief for the households that are already struggling with 30-year high inflation and surging energy prices.\n\nThe latest results could bolster this campaign, with the opposition Labour Party renewing its push on Tuesday — though there’s no sign UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is prepared to adopt such a proposal.\n\nUp next\n\nHarley-Davidson (HOG) and Warner Music Group report results before US markets open.

Amazon acquired PillPack, an online pharmacy, in 2018 and later launched its own digital pharmacy in the United States. Separately, Amazon partnered with JP Morgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway on an effort to provide better health care services and insurance at a lower cost to workers and families at the three companies, and possibly other businesses, too. That effort, called Haven, shut down last year.\n\nAmazon in recent years has broadened its empire from online retail to entertainment, groceries and more, increasing its vast reach into the lives of consumers in the process. The One Medical acquisition would be one of the largest in Amazon’s history. Amazon agreed to buy grocery chain Whole Foods in 2017 for $13.7 billion and earlier this year closed an $8.5 billion deal to buy iconic Hollywood movie studio MGM.\n\nWith the One Medical deal, Amazon would gain access to physical health clinics and “payer and hospital system relationships,” Evercore ISI analyst Elizabeth Anderson said in a note Thursday morning.\n\nHeadquartered in San Francisco, One Medical has seen demand for its services surge in recent years amid the Covid-19 pandemic and the rise of the telehealth sector. In its most-recent quarterly earnings report, One Medical said it had a total membership count of 767,000, up 28% year-over-year. One Medical went public in January 2020.\n\nShares for 1life Healthcare (ONEM), the parent company of One Medical, surged more than 65% in early trading Thursday after the announcement. Amazon stock opened the relatively flat Thursday. (Shares for CVS Health Corp and Walgreens Boots Alliance dipped slightly Thursday morning following the news.)\n\nThe deal remains subject to approval from One Medical’s shareholders and regulators.\n\nNicholas Economides, a professor of economics at New York University’s Stern School of Business, said he is skeptical the deal may trigger much formal antitrust scrutiny. He compared the One Medical acquisition to Amazon’s earlier purchase of Whole Foods, saying that Amazon’s preexisting marketshare in both industries was rather small at the time of the respective deals. Traditionally, antitrust regulators have closely scrutinized mergers that might eliminate a competitor from within the same market, but have rarely objected to deals where one company acquires its way into an adjacent industry.\n\n“The grounds for intervention are even weaker in this case than in Whole Foods, because to some extent Amazon is a marketplace for selling food, so to a small extent it was a competitor to Whole Foods before the merger,” Economides said. “Here, I don’t see Amazon having a significant business in healthcare.”\n\nBut some were quick to call for more scrutiny of the deal. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who chairs the Senate antitrust subcommittee, said the Federal Trade Commission must “thoroughly investigate” the proposed acquisition. The e-commerce giant’s bid “raises questions about potential anticompetitive effects” Amazon could exert through its pharmacy service, Klobuchar wrote to FTC Chair Lina Khan on Thursday.\n\nAlthough Amazon’s latest deal may not raise red flags under a traditional antitrust rubric, the announcement comes as officials at the FTC, the Justice Department and in Congress have sounded a tougher note on large tech platforms and vowed to get more creative — and aggressive — about enforcing competition law. Some US lawmakers are urgently pushing to pass a bill that could erect new barriers between tech giants’ various lines of business, preventing them from using their massive scale in multiple verticals as a kind of force multiplier that critics say harms competition.\n\nShortly after the deal was announced, some tech industry critics also raised concerns about the health data to which the company could gain access.\n\n“Amazon having back door access to private health care data is frankly a terrifying thought and calls into focus how desperately Congress needs to pass antitrust reform to prevent these tech giants from abusing their monopoly power,” Sacha Haworth, executive director of the Tech Oversight Project advocacy group, told CNN Business in a statement.\n\nCNN’s Brian Fung contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Catherine Thorbecke"], "publish_date": "2022/07/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/18/business/toys-r-us-macys-partnership/index.html", "title": "Toys 'R' Us is coming to every Macy's this holiday season | CNN ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nOnce left for dead, Toys “R” Us is making a major comeback.

Parler’s parent, Parlement Technologies, would remain involved by providing technical services and cloud support.\n\nBuying Parler could make West the latest celebrity owner of a social media platform after former President Donald Trump’s bid to win over conservatives with Truth Social and Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s proposed acquisition of Twitter. It also highlights how a small group of wealthy men, some of whom were banned or suspended themselves for incendiary remarks, are looking to own social media platforms in an effort to bolster what they call “free speech.”\n\n“In a world where conservative opinions are considered to be controversial we have to make sure we have the right to freely express ourselves,” West said in a release by Parler.\n\nAs part of the announcement, Parler linked to West’s account on the platform, which appeared to have launched simultaneously. As of early Monday, the account had roughly 500 followers.\n\nFor Ye, the deal comes during a particularly controversial period. West has made headlines in recent weeks for wearing a “White Lives Matter” T-shirt in public and defending his use of the slogan — a phrase the Anti-Defamation League has linked to white supremacy groups — as “funny” to Fox News host Tucker Carlson. After the shirt incident, the apparel company Adidas this month said it was reviewing its partnership with West. In September, West also said he was abandoning a two-year partnership with the clothing retailer Gap.\n\nSpeaking on CNN Monday, Jonathan Greenblatt, the ADL’s CEO, called Parler a “haven” of hate.\n\nParler was founded in 2018 and saw rapid growth surrounding the 2020 election. Billing itself as a loosely moderated free-speech haven, the app became popular with conservative politicians and media figures, peaking at an estimated 2.9 million daily users, according to the market research firm Apptopia. But since then, its fortunes have dimmed, with Parler’s estimated daily user count slipping to just 40,000, Apptopia told CNN on Monday. (Twitter, by comparison, has more than 237 million daily active users.)\n\nIn the weeks following the Jan. 6 riots, Parler was removed from both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store for what the companies said was a failure to adequately moderate violent rhetoric on the platform. Documents provided to the House committee investigating the Capitol riots have shown how the Secret Service was aware of posts on Parler that suggested the possibility of violence surrounding that day. Separately, Parler has written to Congress claiming that lawmakers’ interest in the app’s role in the riots has been intended to “scapegoat” the app.\n\nParler has since been restored to both app stores after making changes to its content moderation practices.\n\nParler has faced more competition in recent months as the burgeoning right-wing digital media ecosystem has expanded. Truth Social launched in February on Apple’s app store, and was approved for Google’s app store on Oct. 13. Truth Social saw a spike of downloads last week due to its appearance on the Google Play Store, Apptopia said, and before then had been hovering at 144,000 daily active users.\n\nMusk’s move to buy Twitter, if the deal goes through, also has the potential to upend Parler and similar services. Musk has repeatedly called for eliminating permanent bans and rethinking Twitter’s approach to content moderation, which could once again make the much larger platform a home for some of the users who jumped to small services like Parler.\n\nIt could also effectively mean that Musk and Ye, who are said to be friends, are now competing with each other. After Ye’s antisemitic tweet sparked an outcry, Musk tweeted: “Talked to ye today & expressed my concerns about his recent tweet, which I think he took to heart.”\n\nOne week later, Ye’s deal to buy Parler was announced.", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/10/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/21/business/balenciaga-kanye-west/index.html", "title": "Balenciaga cuts partnership with Kanye West | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nFashion powerhouse Balenciaga has officially severed ties with Kanye West following a series of antisemitic posts and other controversial comments from the rapper, according to a report from Women’s Wear Daily citing a statement from Balenciaga’s parent company.\n\n“Balenciaga has no longer any relationship nor any plans for future projects related to this artist,” Kering, Balenciaga’s parent company, said in a statement to WWD. Kering did not respond to CNN Business’ requests for comment.\n\nWest, who legally changed his name to Ye, collaborated with Balenciaga for a wildly popular Yeezy Gap line earlier this year. Gap first announced its 10-year deal with Ye for the Yeezy Gap brand in June 2020, but West said last month he was ending his partnership with the Gap because of “substantial noncompliance.”\n\nIn an internal company email, Mark Breitbard, president and CEO of Gap Brand, said it decided to “wind down the partnership” because their “vision is not aligned.”\n\nAdidas also said it is reviewing its partnership with West after an increasingly tense relationship grew between the two.\n\nThe New York Times reported that West and Balenciaga’s relationship has been a close one and that he and creative director Demna Gvasalia text “several times a day.” But Gvasalia and Cédric Charbit, Balenciaga’s chief executive, reportedly attended the ill-fated Paris fashion show where West wore one of his controversial line of “White Lives Matter” shirts.\n\nYe’s Twitter and Instagram accounts were restricted earlier this month for violating policies for posts containing antisemitic content.\n\nIn a now-deleted tweet, West said he was “going death con 3 [sic] On JEWISH PEOPLE,” according to Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine records pulled by CNN.\n\nRecently, Ye announced plans to acquire Parler, a far-right social platform, to prevent having “to fear being removed from social media again.”", "authors": ["Ramishah Maruf"], "publish_date": "2022/10/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/18/tech/kanye-west-parler-conservative-social-media/index.html", "title": "Kanye West's biggest challenge with owning Parler may come from ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nOne week ago, Kanye West was temporarily suspended from Twitter for posting antisemitic tweets. Now, the rapper has agreed to acquire Parler, an alternative social platform popular with conservatives, to prevent ever having “to fear being removed from social media again.”\n\nWest, who has legally changed his name to Ye, is just the latest controversial figure to bet on a nascent, alternative set of social media platforms favored by conservatives and members of the far-right who profess to feel outrage over content moderation on more mainstream services.\n\nAfter being banned from Twitter following the Jan. 6 insurrection, former President Donald Trump backed Truth Social, an alternative to Twitter. In a slide deck, Trump’s digital media company touted the ambitious possibility of creating not just alternatives to the major social media platforms but also to cloud computing products like Amazon Web Services and payment service Stripe.\n\nSeparately, Peter Thiel, an influential venture capitalist and Republican donor, invested in Rumble, a conservative alternative to YouTube. Other services, including Gab and Gettr, are also part of what Ben Decker, CEO of digital threat analysis company Memetica, calls an “alt social media ecosystem,” fueled by “the deplatforming of high-profile conservative” figures from other larger platforms in recent years.\n\nThere are a range of potential reasons why West — an erratic figure known for chaotic business dealings — may have wanted to acquire Parler, a platform that’s been home to election denialism, antisemitism and adherents to the conspiracy theory QAnon. He was likely frustrated with his antisemitic comments being removed from Twitter (TWTR) and Instagram, and for being permanently suspended from the latter. West is also friends with conservative political commentator Candace Owens, who has reportedly encouraged the rapper’s political involvement and whose husband is Parler’s CEO.\n\nIn a statement included with the Parler announcement on Monday, West alluded to the need for a different, safe space for conservatives, a camp with whom he identifies. “In a world where conservative opinions are considered to be controversial we have to make sure we have the right to freely express ourselves,” he said. West also discussed his planned Parler takeover with Trump, a source familiar with the conversation told CNN Monday, although it was unclear if the two spoke before or after the news of the rapper’s acquisition was made public.\n\nBut to the extent he is serious about the acquisition, which remains very much unclear, West faces an uncertain path forward that mirrors the challenges for other services promising unfettered “free speech.”\n\nFor starters, the audience for these alternative platforms remains far smaller than the mainstream services they are competing with. Even if all 40,000 of Parler’s estimated daily active users followed West on the platform, his audience would pale in comparison to the 31.4 million followers he has on Twitter, not to mention Twitter’s more than 200 million daily active users.\n\nAnd despite professing to provide an unrestricted home for fringe content, some services, including Parler, have had to make concessions on content moderation to be allowed on the major app stores. Apple said last year that it had approved Parler’s return to the iOS app store following improvements the company made to better detect and moderate hate speech and incitement, and Google did the same last month. But even with app store approvals, large marketers tend to shy away from running ads alongside content that even whiffs of controversy.\n\nPerhaps the biggest wild card of all comes from West’s friend and fellow erratic rich guy, Elon Musk. The billionaire Tesla CEO appears closer than ever to taking over an already established platform, Twitter, with plans to cut back on its content restrictions. (Following the Parler announcement, Musk tweeted, and later deleted, “fun times ahead!” along with a meme showing the two men’s smiling faces superimposed over a cartoon.)\n\nVarious regulations and business interests may keep Musk from fully committing to letting anything stay on Twitter, in the same way it has for Parler and others. But it might not take much to get right-leaning users, including influential figures, to return to Twitter. Musk has said he would restore Trump’s account on the platform; and while the former president has said he will stick to Truth Social, it’s hard to imagine he wouldn’t at least be tempted to return to Twitter’s much larger megaphone.\n\nShares of the investment vehicle set to take Trump’s Truth Social public slid when Musk first announced his plan to buy Twitter, and fell again earlier this month when Musk revived his proposal to buy it. Likewise, Rumble, which only recently went public via a similar path, saw its stock decline recently when Musk said the deal was back on.\n\nMany of the right-leaning figures who have championed alternative platforms have cheered Musk’s plan to take over Twitter, a sign that they might abandon their dedication to a right-leaning social media ecosystem if a more mainstream platform was willing to welcome them back. Radio personality Joe Rogan — who previously discussed a move to Gettr — said in a text message to Musk in April, “I REALLY hope you get Twitter. If you do, we should throw one hell of a party.”\n\nSocial platforms are attractive in large part because they enable conversations and connections between lots of different kinds of people. With alternative conservative platforms, many users may be discouraged by the echo chamber. “If you go to these platforms, there is one conversation happening,” said Darren Linvill, a Clemson University professor who studies disinformation and inauthentic behavior on social media. Conservative users uninterested in politics may also avoid the alternative platforms because of other objectionable content they host, according to experts who study the space.\n\nPutting the political discourse aside, many such platforms also suffer from technical issues and poor user interfaces. Unlike their mainstream rivals, these newer services lack sufficient resources to fix those issues.

Students loans\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Monday announced that federal student loan borrowers can now apply online for up to $20,000 in debt forgiveness. “This is a game changer for millions of Americans… and it took an incredible amount of effort to get this website done in such a short time,” Biden said. People seeking to apply for student debt relief can fill out the form at StudentAid.gov. Borrowers have until December 31, 2023, to submit an application. In August, Biden announced his decision to cancel up to $10,000 in student loan debt for individuals making less than $125,000 a year or as much as $20,000 for eligible borrowers who were also Pell Grant recipients. The latest phase of his plan is expected to provide debt relief to as many as 43 million borrowers.\n\n2. Russia\n\nAt least 13 people, including three children, were killed after a Russian military jet crashed into apartments in the country’s western city of Yeysk on Monday, state media and authorities said. The crash occurred during a training flight in which one of the plane’s engines caught on fire, Russia’s Defense Ministry told a state-run news agency. Images and videos of the crash’s aftermath showed smoke billowing and fire blazing in the residential area. A building, believed to house hundreds of people, was later engulfed in flames, officials said. Russian President Vladimir Putin told authorities to provide all necessary assistance to the victims of the crash, the Kremlin said in a statement.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Video shows scene where Russian jet crashed into building 01:38 - Source: CNN\n\n3. Trump\n\nNew documents released by the House Oversight Committee on Monday revealed that the Trump Organization charged the Secret Service “exorbitant rates” – upwards of $1.4 million over four years – to protect then-President Donald Trump and his family at properties they owned. The rates were as high as $1,185 per night despite claims by Trump’s company that federal employees traveling with him would stay at those properties “for free” or “at cost.” Charging his protective detail for lodging at his properties was a controversial practice when Trump was in office, and it has continued in his post-presidency because it appears to have been taxpayer-funded, the panel’s chairwoman, Democratic Rep. Carolyn Maloney said. Separately, a House report released Monday also alleges Trump aides blocked public health officials from providing accurate Covid-19 information during the pandemic.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Haberman reacts to report that refutes Trump's claims about Secret Service expenses 01:45 - Source: CNN\n\n4. Grocery stores\n\nA major supermarket merger could result in significant changes to grocery shopping in America, industry analysts say. The proposed merger of Kroger and Albertsons, which the companies expect to complete in 2024, would combine the fifth and tenth largest retailers in the country. If approved by federal regulators, the nearly $25 billion deal would be one of the biggest in US retail history. With grocery prices already a concern for many shoppers, the companies said that they would be able to use $500 million in cost savings from the deal to reduce prices for shoppers and tailor promotions and savings. They also said they will invest $1.3 billion in Albertsons, which would include lowering prices. However, some critics and antitrust advocates say the merger would force out competition and concentrate power among the largest chains – resulting in higher prices.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'I need to cut back on things': Family reacts to surging food prices 01:01 - Source: CNN Business\n\n5.

Here's why it probably won't happen | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nKanye West has had so many controversies you may have forgotten a few.\n\nFrom his infamous interruption of Taylor Swift’s acceptance speech at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards to his early embrace of former President Trump and his “Make America Great Again” agenda, the artist, designer and entrepreneur is, perhaps, best known for being a provocateur.\n\nThe latest calls to cancel West, who legally changed his name to Ye, may be the most intense yet.\n\nAfter he wore and featured “White Lives Matter” (The Anti-Defamation League categorizes the phrase as a “hate slogan” used by White supremacist groups, including the Ku Klux Klan) apparel in his recent Paris fashion show, there was new outcry against West.\n\n“Kanye’s actions are just so dangerous and irresponsible. I don’t care how great his music is, we have to stop supporting someone who uses their platform so irresponsibly,” TV host, professor and former CNN commentator Marc Lamont Hill posted on social media.\n\nAnother lightning rod came earlier this week, when West’s Twitter and Instagram accounts were restricted for violating policies following posts that were criticized as antisemitic. Days later, it was announced that his episode of the YouTube series “The Shop: Uninterrupted” would not release because he used his appearance “to reiterate more hate speech and very ugly stereotypes.”\n\nThis has led some to suggest that West’s career has crashed and burned and there’s no coming back from it all. But here’s why that’s not necessarily the case:\n\nSign of the times\n\nFor all the talk of “cancel culture,” we now live in an era where bad behavior, especially by public figures, garners all of the outrage - until it doesn’t.\n\nNot only do we live in a society that moves fairly quickly from scandal to scandal, racism and cruelty to others no longer live in the shadows.\n\nSo while plenty of people have condemned West for his actions and comments, there are many who support both because they agree with him.\n\nThen there is the fame factor.\n\nStar power has only increased in recent years, especially because social media fosters a sense of intimacy between artists and their followers.\n\n“West’s celebrity status has kept us watching and listening mostly because we’re keenly aware that so many others are also paying attention,” Washington Post senior critic-at-large Robin Givhan recently wrote.\n\n“And each time he says something indecipherable or cruel, we recoil as if we are shocked anew, as if he has not been terrible before,” she continued. “We respond as if we believe that fame is a preventive to terrible behavior, that those who know they’re being watched will aim to be on their best behavior rather than using all that attention as an enticement to acting out.”\n\nThe Trump effect\n\nWest has been very clear about his admiration for Trump, and the two men do seem to share an approach to communication.\n\nWest recently said in an interview with Fox News host Tucker Carlson that he “started to really feel this need to express myself on another level when Trump was running for office and I liked him.”\n\nWest said he was warned against supporting Trump, telling Carlson people told him “my career would be over, my life would be over.”\n\nInstead, West earned new fans from some of the same people who also support the former president.\n\nAfter conservative author and ACT! for America founder Brigitte Gabriel tweeted her support for West, one of her followers responded, “I used to judge him quite harshly. I’m finding new respect for him now.”\n\nThe art versus the artist\n\nIt’s long been debated whether one can embrace the art without supporting the artist. West has a history of coming out on the winning side of that question.\n\nThere were calls to boycott West in 2018 after comments he made about the history of slavery in the United States.\n\n“When you hear about slavery for 400 years,” West said during an interview with TMZ. “For 400 years? That sounds like a choice.”\n\nYet, a month later, all seven tracks on his “Ye” album debuted on Billboard’s Top 40 chart.\n\nThere have been several other controversies since that have not stopped West from achieving mass success with his fashion and sneaker lines.\n\nAnd while West terminated his relationship with the Gap in September, and Adidas has put their partnership with him under review, he entered the public consciousness nearly two decades ago through music that people will likely continue to return to.\n\nThe first words West speaks on his first hit, “Through the Wire,” in retrospect, may have been prescient: “They can’t stop me from rapping can they?”", "authors": ["Lisa Respers France"], "publish_date": "2022/10/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/18/opinions/kanye-west-elon-musk-social-media-alaimo/index.html", "title": "Opinion: Are Kanye West and Elon Musk the Rush Limbaughs of ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: Kara Alaimo, an associate professor in the Lawrence Herbert School of Communication at Hofstra University, writes about issues affecting women and social media.

View more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe conservative social media company Parler announced on Monday that it is being purchased by Kanye West, who was temporarily suspended from Twitter this month for an antisemitic tweet. A statement from Parler’s parent company announcing the deal described West, who has legally changed his name to Ye, as having taken “a groundbreaking move into the free speech media space” where “he will never have to fear being removed from social media again.”\n\nKara Alaimo Courtesy Kara Alaimo\n\nIn a release by Parler, West said that “in a world where conservative opinions are considered to be controversial we have to make sure we have the right to freely express ourselves.”\n\nThis development means several social media companies could soon be left in the hands of mercurial, mega-rich men who have pledged to promote “free speech,” including the kind of extreme views that got West temporarily booted from Twitter. Elon Musk is currently in the process of buying Twitter, though Twitter said in a recent court filing that federal authorities (it was not clear which ones) are investigating Musk (while Musk’s attorney said this filing was designed to distract from Twitter’s own legal issues).\n\nFor his part, Musk has said Twitter should be “an inclusive arena for free speech.” And former President Donald Trump, who was thrown off Twitter and Facebook in January 2021, founded the company that created Truth Social, which describes itself as a “free speech haven.”\n\nIf West and Musk go through with their deals, these three social media platforms are likely to serve as ecosystems for conservative thought. This will likely make the views of those who remain on them more extreme — which could have a radical effect on our politics. That’s because when people who think similarly come together, they reaffirm and heighten one another’s initial beliefs.\n\nWhile men such as West, Musk and Trump claim to promote free speech by not favoring the moderation of problematic content, here’s what lack of moderation really does: It drives away the people victimized by abusive content such as West’s tweet.\n\nA 2020 study of women in 51 countries by The Economist Intelligence Unit found that 38% have been victims of online violence, from stalking to doxxing to violent threats. As Amnesty International and others have found, women of color are most affected. Antisemitic content is also rampant online. A 2021 report by the Center for Countering Digital Hate found that a sample of 714 anti-Jewish posts on five social networks had been viewed 7.3 million times.\n\nWhen women become victims of online hate, they often “shut down their blogs, avoid websites they formerly frequented, take down social networking profiles, (and) refrain from engaging in online political commentary,” according to University of Miami law professor Mary Anne Franks.\n\nIn practice, what these so-called free speech policies really boil down to is an ugly form of censorship that scares away the voices of people who are attacked by users of these platforms.\n\nWest has already described Parler as a place where conservative views can flourish, and nonconservatives are unlikely to flock to Truth Social, given its association with Trump. If women, people of color and others start fleeing Twitter, that could leave it as a platform for conservatives as well. This would likely make the views of those who remain even more zealous.\n\n“When like-minded people get together, they often end up thinking a more extreme version of what they thought before they started to talk to one another,” Harvard University law professor Cass Sunstein writes in “On Rumors: How Falsehoods Spread, Why We Believe Them, and What Can Be Done.” Sunstein says this happens because their exchanges heighten their preexisting beliefs and make them more confident.\n\nSo, when conservatives get together on social media, we can expect them to become more far right. And just as Rush Limbaugh and other conservative talk-show hosts radically altered the political landscape in the 1990s in ways that laid the groundwork for Trump’s presidency, the far-right views nurtured on these social networks could have a huge impact on our country’s politics. It isn’t hard to imagine that the people who commune on these sites could band together to support and elect political candidates who share their worldviews.\n\nWe can also expect these male owners to use their platforms to amplify their own views — even when they’re sexist, misogynistic, racist or otherwise hateful.\n\nIf West comes to own Parler and Musk takes the reins of Twitter, an already-extant conservative ecosystem will be supercharged on social media. These men’s “free speech” policies are likely to drive away people victimized by hate online. Those who remain in these conservative spaces will become even more extreme as a result of their interactions, which could cultivate a dangerous far-right ideology that has far-reaching effects on our politics.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter.

You can sign up for free right here.\n\nTwo newspapers owned by Gannett, one in Indiana and one in Ohio, have humanized the new American reality about abortion now that Roe v. Wade has been reversed. And in doing so, they have highlighted the inhumanity of some partisan punditry.\n\nOn July 1, the Indianapolis Star reported that a 10-year-old girl in Ohio was pregnant, and because “the Buckeye state had outlawed any abortion after six weeks,” the girl was brought to Indiana for an abortion. The source was Dr. Caitlin Bernard, an obstetrician-gynecologist in Indianapolis, who said she had conferred with a child abuse doctor in Ohio.\n\nNo further details about the girl or the alleged rapist were obtainable, even though some news outlets tried. In recent days, after President Biden cited the news report and denounced Ohio’s abortion ban, many conservative media outlets and Republican office-holders poured skepticism on the case, and some personalities flatly said they did not believe the 10-year-old existed. Rep. Jim Jordan tweeted: “Another lie. Anyone surprised?”\n\nYou know what’s coming next. On Wednesday, the Columbus Dispatch reported that a man has been charged in the case. Police say Gerson Fuentes, 27, “confessed to raping the child on at least two occasions.”\n\nNone of the media outlets that sowed doubt about the case were in court for the arraignment. Hardly any of them were even in the state. The Dispatch’s Bethany Bruner said she was the “only reporter in the courtroom” when it happened. “This confirms that the case exists,” she wrote on Twitter, sharing the link to her story.\n\nBruner said the Dispatch relied on public records to track down Fuentes. It’s “fitting,” Washington Post media critic Erik Wemple said, “that perhaps the biggest abortion story since the SCOTUS overturning of Roe v. Wade stems from regional/local newspapers, because that’s where the reporting on this issue will be playing out for months and years. A brand-new test for a hollowed-out American media sector.”\n\nThe doubters and deniers\n\nRight-wing skepticism about the case bubbled up on social media last week and boiled over after Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler wrote about the difficulty in confirming Bernard’s account. On Monday Fox’s Jesse Watters hosted Ohio’s Republican A.G. Dave Yost, who said there was “not a whisper” of any evidence that such a crime occurred. Up until Wednesday morning, “Yost was on a media tour casting doubt on the veracity of the story,” and criticizing the Indianapolis Star, Vice’s Paul Blest wrote. Segments on Fox also heaped suspicion on the Star’s story. The WSJ’s editorial board called it an “unlikely story from a biased source that neatly fits the progressive narrative but can’t be confirmed,” adding, “PJ Media’s Megan Fox was first to point this out.”\n\nOnce the Dispatch reported on the suspect’s arrest, Fox came up with other reasons to blast the media, and Watters credited his show with putting on “the pressure” to find the suspect, adding, “we are glad that justice is being served.” He plastered Bernard’s photo on screen and accused her of participating in a coverup. Then his guest attacked the Indy Star and its “abortionist movement.” One hour later, Tucker Carlson strongly implied that the identity of the suspect was shrouded in secrecy because, in Carlson’s words, “apparently the rapist was an illegal alien.” The suspect’s immigration status is now the focus of right-wing media coverage.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal editorial board attached an “editor’s note” to its unfortunate piece and filed a new editorial “correcting the record” Wednesday evening. And as for Jordan’s “another lie” tweet, well, he just deleted it.\n\nThere are so many untold stories\n\nFor more on this awful episode, check out NPR’s new report by David Folkenflik and Sarah McCammon. They wrote that it “illustrates the high stakes of both the new legal landscape on abortion and of reporting in an age of deep political polarization and mistrust of major news outlets.”\n\nNiemanLab’s Laura Hazard Owen also wrote about the reporting dynamics on Wednesday. Her headline: “Unimaginable abortion stories will become more common. Is American journalism ready?”\n\nThe Dispatch is ready. Wednesday’s story by Bruner and her colleagues Monroe Trombly and Tony Cook not only contains critical details from the courtroom, it includes the broader context that everyone on every side of the reproductive rights debate needs to face. Like this: “An analysis of Columbus police reports filed since May 9 found 50 reports of rape or sexual abuse involving girls 15 years or younger.”\n\nThat’s a report almost every single day, in just one metro area, and certainly a partial count – underscoring a vast number of untold stories.

At least 30 people have sustained injuries and been admitted to the hospital, according to the Colombo National Hospital.\n\nA nurse at the hospital told CNN that many people were brought in due to tear gas inhalation, while others had cuts and bruises likely received when trying to jump over fences. The nurse did not confirm any gunshot injuries.\n\nAs per Sri Lanka’s constitution, Rajapaksa’s resignation would only be considered official once the speaker of the parliament receives a letter stating it.\n\nSpeaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena said that Rajapaksa had reassured him of his resignation over the phone on Wednesday, but that he is still waiting for the official document confirming it.\n\nAt the colonial-era prime minister’s office, people could be seen on the balcony, lighting firecrackers and waving the Sri Lankan flag, according to witnesses.\n\nDemonstrators outside demanded that neither the President nor the Prime Minister “be spared.”\n\nThis follows months of escalating anger over the economic crisis, with Rajapaksa accused of high-level corruption and mismanagement that ultimately bankrupted the country.\n\nAs demonstrators took to the streets, acting President Wickremesinghe appointed a committee of senior armed forces commanders headed by the Chief of Defense Staff Lt. Gen. Shavendra Silva to “restore law and order” in the nation, a high-ranking military official told CNN Wednesday.\n\nWickremesinghe declared a state of emergency across Sri Lanka and a curfew on Wednesday only to later cancel both orders, according to the prime minister’s office.\n\nIn Colombo, a handful of protesters also entered the premises of state broadcaster Sri Lanka Rupavahini on Wednesday, negotiating a “deal” with broadcast staff to not give airtime to politicians such as Wickremesinghe.

It is now known as the General Intelligence Service (GIS).\n\nPrevious CNN investigations have implicated the agency in the deaths of protesters. Its continued influence, sources say, was another “red line” for Hamdok, rendering the relationship with the military untenable.\n\n“The restoration of arrest and search authority to the intelligence service and the continuation of repression against the demonstrators was the straw that broke the camel’s back in the Burhan-Hamdok agreement,” a senior source in the civilian leadership told CNN.\n\nCNN has reached out to contacts within the Sudanese military for comment but has so far received no response.\n\nThe European Union and the so-called Troika on Sudan – the United States, Norway and the United Kingdom – called on “all Sudanese leaders to recommit to the country’s democratic transition” following Hamdok’s resignation, according to a joint statement on Tuesday.\n\nThe group said that they would not support the unilateral appointment of a new prime minister “without the involvement of a broad range of civilian stakeholders.”\n\n“We look forward to working with a government and a transitional parliament, which enjoy credibility with the Sudanese people and can lead the country to free and fair elections as a priority,” the statement said, adding: “This will be necessary to facilitate the European Union and the Troika’s provision of economic assistance to Sudan.”\n\n‘Freedom and justice’\n\nHamdok’s resignation speech came after three protesters were killed by Sudanese security forces during anti-coup demonstrations near the capital Sunday, the civilian-allied Sudanese Central Doctors Committee (SCDC) said.\n\nSunday’s protests in Omdurman, about 25 kilometers (16 miles) northwest of Khartoum, were the 14th day of mass demonstrations against military rule since the military coup. At least 57 people have been killed by security forces since, the SCDC reported.\n\nIn the speech, Hamdok said he was stepping down to make way “for the daughters or sons” of the country to complete the transitional period.\n\nPro-democracy demonstrators protest in Khartoum on January 2.

Even then, the Prime Minister insisted that he would continue as caretaker leader while the Conservative Party launches the process of choosing a successor.\n\nSome senior figures in his party say even that will be unsustainable, given the dwindling number of people willing to work for him.\n\nOthers are already lining up to replace him. Party officials say they will announce the timetable for a leadership election by Monday.\n\nSpeaking in front of the famous 10 Downing Street door, the same place where many of his predecessors delivered their own resignation address, Johnson announced that he would be stepping down – without actually saying the words out loud.\n\n“It is clearly now the will of the parliamentary Conservative Party that there should be a new leader of that party and therefore, a new prime minister,” Johnson said.\n\n“The process of choosing that new leader should begin now,” he added, saying the time line will be announced next week.\n\nIn a sign that he is planning to stay in the office for as long as he can, Johnson announced he had appointed a new cabinet “to serve, as I will, until a new leader is in place.” Appointing new cabinet ministers means that the government can continue to function as he prepares to depart.\n\nJohnson spoke of his attempts to stay on as leader and how “painful” it is for him to step down, but made no mention of the scandals that have proved his political downfall.\n\n“In the last few days, I’ve tried to persuade my colleagues that it would be eccentric to change governments when we’re delivering so much… and when the economic scene is so difficult domestically and internationally,” Johnson said.\n\n“I regret not to have been successful in those arguments, and of course, it’s painful, not to be able to see through so many ideas and projects myself,” he said, adding that he’s proud of “getting Brexit done” and “leading the West in standing up to Putin’s aggression in Ukraine.”\n\nJohnson went on to address voters directly, expressing sadness at stepping down after nearly three years.\n\n“To you, the British public: I know that there will be many people who are relieved and, perhaps, quite a few will also be disappointed,” he said. “And I want you to know how sad I am to be giving up the best job in the world, but them’s the breaks.”\n\nJohnson has in recent months been engulfed in a series of scandals that forced even his most stalwart supporters to abandon him. The latest was Downing Street’s botched handling of the resignation by Johnson’s former deputy chief whip, Chris Pincher, who was accused of groping two men last week.\n\nJohnson initially attempted to ride out the crisis – despite an unprecedented flight of middle-ranking ministers from the government, a battering at Prime Minister’s Questions and a bruising appearance before a committee of senior lawmakers in Parliament. On Wednesday, he still insisted he wasn’t going to resign.\n\nHe finally gave in Thursday after some of his most loyal allies told him that the game was up.\n\nUK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said Johnson had made the “right decision” to resign. “We need calmness and unity now and to keep governing while a new leader is found,” she added.\n\nGreg Clark, newly appointed UK Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, said that he had a “duty to ensure that the country has a functioning government.”\n\nThe leader of the opposition Labour Party, Keir Starmer, said it was “good news for the country” that Johnson had decided to resign, adding that “it should have happened long ago.”\n\n“He was always unfit for office. He has been responsible for lies, scandal and fraud on an industrial scale,” said Starmer on Twitter.\n\nThe opposition leader also had scathing words for the Conservatives. “They have been in power for 12 years. The damage they have done is profound. Twelve years of economic stagnation. Twelve years of declining public services. Twelve years of empty promises,” Starmer said.\n\n“Enough is enough. We don’t need to change the Tory at the top – we need a proper change of government. We need a fresh start for Britain.”\n\n‘Needless damage’\n\nConventionally, when a Conservative leader resigns, he or she gives the party time to hold a thorough leadership contest, in which Conservative lawmakers and then party members nationwide vote.\n\nBut some said Johnson should leave office more quickly.\n\n“We now need a new Leader as soon as practicable,” Business and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said on Twitter. “Someone who can rebuild trust, heal the country, and set out a new, sensible and consistent economic approach to help families,” he added.\n\nScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also called for the leadership question to be settled.\n\n“There will be a widespread sense of relief that the chaos of the last few days (indeed months) will come to an end, though notion of Boris Johnson staying on as PM until autumn seems far from ideal, and surely not sustainable?” Sturgeon said in a series of tweets.\n\nConservative MP Steve Baker told CNN that the party needs “to move swiftly to a leadership contest.”\n\nBaker said Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab should be caretaker prime minister, but that Johnson could also continue in office. Raab has deputized for Johnson in the past: When the PM was in intensive care with Covid-19 in April 2020 and then again briefly last month when Johnson underwent “routine” operation and was put under general anesthetic.\n\nRaab said he would not stand as next Conservative party leader, according to Britain’s PA news agency, which would make him a candidate for a caretaker PM if Johnson was to step down early.\n\n“I am absolutely determined that we should not prolong this crisis. If it’s agreed within government that Boris Johnson should continue as caretaker, then that’s fine with me,” Baker told CNN. “Because we need to just end the crisis, get into a leadership contest, and start fresh in September.”\n\nFormer British Prime Minister John Major said it would be “unwise and may be unsustainable” for Johnson to remain in the office of prime minister for long while a new Conservative leader is chosen. He too suggested Raab could serve as the acting prime minister.\n\nHours after Johnson’s announcement, Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat launched his campaign for the top job with an editorial in UK newspaper the Telegraph.\n\nBarrage of criticism\n\nJohnson’s departure will mark a remarkable downfall for a prime minister who was once seen as having political superpowers, with an appeal that transcended traditional party lines.\n\nHe won a landslide victory in December 2019 on the promise of delivering a Brexit deal and leading the UK to a bright future outside the European Union. But his premiership unraveled in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nIn recent months the prime minister has faced a barrage of criticism from all sides over his conduct and that of some members of his government, including illegal, Covid-19 lockdown-breaking parties thrown in his Downing Street offices for which he and others were fined.\n\nNumerous other scandals have also hit his standing in the polls. These include accusations of using donor money inappropriately to pay for a refurbishment of his Downing Street home and ordering MPs to vote in such a way that would protect a colleague who had breached lobbying rules.\n\nLast month, he survived a confidence vote among members of his own party, but the final count of his lawmakers who rebelled against him was higher than his supporters expected: 41% of his own parliamentary party refused to back him.\n\nHe suffered a further blow late last month when his party lost two parliamentary by-elections in a single night, raising new questions about his leadership.\n\nHis reputation was also damaged by the resignation of his second ethics adviser in less than two years.", "authors": ["Jack Guy Luke Mcgee Ivana Kottasová", "Jack Guy", "Luke Mcgee", "Ivana Kottasová"], "publish_date": "2022/07/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/10/asia/sri-lanka-protest-president-sunday-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "As Sri Lanka's Rajapaksa agrees to step down, singing on streets ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nSri Lanka woke on Sunday to an uncertain future, with both its President and Prime Minister set to step down after thousands of protesters stormed their homes in fury over the nation’s crippling economic crisis.\n\nPresident Gotabaya Rajapaksa has agreed to resign on July 13, the speaker of the country’s parliament announced late Saturday, following a tumultuous day that saw protesters break into Rajapaksa’s official residence in Colombo and splash around in his swimming pool.\n\nProtesters also targeted Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, setting on fire his private residence on Fifth Lane, an affluent neighborhood in the capital. Wickremesinghe later said he was willing to resign “to make way for an all-party government.”\n\nThe announcements – which protesters celebrated by singing on the streets and setting off fireworks – marked a historic victory for the protesters, who have been demanding Rajapaksa’s resignation for months over his government’s failure to address the country’s economic collapse.\n\nFour other ministers stepped down over the weekend.\n\nMinister of Tourism and Land Harin Fernando, Minister of Labour and Foreign Employment Manusha Nanayakkara and Minister of Transport and Highways and co-spokesperson for the cabinet Bandula Gunawardena all resigned on Saturday, according to the ministers’ offices.\n\nMinister of Investment Promotion Portfolio Dhammika Perera told CNN he resigned on Sunday.\n\nThe economic turmoil has plunged the Indian Ocean island nation of 22 million into a dire humanitarian crisis, leaving millions struggling to buy food, medicine and fuel.\n\nAfter months of largely peaceful protests, anger reached tipping point on Saturday, as more than 100,000 people massed outside Rajapaksa’s residence, calling for his resignation.\n\nVideo broadcast on Sri Lankan television and on social media showed the protesters enter the President’s House – Rajapaksa’s office and residence – after breaking through security cordons.

Meanwhile, parliament will elect a new president within 30 days from one of its members who will hold the office for the remaining two years of the current term.\n\nThe United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee said on Twitter on Sunday that Rajapaksa has “lost the confidence” of his people.\n\n“Now, all parties must work together with the international community for a new government that respects the democratic and economic aspirations and upholds human rights the Sri Lankan people deserve,” the committee said.\n\n“The military and police must exercise restraint and be part of the solution, not part of the problem, in this crisis,” it added.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Video shows Sri Lankan Prime Minister's house in flames 00:49 - Source: CNN\n\nJournalists injured\n\nAt least 55 people were injured in the protests, according to Dr. Pushpa Zoysa with the National Hospital of Sri Lanka, who said the figure included three people with gunshot wounds.

But in October, the military effectively took control, dissolving the power-sharing Sovereign Council and transitional government, and temporarily detaining Hamdok, the prime minister.\n\nThe country’s military chief, Gen. Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan, reinstated Hamdok in November as part of a deal between the military and civilian leadership.\n\nUnder the deal agreed by Hamdok and Al-Burhan, Hamdok would again become leader of the transitional government, which was first established after strongman President Omar al-Bashir was ousted in 2019.\n\nSudanese protesters continue to demand democracy\n\nHamdok’s resignation followed news that three more pro-democracy demonstrators were killed by Sudanese security forces.\n\nTwo of the protesters were shot in the chest while the third died from a “violent injury directly to the head,” the SCDC said.\n\nVarious news agencies and social media videos showed groups of demonstrators running through plumes of white tear gas smoke and dispersing from the sound of purported gunfire.\n\nThe demonstrations followed internet and mobile phone network outages.\n\nSunday’s protests in Omdurman, about 25 kilometers (16 miles) northwest of Khartoum, were the 14th day of mass demonstrations against military rule since the October 25 coup.

Otherwise, an online ballot of party members will close on Friday October 28.\n\nThe winner of the contest will be the fifth Conservative prime minister in just over six years – and the third within this parliamentary term. But who might the next leader be? Here are some of the main runners and riders:\n\nRishi Sunak\n\nThough he has yet to formally declare his candidacy, Sunak has already reached the 100-nomination threshold, Britain’s PA Media news agency reported on Friday.\n\nThe former Chancellor of the Exchequer (finance minister) has proved to be something of a prophet of the government’s demise, as many of the predictions he made during this summer’s leadership about Truss’s economic plan came to pass.\n\nConservative leadership candidate Rishi Sunak Peter Nicholls/Reuters\n\nSunak warned that Truss’s unfunded tax cuts would lead to a run on sterling, a panic in the bond market and concern from the International Monetary Fund. Perhaps even he would have been surprised by the pace with which he was proved right.\n\nSunak has experience of economic crisis-fighting, having guided the UK through the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nHe also secured the most votes from MPs in the last leadership election – comfortably clearing the new threshold with 137 endorsements. Although Truss eventually won the decisive members’ vote, Sunak only lost narrowly – with 43% of the vote.\n\nThe trust he has among MPs – and the vindication his predictions have gained – may make him the most likely next set of hands to steer the ship.\n\nPenny Mordaunt\n\nThe Leader of the House of Commons may have had a dress rehearsal for being prime minister this week, after stepping in for an absent Liz Truss at a debate.\n\n“The prime minister is not under a desk,” Mordaunt confirmed Tuesday – in a performance that seemed as much about pitching herself as it did about helping the PM.\n\nMordaunt confirmed in a tweet Friday afternoon that she was running to replace Truss – the first MP to do so.\n\nShe promised a “fresh start” for the country, aiming “to unite our country, deliver our pledges and win the next general election.”\n\nPenny Mordaunt HENRY NICHOLLS/REUTERS\n\nMordaunt came third in the last leadership election, narrowly missing out on being put before the members. With 105 votes from MPs in the last election, she too is expected to clear the newt threshold. She is expected to perform well among the party membership, in part due to her military credentials. Mordaunt is a reservist of the Royal Navy and served a short spell as Secretary of State for Defense.\n\nLike Sunak, she is from the more moderate wing of the party. There was even talk among MPs of the two forming a “dream team” ticket, although this is yet to materialize – and it is unclear if either would accept being chancellor over taking the top job.\n\nKemi Badenoch\n\nBadenoch came fourth in this summer’s leadership election – securing only 59 votes from MPs – but was consistently rated by pollsters as a favorite among Conservative grassroots members.\n\nOne of the younger MPs in the running, Badenoch quickly won the endorsement of long-serving Tory grandee Michael Gove, who praised her as the “outstanding talent” in the party.\n\nBadenoch is from the right of the Tory party – and in her previous leadership bid suggested that the government’s climate targets might prove too costly.\n\nWith Truss’s votes from MPs now up for grabs, Badenoch may have an outside chance of clearing the threshold and making it to the members’ vote.\n\nBoris Johnson\n\nBoris Johnson is flying back to the UK from his Caribbean holiday and plans to join the race to replace Truss, Britain’s PA Media news agency reported Friday.\n\nUK Trade Minister Sir James Duddridge, a close Johnson ally, told PA Media that he had been in contact with Johnson via Whatsapp, saying that Johnson had sent him: “‘I’m flying back, Dudders. We are going to do this. I’m up for it’.”\n\nThe minister also said via Twitter “I hope you enjoyed your holiday boss. Time to come back. Few issues at the office that need addressing. #bringbackboris.”\n\nSky News said one of its reporters, who boarded the flight Johnson took, snapped a picture of the former prime minister and his wife Carrie Johnson on board, adding that the couple received several boos from fellow passengers.\n\nMultiple allies have made the case that Johnson could be a unity candidate who could bring stability to the country, despite the fact he resigned in disgrace only a few months ago after a series of scandals came together, making his position untenable.\n\nWhen asked by CNN how they could justify Johnson standing to be PM again, one MP who campaigned for Johnson in the 2019 leadership campaign, said: “Socialists will destroy our economy and if you don’t understand that then I genuinely fear for our future.”\n\nAnother MP who supported Johnson in 2019 said he was the only candidate who could comfortably win over both Conservative MPs and members of the Conservative Party.\n\nJohnson’s closest allies said they were aware he was being actively lobbied in the hours after Truss’ resignation speech, making the case to him that he represented the party’s best shot at stability in the medium term.\n\nIn his final speech as prime minister outside 10 Downing Street, Johnson made one of his characteristic allusions to ancient history. He said he would “return to his plough” like the Roman statesman Cincinnatus – suggesting a quieter life on the backbenches. But that’s not how Cincinnatus saw out his days. He was called back from his plough to return to Rome for a second term – this time as a dictator.\n\nSome suspect that the new 100-vote threshold is an attempt by the Conservative Party to render another Johnson term impossible. But Johnson’s campaign has already started to gather momentum. A number of prominent Conservative MPs announced Friday that they will back him – even though Johnson has yet to confirm he will stand.\n\nAs Conservative MPs are currently facing electoral oblivion, their desire for self-preservation should not be underestimated. Less than three years ago Johnson delivered an 80-seat majority, and the right of the Tory party may think he is the only candidate capable of saving their jobs.\n\nIf Johnson was to secure the required 100 votes from MPs, he would be expected to perform extremely well in a vote by the party membership.\n\nGrant Shapps\n\nIt is a sign of the disorder of the last days of Truss’s government that she elevated Grant Shapps to home secretary – despite not offering him a ministerial role of any sort when she first took office.\n\nGrant Shapps Phil Noble/Reuters\n\nShapps served as transport secretary under Boris Johnson. He put himself forward to succeed him in the previous leadership election – only to withdraw from the race three days later, after failing to secure the requisite 20 MPs’ votes to proceed to the next round.\n\nThe new threshold will likely prove too high for Shapps – but his criticism of Truss’ government from the outset may have won him the support of more MPs than last time.\n\nOther names in the hat\n\nSuella Braverman’s resignation as home secretary on Wednesday night may have been a precursor to a possible leadership bid. The former attorney-general has not run before – but with her hard-line stance on immigration, might look set to drag the party further to the right.\n\nTom Tugendhat emerged as a surprise favorite among Tory members and the wider public, despite only coming fifth in the last leadership election. Having not served as a cabinet member before that contest, Tugendhat distanced himself from the moral mess of Johnson’s government and promised a “clean start” for Britain. After serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, Tugendhat was made security minister by Truss.\n\nBen Wallace, defense secretary and another ex-military man, was tipped to succeed Johnson in the last leadership contest – polling extremely well among Conservative members. However, he never ran in that election, and he has now ruled himself out of this race.\n\nFormer prime minister Theresa May has also been floated as a possible “unity” candidate to succeed Truss. May tried to bring together the warring wings of the Conservative party over Brexit, in move that ultimately saw her replaced by Boris Johnson.

Here are the lowlights – and lowerlights – of Truss’ term as Britain’s shortest-serving prime minister.\n\nSeptember 5: Truss takes over\n\nLiz Truss delivers a speech outside 10 Downing Street on her first day in office Henry Nicholls/Reuters\n\nTruss is declared the winner of the Conservative Party leadership contest on September 5 after her predecessor, Boris Johnson, is forced to step down following a series of ethics scandals.\n\nThe omens aren’t good. The country is facing a bruised economy, a spiraling cost of living crisis and a crumbling healthcare service. Truss, who served as foreign secretary in Johnson’s government, also faces huge diplomatic challenges in the face of Russia’s war on Ukraine.\n\nIn her first speech as prime minister, in Downing Street on September 6, she tells the country that “together we can ride out the storm.”\n\nShe says her priorities included tackling soaring energy prices, improving the UK’s energy security and fixing the National Health Service.\n\nSeptember 8: Queen Elizabeth II dies\n\nJust two days into Truss’ premiership Queen Elizabeth II dies at the age of 96, sending the country into a period of national mourning.\n\nTruss pays tribute to the Queen as a symbol of stability who ruled through crises, tragedies, political scandals, pandemic and recessions.\n\n“Queen Elizabeth II was the rock on which modern Britain was built,” the new prime minister says. “Our country has grown and flourished under her reign.”\n\nLiz Truss speaks at the state funeral of Queen Elizabeth II at Westminster Abbey in London.

Her finance minister and closest friend in politics, Kwasi Kwarteng, unveils a sweeping plan to extricate the country from recession, which includes a swath of tax cuts that will be funded by higher government borrowing.\n\nThe plan’s a huge gamble – the biggest tax cuts in 50 years, without a clear plan on how to pay for them.

But Kwarteng says there was no time for such an audit – a move that stuns financial markets and sends the pound plunging.\n\nChancellor Kwasi Kwarteng unveils a \"growth plan\" in the House of Commons on September 23. Jessica Taylor/UK Parliament/Reuters\n\nThe prime minister later defends her government’s controversial tax cuts in an exclusive interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper.\n\nShe says that by cutting taxes, her government is “incentivizing businesses to invest and we’re also helping ordinary people with their taxes.”\n\nBond prices subsequently collapse, sending borrowing costs soaring, sparking mayhem in the mortgage market and pushing pension funds to the brink of insolvency.\n\nOctober 14: Truss fires Kwarteng\n\nThe economic turmoil and the prospect of higher mortgage rates force Truss to walk back key components of her financial plan.\n\nAfter ditching her plan to slash the highest rate of income tax, she fires Kwarteng in October in a desperate attempt to salvage her position.\n\n“It was right, in the face of the issues we had, that I acted decisively to ensure that we had economic stability,” Truss says.\n\nIn a letter posted on Twitter, Kwarteng says he agreed to step down at Truss’ behest.\n\nTruss appoints former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt as Kwarteng’s replacement, making him Britain’s fourth finance minister in just over three months.\n\nOctober 17: Hunt ditches Truss’ fiscal plan\n\nJust three days into the job, Hunt says he will scrap “almost all” tax measures announced by his predecessor, in an effort to calm spooked markets and restore the government’s credibility.\n\nA proposed cut to the basic rate of income tax from April 2023 is postponed “indefinitely.” And while the government says it will still guarantee energy prices for households and businesses through this winter, it won’t commit to capping prices beyond next spring.\n\nThe moves amount to a gutting of Truss’ flagship “growth plan” and leave her in a perilous political position.\n\nWhile investors show support for Hunt’s new plan, the opposition Labour Party is not appeased.\n\n“All the Chancellor’s statement underlines is that the damage has been done,” lawmaker Rachel Reeves tweets.\n\nOctober 19: Key ally quits Cabinet\n\nHome Secretary Suella Braverman announces her departure from Truss’ Cabinet, as claims emerge of chaos and “bullying” during a parliamentary vote the same day.\n\nBraverman says she stepped down as Home Secretary over the use of a personal email address that violated ministerial rules, but also launches a thinly veiled criticism of Truss’ leadership in her resignation letter.\n\nHome Secretary Suella Braverman was forced to resign from Truss' Cabinet.

But the official said none of the first shipment would land on store shelves in the US, adding that Sunday’s shipment is hypoallergenic and will be fed to babies intolerant of protein in cow milk.\n\nThe shipment included 132 pallets of formula, which arrived on one C-17 cargo plane. The formula originated from Zurich, Switzerland, and was trucked to Germany, where it was loaded on the C-17 and flown to the US.\n\nAgriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, who greeted the arrival of the delivery in Indianapolis, said Sunday’s shipment – the first of Operation Fly Formula – would provide enough formula for 9,000 babies and 18,000 toddlers for one week.\n\n“It is a large shipment of very specific and specialized formula. Formula for moms and dads who have children who have allergies where the regular formula just simply will not work,” the secretary said at a news conference in Indianapolis shortly after the shipment landed.\n\nThe Biden administration official told CNN earlier that the product contained in the first shipment will be distributed to hospitals, doctors, home health care facilities and pharmacies in regions “where the needs are most acute.”\n\nThe aircraft on Sunday transported pallets of Nestlé Health Science formula – including Alfamino Infant and Alfamino Junior. At the site of the arrival in Indianapolis, a Nestlé spokesperson said, “Some cases are ready for distribution in the next couple of days. Others will be released into the supply chain after standard quality testing is completed.”\n\nThe White House announced later Sunday that the second flight of Operation Fly Formula, which includes “114 pallets of Gerber Good Start® Extensive HA infant formula,” was expected to “take place in the coming days.”\n\nThe White House said the “total amount of formula arriving in the first round of Operation Fly Formula” is the equivalent of 1.5 million doses of eight-ounce bottles.\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Wednesday announced Operation Fly Formula, which directs the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Agriculture to utilize the Defense Department’s commercial planes to import formula from abroad.\n\nSeparately, the Biden administration on Sunday evening announced the first two Defense Production Act authorizations for infant formula amid the ongoing nationwide formula shortage. The two “priority orders,” the administration said, are Reckitt and Abbott Nutrition, the baby formula manufacturer at the heart of a nationwide formula recall. The authorizations would allow those companies to urgently receive materials such as sugar, corn syrup, filters, which help make formula.\n\nFrustration for American families\n\nThe shipment comes as the shortage of baby formula has caused major disruptions and frustration for some desperate American families. Already, some families have begun rationing their supply of formula, while others have turned to hospitals when they can’t find the kind they need.\n\nAnd in a clear sign of the deep effects of the crisis, a doctor at Le Bonheur Children’s Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, said last week that he admitted two young patients – a toddler and a preschooler – because the specialty formula they need is out of stock and they haven’t been able to tolerate any replacements.\n\nClinical dietitians at Medical University of South Carolina Shawn Jenkins Children’s Hospital in Charleston have reported that at least four babies were recently hospitalized for complications related to the ongoing formula shortage, according to a spokesperson for MUSC.\n\nThe spokesperson said three of the four babies were hospitalized due to intolerance of formula that parents had to try because of shortages, while one was sickened by mineral imbalances from caregivers mixing their own formula.\n\nOn Sunday, New York City Mayor Eric Adams declared a state of emergency over the nationwide shortage of the supply of infant formula.\n\nA statement from his office said the move would “empower the New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) to prevent price gouging for formula.”\n\nRetailers nationwide have been struggling to keep shelves fully stocked as supply chain problems persist, slowing down both production and distribution of goods.\n\nAccording to market research firm IRI, stores’ infant formula inventories in mid-January were down 17% from where they were in mid-February 2020, just before the pandemic hit US shores.\n\nThe shutting down of the country’s largest formula plant in February exacerbated pandemic-related supply chain issues and supercharged the nationwide shortage.\n\nThe out-of-stock rate for baby formula hovered between 2% and 8% in the first half of 2021, but began rising sharply last July. Between November 2021 and early April 2022, the out-of-stock rate jumped to 31%, data from Datasembly showed. That rate increased another 9 percentage points in just three weeks in April, and now stands at 40%, the statistics show.\n\nThe baby formula shortage has thrown the White House into crisis mode and opened yet another political wound going into an already challenging midterm election season, frustrating the West Wing and the rest of the administration as they struggle with how little control they have over a situation that is centered at the US Food and Drug Administration, an independent agency that the White House neither controls nor gets direct reports from.\n\nOfficials have faced criticism that the FDA moved too slowly to address warning signs. At the same time, they have been attempting to learn whether formula companies are actually short on ingredients, while also trying to tackle potential price gouging.\n\nVilsack said in Indianapolis on Sunday that the federal government is working with suppliers of baby formula in the US to increase production and address the nationwide shortage.\n\nHe had said the government is working to help get the Abbott facility in Michigan up and running, through the aid of the Defense Production Act.\n\nThe agriculture secretary also said an agreement with the FDA would allow the Abbott facility and others to “jump ahead of line for the necessary supplies that are necessary and required in order to produce the formula.”\n\nMore flights expected\n\nEarlier Sunday, President Joe Biden touted the first flight from his administration’s baby formula airlift operation on Twitter.\n\n“Folks, I’m excited to tell you that the first flight from Operation Fly Formula is loaded up with more than 70,000 pounds of infant formula and about to land in Indiana. Our team is working around the clock to get safe formula to everyone who needs it,” Biden said on Twitter.\n\nNational Economic Council director Brian Deese told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” on Sunday that as part of the airlift operation, more flights with baby formula “will be coming in early this week.”\n\n“We’re going to keep ramping that up until we get there,” Deese said.\n\nPressed by Bash on how the US ended up in a position in which baby formula has to be airlifted into the country, Deese in part blamed market consolidation.\n\n“It goes back to this question of how we can bring more competition in our economy, have more providers have this formula so that no individual company has this much control over supply chains,” he said.\n\nThe Biden administration official told CNN earlier that the product was coming from a factory that has already gone through US FDA approval – meaning US inspectors would only need to conduct “spot checks” Sunday after the product lands. Those checks include ensuring that the product was not damaged in transit and has appropriate labeling. An FDA inspector was onsite to conduct the spot check. Separately, Nestlé is also going to conduct its own quality check at its local distribution site.\n\n“This shipment is essentially going to get off this cargo plane, then the Federal Express folks are going to take it from there, they are going to deliver it to a distribution center that the Nestlé Gerber folks have here in Indiana, and then it’s going to go on trucks and it’s going to be delivered in hospitals and home health care clinics across the country, providing support and help,” Vilsack said Sunday.\n\nAdditionally, the Biden administration is engaged in conversations with makers of other European baby formula to approve and obtain excess supplies for US distribution, the administration official told CNN.\n\nIndianapolis was chosen as the arrival site for the formula because the Nestlé distribution site is located there. The official added that the administration is plugging into the existing distribution chain.\n\n“We’re turning a two-week process into 72 hours,” the official said.\n\nThis story and headline have been updated for additional developments.\n\nCLARIFICATION: A previous version of this story mischaracterized the timeline of the first round of Operation Fly Formula’s arrival in the United States.", "authors": ["Polo Sandoval Samantha Beech", "Polo Sandoval", "Samantha Beech"], "publish_date": "2022/05/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/07/politics/senate-democrats-climate-health-care-bill-vote/index.html", "title": "Senate passes Democrats' sweeping health care and climate bill ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe Senate on Sunday afternoon passed Democrats’ $750 billion health care, tax and climate bill, in a significant victory for President Joe Biden and his party.\n\nThe final, party-line vote was 51-50, with Vice President Kamala Harris breaking the tie. The package is the product of painstaking negotiations, and its final passage would give Democrats a chance to achieve major policy objectives ahead of the upcoming midterm elections.\n\nThe Democrat-controlled House, which is expected to take up the legislation on Friday, August 12, must approve the bill before Biden can sign it into law.\n\nThe sweeping bill – named the Inflation Reduction Act – would represent the largest climate investment in US history and make major changes to health policy by giving Medicare the power for the first time to negotiate the prices of certain prescription drugs and extending expiring health care subsidies for three years. The legislation would reduce the deficit, be paid for through new taxes – including a 15% minimum tax on large corporations and a 1% tax on stock buybacks – and boost the Internal Revenue Service’s ability to collect.\n\nIt would raise over $700 billion in government revenue over 10 years and spend over $430 billion to reduce carbon emissions and extend subsidies for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act and use the rest of the new revenue to reduce the deficit.\n\nSenate Democrats, with a narrow 50-seat majority, stayed unified to pass the legislation, using a special, filibuster-proof process to approve the measure without Republican votes. Final passage came after a marathon series of contentious amendment votes known as a “vote-a-rama” that stretched nearly 16 hours from late Saturday night until Sunday afternoon.\n\nWest Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin told CNN that the legislation he helped write is “a good balanced bill.”\n\n“I think we’ll all benefit from it; the country will,” Manchin told CNN. “We have energy security, that’s what we were looking for. And we have the ability to invest in the energy of the future.”\n\nBiden praised the Senate for passing the bill in a statement Sunday, thanking Democrats in the chamber and touting the legislation’s climate investments and health care provisions.\n\n“Today, Senate Democrats sided with American families over special interests, voting to lower the cost of prescription drugs, health insurance, and everyday energy costs and reduce the deficit, while making the wealthiest corporations finally pay their fair share,” Biden said.\n\nHow Senate Democrats passed the bill on a party-line vote\n\nSenate Democrats have long hoped to pass a signature legislative package that would incorporate major agenda items for the party, but struggled for months to reach a deal that gained full support of their caucus.\n\nManchin played a key role in shaping the legislation – which only moved forward after the West Virginia Democrat and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced a deal at the end of July, a major breakthrough for Democrats after earlier negotiations had stalled out.\n\nArizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema on Thursday night offered critical support after party leaders agreed to change new tax proposals, indicating she would “move forward” on the sweeping economic package.\n\nBut Sinema, Manchin and other senators worked through the weekend making crucial alterations on the bill.\n\nTo avoid a last-minute collapse of the bill on Sunday, Democrats created a plan to win over Sinema, who was concerned over the 15% corporate minimum tax’s impact on subsidiaries owned by private equity. Senate Democrats accepted a narrower tax proposal, but instead of paying for it through a change to the state and local tax (SALT) deduction, as Senate GOP Whip John Thune of South Dakota suggested, they instead extended the limitation on the amount of losses that businesses can deduct for another two years.\n\nThe change was intended to prevent House Democrats primarily from coastal districts, who have campaigned on repealing limits on the SALT deduction, from breaking from the bill, when they vote on it later this week.\n\nAfter the bill’s passage in the Senate, Sinema said in a statement it would “help Arizonans build better lives for themselves and their families by lowering prices, making health care more affordable and accessible, and securing Arizona’s water and energy future,” while also “boosting innovation and spurring job creation.”\n\nIn a good sign for the bill becoming law, key House Democrats signaled later Sunday that they’ll vote for it despite previous demands over SALT.\n\nRep. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey had been part of the “No SALT, no deal” caucus. But he said the bill passes his test because it doesn’t raise individual income tax rates.\n\nRep. Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, another member of that caucus, echoed his sentiment: “I will also remain steadfast in my commitment to ensuring that any discussion of reforms to the 2017 tax law begins with addressing SALT. Because this legislation does not raise taxes on families in my district, but in fact significantly lowers their costs, I will be voting for it.”\n\nRepublicans used the weekend “vote-a-rama” to put Democrats on the spot and force politically tough votes. They were also successful in removing a key insulin provision to cap the price of insulin to $35 per month on the private insurance market, which the Senate parliamentarian ruled was not compliant with the Senate’s reconciliation rules. The $35 insulin cap for Medicare beneficiaries remains in place.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement that the bill included “giant job-killing tax hikes” and amounted to “a war on American fossil fuel.” The Kentucky Republican said Democrats “do not care about middle-class families’ priorities.”\n\n“And their response to the runaway inflation they’ve created is a bill that experts say will not meaningfully cut inflation at all,” said McConnell. “The American people are clear about their priorities. Environmental regulation is a 3% issue. Americans want solutions for inflation, crime, and the border.”\n\nHow the bill addresses the climate crisis\n\nWhile economists disagree over whether the package would, in fact, live up to its name and reduce inflation, particularly in the short term, the bill would have a crucial impact on reducing carbon emissions.\n\nThe nearly $370 billion clean energy and climate package is the largest climate investment in US history, and the biggest victory for the environmental movement since the landmark Clean Air Act. It also comes at a critical time; this summer has seen punishing heat waves and deadly floods across the country, which scientists say are both linked to a warming planet.\n\nAnalysis from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s office – as well as multiple independent analyses – suggests the measure would reduce US carbon emissions by up to 40% by 2030. Strong climate regulations from the Biden administration and action from states would be needed to get to President Joe Biden’s goal of cutting emissions 50% by 2030.\n\nThe bill also contains many tax incentives meant to bring down the cost of electricity with more renewables, and spur more American consumers to switch to electricity to power their homes and vehicles.\n\nLawmakers said the bill represents a monumental victory and is also just the start of what’s needed to combat the climate crisis.\n\n“This isn’t about the laws of politics, this is about the laws of physics,” Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii told CNN. “We all knew coming into this effort that we had to do what the science tells us what we need to do.”\n\nKey health care and tax policy in the bill\n\nThe bill would empower Medicare to negotiate prices of certain costly medications administered in doctors’ offices or purchased at the pharmacy. The Health and Human Services secretary would negotiate the prices of 10 drugs in 2026, and another 15 drugs in 2027 and again in 2028. The number would rise to 20 drugs a year for 2029 and beyond.\n\nThis controversial provision is far more limited than the one House Democratic leaders have backed in the past. But it would open the door to fulfilling a longstanding party goal of allowing Medicare to use its heft to lower drug costs.\n\nDemocrats are also planning to extend the enhanced federal premium subsidies for Obamacare coverage through 2025, a year later than lawmakers recently discussed. That way, they wouldn’t expire just after the 2024 presidential election.\n\nTo boost revenue, the bill would impose a 15% minimum tax on the income large corporations report to shareholders, known as book income, as opposed to the Internal Revenue Service. The measure, which would raise $258 billion over a decade, would apply to companies with profits over $1 billion.\n\nConcerned about how this provision would affect certain businesses, particularly manufacturers, Sinema has suggested that she won changes to the Democrats’ plan to pare back how companies can deduct depreciated assets from their taxes. The details remain unclear.\n\nHowever, Sinema nixed her party’s effort to tighten the carried interest loophole, which allows investment managers to treat much of their compensation as capital gains and pay a 20% long-term capital gains tax rate instead of income tax rates of up to 37%.\n\nThe provision would have lengthened the amount of time investment managers’ profit interest must be held from three years to five years to take advantage of the lower tax rate. Addressing this loophole, which would have raised $14 billion over a decade, had been a longtime goal of congressional Democrats.\n\nIn its place, a 1% excise tax on companies’ stock buybacks was added, raising another $74 billion, according to a Democratic aide.\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Alex Rogers Clare Foran Ali Zaslav Manu Raju", "Alex Rogers", "Clare Foran", "Ali Zaslav", "Manu Raju"], "publish_date": "2022/08/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2022/08/16/fda-allows-retail-sales-hearing-aids-lower-cost-broaden-access/10336389002/", "title": "FDA allows over-the-counter sales of hearing aids without doctor ...", "text": "Millions of Americans could have access this fall to less expensive hearing aids sold over the counter without a required doctor's exam and prescription.\n\nA Food and Drug Administration rule unveiled Tuesday allows retail sales of hearing aids by mid-October for people with mild to moderate hearing loss. Regulators said the new rule should give millions of adults less expensive options and broaden access for those who can't afford hearing aids.\n\n\"Today, the FDA opens the door to quality, affordable hearing aids to consumers over the counter,\" Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said on a call with reporters Tuesday. \"For many Americans who suffer from hearing loss, safe and effective and high-quality hearing aids have been unaffordable.\"\n\nNearly 30 million adults have trouble hearing, but only about 1 in 5 people with hearing loss use a hearing aid. Aging, exposure to loud noises, medical conditions and other factors contribute to hearing loss. Hearing aids can help make speech and sounds louder and allow people to better communicate.\n\nThe agency estimates the new class of devices would save consumers about $2,800 for a pair of hearing aids, officials said. Some hearing aids cost more than $5,000 between the price of the device and a professional fitting. Medicare covers a diagnostic test but does not pay for the device.\n\nThe rule does not extend to children or adults with more severe types of hearing loss. People should seek medical care if they have more complex hearing loss or symptoms such as discomfort or bleeding, officials said.\n\n“Hearing loss is a critical public health issue that affects the ability of millions of Americans to effectively communicate in their daily social interactions,” said FDA Commissioner Robert M. Califf. “Establishing this new regulatory category will allow people with perceived mild to moderate hearing loss to have convenient access to an array of safe, effective and affordable hearing aids from their neighborhood store or online.”\n\nThe agency made changes to a proposed rule last October based on public comments from consumers, stakeholders and experts. The final rule requires retail hearing aids to lower maximum sound and to include user-adjustable volume control. The final rule also limits how deep the devices can be placed in the ear canal. Manufacturers must meet performance and device design requirements in order to sell the devices directly to consumers.\n\nCaliff said the agency evaluated safety concerns about sound output limits for the new class of hearing aids. Devices with high sound output levels could potentially jeopardize long-term hearing while devices without enough sound could be ineffective.\n\n\"We thought we hit the sweet spot on the output limit,\" Califf said.\n\nThe rule comes five years after Congress passed the Over-the-Counter Hearing Aid Act, directing the FDA to authorize the sale of over-the-counter hearing aids.\n\nNancy LeaMond, AARP executive vice president and chief advocacy and engagement officer, said expanding access to affordable aids could improve overall health and quality of life for those with hearing loss.\n\n“For many Americans, the high cost of prescription hearing aids puts them out of reach, increasing their risk of isolation, depression and other health issues,\" LeaMond said.\n\nWhile the new rule could provide affordable options for millions of people with hearing loss, some urged consumers to be careful.\n\nThe Hearing Industries Association, which represents major hearing aid manufacturers, suppliers and hearing health professionals, said hearing loss is unique for each person. Most people do not know if their condition is mild, moderate, or greater, caused by another medical issue or something as simple as ear wax, the group said.\n\n\"Our suggestion is really to first see a hearing professional and have a hearing test and have some solid information about the degree of hearing loss,\" said Kate Carr, president of the Hearing Industries Association.\n\nA limited number of hearing aids are being sold directly to consumers now. Bose received FDA clearance in 2018 to sell hearing aids directly to consumers. The company discontinued its hearing aids this year and now partners with Lexie Hearing, which sells a device incorporating Bose's technology for $899.\n\nCarr said consumers must understand a hearing aid's return policies and warranties when they purchase a product. Because over-the-counter hearing aids are not sold through a licensed medical professional, any consumer protections must be enforced under state and local laws.\n\nIn January, the National Association of Attorneys General urged the FDA to ensure states' authority to enforce their consumer protection laws for the sale of consumer hearing aids. A bipartisan coalition of 43 attorneys general noted the FDA's preliminary rule included language that \"may unintentionally hinder or repeal\" state consumer protection laws.\n\nBut FDA officials said states will have full authority to enforce consumer protection laws as long as such laws don't restrict or interfere with consumers' access to the new class of devices.\n\nStates can \"enforce consumer protections for over-the-counter hearing aids,\" including laws that ensure reasonable warranty and return policies, said Jeff Shuren, director of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health.\n\nKen Alltucker is on Twitter as @kalltucker or can be emailed at alltuck@usatoday.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/17/health/otc-hearing-aids-what-to-know/index.html", "title": "Hearing aids: What to know about buying them over the counter | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe high cost of hearing aids has long been a barrier for many people who have hearing problems. Traditional prescription hearing aids cost on average $2,000 per ear, and many people need two of them.\n\nBut the US Food and Drug Administration’s rule change in August means that people with mild to moderate hearing loss will be able to buy these devices online or in stores without a prescription – and for a lower price – starting Monday.\n\nThat means people won’t have to visit a hearing health professional and have a custom fitting, a process that can also be cost-prohibitive.\n\nTens of millions of people have hearing loss, but only about 16% of them use a hearing aid, according to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders.\n\nAs FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said in the agency’s announcement August 16, “Today’s action will not only help adults who have perceived mild to moderate hearing loss gain access to more affordable an innovative production options, but we expect that it will unleash the power of American industry to improve the technology in a way that it will impact the enormous burden of disability from hearing loss affecting the world.”\n\nHere, Dr. Frank Lin, director of the Cochlear Center for Hearing and Public Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, and Dr. Lindsay Creed of the American Speech Hearing Association, offer their advice on what to keep in mind when buying hearing aids over the counter.\n\nTip 1: Get tested\n\nBoth Lin and Creed strongly recommend getting a hearing test before heading to the store. Hearing tests measure a person’s level of sensitivity to sound. Creed said that a hearing test might also determine whether your hearing loss is caused by a condition that may not require a hearing aid, such as wax buildup.\n\n“It would be helpful to know exactly what your hearing levels are, because the research really suggests that individuals aren’t great at accurately determining their hearing loss levels. Younger individuals tend to overestimate their degree of hearing loss, while older individuals tend to underestimate their hearing loss,” Creed said. Getting tested will give you the most accurate results when you shop.\n\nKnowing your hearing number is as important as any other health data, Lin said, such as blood pressure, blood sugar levels or cholesterol.\n\nThere are several options for free or low-cost hearing tests, including hearing centers in stores like Costco or Sam’s Club, and even audiologist-recommended online tests. Stores like Best Buy will offer online hearing screenings.\n\nMany hearing aid manufactures offer their own tests to help customers with ease of use and accuracy.\n\nCreed recommends looking for tests that are backed by research and data.\n\n“I always feel like knowledge is power. If you want to start out with the most information and then make the best-informed decision as far as the technology that’s most appropriate for you, still starting with those professionals is a good idea,” she said.\n\nGetting tested will help you choose the product that best fits your needs.\n\nTip 2: Know what you’re buying\n\nYou’ll be able to find hearing aids on the shelves of pharmacies and big box stores, online and even in tech stores. Walgreens, CVS, Walmart, Best Buy and Hy-Vee are some of the places where customers can expect to find these devices.\n\nBut there are a few things to keep in mind when shopping.\n\nCreed says a return policy is crucial and advises customers to make sure whatever product they purchase has one. The new FDA regulation says the return policy on over-the-counter hearing aids must be plainly stated on the packaging, but extended return policies are up to the stores.\n\nBest Buy plans to offer an extended return policy of 60 days, for example, while Walgreens gives people 45 days to try out the products.\n\nAdditionally, the FDA recommends checking a product’s warranty and whether it covers maintenance and repairs, as well as whether you can get a loaner pair to use during repairs.\n\nWhen shopping for hearing aids, Creed recommends looking for the words “OTC Hearing Aid” on the package. This is part of the FDA regulation to make sure people are getting an actual hearing aid, rather than another type of device such as a hearing amplifier, made for recreational use. Hearing amplifiers magnify all sound, but hearing aids are customized to suit a person’s hearing needs.\n\nHearing aids sold over the counter will be regulated on October 17, but hearing amplifiers are unregulated. The FDA considers hearing aids to be medical devices but hearing amplifiers to be consumer electronics. If the product doesn’t say “OTC or over-the-counter hearing aid” on the primary display, it is not an FDA-regulated hearing aid.\n\n“I think, fortunately, the way the FDA crafted the language, the regulation is really well thought-out,” Lin said. “To basically give consumers information they’ll need to make an informed decision while at the same time creating the performance characteristics to guarantee that a device on the market will actually be reasonably safe and effective.”\n\nCreed urges anyone with questions contact an audiologist for guidance.\n\nTip 3: Know the difference between over-the-counter and prescription\n\nOver-the-counter hearing aids will be a great option for thousands of people in the mild-to-moderate stage of their hearing journey, but for some with more severe hearing loss, prescription hearing aids are still the only option. People under the age of 18 will also need a prescription.\n\n“We do anticipate for there to be some differences in the devices because it would not be cost-effective for manufacturers to sell their high-level technology at these prices,” Creed said. “So they’re probably going to be comparable to entry-level hearing aids in the prescription market.”\n\nOver-the-counter hearing aids might not have the same maximum volume as a prescription model and might not have the same degrees of customization or personalization. OTC devices will probably also be softer in volume and have output levels established by the FDA.\n\n“Because of how the FDA came out with very well thought-out regulations, they are really the range where it benefits … 90-plus percent of people out there with hearing loss,” Lin said.\n\nFor those with severe hearing loss, Lin and Creed recommend seeing an audiologist, even if it’s only to get a personalized recommendation on which over-the-counter hearing aid to choose. But some will require a more customizable prescription option.\n\nThe future of OTC hearing aids\n\n“It’s going to be the wild, wild West for another one or two years, and that’s a good thing because I think a lot will be trying different types of technologies and for retail malls to see what sticks, what meets consumers where they are, which has never happened before,” Lin said.\n\nHe believes the FDA’s move to approve hearing aids will lead to increased innovation as big tech companies enter the market.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nLin says audiologists will also start to shift their models, perhaps taking a more hands-on route in guiding patients toward the right over-the-counter hearing aids and aiding them in customization.\n\nCreed notes that although over-the-counter hearing aids are much less expensive and more accessible than prescription versions, they’re still not cheap.\n\n“There’s a lot of research going on using community health workers and seeing if they can fit more amplifier-type devices using community health workers,” Creed said, “And so I think that there’s still a lot of work to be done in this space.”", "authors": ["Raenu Charles"], "publish_date": "2022/10/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/reviewed/2022/08/18/fda-over-counter-hearing-aids-what-laws-mean-where-buy/10356745002/", "title": "FDA over-the-counter hearing aids: What new laws mean and where ...", "text": "David Ellerby, Sarah Kovac and Christopher Groux\n\n— Recommendations are independently chosen by Reviewed’s editors. Purchases you make through our links may earn us a commission.\n\nA new regulation passed by the FDA means over-the-counter hearing aids are now more accessible for millions of Americans. As of October 17, instead of being forced to visit an audiologist and shelling out thousands of dollars for the added expense, consumers can buy hearing aids that are FDA-certified from any major retailer like Amazon, Walmart or Best Buy without needing a prescription.\n\nGet deals and shopping advice delivered straight to your phone.

Instead of having to pay for a specialist and get a prescription, anyone can purchase tested hearing aids from any retailer at which they are sold.\n\n\"When my husband got his first set of hearing aids in his late 20s, we (laughably) thought they would be the silver bullet that solved our communication problems,\" says Sarah Kovac, Accessibility Editor at Reviewed. \"They made a huge difference, but it never ceased to surprise me how many issues we’ve had with them despite their thousands-strong price tag. Parts need to be replaced, audio settings need to be recalibrated by the audiologist and there are periods of nearly constant squealing from feedback. These shortcomings persist despite being told he had the best hearing aids on the market.\"\n\nIn 2017, a law was passed requiring the FDA to come up with guidelines for supplying hearing aids directly to the consumer without needing a prescription or medical fitting. The law would only apply to air conduction (as opposed to bone conduction) hearing aids, the most common type of hearing aid. That guidance was officially released in 2018.\n\nThe most recent change is that the FDA has formalized these guidelines by establishing some basic rules. Over-the-counter aids are still restricted to air conduction hearing aids (both behind- and in-ear). The central additional requirements are that the volume level must be able to be adjusted by the user, and the amplification level be limited to prevent accidental ear damage.\n\nUnder these new rules it is technically possible for manufacturers of any kind to make and sell an FDA-licensed hearing aid provided the product passes a rigorous testing procedure. That testing, however, still figures greatly into how expensive that new pair of hearing aids will be.\n\n► Related: FDA allows over-the-counter sales of hearing aids without doctor exam or referral\n\n► More: Are OTC hearing aids available yet? What to know about when (and where) you can get them.\n\nWill this make hearing aids cost less?\n\nNot necessarily. On average, a pair of prescription hearing aids costs over $4,000. For good quality hearing aids, a large part of this cost comes from the components and required research and development. Another large slice is associated with obtaining the hearing aids from, and having them fitted by, an audiologist.\n\nYou also can’t rely on your health insurance to pick up the costs either. There is no hearing aid coverage through Medicare parts A or B. Private health insurance may also require additional costs to buy hearing aids or set limits on coverage. Check your state regulations, though, as some require coverage but have spending limits and may be restricted to specific age groups.\n\nEven though these new guidelines establish a process by which over-the-counter hearing aids can be sold, the need for an audiologist and prescription is the only part of the process being removed. Testing for these products must still happen to an intense degree for full FDA approval, and those tests don’t come cheap. So, while hearing aid costs may decrease somewhat with these new laws in place, users shouldn’t expect a night-and-day difference now that the changes have gone into effect.\n\nWhat to know before buying over-the-counter hearing aids\n\nEven as we wait for the FDA’s new hearing aid regulations to affect the market as a whole, some hearing aids are already available for purchase over the counter. This only applies to air conduction hearing aids, and only to users over 18 years of age.\n\nSome popular FDA-certified brands include:\n\nThrough the purchase process you may also see a wide range of phrases relating to the FDA, like “FDA-registered” or “FDA-approved.” These words don’t really mean anything as far as certified scientific testing is concerned. FDA registration just means the FDA is aware the manufacturer exists. The FDA also doesn’t issue direct approvals of products; they set rules for quality control and performance and check these are met.\n\nIf a hearing aid manufacturer jumped through all the hoops needed to get an FDA medical device classification, that means certain standards are expected. These include accurate labeling, quality control, checks that the device functions as promised and basic safety tests.\n\nThe only way to be certain a device has been through the FDA clearance process is to check whether the device or manufacturer shows up in official FDA databases.\n\nFor that step, we suggest consulting the FDA’s own Establishment Registration & Device Listing page. Type the brand name into the “Establishment or Trade Name” field, and see if the listing for the product exists. If it doesn’t, you’re not dealing with a brand that’s been given proper FDA clearance.\n\nWhile it’s possible you may see hearing aids cost as little as $100 at some retailers, these haven’t passed through any serious medical muster. As great as the price may look, it’s probably too good to be true. It's likely these are simple amplifiers and lack the capabilities of real hearing aids. But if you follow these simple checks, you’ll find the safest hearing aids available in this brave new world of over-the-counter options.\n\nWhere to buy over-the-counter hearing aids today\n\nWith the new FDA over-the-counter hearing aid regulations officially in effect, there are a few major retailers beginning to sell hearing aids and amplifiers. We recommend searching within the above-linked FDA databases to ensure you’re getting the best quality products, but here are some options.\n\nThere’s a lot more where this came from.

It can also interact with common medications and trigger allergies.\n\nWhile short term use for jet lag, shift workers and people who have trouble falling asleep appears to be safe, long-term safety is unknown, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health at the National Institutes of Health.\n\nExperts worry that the pandemic’s negative impact on sleep may have further increased the public’s reliance on any type of prescription and over-the-counter sleeping aid, Robbins said.\n\n“In an associational study we found that older adults who reported frequent use - every night or most nights - of a sleep aid (over the counter or prescription) had a higher risk of incident dementia and early mortality,” she said.\n\nHowever, researchers could not determine which type of sleep aid – over-the-counter medications, such as melatonin, or prescription medications – was responsible for the findings.\n\nLarger dose, little regulation\n\nSince 2006, a small but growing subset of adults are taking amounts of melatonin that far exceed the 5 milligram a day dosage that is typically used as a short term treatment, the study found.\n\nHowever, pills for sale may contain levels of melatonin that are much higher than what is advertised on the label. Unlike drugs and food, melatonin is not fully regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration, so there are no federal requirements that companies test pills to be sure they contain the amount of advertised melatonin.\n\nPeople are using twice as much melatonin as they used to, sometimes at dangerously high levels. Shutterstock\n\n“Previous research has found that that melatonin content in these unregulated, commercially available melatonin supplements ranged from - 83% to +478% of the labeled content,” said Robbins, who coauthored the book “Sleep for Success! Everything You Must Know About Sleep But are Too Tired to Ask.”\n\nNor are there any requirements that companies test their products for harmful hidden additives in melatonin supplements sold in stores and online. Previous studies also found 26% of the melatonin supplements contained serotonin, “a hormone that can have harmful effects even at relatively low levels,” according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, a department of the National Institutes of Health.\n\n“We cannot be certain of the purity of melatonin that is available over the counter,” Robbins said.\n\nTaking too much serotonin by combining medications such as antidepressants, migraine medications and melatonin can lead to a serious drug reaction. Mild symptoms include shivering and diarrhea, while a more severe reaction can lead to muscle rigidity, fever, seizures and even death if not treated.\n\nIt’s a hormone, not an herb\n\nBecause it is purchased over the counter, experts say many people view melatonin as an herbal supplement or vitamin. In reality, melatonin is a hormone made by the pineal gland, located deep within the brain, and released into the bloodstream to regulate the body’s sleep cycles.\n\n“There is a view that if it’s natural, then it can’t hurt,” Robbins told CNN in a prior interview on the impact of melatonin on children. “The truth is, we just really don’t know the implications of melatonin in the longer term, for adults or kids.”\n\nAnother reality: Studies have found that while using melatonin can be helpful in inducing sleep if used correctly – taking it at least two hours before bed – but the actual benefit is small.\n\n“When adults took melatonin, it decreased the amount of time it took them to fall asleep by four to eight minutes,” Dr. Cora Collette Breuner, a professor in the department of pediatrics at Seattle Children’s Hospital at the University of Washington, told CNN last March.\n\n“So for someone who takes hours to fall asleep, probably the better thing for them to do is turn off their screens, or get 20 to 40 minutes of exercise each day, or don’t drink any caffeinated products at all,” Breuner said.\n\n“These are all sleep hygiene tools that work, but people are very reticent to do them. They rather just take a pill, right?”\n\nTraining your brain to sleep\n\nThere are other proven sleep tips that work just as well, if not better than sleeping aids, experts say. The body begins secreting melatonin at dark. What do we do in our modern culture? Use artificial light to keep us awake, often long past the body’s normal bedtime.\n\nResearch has found that the body will slow or stop melatonin production if exposed to light, including the blue light from our smartphones, laptops and the like.\n\n“Any LED spectrum light source may further suppress melatonin levels,” said Dr. Vsevolod Polotsky, who directs sleep basic research in the division of pulmonary and critical care medicine at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, in a prior CNN interview.\n\nSo ban those devices at least an hour before you want to fall asleep. Like to read yourself to sleep? That’s fine, experts say, just read in a dim light from a real book or use an e-reader in night mode.\n\n“Digital light will suppress the circadian drive,” Polotsky said, while a “dim reading light will not.”\n\nOther tips include keeping your bedroom temperature at cooler temperatures of about 60 to 67 degrees Fahrenheit (15 to 20 degrees Celsius). We sleep better if we’re a bit chilly, experts say.\n\nSet up a bedtime ritual by taking a warm bath or shower, reading a book or listening to soothing music. Or you can try deep breathing, yoga, meditation or light stretches. Go to bed and get up at the same time each day, even on weekends or your days off, experts say. The body likes routine.\n\nIf your doctor does prescribe melatonin to help with jet lag or other minor sleep issues, keep the use “short-term,” Robbins said.\n\nIf you are planning to use melatonin for a short-term sleep aid, try to purchase pharmaceutical grade melatonin, she advised.

Jackson Women’s Health Organization and overturned Roe v. Wade, reproductive health care has needed to operate in a new landscape.\n\nDoctors and prescribers are now seeing an increase in demand for different forms of contraception, including emergency contraception and longer-lasting forms of birth control.\n\nSome national pharmacy chains imposed limits on purchases of emergency contraception, even temporarily.\n\nNurx, an online pharmaceutical company that prescribes birth control along with other medications, saw increases in demand for emergency contraception after the leak of the Dobbs opinion in May as well as after the decision came down in June.\n\n“When that decision was leaked, we saw a massive demand for emergency contraception. We saw a 300% increase in prescriptions being asked for and by our patients,” said Kelly Gardiner, vice president of communications with Thirty Madison, Nurx’s parent company.\n\nThe company then saw a “huge surge” in demand after the decision was final.\n\n“We saw a 10 [times] surge for prescription-only Ella, and even though demand has leveled out right now, what we’re starting to see is birth control requests are [three to four] times higher than usual,” Gardiner said.\n\nElla is an emergency contraceptive pill that can be taken up to five days after sex. Emergency contraceptives work by delaying ovulation or preventing implantation and cannot terminate a pregnancy.\n\nMore people were also buying multiple forms of birth control. According to Gardiner, before the decision was released, about 30% of Nurx customers who had traditional birth control prescriptions would add Ella to their order. After the decision, that number rose to 60%.\n\n“We’re seeing people who used to just kind of use their birth control regularly, really want that added protection,” she said.\n\nFor health care providers, the Supreme Court decision has brought more questions and concerns from patients.\n\n“I am definitely seeing people who are saying, you know, ‘My IUD expires in a year. Should I get a new one? That way if I can’t access it, I’ve got coverage for another five years,’ ” said Dr. Jennifer Lincoln, a board-certified ob-gyn in Portland, Oregon, and a fellow with the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology. “Or ‘I’m not sure if I’m done having kids, but should I get a tubal [ligation] just in case? Because I don’t know what to do.’ ”\n\nA tubal ligation is a permanent surgical sterilization procedure. Although Lincoln said it’s a procedure OB-GYNs are “happy to provide,” it does require some consideration.\n\n“We don’t want people to just feel rushed into it and be like 80% sure, and so then they’re going to regret it. So we don’t want to perform surgeries on people who are conflicted. And so that’s another another bump in the road.”\n\nDr. Meera Shah, chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood Hudson Peconic in New York, said she’s seen more interest in vasectomies, as well.\n\n“We’ve had an increase in number of calls to our health center of patients requesting vasectomies because of the decision,” she said.\n\nConfusion after Supreme Court decision\n\nSome of the demand might be driven by concerns that certain types of birth control won’t be available.\n\n“People are confused,” Lincoln said. “They hear that they can no longer have abortions or be able to control their reproductive future, and they’re wondering if things like IUDs [intrauterine devices] are going to be next, if emergency contraception might be next, if their birth control might be next,” she said.\n\n“There’s mass confusion, and I get it, because it’s really hard to know what’s true and what’s not,” Lincoln said.\n\nShah, who practices in New York and Indiana, said much of her post-Roe work around contraception has involved reassuring patients that they can still access health care, “telling the patients that, you know, in New York, abortion access is protected, and so is contraception access,” she said.\n\nShah thinks some of that fear is coming from social media and discussions around the ruling.\n\n“In the final decision, it was mentioned that we should revisit other cases that are rooted in the same theory as Roe v. Wade was, so Griswold being one of them,” she said. Griswold v. Connecticut, a 1965 Supreme Court decision that protected a right to marital privacy and allowed access to contraception, was referenced in US Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas’ concurring opinion on the Dobbs case.\n\n“When is that going to happen? Is that going happen? Is that a real threat?” Shah said.\n\nLincoln, who has a large audience on TikTok, said she has heard from followers about difficulty accessing over-the-counter contraception products.\n\n“I’ve had my followers on social media send me screenshots of the aisles where condoms are sold, and they’re all gone too, because people are like, ‘Oh my goodness, we need everything,’ ” she said.\n\n“I love that people want to be prepared, but the stockpiling mentality doesn’t help anybody, because we do end up with shortages,” Lincoln said.\n\n‘Demoralizing’ to health care practice\n\nWith the decision in place, reproductive health care providers now face an additional challenge.\n\n“It’s demoralizing to go through the amount of years of training that we go through, to know and to see the outcomes that happened with people when they didn’t have a choice, when they had situations that they couldn’t take control of, and to see that patients now who are just being told that they are not able to be in control of their life and their reproductive choices,” Lincoln said.\n\n“We’ve already been down, because of Covid and seeing our patients be left behind, out of the vaccine trials, and now this, it’s just – it’s just hard when you never thought this would have to be an issue. And we’ve got plenty of other stuff to focus on, right?\n\n“We’ve got so many other things that we could be focusing on, and we’re having to relitigate this and see our patients have their autonomy taken away, and it’s just really hard,” Lincoln said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nShah noted the level of fear and uncertainty, particularly with her work in Indiana, that comes with ordering procedures that may not be legal the next day.\n\n“It’s really scary. We have to tell the patients, ‘we’ll put you on a schedule, but we don’t know what tomorrow holds.’ And as a patient, that is absolutely terrifying to hear,” she said.\n\n“As a provider, that’s devastating. Turn somebody away? That’s awful. Say ‘I can’t take care of you because the government says I can’t’? When I know that this is safe and that your bodily autonomy is first and foremost?\n\n“It’s hard.

Mott Children’s Hospital National Poll on Children’s Health at the University of Michigan Health.\n\nThe term CBD stands for cannabidiol, a chemical compound found in marijuana and hemp, the report said. Unlike marijuana, CBD only has 0.3% of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC. The THC is the psychoactive part of marijuana that makes people feel high.\n\nOf the 7% of parents who gave or considered giving a CBD product to their child, only 29% said they talked with their child’s pediatrician about using it.\n\nOf the 1,992 parents polled nationwide, 35% thought CBD and marijuana are more or less the same thing. The parents had children who ranged from newborns to 18 years old.\n\n“I think that people who fall into that camp would be surprised if they strolled down the aisles of their neighborhood drugstore,” said Sarah Clark, co-director of the poll. She is also a research scientist in the department of pediatrics at the University of Michigan’s Institute for Healthcare Policy & Innovation.\n\nMost CBD products are not regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration, which means that people can purchase the items off the shelf.\n\nThe only CBD product that’s FDA-approved for children is Epidiolex, a prescription drug used to treat some forms of epilepsy, according to Dr. Jennifer Griffith, who was not involved in the study. She is an assistant professor of neurology and pediatrics in the division of pediatric neurology at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and St. Louis Children’s Hospital.\n\nVery little has been researched about the effects of CBD on children, but some potential benefits from anecdotal stories say it may help children reduce anxiety, pain and inflammatory diseases, to name a few, Griffith said.\n\nAccording to the poll, 83% of parents thought that the FDA should regulate CBD products, but only 58% said it would be a very important factor in their decision-making process to give their children CBD products.\n\nSome potential negative side effects may include diarrhea; fatigue, nausea or vomiting; and decreased appetite, Griffith explained.\n\nSpeak to your child’s health provider\n\nAdults with CBD products at home should treat them like a medication and keep it out of reach of their children, Clark said.\n\n“CBD can interact with other prescription medications, in some cases significantly increasing or decreasing the level of medication in the body, which can cause its own problems,” Griffith said.\n\nProducts such as CBD gummy bears, for example, are an easy thing for a kid to see as candy, and they may decide to eat the whole pack, Clark said.\n\nIf parents are considering giving their child a CBD product, Clark advised that they speak to their child’s medical provider before do so.\n\nIn addition to learning about possible side effects and potential medication interactions, it also alerts the provider to any health issues the child is facing like anxiety, she said. The provider may be able to offer alternatives, Clark explained.\n\nAbout three-quarters of the parents believed CBD products for children should require a doctor’s prescription.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nIt’s difficult to recommend CBD products for children when there are very few studies showing how they affect young ones, Clark said.\n\n“It’s not enough to just go on what the manufacturers claims are, we actually need to have some data behind that, and right now we just don’t have enough,” she said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nGriffith is also skeptical of allowing children to use CBD products due to the potential negative side effects kids may face.\n\n“I don’t recommend CBD for any condition other than epilepsy because I know that CBD has real risks, and I don’t have any evidence of proven benefit,” she advised.\n\nGriffith also recommended parents and caregivers check the FDA warning list to make sure the CBD product or company isn’t on there.

At that point adults 21 and older can possess up to an ounce of marijuana, with no more than five grams in a concentrated form.\n\nWhen is it legal to grow marijuana?\n\nLike the possession rules, growing is allowed after the Nov. 30 canvass. Adults can grow six plants at home or no more than 12 plants in a house with more than one adult.\n\nWhen can I buy marijuana?\n\nThe proposition requires the Department of Health Services to accept applications for medical dispensaries beginning in January, and to issue those licenses to qualified medical dispensaries within 60 days.\n\nThis means March is the earliest that people without medical-marijuana cards can buy marijuana at recreational retail locations. It's possible the kick off will take longer, but dispensary operators are hoping to be able to offer recreational sales by April 20, 2021, or 420 as the cannabis holiday is called.\n\nThe measure states that if DHS doesn't issue recreational licenses by April 5, medical dispensaries in good standing can begin offering sales to adults until the department issues licenses.\n\nWhen can I get my felony marijuana conviction erased?\n\nThe measure states that starting July 12, people who were arrested, charged with, adjudicated or convicted, or sentenced for possessing two and a half ounces or less of marijuana, not more than 12.5 grams of concentrate, or having six marijuana plants, or marijuana paraphernalia, can petition to have the record expunged.\n\nThe details are thick on how this will proceed, but if the agency that prosecuted the crime can't prove \"by clear and convincing evidence\" that the crime doesn't qualify for expungement, the court has to grant the petition. Clear evidence would mean prosecutors have to prove, for example, the conviction was for possessing more than two and a half ounces or some other violation not covered by the ballot measure.\n\nPhoenix defense attorney Thomas Dean estimates hundreds of thousands of people could petition for their records to be cleared, based on data that shows more than 10,000 people a year are arrested in Arizona for marijuana possession.\n\nMost of those people are directed to costly drug treatment programs, and the record can prevent them from getting hired at a variety of jobs.\n\nHow many dispensaries will there be?\n\nArizona has about 120 operating medical dispensaries today, and they will be the first to be allowed to get licenses for adult sales to anyone over 21. There are about nine or 10 licenses in Arizona that are not yet being used at a dispensary, and eventually those are likely to open and sell medical and recreational marijuana.\n\nThe measure also allows DHS to issue licenses to counties where there are fewer than two dispensaries today. And finally, there are 26 \"social equity\" licenses to be issued (more on this below), which should bring the total number of dispensaries in the state to about 160.\n\nWhat will the tax be and how much will it bring to the state?\n\nThe measure calls for an excise tax of 16% on recreational marijuana, on top of regular sales taxes, which vary by jurisdiction. Budget officials at the state Legislature expect the measure to bring in about $254 million from the combined taxes. Initiative backers have estimated a higher figure of about $300 million annually.\n\nWhere will all that money go and why won't it go to K-12 education?\n\nThe money is distributed several ways, first paying for the additional services needed from DHS to administer the program and to law enforcement. The remaining funds go mostly to community colleges.\n\nInitiative backers said the additional tax revenue could make a difference in the community college system, but would not be sufficient to address needs in K-12 schools, and they didn't want to make what would have amounted to a token contribution to grade schools.\n\nWhat is a 'social equity' license and who will get one?\n\nDHS has the task of defining who can apply for the 26 social equity licenses available through the measure. The proposition only states that the licenses will be issued to \"individuals from communities disproportionately impacted by the enforcement of previous marijuana laws.\"\n\nDHS has six months from the time it issues final rules on the program to issue the social equity licenses.\n\nWhat can the dispensaries sell?\n\nIt depends. Dispensaries can continue to offer much of the same marijuana flower, concentrates, edibles and other product as they do for the medical program, but there are some limits on the adult-use sales that the medical sales don't have.\n\nThe most significant is potency of edibles, which are limited to 10 mg of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) per serving and 100 mg per package. Some products available now for medical patients are far stronger than this, and will remain available for sale to medical patients only.\n\nThe adult-use rules also prohibit any edibles from being shaped like a \"human, animal, insect, fruit, toy or cartoon,\" which is not a restriction on medical edibles today.\n\nOn a similar theme, dispensaries can't sell products with names that resemble or imitate products marketed to children.\n\nVape pens and other forms of concentrated marijuana that are smoked will be available, though.\n\nIs it legal to drive under the influence of marijuana?\n\nProposition 207 says that \"driving, flying or boating while impaired to the slightest degree by marijuana remains illegal.\" But it also says that simply testing positive for marijuana metabolites does not mean a person is impaired.\n\nUnder current Arizona law, drivers can be convicted of driving under the influence if they simply have marijuana metabolites in their system, which can last for weeks, long after the actual \"high\" has passed.\n\nProposition 207 says that \"a person with metabolites or components of marijuana in the person's body is guilty ... only if the person is also impaired to the slightest degree.\"\n\nThe change will mean people who use marijuana can't be charged with driving impaired days later unless law enforcement officers also show the person was impaired, for example, with a roadside test or observations of erratic or inattentive driving.\n\nCan I use marijuana at work?\n\nProbably not. The measure states that it \"does not restrict the rights of employers to maintain a drug-and-alcohol-fee workplace or affect the ability of employers to have workplace policies restricting the use of marijuana by employees or prospective employees.\" So employers can prohibit marijuana use on the job and continue to test potential hires for usage.\n\n\"Under 207, employers can discriminate however they want,\" said Dean, the attorney.\n\nHe said that employers can require workers to take a urinalysis that can detect inactive metabolites that may signal marijuana use a month after the fact.\n\n\"I don't think there's anything you can do to stop that kind of adverse action against employees,\" he said.\n\nThat is one reason some patients may choose to maintain their medical-marijuana cards, despite the fee to the state every two years and the cost of a doctor's recommendation. Medical-marijuana patients do have some workplace protections.\n\n\"They cannot fire someone (with a medical card) for a positive test,\" Dean said. \"They can only take action against them if they are impaired at the workplace or are in possession of medical marijuana in the workplace.\"\n\nIs my medical-marijuana card still valid?\n\nYes. The medical marijuana program is not changing, although patients are likely to find their dispensaries busier in 2021 when recreational sales begin.\n\nMedical card holders are allowed to possess more marijuana, purchase higher potency edibles, and avoid the 16% excise tax. They also have some protection from being fired from a job for failing a drug test, though some safety sensitive jobs can still require workers to be drug free.\n\nHow many people hold medical-marijuana cards in Arizona?\n\nAs of September 2020, about 280,000 Arizonans held cards issued by the Department of Health Services that allow them to posses marijuana and purchase it from state-licensed dispensaries.\n\nHow do people obtain a card?\n\nPatients need to be diagnosed with a debilitating medical condition (see below) and then get a written certification from a medical doctor, osteopath, naturopath or homeopath licensed in Arizona.\n\nMany traditional doctors decline to issue the written certification required by the Department of Health Services. However, a number of clinics in Arizona specialize in issuing marijuana certifications.\n\nThose physicians often are willing to make both the medical diagnosis and the required certification.\n\nWhat are the conditions that qualify for a marijuana certification?\n\nCancer, glaucoma, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), hepatitis C, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Crohn's disease, agitation of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nAlso, any chronic or debilitating disease or medical condition or the treatment for a chronic or debilitating disease or medical condition that causes: cachexia or wasting syndrome, severe and chronic pain, severe nausea, seizures (including those characteristic of epilepsy), severe or persistent muscle spasms (including those characteristic of multiple sclerosis).\n\nAbout 88 percent of Arizona patients qualify for their card because of chronic pain, according to the Department of Health Services.\n\nMORE: Where to celebrate 420 in Phoenix and why that date is Weed Day\n\nWhat does a card cost?\n\nThe total cost to pay a doctor to make the recommendation and pay the state for a card costs from about $200 to $300, based on Phoenix-area advertisements. Originally, the cards had to be renewed annually, but a new state law made the cards valid for two years.\n\nThe state card costs $150 for an initial registration or a renewal. It is discounted to $75 for people who participate in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. This is uniform across the state.\n\nDoctors writing the certification charge varying amounts from about $50 to $150, plus they may charge for an exam to diagnose the medical condition that qualifies a patient to use marijuana.\n\nPatients who bring in documentation for their ailment from another doctor often either receive a discount or are charged less for their certification, based on the advertisements from multiple clinics.\n\nSome clinics offer to match any competitor's price, so shopping around online and being willing to drive across town can save customers.\n\nHow many places can people buy marijuana legally in Arizona?\n\nArizona has issued 130 dispensary licenses, and about 120 are operating in the state.\n\nHow much marijuana can card-holders buy?\n\nQualified patients can purchase no more than 2.5 ounces of marijuana in any 14-day period.\n\nHow much marijuana do dispensaries sell?\n\nIn 2019, they sold about 75 tons of marijuana flower alone, plus another 7 tons in food and other products containing marijuana, according to the Department of Health Services.\n\nHow much does marijuana cost?\n\nThe advertised prices for marijuana at Arizona dispensaries vary widely. It is sold in packages as small as a gram for $8 to an ounce for $300 or more depending on the strain. The various marijuana products are at different price points as well.\n\nHow much is the retail market worth in Arizona?\n\nBased on the advertised prices at some of the state's dispensaries, marijuana sells for about $3,300 to more than $4,000 a pound. Arizona's retail market is estimated at about $1 billion annually counting medical sales only, and that could potentially double with recreational sales.\n\nREAD: With hemp farming about to be legal, marijuana farms fear cross-pollination\n\nWhat is the debate over edibles and other marijuana extracts?\n\nThe Arizona Supreme Court considered whether concentrated marijuana products, such as food, candies, vape pens, \"shatter\" and other products were permitted under the voter-approved Medical Marijuana Act. In May 2019, the court ruled these products are legal.\n\nDispensaries across the state commonly sell such products (5 tons in 2018), but some law-enforcement officers had arrested and charged card-holding patients for possessing items other than marijuana flower.\n\nSome prosecutors in the state contended such items were not allowed under the 2010 act.\n\nThe Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the case of one such cardholder, Rodney Jones. Jones was sentenced to 2.5 years in prison for possessing a concentrated form of the drug despite also possessing a certification card.\n\nRELATED: Are marijuana extracts, edibles legal in Arizona? Court will decide\n\nWhat is the punishment for marijuana possession for those without a medical card in Arizona?\n\nProposition 207 reduces the penalties for marijuana possession.\n\nAdults who are charged with possessing more than one ounce of the drug, but less than 2.5 ounces, and less than 12.5 grams of concentrate, will now face a petty offense. That's the same for adults charged with smoking marijuana in public and growing more than the allowed number of plants.\n\nPeople younger than 21 charged with possession will face a civil fine and possibly drug counseling on a first offense.\n\nPrior to Proposition 207, possessing less than 2 pounds of marijuana in Arizona was a Class 6 (least severe) felony punishable by six to 18 months incarceration time and up to $150,000 in fines. Courts are directed to offer probation to first- and second-time offenders with no prior convictions for violent crimes thanks to the passage of Proposition 200 in 1996, which essentially prevents incarceration for those offenses. Drug treatment is required in such cases.\n\nThe penalties for subsequent possession greater than 2.5 ounces or drug-sale offenses remain more severe.\n\nReach reporter Ryan Randazzo at ryan.randazzo@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-4331.

Our eight-part guide shows you a delicious expert-backed eating lifestyle that will boost your health for life.\n\nCNN —\n\nA weekly dose of a medication recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat type 2 diabetes may help adults without diabetes lose weight as well, a new study found.\n\nTirzepatide, which is sold under the brand name Mounjaro, was studied in people without diabetes in three dosages: 5, 10 and 15 milligrams. Participants with obesity or who were overweight and took the 5-milligram dose lost an average of 35 pounds (16 killograms), those on the 10-milligram dose lost an average of 49 pounds (22 kilograms), and participants on the 15-milligram dose lost an average of 52 pounds (23.6 kilograms).\n\n“Almost 40% of individuals lost a quarter of their body weight,” said coauthor Dr. Ania Jastreboff, codirector of the Yale Center for Weight Management in a briefing for the media.\n\n“The data was quite impressive,” said Dr. Robert Gabbay, chief medical officer of the American Diabetes Association, who spoke to CNN from the ADA’s 82nd Scientific Sessions in New Orleans, where the study results were presented.\n\n“The weight loss that they got in this study was even greater than what had been seen in the previous studies of people with diabetes,” Gabbay, who was not involved with the study, said.\n\n“The middle range of weight loss for people in this new study was 49 pounds – 49 pounds is a lot,” he said. “It’s the range of weight loss that we typically think only possible through surgery.”\n\nAll in all, people without diabetes lost an average of 15% to 20.9% of their starting body weight over the course of the 72-week double-blinded, randomized clinical trial, which was published Saturday in The New England Journal of Medicine. Participants who got a placebo lost between 2.4% and 3.1% of their body weight, on average.\n\nIn comparison, studies on people with diabetes who used tirzepatide found they lost an average of 15% of their starting body weight, Gabbay said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Here's why you can't stop eating pizza, ice cream and chocolate chip cookies 01:42 - Source: CNN\n\n“This is a not uncommon observation,” he said. “The impact of previous weight loss medications are less effective in people with diabetes, and we honestly don’t know exactly why.”\n\nHowever, the impact of tirzepatide on people with diabetes is still “profound,” Gabbay said, “providing much more than other tools that we’ve had.”\n\nSelf-injected dose\n\nFor the new study, weekly injections of tirzepatide were tested in more than 2,500 people without diabetes who had a body mass index (BMI) over 30 or who were over 27 BMI and had at least one weight-related health condition such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol or cardiovascular disease. A measure of a person’s height-to-weight ratio, a BMI of 25 or higher is considered overweight in adults.\n\nAt the start of the study, the participants had an average weight of 231 pounds (104.8 kilograms) and average BMI of 38.\n\nAdults in the study injected themselves with tirzepatide or a placebo once a week, using “a small penlike device with a tiny, tiny needle,” Gabbay said. “The prick from that needle is less painful than, for example, people that prick their fingers to measure blood glucose.”\n\nPeople in the study also received counseling sessions to help them stay on a healthy diet with a daily 500-calorie deficit, as well as at least 150 minutes of physical activity each week. While that certainly helped, it does not explain the magnitude of the weight loss seen in the study, Gabbay said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback If you do just one exercise every day, try this one 02:32 - Source: CNN\n\n“The kind of weight loss that we see when people exercise and change their calorie intake is somewhere in the order of 5% to 7%,” he said. “This study showed a profoundly greater weight loss, far above what we would imagine with lifestyle changes.”\n\nThe most common side effects reported were nausea, diarrhea and constipation. Between 2.6% and 7.1% of the participants discontinued treatment due to adverse events.\n\nMounjaro carries a boxed warning about thyroid tumors and should not be used by people with a family history of certain thyroid conditions.\n\n“Obesity should be treated like any other chronic disease – with effective and safe approaches that target underlying (causes of) disease … and these results underscore that tirzepatide may be doing just that,” Jastreboff of the Yale Center for Weight Management said in an American Diabetes Association news release.\n\n“These results are an important step forward in potentially expanding effective therapeutic options for people with obesity.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte Virginia Langmaid", "Sandee Lamotte", "Virginia Langmaid"], "publish_date": "2022/06/06"}]}

Greg Abbott and other southern border officials started busing thousands of migrants to New York, the 84,400-square-foot tent facility in Randall’s Island is the city’s latest response to what Mayor Eric Adams has called a humanitarian crisis.\n\nThe location of the winterized complex, which will initially accommodate 500 single men, has drawn criticism from some city council members as well as advocates, who have raised concerns about accessibility to the site and extreme cold in the winter months. Families who arrive with children are housed in the Row Hotel in midtown Manhattan.\n\nThe tent camp’s opening comes just over a week after Adams declared a state of emergency and warned the wave of new arrivals was overwhelming homeless shelters, straining resources and could cost the city $1 billion.\n\nThe Randall’s Island Humanitarian Emergency Response and Relief Center spans more than 6.4 acres and cost $325,000 to set up, according to New York City Emergency Management Commissioner Zach Iscol. Costs related to operations are still being calculated, he said. The shelter can be expanded to serve 1,000 men.\n\nThe center has an intake operation, a recreation room with games and televisions, a kitchen and food hall, bathrooms and showers, laundry services, and sleeping quarters. And it will have security, Iscol said.\n\nFor months, city officials, with the help of non-profits, had been receiving asylum seekers in a sectioned-off area of Manhattan’s Port Authority Bus Terminal, where they received medical attention and rapid Covid-19 tests, food, clothing, prepaid phones, toiletries, legal assistance and transportation to temporary shelter.\n\nCity officials reviewed 80 to 90 potential locations before settling on Randall’s Island.\n\n“There are not a lot of places where you could put this infrastructure and do this kind of work,” Iscol said.\n\nThe tent structure is designed to withstand 90 mph winds and is heated at 70 degrees.\n\n“These are shelters that could keep people warm in the winter and cool in the summer,” Iscol said.\n\nAsylum seekers will be greeted with food, a medical exam and meet with staff. People will be tested for Covid-19 and if they test positive, they will be taken to isolation trailers outside of the main facility, said Dr. Ted Long, senior vice president for ambulatory care and population health at New York City Health + Hospitals.\n\nThe recreation room includes six big-screen televisions, video gaming systems, phones for international calls, charging stations and free Wi-Fi.\n\nThe food hall seats about 500 people, and offers three meals a day as well as snacks, water, coffee and tea. The kitchen, designed to cook for 1,000 people, will serve South American food, according to Iscol.\n\nThe dormitory is made up of two tents, each with a capacity of 449 cots. Laundry services are available as well.\n\nTransportation from Randall’s Island to Manhattan is still in the works, Long said. Officials hope to offer buses between the two locations once an hour, he said.\n\nCity officials said Tuesday there will be no limit on how long asylum seekers will be allowed to stay. While the goal is to get migrants to their next destination in about 96 hours, officials said there will be no limit on their stays.\n\n“We’re going to take as much time as we need to get you where you want to go,” Long said. “If it takes longer than that, then that’s fine. If it takes less time than that, that’s also fine.”\n\nThe city will work with asylum seekers who do not have family in the US to figure out the next steps, New York City Deputy Mayor for Health and Human Services Anne Williams-Isom said.\n\nLong said 90% of the staff, including greeters and intake and resettlement workers, are bilingual.\n\nAs of Saturday, more than 19,400 asylum seekers had entered the city’s shelter system in recent months. Last week, officials told CNN more than 14,100 remained in shelters.\n\nThe most recent arrivals are asylum seekers from Venezuela.\n\nKathryn Kliff, a staff attorney with the Legal Aid Society’s Homeless Rights Project, said the organization will monitor the shelter operation to make sure it complies with city right-to-shelter requirements.

The government began busing migrants from the beach to the shelter Wednesday, but not before tensions turned into violence, pushing, shoving, kicking and a couple of blows broke out between locals and migrants.\n\nThe sports complex has indoor and outdoor sleeping areas, portable bathrooms and makeshift bathings areas.

Morones criticized the mayor for calling the migrants “vagrants” and “potheads,” according to Mexican media outlet Milenio. He compared the mayor to President Donald Trump, calling him “Donald Trump Jr.”\n\n​​​​​​More:Violence breaks out at Tijuana border as migrant caravan arrives to already crowded city\n\n“How dare he call the migrants criminals, bringing diseases,” Morones said. Referencing the confrontation that occured Wednesday night between locals and migrants, Morones added: “He is promoting violence… Hate words lead to hate actions and we’re not going to tolerate it.”\n\nThe migrants left San Pedro Sula, Honduras about a month ago, fleeing poverty, gang violence and lawlessness. The group — which at its peak included some 7,000 people according to estimates by United Nations officials — has trekked through heat and hitched harrowing rides on the sides of trucks and tractor trailers.\n\nBy the time the caravan reached Mexico City in early November, the caravan had shrunk to about 5,000. The group rested in a stadium in Mexico's capital before leaving late last week to finish the journey.\n\nAn estimated 5,000 migrants left Mexico City on Nov. 9 and have been traveling toward Tijuana by bus.\n\n“We have information that the buses were paid for by the governments of the different municipalities of the states that migrants were traveling through,” said Francisco Rueda Gomez, secretary-general of the state of Baja California.\n\nMore:The first waves of the migrant caravan have arrived at U.S.-Mexico border; thousands more expected in coming days\n\nA small contingent of about 85 migrants, most members of the LGBT community arrived in an upscale Tijuana neighborhood on Nov. 11. They were confronted by residents, who said they opposed the migrants' presence in the area, according to local news reports.\n\nLarger waves of migrants began arriving Nov. 13.\n\nAs the caravans traveled north toward the border with the United States, the Trump administration deployed more than 5,200 soldiers to the southwest border, joining more than 2,000 National Guardsmen already stationed there. The troops will “harden and secure” the border as part of Operation Secure Line, according to the Department of Defense.\n\nTrump is also changing asylum policy in an attempt to deter the caravans. Last Friday, he signed a proclamation that will deny asylum to immigrants who enter the U.S. without authorization. Immigrants typically are allowed to request asylum at the ports of entry or when they are apprehended while attempting to cross the border illegally. The same day, the American Civil Liberties Union, Southern Poverty Law Center and Center for Constitutional Rights filed a federal lawsuit challenging the restrictions.\n\nRebecca Plevin covers immigration for the Desert Sun.

San Antonio, the nearest major city, may be among the departure cities.\n\nOperational capacity and Haiti’s willingness would determine the number of flights, according to an official with direct knowledge of the plans who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity. But the official said “good progress” was being made.\n\nAnother administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity expected two flights per day, at most, and said all migrants would be tested for COVID-19.\n\nTraffic remained closed Saturday morning to vehicles and pedestrians in both directions at the only border crossing in Del Rio, Texas, after chaos unfolded Friday and presented the administration with a new and immediate challenge as it tries to manage large numbers of asylum-seekers who have been reaching U.S. soil.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security released a six-point strategy to address the increase in Haitian and other migrants at the Del Rio Port of Entry early Saturday morning. Within the next 48 hours, U.S. Customs and Border Protection will add 400 agents and officers to the Del Rio sector \"to improve control of the area.\"\n\nCBP said it was closing the border crossing with Ciudad Acuna, Mexico, \"to respond to urgent safety and security needs.\" Travelers were being directed to Eagle Pass, Texas, 57 miles away.\n\nBorder residents gathered in a grassy median, waiting to see if the crossing would reopen.\n\nAna Padron, 23, was returning home to Ciudad Acuña from her shift at a Whataburger in Del Río. She was impatient to return to her nine-month-old and three-year-old daughters.\n\n\"I don't have anywhere to stay here,\" she said. \"I guess if I can't cross, I'll just sleep in the car.\"\n\nRene Beltran of Ciudad Acuña was waiting with his 18-wheeler to cross into Mexico. He drives back and forth between the two border cities three times a day for work. He said that in 12 years as a trucker, he had never seen the crossing closed.\n\n\"Even during the pandemic, we were able to cross,\" he said. \"But now the authorities didn't react in time and they're overwhelmed.\"\n\nOther truckers waited near the bridge, hoping to return home to Mexico for the night.\n\nHaitians crossed the Rio Grande freely and in a steady stream, going back and forth between the U.S. and Mexico through knee-deep water, with some parents carrying small children on their shoulders. Unable to buy supplies in the U.S., they returned briefly to Mexico for food and cardboard to settle, temporarily at least, under or near the bridge in Del Rio, a city of 35,000 that has been severely strained by migrant flows in recent months.\n\nMigrants pitched tents and built makeshift shelters from giant reeds known as carrizo cane. Many bathed and washed clothing in the river.\n\nMexicans set up stands near the river crossing, selling bottled water, Cup Noodles, hot food and used clothing.\n\nThe vast majority of the migrants at the bridge on Friday were Haitian, said Val Verde County Judge Lewis Owens, who is the county's top elected official and whose jurisdiction includes Del Rio. Some families have been under the bridge for as long as six days.\n\nTrash piles were 10 feet wide, and at least two women have given birth, including one who tested positive for COVID-19 after being taken to a hospital, Owens said.\n\nVal Verde County Sheriff Frank Joe Martinez estimated the crowd at 13,700 and said more Haitians were traveling through Mexico by bus.\n\nAngel Joseph, 26, waited outside a house a few blocks from the river to buy a plate of chicken and rice. He left Cap-Haïtien, Haiti, four years ago, settling in Chile. But he said without Chilean residency, he could not find good-paying work and headed for Mexico. In Tapachula, Chiapas, on Mexico’s Southern Border, a police officer stopped him on the street and took his cell phone and wallet.\n\nHe pointed to abrasions from where the police officer cuffed him. “I asked him why he was stopping me,” he said. “But it wasn’t for any reason, just because I was a migrant.”\n\nJoseph hopes to resettle in Miami. If he can’t enter the United States, he says he will try and find work in Ciudad Acuña.\n\nThe flight plan, while potentially massive in scale, hinges on how Haitians respond. They may face a choice: stay put at the risk of being sent back to their impoverished homeland – wracked by poverty, political instability and a recent earthquake – or return to Mexico. Unaccompanied children are exempt from fast-track expulsions.\n\nAbout 500 Haitians were ordered off buses by Mexican immigration authorities in the state of Tamaulipas, about 120 miles south of the Texas border, the state government said in a news release Friday. They continued toward the border on foot.\n\nHaitians have been migrating to the U.S. in large numbers from South America for several years, many of them having left the Caribbean nation after a devastating earthquake in 2010. After jobs dried up from the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, many made the dangerous trek by foot, bus and car to the U.S. border, including through the infamous Darien Gap, a Panamanian jungle.\n\nIt is unclear how such a large number amassed so quickly, though many Haitians have been assembling in camps on the Mexican side of the border, including in Tijuana, across from San Diego, to wait while deciding whether to attempt to enter the United States.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment. \"We will address it accordingly,\" Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said on MSNBC.\n\nAn administration official, who was not authorized to address the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity, said the action is not targeting Haitians specifically and does not reflect a policy shift, just a continuation of normal practices.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration, acting on a Border Patrol request, restricted drone flights around the bridge until Sept. 30, generally barring operations at or below 1,000 feet unless for security or law enforcement purposes.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican and frequent critic of President Joe Biden, said federal officials told him migrants under the bridge would be moved by the Defense Department to Arizona, California and elsewhere on the Texas border.\n\nSome Haitians at the camp have lived in Mexican cities on the U.S. border for some time, moving often between them, while others arrived recently after being stuck near Mexico's southern border with Guatemala, said Nicole Phillips, the legal director for advocacy group Haitian Bridge Alliance. A sense of desperation spread after the Biden administration ended its practice of admitting asylum-seeking migrants daily who were deemed especially vulnerable.\n\n\"People are panicking on how they seek refuge,\" Phillips said.\n\nEdgar Rodríguez, lawyer for the Casa del Migrante migrant shelter in Piedras Negras, north of Del Rio, noticed an increase of Haitians in the area two or three weeks ago and believes that misinformation may have played a part. Migrants often make decisions on false rumors that policies are about to change and that enforcement policies vary by city.\n\nU.S. authorities are being severely tested after Biden quickly dismantled Trump administration policies that Biden considered cruel or inhumane, most notably one requiring asylum-seekers to remain in Mexico while waiting for U.S. immigration court hearings. Such migrants have been exposed to extreme violence in Mexico and faced extraordinary difficulty in finding attorneys.\n\nThe U.S Supreme Court last month let stand a judge's order to reinstate the policy, though Mexico must agree to its terms.

During his first month in office, Biden chose to exempt children traveling alone on humanitarian grounds.\n\nThe U.S. government has been unable to expel many Central American families because Mexican authorities have largely refused to accept them in the state of Tamaulipas, which is across from Texas' Rio Grande Valley, the busiest corridor for illegal crossings. On Friday, the administration said it would appeal a judge's ruling a day earlier that blocked it from applying Title 42, as the pandemic-related authority is known, to any families.\n\nMexico has agreed to take expelled families only from Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, creating an opening for Haitians and other nationalities because the U.S. lacks the resources to detain and quickly expel them on flights to their homelands.\n\nIn August, U.S. authorities stopped migrants nearly 209,000 times at the border, which was close to a 20-year high even though many of the stops involved repeat crossers because there are no legal consequences for being expelled under Title 42 authority.\n\nPeople crossing in families were stopped 86,487 times in August, but fewer than one out of every five of those encounters resulted in expulsion under Title 42. The rest were processed under immigration laws, which typically means they were released with a court date or a notice to report to immigration authorities.\n\nU.S. authorities stopped Haitians 7,580 times in August, a figure that has increased every month since August 2020, when they stopped only 55. There have also been major increases of Ecuadorians, Venezuelans and other nationalities outside the traditional sending countries of Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.\n\nContributing: Martha Pskowski, El Paso Times", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/09/20/haitian-migrants-del-rio-texas-border-expulsion-what-know/8416939002/", "title": "Haitian migrants in Del Rio, Texas: 600 Homeland Security agents ...", "text": "CIUDAD ACUÑA, Mexico — An additional 600 Homeland Security personnel have been sent to the border in Del Rio, Texas, as thousands of refugees camped under a bridge are being taken back to Haiti, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro N. Mayorkas said Monday.\n\nMore than 14,500 migrants – the vast majority of whom are Haitian, according to Del Rio officials – are facing high temperatures and poor conditions at a camp under a bridge.\n\nHaitians have been crossing into the isolated city for weeks, but the number of migrants reached new levels in recent days, Mayorkas said.\n\nIn response to the rapid arrival, the United States closed the Mexican border Sunday to Del Rio, a city of about 35,000 people located roughly 145 miles west of San Antonio. Mexican authorities tightened immigration controls, cut off the entry points to Ciudad Acuña to stop more migrants from reaching the border, and announced it would also begin deporting Haitians.\n\nAbout 3,500 migrants from the camp have already been relocated, and 3,000 more were expected to be relocated to another processing facility Monday, Mayorkas said.\n\nAt least three deportation flights with 145 passengers each arrived Sunday in Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital, and Haiti said six flights were expected Tuesday.\n\n'We can't turn back':Haitian migrants face massive expulsion amid crackdown at US-Mexico border\n\nThe move signals a shift to using a pandemic-related law to immediately expel migrants without allowing them to claim asylum, a U.S. official who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly told The Associated Press.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott on Monday also sent a letter to President Joe Biden requesting a federal emergency declaration for the state. Abbott said he declared a disaster and has taken action under state law but \"supplementary federal assistance is necessary to lessen the threat of disaster, save lives, and protect property, public health and safety.\"\n\nHere's what we know:\n\nHow did Haitian migrants get to Del Rio, Texas?\n\nHaitians have been crossing from Ciudad Acuña, Mexico, into Del Rio, Texas, for almost three weeks.\n\nIn his letter to Biden on Monday, Abbott said the number of migrants increased from around 4,000 on Wednesday to over 16,000 migrants by Saturday.\n\nSome Haitians at the camp lived in Mexican cities on the U.S. border for some time, while others arrived recently after being stuck near Mexico's southern border with Guatemala, said Nicole Phillips, the legal director for advocacy group Haitian Bridge Alliance. Many have been waiting in camps in Mexico before deciding whether to cross the border.\n\nMany left Haiti in the wake of a devastating 2010 earthquake and lived in South America for years. As jobs from the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro vanished, many traveled by foot, bus and car to the U.S. border.\n\nIt is not clear how the large group amassed so quickly, but misinformation may have played a role, according to Edgar Rodríguez, lawyer for the Casa del Migrante migrant shelter in Piedras Negras, south of Del Rio. Migrants often make choices after hearing false rumors that policies are going to change or that cities have different enforcement policies.\n\nMayorkas and other Homeland Security officials stressed the role misinformation has played in leading to the current surge. \"It is tragic to see families, vulnerable individuals who have been deceived by treacherous and exploitative smuggling organizations,\" Mayorkas said.\n\nWhat is it like at the border?\n\nDespair is settling in for migrants on both sides of the border.\n\nIn the camp, there is no easy access to food and water and trash piles are 10 feet wide.\n\nBorder Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz said part of what has caused such dire circumstances is that the Del Rio community is much smaller than some other areas along the border and resources are limited.\n\nDel Rio Mayor Bruno Lozano said that hot temperatures and the fluctuating level of the Rio Grande could make the camp dangerous. The temperature in Del Rio has been in the high 90s and on Monday is forecast to hit 105 degrees.\n\nMigrants have pitched tents and built makeshift shelters under the bridge while others bathe and wash clothing in the river. At least two women have given birth, one of whom later tested positive for COVID-19, said Val Verde County Judge Lewis Owens, the county's top elected official.\n\nHaitian migrants must decide whether to stay put and risk being deported to the country they left or return to Mexico.\n\nSome of those waiting in Mexico, like Charles Edirame, said they are afraid to return to Haiti after the recent devastating earthquake and the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse.\n\nEdirame and his wife and daughter crossed the border to the encampment but returned to Mexico when they heard about the deportations. The Haitian family was deciding what to do next.\n\n\"We don't have money, we don't have anything. We spent two months getting here on foot,\" he said. \"If I go back, I could die the next day.\"\n\nOn Sunday, photos and video emerged showing CBP agents chasing Haitian migrants on horseback. The agents charged migrants carrying only food and water and the clothes on their backs as they tried to scramble onto the U.S. side of the river.\n\n\"Let's go! Get out now! Back to Mexico!\" agents shouted. One man stumbled and fell as he tried to dodge an agent.\n\nDemocrats decry images of border enforcement\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki on Monday said the images are \"horrific,\" adding more information on the situation is needed.\n\n\"I've seen some of the footage, I don't have the full context.

I don't think anyone seeing that footage would think it was acceptable or appropriate,\" Psaki said at a news briefing.\n\nRep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., said on Twitter that the border patrol agents' actions were \"human rights abuses, plain and simple. Cruel, inhumane, and a violation of domestic and international law.\"\n\nRep. Veronica Escobar, D-Texas, also expressed her concern, saying the actions were \"absolutely unacceptable.\"\n\n\"No matter how challenging the situation in Del Rio is right now, nothing justifies violence against migrants attempting to seek asylum in our country,\" Escobar said on Twitter.\n\nA use of force policy document from CBP dated January 2021 says: \"The use of excessive force by CBP law enforcement personnel is strictly prohibited.\" But the document also says that agents \"may use 'objectively reasonable' force only when it is necessary to carry out their law enforcement duties,\" adding that the \"reasonableness\" of any particular situation varies with the conditions.\n\nMigrant shelter in El Paso prepared to receive refugees\n\nEl Paso's Annunciation House on Monday prepared to receive Haitian refugees even as flights deporting hundreds of Haitians were scheduled to depart San Antonio for Por-au-Prince.\n\nRuben Garcia, director of El Paso's Annunciation House migrant shelter, on Monday said that authorities had asked the shelter to be prepared to receive refugees, but so far no Haitians have been released in El Paso.\n\n\"It’s really unpredictable because you see all the different things they are doing like expelling people directly to Haiti,\" he said. \"Sometimes I am told to get ready, and so we ramp up and nothing happens.\n\n\"Right now, we haven’t gotten anybody,\" he said. \"I know they are using a lot of buses, that they started arriving on Friday. We are on standby.

You are free, you are home,\" Basulto Corona told them.\n\nEventually, about 50 Haitian migrants — men, women and children — at Braulio Fernández Aguirre Park agreed to move to the building.\n\nSo ended the weeklong, relentless campaign by U.S. and Mexican officials to resolve the Haitian migrant crisis, after about 15,000 migrants had amassed near Del Rio beginning in mid-September.\n\nBy Saturday morning, no migrants were left at the park, located only a few hundred feet south of the Rio Grande.

The port had been closed since Sept. 17.\n\nOn Friday, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said at a news briefing at the White House that the Haitian migrant camp under the Del Rio International Bridge was empty.\n\nAll week, U.S. officials had used buses to move thousands of Haitian migrants to processing centers or place them on expatriation flights to Haiti. Some weary Haitians decided to return to Mexico rather than risk being expelled from the U.S.\n\nThe Haitians, whose homeland is reeling from the July assassination of President Jovenel Moïse, an August earthquake and gang violence, hoped to seek asylum in the U.S. Many had left their country before the recent tumult, traveling first to South America, and then making their way north to the Texas-Mexico border.\n\nPresident Joe Biden’s administration responded with a six-point plan that relied heavily on Title 42, a provision of federal law that permits health officials to ban people from entering the country during the COVID-19 pandemic, to immediately expel the migrants to their countries of origin.\n\nPleading to stay\n\nMexican authorities worked to stop Haitians from reaching the Del Rio camp by removing migrants from buses, city streets and hotels in Acuña. The park was the final haven for large groups of Haitians fearful of the Mexican sweeps.\n\nBut at noon Friday, Basulto Corona told the Haitians at the park that they would be taken to a \"designated area,\" where they would have a roof over their heads, receive food and water and be able to apply for legal residency in Mexico and work permits.\n\nMore from Del Rio:El Paso Times journalists' video shows confrontations between Border Patrol agents, Haitian migrants\n\nThe migrants had pleaded with Mexican immigration officials this week to be able to file the paperwork in the border city.

We'll walk.\"\n\nThe offer from Mexican immigration officials came after a week of fear and uncertainty and a day after Mexican State Police at dawn entered the park, lining up their vehicles along the banks of the Rio Grande.

The space has a concrete-floor outdoor space and no air conditioning. The location was still under construction with tools and construction equipment left unattended, and it's unknown if there is running water.\n\nHistorians:Border Patrol agent's treatment of Haitian migrants recalls slavery-era whippings\n\nIlfrid Alcide, 26, debated whether or not to move his family to the building.

Yellow police tape is being used to block them from using a small dam to walk into the U.S.\n\nA Mexican police officer on the Mexican side of the border said migrants won't be allowed to cross anymore. He would not give his name.\n\nMany of the migrants have lived in Latin America for years, but they are now are seeking asylum in the U.S. as economic opportunities in Brazil and elsewhere dry up. Thousands are living under and near a bridge in Del Rio.\n\nMore:'We hope the US can help us': Haitian migrants in Texas wait on border, seeking asylum\n\nEarlier Sunday, the U.S. sent three flights of Haitians back to their homeland. The planes are expected to arrive Sunday afternoon in Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital.\n\nSome said the recent devastating earthquake in Haiti and the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse make them afraid to return to a country that seems more unstable than when they left.\n\n\"In Haiti, there is no security,\" said Fabricio Jean, a 38-year-old Haitian who arrived in Texas with his wife and two daughters. \"The country is in a political crisis.\"\n\nScores of people waded back and forth across the Rio Grande on Saturday, re-entering Mexico to purchase water, food and diapers in Ciudad Acuña before returning to the Texas encampment.\n\nJunior Jean, a 32-year-old man from Haiti, watched as people cautiously carried cases of water or bags of food through the knee-high river water. Jean said he lived on the streets in Chile the past four years, resigned to searching for food in garbage cans.\n\n\"We are all looking for a better life,\" he said.\n\nHaitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry wrote Sunday on Twitter that he is concerned about conditions at the border camp and that the migrants would be welcomed back.\n\n\"We want to reassure them that measures have already been taken to give them a better welcome upon their return to the country and that they will not be left behind,\" he tweeted. Henry did not provide details about the measures. A Haitian government spokesman could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nAnother Haitian political leader questioned Sunday whether the nation could handle an influx of returning migrants and said the government should stop the repatriation.\n\n\"We have the situation in the south with the earthquake. The economy is a disaster, (and) there are no jobs,\" Election Minister Mathias Pierre said, adding that most Haitians can't satisfy basic needs. \"The prime minister should negotiate with the U.S. government to stop those deportations in this moment of crises.\"\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security said Saturday that it moved about 2,000 migrants from the camp to other locations Friday for processing and possible removal. A statement from the agency also said it would have 400 agents and officers in the area by Monday morning and would send more if necessary.\n\nThe announcement marked a swift response to the sudden arrival of Haitians in Del Rio, a Texas city of about 35,000 people roughly 145 miles west of San Antonio. It sits on a relatively remote stretch of border that lacks capacity to hold and process such large numbers of people.\n\nHaitians have been migrating to the U.S. in large numbers from South America for several years, many having left their Caribbean nation after a devastating 2010 earthquake. After jobs dried up from the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, many made the dangerous trek by foot, bus and car to the U.S. border, including through the infamous Darien Gap, a Panamanian jungle.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection closed off vehicle and pedestrian traffic in both directions Friday at the only border crossing between Del Rio and Ciudad Acuña \"to respond to urgent safety and security needs\" and it remained closed Saturday. Travelers were being directed indefinitely to a crossing in Eagle Pass, roughly 55 miles (90 kilometers) away.\n\nCrowd estimates varied, but Del Rio Mayor Bruno Lozano said Saturday evening there were more than 14,500 immigrants at the camp under the bridge. Migrants pitched tents and built makeshift shelters from giant reeds known as carrizo cane. Many bathed and washed clothing in the river.\n\nIt is unclear how such a large number amassed so quickly, though many Haitians have been assembling in camps on the Mexican side of the border to wait while deciding whether to attempt entry into the U.S.\n\nThe number of Haitian arrivals began to reach unsustainable levels for the Border Patrol in Del Rio about 2 ½ weeks ago, prompting the agency's acting sector chief, Robert Garcia, to ask headquarters for help, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.\n\nSince then, the agency has transferred Haitians in buses and vans to other Border Patrol facilities in Texas, specifically El Paso, Laredo and Rio Grande Valley. They are mostly processed outside of the government's pandemic-related authority, meaning they can claim asylum and remain in the U.S. while their claims are considered. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement makes custody decisions, but families can generally not be held more than 20 days under court order.\n\nHomeland Security's plan announced Saturday signals a shift to use of pandemic-related authority for immediate expulsion to Haiti without an opportunity to claim asylum, the official said.\n\nThe planned flights, while potentially massive in scale, hinge on how Haitians respond. They might have to decide whether to stay put at the risk of being sent back to an impoverished homeland or return to Mexico. Unaccompanied children are exempt from fast-track expulsions.\n\nHomeland Security said in a statement that, \"our borders are not open, and people should not make the dangerous journey.\"\n\n\"Individuals and families are subject to border restrictions, including expulsion,\" the agency wrote.\n\nLozano reported from Ciudad Acuña, Mexico, and Spagat reported from San Diego.

The first caravan fractured since it left Mexico City.\n\nAbout 85 mostly LGBT people from the first caravan arrived in Tijuana on Sunday. About 400 from the first caravan arrived Tuesday, about 375 arrived Wednesday, and an estimated 2,000 more are on their way, according to state and local officials. A second caravan started arriving in Mexico City on Tuesday.\n\nOfficials with the state of Baja California said Tuesday that Tijuana’s churches and immigrant shelters could accommodate 900 migrants, but hundreds were preparing to sleep Wednesday night along the grass and paved walkways near the beach and border fence.\n\nUpdate:Violence breaks out at Tijuana border as migrant caravan arrives to already crowded city\n\nPreviously:The first waves of the migrant caravan have arrived at U.S.-Mexico border; thousands more expected in coming days\n\nMore:US: 'Everything on table' to block migrant caravan at border\n\nSome migrants camped at the beach said officials had told them the shelters were full. Some said officials offered them space in shelters, but preferred to sleep alongside other caravan members. They said the beach would serve as a meeting point, as other caravan members arrive.\n\nAt a press conference Wednesday evening, state and local officials announced they were opening up a temporary migrant shelter at the Benito Juarez Sports Complex in Tijuana. They said there is room for at least 360 people, especially women, children and the elderly, to sleep with grey wool blankets on thin mattresses on the floor of the facility’s indoor basketball court.\n\nThe officials said they would encourage caravan members to sleep at the sports complex, but “we will not remove them by force,” said Luis Bustamante, assistant secretary for social development for the state of Baja California, of the migrants camped on the beach.\n\nMore:Homeland Security focuses on border security — not processing asylum applications from migrant caravan\n\nMore:A previous migrant caravan faced the same federal scrutiny. Here is how that turned out\n\nEarlier Wednesday, as people staked out their spots by the Pacific Ocean, a welder on the U.S. side of the border affixed concertina wire to the top of the tall fence.\n\nMeanwhile, a young man shimmied up another part of the wall without wire, sat atop it and tried ripping off the top of the wall, which appeared to be made of metal that had been corroded by salt water. On the Mexican side, federal police approached and told him to get down, while on the U.S. side of the fence, immigration agents and armed military police soldiers watched. The young man descended back to the ground on the Mexico side of the fence; the pieces of the wall that he’d torn off remained strewn across the ground.\n\nJust steps from the commotion, Glenda Aviles sat in her makeshift campsite. Aviles, who traveled from Honduras with her two teenage sons, said the family chose to sleep by the beach in the Playas de Tijuana neighborhood Tuesday night. It was cold, she said, but “here, I feel free like the wind.”\n\n“We have been suffering through rain, sun and cold temperatures for more than a month,” Aviles said. “We’ve become accustomed to suffering.”\n\nJarely Pinera, who fled Honduras with her three-year-old daughter, said she would prefer to sleep in a shelter, but when she arrived in Tijuana on Wednesday, she said officials told her the shelters were full. She said members of a local church brought soup out to the beach lunchtime. She said she doesn’t have money to buy food herself. She said she didn’t know where they would bathe.\n\nPinera said she was tired from the journey but, “God always gives you strength and with his help we’ve arrived here.”\n\nBut not all of the members of the caravan will be sleeping by the ocean. Linda Romero, the coordinator of the Tijuana migrant shelter Movimiento Juventud 2000, said 15 Central American migrants are staying at her facility. She said the shelter is now completely full.\n\nBelkis Bustamante, 23, and her husband, Bryan Garcia, 21, said they planned to stay at Movimiento Juventud 2000 and share a camping tent with their 4-year-old daughter and 5-year-old son. On Wednesday morning, doctors at the shelter examined the family. They got medicine for a hacking cough they all had. They said they would stay in the shelter until they find work in Tijuana.\n\nThe migrants left San Pedro Sula, Honduras, about a month ago, fleeing poverty, gang violence and lawlessness. The group – which at its peak included some 7,000 people, according to estimates by United Nations officials – trekked through heat and hitched harrowing rides on the sides of trucks and tractor trailers. By the time the caravan reached Mexico City in nearly November, the caravan had shrunk to about 5,000. The group rested in a stadium in Mexico’s capital before leaving late last week to finish the journey to Tijuana.\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration is still mobilizing military troops to border locations, in an attempt to “harden” areas where administration officials anticipate immigrants might try to enter the U.S. without authorization.\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis said at an impromptu press conference Wednesday aboard a plane headed to McAllen, Texas that the roughly 5,900 military personnel already deployed to the border are mostly providing planning and engineering support, and helping to set up additional barriers along the border. He said many are laying down concertina wire and setting up temporary housing, and that helicopter crews are in place to move soldiers around the border, as needed.\n\n“Law enforcement is left in the hands of the customs and border police who have the statutory authority to carry that out,” Mattis said. “At the present, I do not anticipate military personnel coming into direct contact with migrants.”\n\nMattis said as many as 7,000 troops could be sent to the border to assist the effort. Mattis said he expects to have the current deployment in place within ten days. He did not say how long he expects the effort to continue.\n\nMattis said it might be necessary to move troops from one location to another, as the migrant caravans arrive at different border locations.\n\n“I'm 100 percent confident we have the number of troops in each of those ports of entry to complete the – what we've been asked to do, prior to the arrival of the large caravans, wherever they choose to go, for right now.”\n\nRebecca Plevin covers immigration for The Desert Sun.

The complex has room for 3,000 people to sleep on thin mattresses on the floor of an indoor basketball court, in large, communal tents and in individual camping tents, according to a local official.\n\n“The message to the migrant population is very clear,” Francisco Rueda Gómez, secretary-general of the state of Baja California. “We are providing them with humanitarian support, health care and food, however the need to take into consideration the rules of the shelters so they can coexist in harmony with the local population.”\n\nRueda Gómez said it will cost about $4 million to care for the migrants for two months, including providing food and medical care. He said the state government can only afford to fund this work for 10 days at the most, so he has asked the federal government for support.\n\nThe violent night marks the latest in rising tensions as waves of migrants arrive in the border town south of San Diego, culminating a month-long journey across Mexico.\n\nThe conflict was foreshadowed earlier in the day at the beach. By the afternoon, two large groups of migrants – a total of about 750 people – had arrived in Tijuana. The city’s migrant shelters had limited space when the caravan arrived. A large portion of the migrants said they didn’t want to be separated, opting instead to sleep at the beach.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, city and state officials announced they were opening a temporary shelter at the Benito Juarez sports complex, where 360 migrants could sleep on thin mattresses in an indoor basketball court. They started offering buses from the beach to the shelter around 6 p.m.\n\nMeanwhile, Playas de Tijuana residents marched through the neighborhood to call for security and demand the migrants go to the shelters.\n\nBy 8:30 p.m., hundreds of residents and migrants had congregated by the beach, with local residents demanding the immigrants leave the public space at the beach.\n\n“This is not an appropriate place for them,” one local resident said. “There are appropriate places for them.”\n\nSIGN UP FOR FACEBOOK NEWS ALERTS: Message us here to get started\n\nSUPPORT LOCAL JOURNALISM: Interested in article like this?

He asked why area residents were treating the migrants differently.\n\nThe last bus left for the temporary shelter around 11 p.m., leaving about 200 locals and about 100 migrants gathered by the beach. Some migrants tried to sleep through the commotion, sprawled on patches of grass, with blankets pulled over their heads.\n\nMore:US: 'Everything on table' to block migrant caravan at border\n\nPhotos:Central American migrant caravan arrives in Tijuana\n\nVideo:Central American migrant caravan arrives\n\nAs the conflict intensified, Irineo Mujica, an immigrant activist who helps organize migrant caravans, said the migrants still at the beach – and the ones en route to Tijuana – wouldn’t go to the shelters. He referred to them as “jails” with strict curfews. He said he was concerned that non-governmental organizations wouldn’t be allowed into the shelters, making it harder for the migrants to remain organized as one collective.\n\n“For this reason – because this is oppression – we prefer to be in the streets, in the cold, rather than in a jail,” Mujica said.\n\nThere are at least three separate migrant caravans snaking their way through Mexico. Nearly 900 people from the first caravan arrived in Tijuana this week and on Wednesday night, local and state officials estimated 2,000 more were on their way. Several hundred of those 2,000 arrived Thursday morning, according to local reports. A second caravan started arriving in Mexico City Tuesday and as of Wednesday, a third caravan was traveling through Veracruz, on the eastern side of Mexico.\n\nRueda Gómez, with the Baja California government, said Tijuana’s migrant shelters currently have space for 700 migrants, in addition to the 3,000 spots at the sports complex.\n\nGustavo Magallanes, who oversees migrant affairs for the state of Baja California, said the arrival of the caravans in Tijuana is not a humanitarian crisis. The challenge, he said, is that so many people are arriving in such a short period of time. On top of that, he said, there are limited resources available for the migrants, as state and local governments are nearing the end of their fiscal years.\n\nRebecca Plevin covers immigration for the Desert Sun.

Ron DeSantis, the island’s community – still jarred by the unexpected arrival – rushed to help the newcomers.\n\n“We received food, we received clothes, we received … different things, so much so that we’ve had to relocate that donation drop-off spot to the fire department,” Edgartown, Massachusetts, town administrator James Hagerty told CNN Wednesday.\n\nTown officials had to post on social media they did not need more donations, Hagerty added, as items continued to pour in.\n\n“I think that’s a testament to the community of the island, and it’s a testament to the citizens of Edgartown, it’s a testament to everything that’s going on now,” he said.\n\n“We’ve been through Covid, we’ve been through hurricanes, we’ve been through this, we’ve been through a lot of things imaginable for a small community and every one of those we’ve risen up as the Vineyard, ‘cause we’re resilient,” Hagerty said. “We take care of our own, we take care of the community, we help people out.”\n\nVolunteers help serve food to the recently arrived migrants. Jonathan Wiggs/The Boston Globe/Getty Images\n\nThe town is no stranger to large population influxes. Located off the coast of Massachusetts, the island of Martha’s Vineyard – home to Edgartown and several other municipalities – is known as a posh summer destination for wealthy vacationers.\n\nWhile the town’s winter population is a couple hundred people, it jumps up to several thousand during the hotter months when they welcome summer tourists, Hagerty said.\n\nAn estimated year-round island population of around 20,000 can balloon to more than 100,000 during peak tourism season.\n\nBut the challenge with this week’s arrival of migrants was they were unexpected, the town administrator said, and it all happened so “last minute” and the migrants’ needs were so diverse and included relocation and transportation costs for those who were looking to go to another part of the country.\n\nIn addition to the donations, the towns on the island as well as community-based and nonprofit groups helped in the effort to care for the migrants and offer them shelter, food and care, according to a Facebook post from the Dukes County government.\n\n“We are grateful to the many local and neighboring community members who have reached out with offers of support,” county officials wrote in the post.\n\nResidents from across the island and other parts of the country raised more than $175,000 after the migrants’ arrival, according to Beth Folcarelli, CEO of the nonprofit Martha’s Vineyard Community Services. And while there were some large donations consisting of multiple thousands of dollars, most of the donations made for the migrants were contributions between $50 to $100, Folcarelli said.\n\n“In just two days we built such a connection between the volunteers who worked at the shelter and really providing and working with the migrants to really take some next steps for their future in this country,” she said.\n\nOn Friday, the migrants were transported to a military base to receive shelter and humanitarian support, officials said.\n\nBefore they left, all those who needed a cell phone were provided a mobile device with a US-based number, and they were all given a $50 Visa card, with the help of funds raised by the community, Folcarelli said.\n\n“We did come together, and I think were able to organize really in a very short time, get things going for them,” she added. “People stepped forward right away.”\n\nThe unexpected arrival is the latest move in a series of actions by Republican governors to transport migrants to northern liberal cities and states in order to protest the Biden administration’s policies at the southern border.\n\nAlso this week, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said he sent two buses of migrants to Vice President Kamala Harris’ residence in the nation’s capital, and the Thursday arrival surprised unsuspecting volunteers.

They are a tiny fraction of 23,500 Iraqis who migrated to Europe this year, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.\n\nThe reverse flight illustrates how many refugees have become disillusioned as European countries erected walls to prevent their passage north and then steered them to camps in remote villages like Idomeni or cordoned them off in tent cities like in Calais, France.\n\n\"The borders are closed, and a lot of people realize that Europe may not be the promised land that everyone imagined,” said Christine Nikolaidou, spokeswoman for the International Organization for Migration, which bought plane tickets for refugees. “A lot of people are trapped.”\n\nThe Al-Zobady brothers left home in early February to escape violence in Diyala, where the Islamic State carried out attacks.\n\nAfter spending $5,000 on smugglers and other costs, they got stuck in Idomeni for three months, waiting for the shuttered Macedonian border to open so they could go to Germany. Both were disappointed, but they are now resigned to returning home.\n\n“We left my country because of the war,” said Ali Al-Zobady, who worked as a teaching assistant in Iraq. “We just want peace. We dream of a new life. The European governments did not save my life.”\n\nMore than 50,000 refugees have been in limbo since March when the European Union and Turkey reached an agreement to send only recent refugees landing in Greece back to Turkey if they did not claim asylum in Greece or if their claim was denied.\n\nSoon after the brothers departed from Athens on May 18 to go back to Iraq, Greek officials cleared the Idomeni camps with bulldozers, sending about 3,000 refugees to other camps and dispersing about 5,000 people across the Greek countryside.\n\nThe brothers could have moved to another camp in hopes of eventually making it over the Macedonia border. But Ali Al-Zobady wanted to finish his math degree at the University of Diyala.\n\nIraq is struggling with economic hardships, terrorism and, in major cities like Mosul and Fallujah, Islamic State rule. Last month, a bomb exploded in Diyala, the Al-Zobady brothers' home province, killing 16 people.\n\nMany Iraqi refugees here said they prefer to rejoin their families and restart their lives rather than waste more time in Greece.\n\n“Some of them, of course, have their families back home, and they think that maybe it's going to be easier for all of them to continue their lives,” Nikolaidou said.\n\nOmar Haneef, 30, a Baghdad native who spoke by phone from the Athens airport, said his prospects were bleak back home, but he couldn’t stay in a camp or be homeless in northern Greece.\n\n“I am afraid to go back to Iraq, but there is no other solution — the situation is really bad. Macedonia is not treating refugees well. The borders are closed,” he said. “I have decided to return back to Iraq, in spite of the dangerous situation there. In Baghdad, I cannot secure my life. But I have no other option. Europe didn't welcome us.”\n\nAnother Iraqi, Mohammad Aljawad, 45, from Karbala, spent five months in Turkey and Greece before deciding to return to Iraq. The violence there won't stop him.\n\n“I am not afraid of going back to Iraq,” he said. “The security situation in Iraq is not recent or new to us. We are used to it.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/06/08"}]}

Here ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAs the protest cries of exasperated Iranians continue to ring through the streets of the country, reflected in videos posted on social media, here are a few of the key stories that have shaped the movement on the one-month anniversary of Mahsa Amini’s arrest.\n\nTo date, more than 1,000 people have been arrested across Iran, according to state news agency IRNA. At least 40 journalists are among those arrested, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, and a handful of athletes have been either arrested or detained for questioning.\n\nBelow is a closer look at the faces and stories behind just three of those arrested, and in some cases released, in connection with the protests.\n\nThe singer\n\nShervin Hajipour’s emotional song “Baraye,” which in English translates to “For…,” has been watched by millions across the globe.\n\nThe poignant two-and-a-half-minute ballad is based on tweets composed by Iranians expressing their anger and frustration with the government. Hajipour despondently sings about grievances that range from “for dancing in the street”, “for yearning for a normal life ” to “for the children who pick through the trash in search of their dreams.”\n\nThe young up-and-coming singer could not have expected just how much of an impact his song would have.\n\nHajipour posted the video of himself singing “Baraye” on Instagram on Tuesday September 27 and was arrested two days later. The song was viewed over 40 million times on his Instagram page before he took it down on the day of his arrest.\n\nFrom OfficialToomaj/Twitter\n\nThe 25-year-old singer was summoned to a police station over questioning for “encouragement to protest,” according to Iranian news agency Entekhab.\n\nIn the days following his detention, Hajipour deleted his Instagram page altogether, but his song had already gone viral and Iranians called upon each other to keep sharing the song to amplify his voice and, as a result, their grievances.\n\n“Baraye” soon became an anthem for the worldwide protests and rallies held on a day of solidarity dubbed “Freedom Rally for Iran.” On October 1, crowds of Iranians around the world in over 200 cities, including Melbourne, Tokyo, Brussels, Paris, London, Los Angeles and Toronto, marched through the streets with some people singing along to the lyrics of the song.\n\nPeople started calling for Hajipour’s song to be nominated for a Grammy in the “Best Song for Social Change” category. The newly created award “recognizes a song that has had profound social influence and impact,” and “that responds to the social issues of our time and has the potential for positive global impact,” according to the Recording Academy.\n\nOn Monday, “Baraye” received 95,000 of the 115,000 submissions for the new Grammy Award, according to a statement from the Recording Academy.\n\n“The Academy is deeply moved by the overwhelming volume of submissions for Shervin Hajipour’s ‘Baraye’ for our new Special Merit Award, Best Song for Social Change,” Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason Jr. said in a statement.\n\n“The Academy steadfastly supports freedom of expression and art that’s created to empower communities in need. Because music serves the world, and the Recording Academy exists to serve music.”\n\nThe singer was released on bail on October 4, according to state-aligned news agency Tasnim, and now faces charges of spreading propaganda against the regime and encouraging and inciting people to acts of violence, according to his attorney, Majid Kaveh. Hajipour’s sister posted on social media that her brother is at home spending time with his family.\n\n“I’m infinitely grateful for all your kindness towards me during this time,” the singer wrote the day he was released in a social media post on his newly re-activated Instagram. “I came to say that I am doing well.” Hajipour wrote about how he was disappointed that his song has become politicized.\n\n“I won’t be a puppet to the people who don’t care about me, you, and this country,” he wrote.\n\nA week later, Hajipour addressed fans in a video message on an Instagram post pleading Iranians to treat each other like family during these trying times. “After all, we are all from the same soil and blood … and I would like it if the authorities, particularly during these conditions, approach people, who are in similar situation like me, like parents do with their children,” he said.\n\nThe video message raised concerns among skeptical Iranians that Hajipour’s statement was forced by Iranian authorities because of an unidentified man sitting in the backseat of the car where he had recorded his video.\n\nIran’s Deputy Interior Minister for security and police Seyed Majid Mirahmadi rebuked these claims saying that ever since the singer’s release from detention, any videos and claims he’s made have been on his own accord, adding that “he was not forced to publish any videos of himself,” according to the country’s semi-official ISNA news agency.\n\nThe journalist\n\nThe Iranian journalist who broke the news of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini’s death is still under arrest and awaiting clarification on the charges made against her, according to her husband Mohammad Hossein Ajorloo.\n\nNiloofar Hamedi, a journalist at Shargh Daily newspaper in Tehran, was assigned to cover Amini’s story, Shargh Daily Community Editor Shahrzad Hemmati said in an op-ed.\n\nCovering the municipal beat, Hamedi went to Tehran’s Kasra hospital where Amini was being treated and where her family were gathered. She then tweeted a photo on her since-suspended Twitter account of Mahsa’s father and grandmother crying and embracing each other in the halls of the facility. Amini died that same day, September 16.\n\nFrom Zia Nabavi/Twitter\n\nA few days later, after protests broke out in outrage over Amini’s death, agents of Iran’s Ministry of Information raided Hamedi’s home and arrested her, saying they had a warrant for her arrest without providing further details, her husband Ajorloo explained on social media.\n\n“Although they showed us some papers, they did not allow us to read them,” Ajorloo said.\n\nThe agents searched the couple’s home and seized all their electronic devices, including mobile phones and laptops. “Contrary to the law, they did not hand over the second copy of the house inspection report to us,” Ajorloo explained.\n\nNiloofar was then taken to Evin Prison, where her husband said her case was being investigated. Tehran’s Evin Prison is a notoriously brutal facility where the regime incarcerates political dissidents and is exclusively designated for prisoners managed by Iran’s Intelligence Ministry.\n\nOn October 2, Ajorloo said his wife called him from prison to say that she was out of solitary confinement where she passed the time practicing yoga, but was not allowed to elaborate on her condition any further.\n\nOn her 13th day of incarceration, she told her husband that she was doing well, sharing a cell with eight other female detainees, he shared on social media.\n\nAjorloo says that he still has no information about his wife’s case and has no idea if or when she will be released.\n\n“The frequent calls from Shargh Daily newspaper readers to our editorial office inquiring about Niloofar’s well-being, how they get choked up on the phone line, is a sign that she was the voice of the people,” Shargh editor Hemmati said in her op-ed. Seemingly addressing a court judge she writes, “we are journalists Mr. Judge, allow us to fearlessly and without the fear of being labeled as political, with these laughable yet sad salaries, to be happy that we are relaying the people’s voice.”\n\nHemmati ends her piece by saying that journalists are waiting for the day when they can truly believe that they will not be threatened to tell the truth.\n\nIn recent days, Hamedi’s husband has started sharing intimate photos of the couple on his social media, speaking of his longing and concern for his wife.\n\n“Niloofar always says that we should take pictures of hardships so that we can remember how difficult it was to achieve happiness,” Ajorloo wrote in a tweet sharing a photo of what appears to be the pair camping. “This photo is one of those moments; The night before the climb up Sabalan [mountain], when Niloofar suffered altitude-sickness and I didn’t know what would happen tomorrow,” Ajorloo writes. “These days, however bitter and difficult, will pass, and the day of the great celebration of freedom is coming.\n\nنیلوفر همیشه میگه باید از سختی‌ها هم عکس بگیریم تا یادمون بمونه خوشی‌ها با چه مشقتی به دست اومده.\n\nاین عکس یکی از همون لحظاته؛ شب قبل از صعود سبلان که نیلوفر ارتفاع‌زده بود و نمی‌دونستم فردا چی میشه.\n\nاین روزها هم هرچند تلخ و سخت، می‌گذره و روز جشن بزرگ آزادی می‌رسه.#نیلوفر_حامدی pic.twitter.com/bo96fw7cYC — محمدحسین آجورلو (@mohamadhosein_2) October 11, 2022\n\nHamedi has been imprisoned in Evin prison for over 20 days, waiting alongside several other jailed journalists, activists and human rights lawyers who were arrested during the most recent protests.\n\nThe dissenter\n\nIranian security forces arrested a woman after a photo of her and another woman eating at a Tehran restaurant without their head scarves was widely circulated online, one of the women’s family members said in a statement.\n\nThe photo, which first emerged on social media on September 29, shows two women having breakfast at a type of cafe that, like most coffeehouses in Iran, is traditionally patronized by men.\n\nOne of the women in the photo, Donya Rad, was arrested shortly after the photo was published online. CNN spoke with her sister who said security agencies contacted Donya, summoning her to explain her actions.\n\nFrom Dina Rad/Twitter\n\n“After visiting the designated place she was arrested, after a few hours of no news, Donya told me in a short call that she was transferred to Ward 209 of Evin Prison,” her sister said in a post on social media.\n\nDonya’s sister tweeted that her sister was released from prison last Sunday, over a week after she was initially detained. “I am grateful to the friends who understood us and supported us,” she wrote.\n\nIn recent weeks, actions like this – in which women defy religious and cultural norms in Iran – are no longer isolated incidents.

He was then told that if he engaged in any more “activism” he and his family would be hunted down and arrested, he said.\n\nWhat Arman claims happened to him and those allegedly detained alongside him isn’t an isolated incident. Instead, it’s part of a tried and tested playbook used by the Iranian government to stalk, torture and imprison protesters, in an ongoing campaign to squash political dissent.\n\nArman, whose name has been changed for his safety, says he was tasered before being detained. Arman\n\nIn the months following Iran’s nationwide demonstrations in 2019, which were sparked by the government’s abrupt decision to increase the price of gas by 50% but snowballed into calls for the fall of the Islamic Republic and its leaders, widespread accounts of torture and thousands of arrests were documented.\n\nAs Iranians from all walks of life unite to fight for their civil rights – in protests first sparked by the death of a young woman in religious police custody last month – it appears to be happening again.\n\n“We are now in the worst time of our life. Full of stress. Full of fear,” a 24-year-old female protester told CNN. She says several of her friends were tortured – and that one of them was also sexually violated – after being detained by the IRGC in Rasht last month.\n\n“Nothing has happened to me yet and I was able to escape. But it is possible at any moment,” she explained during a video call about the incident, her face covered to protect her identity.\n\nCNN has spoken to almost a dozen Iranians who have shared first-hand accounts of torture in either the 2019 and 2022 protests, or who have had loved ones die or disappear while in the custody of authorities.\n\nSome of those impacted shared photographs documenting their injuries as well as court records detailing the criminal charges they’re facing; others shared only their stories, which CNN cannot independently verify.\n\nCNN contacted the Iranian government as well as its permanent mission to the United Nations regarding the accounts of torture and arbitrary detention detailed by protesters but has yet to receive a response.\n\nA group of people look out from what appears to be a security van in Tehran, as an officer stands nearby. Twitter\n\n‘There were rapes, torture’\n\nFarhad, a 37-year-old father-of-two, intimately understands the personal cost of speaking out against the Iranian government, but it hasn’t stopped him from joining the demonstrations which have continued for more than a month now and seem to transcend Iran’s social and ethnic divisions.\n\nIn the November 2019 protests, he says he watched several of his friends die on the streets of Tehran after being gunned down by security forces, in what would be a four-day nationwide rampage to silence dissent that ultimately left more than 300 civilians dead, according to Amnesty International.\n\nIt wasn’t until December 2, in the aftermath of the bloodshed, that Farhad says plain-clothes officers kicked down his door in the middle of the night to arrest him for his involvement in the demonstrations.\n\nFarhad, whose name has also been changed for his security, says the IRGC used footage of the protests from the BBC – which he has since shared with CNN – to identify him, effectively weaponizing the media coverage of the rallies to hunt down participants.\n\nIranian police patrol in the capital Tehran on October 8, 2022. Stringer/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHe claims he was tortured for 16 days in total and like Arman, that he knew the Tehran detention center in which he was being held was run by the IRGC because of a sign on one of its walls displaying its distinctive insignia.\n\nIn Farhad’s telling, several hundred people were detained and tortured alongside him. He still hears their screams.\n\n“Hundreds of people were imprisoned with me. There was a bed, people were being tied to it and abused. There were rapes, torture with electric shocks and boiling water … they were hanging people from the ceiling to beat them,” he told CNN.\n\nFarhad’s last memory from his time in that dark room is when he was hung up and beaten senseless by plain-clothes officers before being thrown in the back of a car, driven to an undisclosed location and dumped on the side of the road.\n\nDays later he woke up in a medical clinic near his house in Tehran, he said. He doesn’t know how he got there but cites an extended family member with links to Iran’s government as a possible reason his life was spared.\n\n“My teeth were broken; my lip was completely torn off. Because my bleeding was so severe, I [think] they did not expect me to survive.”\n\nCNN has reviewed photographs of Farhad’s injuries and the scarring he lives with today.\n\nFarjad has since left Tehran with his immediate family for their safety, but says he still receives late-night phone calls from Iranian authorities threatening to rape his wife and kill his children, and that his bank account is periodically frozen.\n\nHe also claims that in the months following his torture, his national identity card – the primary document used to access essential services in Iran – was wiped from the system.\n\nDespite the ongoing risks to his life and livelihood, Farhad’s commitment to the current demonstrations is unwavering.\n\n“My country and my people are suffering. The government of the Islamic Republic oppresses in the name of religion, I can’t see people [being] killed for their beliefs anymore,” he said.\n\nState-sponsored hackers\n\nCNN spoke with four more protesters who were tortured while in detention and later imprisoned for taking part in anti-government demonstrations in 2019 – including a young single mother who says she has had to place her son in the care of her parents in order to serve prison time, and a 43-year-old father of two from Shiraz who says he suffers from acute post-traumatic stress disorder, after spending 48 days in solitary confinement.\n\nTheir accounts all share striking similarities, most notably the ongoing harassment they say their families face from Iranian authorities via fake social media accounts, late-night phone calls, and local informants whom they believe monitor them for the IRGC intelligence service.\n\nAmin Sabeti is an Iranian cyber security expert who has spent years studying hacking groups with ties to the Islamic Republic, including the IRGC-affiliated ‘Charming Kitten’ group, which was recently sanctioned by the US government for “malicious cyber-enabled activities, including ransomware and cyber-espionage.”\n\nAccording to Sabeti, who is based in the UK, state-sponsored hackers have a tried and tested method in place to “dox protesters” once they’ve infiltrated their online groups using fake accounts, which involves “sharing photos of them on Twitter, Instagram or Telegram and asking others to share information about them,” while pretending to be concerned for their safety.\n\n“They used the same tactics in the November 2019 uprising,” Sabeti explained, which has led to more tech-savvy demonstrators identifying suspicious accounts and distributing warnings among their networks.\n\nA history of torture\n\nAt Tehran’s Ebrat Museum – a repurposed former prison – dramatic displays on the atrocities carried out against Muslim clerics by Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi’s police during the revolution have long been used as a propaganda tool to celebrate the “freedoms” won in the Islamic Republic.\n\nAnd yet, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei – who was himself imprisoned in the 1970s during Pahlavi’s reign – and his security apparatus, have a decades-long legacy of also using mass arrests and torture to control and silence political dissidents – the hypocrisy of which is not lost on protesters today.\n\nThe current movement – led and inspired by women – has united Iranians across generations, in what is shaping up to be the biggest threat the regime has faced to date. Notably, it has also survived weeks of rolling internet outages and violent crackdowns.\n\nBut as chants of “woman, life, freedom” continue – a rallying cry that’s come to encompass the daily violence and control Iranian women are rising up against – more than 1,000 people have been arrested, according to state news IRNA.\n\nPeople gather next to a burning motorcycle in Tehran amid the protests on October 8. Stringer/AFP/Getty Images\n\nLooking ahead, analysts and exiled activists CNN spoke to are fearful that the authorities will ultimately employ whatever violent tactics they deem necessary to once again, regain some semblance of control.\n\nAlready, almost two dozen children – some as young as 11 – were killed by Iran’s security forces during demonstrations in September, according to Amnesty International, in a chilling reminder that no life will be spared. Meanwhile, Iran’s Education Minister Yousef Nouri confirmed last week that student protesters are now being detained in what he termed “psychological institutions,” run by the state.\n\nNone of the Iranians CNN spoke with were naive to the fact that their lives – and the lives of their families – are on the line as the uprising rages on, with most going to extreme lengths to protect their personal information online and avoid unnecessary risks while taking to the streets.\n\nArman still receives threatening phone calls and messages for his activism, but he says he won’t be deterred.\n\n“They torture us, and they are lying to the world, to the international community … Iranians want freedom,” he said. “We don’t want dictatorship.

Women have burned their scarves and cut their hair, protesters have been injured and arrested, and as many as 17 people have been killed. Despite the violent crackdown from Iranian security forces, demonstrations have continued in at least 13 cities for days.\n\nIran has dealt with multiple waves of protests, but the demonstrations over Amini's death are unique, said Tara Sepehri Far, a senior researcher in the Middle East and North Africa division at Human Rights Watch.\n\nMany have come to see Amini's death as symbolic of the country's heavy-handed response to dissent, the laws restricting women's rights and the morality police's increasingly violent treatment of young women.\n\nWhile burning of the hijab is not unprecedented, the intense outcry across the country is seemingly a remarkable moment of defiance by women seeking to gain more autonomy, Sepehri Far told USA TODAY.\n\n\"Them doing it collectively as an act of defiance, it has forever moved the debate forward,\" she said. \"For brief moments, the city experienced defiance of women without hijab, the imagination that was once impossible for many people became reality.\"\n\nWHAT TO KNOW:How will Iran respond next to protests over Mahsa Amini's death?\n\nMAHSA AMINI'S DEATH:Protesters take to the streets as security forces crack down\n\nAmini died three days after being detained Sept. 13 after being accused of violating the country's dress codes by not properly covering her hair with a headscarf or hijab. She collapsed at a detention center, fell into a coma and died three days later, the United Nations said in a statement.\n\nPolice said she died of a heart attack, but her family has accused authorities of lying, which has sparked public skepticism over the cause of her death.\n\nIn a statement, Nada Al-Nashif, the acting United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, expressed alarm over her death as well as the \"allegations of torture and ill treatment,\" and \"the violent response\" to protests.\n\n\"The authorities must stop targeting, harassing and detaining women who do not abide by the hijab rules,\" she said.\n\nThe widespread participation of men has also set the protests apart, she said.\n\n\"This is probably the first time in recent memory that people have come to street in masses in demand of a very clear issue of women's rights,\" Sepehri Far said.\n\n\"The public understands this issue is not an isolated incident.\"\n\nSupport for mandatory hijab declines as protest emerge\n\nIran has a long history of trying to control what women can wear, said Firoozeh Kashani-Sabet, a professor of modern Middle Eastern history at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Reza Shah Pahlavi banned the hijab and all kinds of Islamic veils, a decree that was met with resistance and led to discrimination against women who chose to remain veiled, she said.\n\nShortly after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini took power during the 1979 Iranian revolution, the hijab became mandatory and the morality police were tasked with enforcing that and other restrictions. Women's rights can often become a government's target, especially in moments of distress, Kashani-Sabet said.\n\n\"Trying to wield authority over women in particular, unfortunately, can sometimes become a way of expressing power,\" she said.\n\nSepehri Far said the mandatory hijab is more than just a dress code – it affects \"every aspect of a woman's life\" including education, employment and ability to run for office.\n\nINSIDE IRAN:Most women must live as second-class citizens, but some are making strides\n\nThere have been several waves of protests in recent years against the mandatory hijab, including the \"White Wednesday\" and \"My Stealthy Freedom\" campaigns launched by activist Masih Alinejad, which encouraged women to post images and videos of themselves without headscarves on social media.\n\nIn 2017, dozens of women removed their headscarves in protest. Many were arrested while protesting the law as a social media campaign gained steam online.\n\nAbout half of Iranians in 2014 said they believed the government should not be allowed to dictate what women wear, according to a study recently published by the Center for Strategic Studies, part of the Iranian president's office.\n\n\"The criticism against this policy is increasing by day, and I think the support is very visibly diminishing, even according to government statements and stats,\" Sepehri Far said.\n\nIt's important to acknowledge that not everyone is against wearing the hijab. But, Kashani-Sabet said, \"it's high time that women are given options, women are given the freedom of choice in matters of dress.\"\n\nMany Muslim women choose to wear the hijab for religious and personal reasons and have fought against being forced to remove them, particularly in Western countries. About 4 in 10 Muslim women in America said they always wear hijab in public, a percentage that has remained steady over the past decade, according to a study from Pew Research Center in 2017.\n\nWho are the 'morality police'?\n\nThe morality police have existed in some form for at least 20 years, but in 2019. they reorganized and began to use \"reeducation centers,\" said Hadi Ghaemi, executive director of the New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran.\n\n\"They take a woman there and treat them like criminals by taking mugshots and making a record of them, contacting the male member of their family ... and then they give them about a one hour course supposedly on how to wear a proper hijab,\" Ghaemi said. \"At the end of the day, it's mass surveillance of woman in public space.\"\n\nGhaemi said it is \"extremely common\" for women, and sometimes men, to be stopped and questioned by the morality police even if they are not taken to the reeducation centers. What is considered \"improperly\" wearing hijab can be arbitrary, he added.\n\nIn Tehran, where Amini was visiting family, police have said they would stop arresting women they determined have breached Islamic values and adopt this more educational approach. But Sepehri Far said calling the detention centers \"reeducation centers\" is a rhetorical attempt to reduce friction between the public and the people, not a true loosening of restrictions.\n\nShe said the morality or guidance police have been trying to use private businesses and traffic cameras to find women not properly wearing the hijab. The United Nations human rights office said in a statement on Amini's death that the police had stepped up patrols and have been recorded slapping, beating and shoving women into police vehicles.\n\nSepehri Far said punishments can range from a fine to up to two months of detention.\n\n\"It's still very much a law-enforcement-led initiative because you are arrested and detained,\" she said. \"It's not uncommon to talk to women who have experienced this multiple times.\"\n\nKashani-Sabet, from the University of Pennsylvania, said it's unclear how many people work for the morality police and how many young women are subject to arrests and violence.\n\n\"Part of what makes it effective is just this belief that they're omnipresent, omniscient...and they have this extraordinary power,\" she said.\n\n'No one forced me to dress this way':Hijab becomes symbol of resistance, feminism in the age of Trump\n\nProtests over Amini's death 'changed the equation'\n\nPart of what makes the protests in the wake of Amini's death different is the widespread participation of men, Sepehri Far and Ghaemi said.\n\nIt's also significant that protests are occurring in the country's capital, Tehran, which has not seen such widespread demonstrations since economic unrest in 2009, Sepehri Far said.\n\nSecurity forces have responded to the mostly peaceful protests with unlawful use of metal pellets, tear gas, water cannons and beatings with batons, according to Amnesty International.\n\nHundreds have been injured. An anchor on Iran’s state television suggested last week that the death toll could be as high as 17, but did not say how he reached that figure.\n\nThe U.S. government imposed sanctions on the morality police and leaders of other Iranian security forces, saying they “routinely employ violence to suppress peaceful protesters.” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen called on the Iranian government “to end its violence against women and its ongoing violent crackdown on free expression and assembly.”\n\nThere was also near-total disruption of internet access Monday in parts of the Kurdistan province in western Iran and regional blackouts elsewhere, including Tehran, according to internet watchdog Netblocks. Access to Instagram and WhatsApp have been restricted across the country as well as a \"nation-scale shutdown of mobile networks,\" which will likely make it more difficult for people to organize protest and share information, the organization said.\n\nINSIDE IRAN'S RESPONSE: What's next for protesters?\n\nCNN’s chief international anchor, Christiane Amanpour, who is British-Iranian, said she had planned to ask Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi in New York about the protests in what would have been his first U.S.-based interview, but Raisi did not show up after she refused to wear a headscarf.\n\nSepehri Far and Ghaemi expressed concern that the crackdown could get worse. Even if the government does not adhere to the protesters' demands, the experts said, the domestic pressure has already influenced the conversation around women's rights.\n\n\"They have changed the equation,\" Ghaemi said. \"The Islamic Republic is very much on the defense.\"\n\nMORE:USA TODAY journalist gets rare glimpse of life in Iran, whose history with US is marked by decades of animosity\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nContact Breaking News Reporter N'dea Yancey-Bragg at nyanceybra@gannett.com or follow her on Twitter @NdeaYanceyBragg", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/24/middleeast/mahsa-amini-death-iran-internet-un-investigation-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Mahsa Amini death: Iran restricts internet as protest deaths mount ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIranian authorities say they will restrict internet access in the country until calm is restored to the streets, as protests over the death of a young woman in the custody of the morality police rock the Islamic Republic.\n\nThousands of Iranians have taken to the streets in protest since the death last week of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who was apprehended in Tehran and taken to a “re-education center,” apparently for not wearing her hijab properly.\n\nSince Friday, demonstrations have taken place in at least 40 cities nationwide, including the capital Tehran, with protesters demanding an end to violence and discrimination against women as well as an end to compulsory wearing of the hijab.\n\nAt least 1,200 have been arrested in connection to the protests, Iranian state-backed news agency Tasmin reported Saturday, citing a security official.\n\nDozens of protesters have reportedly been killed in the resulting clashes with security forces.\n\nCNN cannot independently verify the death toll – a precise figure is impossible for anyone outside the Iranian government to confirm – and different estimates have been given by opposition groups, international rights organizations and local journalists.

For weeks, a nationwide protest movement has relentlessly gathered momentum and appears to have blunted the government’s decades-old intimidation tactics.

But experts say that these protests transcend Iran’s many social and ethnic divisions, breaking a decades-old barrier of fear and posing an unprecedented threat to the regime.\n\nAcross Iran, protesters seem intent on exposing the weaknesses of a clerical establishment which is widely accused of corruption and has stamped out dissent with arbitrary detentions and even mass executions.\n\nTehran has been convulsing with demonstrations since the death in mid-September of Mahsa (also known as Zhina) Amini, the 22-year-old Kurdish-Iranian woman who died after being detained by the country’s morality police for how she was dressed.\n\nProtests crop up sporadically in various parts of the capital throughout each day. At night, a chant that has become a staple of the protests — “death to the dictator” — sounds from the rooftops of buildings. It’s a reference to Khamenei, who was once considered beyond reproach because of his elevated clerical status.\n\nDemonstrators gather around a burning barricade during a protest for Mahsa Amini, who died after being arrested by the Islamic Republic's \"morality police,\" in Tehran on September 19, 2022.

Let me assure you,” a protester from Tehran’s prestigious Sharif University of Technology told CNN, referring to Iranian police who had violently cracked down on demonstrators on campus, and detained scores of young people.\n\nSocial media video showed cars filling the streets shortly after news spread Sunday of the crackdown on students, horns blaring in solidarity with protesters as the showdown unfolded at the university, known for educating Iran’s best and brightest students.\n\n“If the dust settles and we stop protesting, they are going to kill even more of us. They are going to detain even more people and they are going to turn us to North Korea,” the impassioned protester said. “This is not the end. I promise you that.”\n\nCNN has not been able to independently verify the number of the dead and injured, but state media says 40 people have died since the start of demonstrations in mid-September. Rights group Amnesty International says at least 52 have been killed. Over 1,000 people are believed to have been detained, including journalists and artists.\n\nProtesters chant slogans during a protest over the death of Mahsa Amini in downtown Tehran, Iran, September 21, 2022. AP\n\nLast week, Amnesty International said it had obtained a leaked document which appeared to instruct commanders of armed forces in all provinces to “mercilessly confront” protesters, deploying riot police as well as some members of the military’s elite Revolutionary guards, the Basij paramilitary force and plainclothes security agents.\n\nCNN has not seen the leaked documents obtained by Amnesty International and cannot verify the reporting. CNN has reached out to Amnesty International on how it received the leaked documents but hasn’t received a reply.\n\nCNN has also reached out to Iranian government officials for a comment on Amnesty International’s reporting but hasn’t received a reply.\n\nIn addition, Amnesty International said it had seen evidence of sexual assault against female protesters – CNN has not been able to verify this. Social media video has also shown Iranian security forces dragging unveiled women through the streets by their hair.\n\nAn existential threat\n\nThe threat posed by these protests, analysts say, is existential to the regime, and is one of the biggest challenges the Islamic Republic has faced in years.\n\n“These are primarily very, very young people, a younger generation who have apparently completely lost faith that this Islamic Republic can be reformed,” said Trita Parsi, executive vice-president at the Washington, DC-based Quincy Institute.\n\n“They’re breaking from their previous generation who was seeking to reform the system from within,” Parsi added. “This new generation seems to not have any faith in that at all.”\n\nThe 83-year-old Khamenei, who commented on the protests for the first time on Monday, blamed – without evidence – the United States and Israel for fueling the protests. He also made clear that the regime would block the protesters’ desire for change.\n\nA protester holds a portrait of Mahsa Amini during a demonstration in her support in front of the Iranian embassy in Brussels on September 23, 2022. Kenzo Tribouillard/AFP/Getty Images\n\n“I say clearly that these riots and the insecurity were engineered by the US and the occupying, false Zionist regime (Israel), as well as their paid agents, with the help of some traitorous Iranians abroad,” said Khamenei in his address.\n\nThe current protests may eventually be quashed or simply lose momentum, but analysts say Iran can expect another cycle of nationwide demonstrations in months to come. The latest demonstrations follow similar, but less widespread, protests against the government in 2019, 2017 and 2009.\n\n“The protests transcend social sectarian boundaries, bringing together a much broader strata of Iranian society than we have seen in years,” said Ali Vaez, director of the International Crisis Group’s Iran Project. “But they suffer from the same shortcomings that the previous movements in Iran also suffered from. Primarily, the lack of leadership.\n\n“It’s very difficult to be able to maintain and sustain a movement that over the long run will bring the regime to its knees without coordination and leadership,” Vaez said.\n\nStill, the protesters appear bolder than ever, sensing a window of opportunity that could quickly close as Iran appears to near development of a nuclear weapon, which would both entrench the regime’s grip on power and deepen its isolation.\n\nThis is the scenario that anti-regime Iranians are trying desperately to avoid, said Vaez.\n\n“The only thing worse than a regime that kills and represses its own people is a regime with a nuclear weapon and that kills and represses its own people,” he said.", "authors": ["Jomana Karadsheh Tamara Qiblawi", "Jomana Karadsheh", "Tamara Qiblawi"], "publish_date": "2022/10/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/03/middleeast/iran-protests-sharif-university-crackdown-intl/index.html", "title": "Iranian security forces beat, shot and detained students of elite ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWhen Farid’s friend called crying for help on Sunday, he jumped on his bike and quickly rode to Tehran’s Sharif University.\n\n“Please come save us. We are stuck here. They are shooting at us,” his friend said.\n\nScenes of violence and “savagery” met him when he arrived at the campus of the elite university, he said, where hundreds of students had been trapped in the parking lot by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps, according to videos CNN verified from social media.\n\n“They had guns, they had paintball guns, they had batons,” said Farid, whose name has been changed for his safety.\n\n“They were using gases… [that are] banned internationally… it was a war zone… there was blood everywhere.”\n\nIn one video posted to social media from the scene, police can be seen detaining people and carrying them on motorbikes. In another, loud bangs are heard.\n\nIt was the first day of school, but many students had refused to join class. Instead, they were protesting against the regime, in a nationwide movement triggered by the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old who passed away last month in a hospital after being apprehended by Iran’s morality police and sent to a “re-education center” for not abiding by the state’s hijab laws.\n\nFor more than two weeks, protests have taken place in more than 45 cities across Iran, including the capital, with dozens of people reportedly killed in clashes with security forces.\n\nCNN cannot independently verify claims of arrests or detentions as a precise number of protesters arrested or detained is impossible for those outside Iran’s government to confirm. Numbers vary depending on whether they come from opposition groups, international rights organizations, or local journalists. State media outlet the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) reported that at least 41 people have died in Iran in recent protests. According to Amnesty International, the crackdown has killed at least 52 people and injured hundreds more.\n\nWhile the rallies started with calls for justice for Amini’s death, they have since morphed into a larger movement, uniting an array of social factions and classes.\n\nFarid said that Sunday’s incident began after a group of students were reprimanded by campus security – who called in reinforcements – for staging a walkout and engaging in anti-regime chants.\n\n“It started with the students refusing to go to class. And then the (professor) of science came to talk to them because they were chanting stuff… the students were led out by the security forces of the university, and they were then stopped by Sepahs (IRGC forces), wearing normal people’s clothing,” Farid told CNN.\n\n“They told them that ‘if you go near the subway station, we will start shooting, go back to the university.’ And then after half of the students got back into the university, they let the others into the parking lot. And after that, they started shooting them with paint balls and taking them into custody in a very, very savage way,” he added.\n\nThe university’s official newspaper, the Sharif Daily, also reported that security forces fired less-lethal rounds at large groups of students in the campus parking lot while they attempted to flee from security forces on Sunday. Social media videos reviewed by CNN captured the incident.\n\nThe “three main dormitories” of the Sharif University were also “shot at” by security forces, according to Farid, who claimed that there are still students hiding out at the university following Sunday night’s events.\n\n“As we speak, there are still students hidden in the university in the parking lots or in professors’ rooms,” he told CNN.\n\n“We don’t have a tally [of detainees] yet. The Student Council was trying to make a tally, but we won’t know for sure for another five, six hours.”\n\nCiting a source at the university, Iranian state news agency IRNA said Monday that 30 of the 37 students arrested during the protests had been released.\n\nCNN cannot independently verify what happened during the confrontations at Sharif University or the number of students detained in the aftermath. Representatives from Sharif University could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nIn a statement Monday, the Sharif University Students Islamic Association urged all “professors and students at Sharif University not to attend classes until all arrested students are released” while calling on students and professors across Iran to pause classes in solidarity.\n\nSnippets of that ongoing solidarity have already been seen in the Iranian capital, where video posted to social media shows a line of cars blocking the streets near Sharif University on Sunday night in support of the students.\n\nThe nationwide protests – which bring together a combination of grievances over a floundering economy, limited civil rights and the marginalization of ethnic minorities – are the most significant domestic threat the Iranian regime has faced in years.\n\nToday’s protests are also bringing together younger Iranians with internet access who haven’t known Iran before the Islamic Republic.\n\nIt’s unlikely that the government – which has blamed Western media for instigating the protests – will make concessions, analysts say, with an end of the demonstrations more likely to come through the use of brute force.\n\nBut Farid insists he and his contemporaries are not scared, saying they have nothing to lose.\n\n“This is far from over. We are not scared. We are outraged. We are furious. You know, these people think that we are the previous generation – that if they do this, we’re gonna just stop. We are not going to stop,” he said.\n\n“These kids are our future,” Farid added. “We’re not going to stand for this.”", "authors": ["Teele Rebane Hannah Ritchie Jomana Karadsheh Kara Fox", "Teele Rebane", "Hannah Ritchie", "Jomana Karadsheh", "Kara Fox"], "publish_date": "2022/10/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/20/middleeast/iran-police-death-protests-mahsa-amini-intl/index.html", "title": "Mahsa Amini: Five people killed in Iran in protests over death of ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFive people have been killed by Iranian security forces during protests that were sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini, who was being held in police custody, according to a human rights monitor.\n\nHengaw Organization for Human Rights, a Norwegian-registered organization monitoring rights violations in Iran, said five people were fatally shot during demonstrations in Iran’s Kurdish region over the past few days.

If the thought of acquiring a costume has you quaking with fear, take a deep breath because Google has your back. Google Trends just released its second annual Frightgeist, which compiles the most-searched Halloween costumes of 2022. You can view the most-searched Halloween costumes by state, as well as based on parameters such as \"spookiness level.\"\n\n►Related: Google Trends' FrightGeist lists the most popular Halloween costumes of 2022.

Sign up for our newsletter to get all the best gift guides, deals and holiday planning advice.\n\nPopular Halloween costumes of 2022\n\n1. Witch\n\nComing out on the top of the list is the witch costume, the most classic and perhaps the spookiest costume. With their pointed hats, black clothing and wands, a witch costume is very identifiable even if you don’t paint your skin green. No matter the details of your particular costume, you'll be representing a classic archetype that's sure to cast a spell on all who dare cross your path. If you so desire, your dog can be part of the witching fun, as well.\n\n2. Spider-Man\n\nSpider-Man, Spider-Man, does whatever a Spider-Man can, including climbing to the second spot on the most-searched Halloween list. It makes sense, as what the costume lacks in scariness it more than makes up for in how iconic the character is. He's one of the world's most popular superheroes and since he's had a blockbuster movie come out in the past year, it's no wonder that our Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man has been a trending Halloween costume. Spider-Man is a surprisingly versatile costume due to the many variants of the character and his suit — the symbiote suit, Miles Morales' suit, Spider-Gwen, Spider-Woman and the Iron Spider are just a few costumes to consider if you want to go with something other than the classic, red, black and blue costume.\n\n3. Dinosaur\n\nMove over werewolves, there's a new beast in town—the dinosaur. Topping the animal list and ranking high above any traditional monster, it seems that when it comes to scariness, the dinosaur reigns supreme this year. Perhaps it's because the extinct saurian stomped through the screen in this summer’s Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. One of the most popular dinosaur costumes is an inflatable T-rex from Rubie's — just make sure you don't puncture it. Dinosaurs also make for a popular costume for toddlers, too.\n\n4. Stranger Things\n\nThe fourth entry is simply listed as \"Stranger Things,\" the hit show which recently aired its fourth season in two volumes earlier this year. As Stranger Things is a horror show, it's no wonder that costumes of its characters and creatures are a popular choice for the holiday that celebrates all things that go bump in the night. While \"Stranger Things\" is a bit broad, this means that you have several options when it comes to what you want your costume to be. Do you want it to be a more low-key costume? In that case, you can dress up as Eleven. But if you really want to bring the spook for Halloween, you can wear a terrifying Vecna mask.\n\n5. Fairy\n\nThe fairy is a decidedly cute costume, though, you can always put a more frightening spin on the fae. With the possibility of adding elf ears, tiaras, wings and copious amounts of pixie dust, if you put time into it, this is a costume that can really shine if you're looking to win a competition. This is another popular costume for kids, particularly if you're going for Tinkerbell's look.\n\n6. Pirate\n\nWhile Frightgeist lists \"pirate\" as a profession, we don't recommend adding \"piracy\" to your resume. What we do recommend is getting a pirate costume for Halloween. Peg legs, eyepatches, hook hands, feather caps, bandanas and striped shirts are just a few ways to convey that you're a dastardly dog of the sea looking for treasure, which in your case is probably candy.\n\n7. Rabbit\n\nThe rabbit is a deceptively versatile costume. At first glance, there's nothing scary about a cuddly bunny rabbit at all and the corresponding costumes. Other costumes, however, turn the concept of the rabbit on its head with decidedly frightening costumes, such as ones that depict the character \"Frank\" from the 2001 cult classic, Donnie Darko.\n\n8. Cheerleader\n\nDoes the cheerleader make for such a popular Halloween costume because it reminds us of watching in horror as a favorite sports team loses a game? Probably not. It's probably because a cheerleader costume is easily identifiable while still being customizable. Still, there is something decidedly something eerie about being able to cheer in the face of your team's certain doom...\n\n9. Cowboy\n\nIf Frightgeist is anything to go by, the playground dream of dressing up as Woody and Jess is coming alive. Cowboys are a great costume if you're a fan of westerns, history, Toy Story or just wearing tall boots and a hat you can tip. Trust us, you'll look cool doing it.\n\n10. Harley Quinn\n\nAt number 10, we have another comic book character, the infamous supervillain Harley Quinn. Introduced as The Joker's henchman and becoming an independent character in her own right, Harley Quinn beats out both Batman and generic clown costume searches. Perhaps the trends reflect the third season of her show that came out earlier this year, or the reveal that Lady Gaga will play her in the upcoming Joker sequel. Either way, this clown makes for a great costume.\n\nMake holiday shopping easy with help from our experts.

According to the National Retail Federation's annual 2021 Halloween spending survey, around $3 billion is expected to be spent on candy this year, with $10 billion expected to be spent on all things Halloween.\n\nThat may seem like enough money to make sure only the best candy ends up in our hands. If people needed ideas, or were curious, as to which ones to buy, America has spoken when it comes to the most and least popular candy in the country.\n\nFrom Hot Tamales to Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, as well as the ever-lasting debate on candy corn, here is what the country had to say, according to CandyStore.com.\n\nWhat is the most popular candy?\n\nCandy Store has been delivering and distributing bulk orders of candy across the country since 2007. Using their sales data since then for the time period before Halloween, they determined which candy was the most popular with the winner being: Reese's Cups.\n\nHere are the top 10 candies in America, according to CandyStore.com:\n\nReese's Cups Skittles M&M's Starburst Hot Tamales Sour Patch Kids Hershey Kisses Snickers Tootsie Pops Candy corn\n\nWhich candy won the most states?\n\nCandy Store also used the data to determine the most popular candy in each state.\n\nA total of 19 different candies got the top vote across the country, and while Reese's Peanut Butter Cups is the overall top candy, it didn't win the most states.\n\nThat title actually belongs to Starbursts and Sour Patch Kids, each being the top candy of choice for six states. Starburst was the most popular candy in Alabama, Idaho, Indiana, Michigan, South Dakota and Texas. Sour Patch Kids was the most popular candy in Alaska, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Nebraska and New York.\n\nIn second place was Reese's and M&M's with five states each, followed by Tootsie Pops which was the most popular in four states.\n\nWhat is the 'best' candy?\n\nThis title differs from the most popular candy in that this contest used a voting system. To determine the best and worst candies ever, Candy Store used rankings from multiple websites, as well as surveying over 17,000 people on their favorite candies.\n\nCandy Store then used a point system where a candy voted No. 1 received 10 points, voted No. 2 received nine points and so on. Collectively, the best candy is also the most popular – Reese's Peanut Butter Cups.\n\nHere are the top 10:\n\nReese's Cups M&M's Skittles Snickers Sour Patch Kids Kit Kat Twix Hershey Bar Butterfinger Nerds\n\nWhat is the 'worst' candy?\n\nThe war on candy corn rages on.\n\nDespite being the 10th most popular candy in the U.S., candy corn was voted as the worst candy of all time.

Purchases you make through our links may earn us a commission.\n\nHalloween is going to look a little different this year. We won't—or at least shouldn't—be crowding around at costume parties or going door to door asking strangers and neighbors for candy. But it doesn't mean you can't dress up to celebrate social distance-style. No matter what your plans are this Hallow's Eve, it's absolutely worth it to invest in a festive costume that's bound to raise your (haunted) spirits. We've rounded up the best places to shop for costumes online that'll fit every budget and niche taste in historical references and pop culture.\n\n1. Walmart\n\nPrices: $\n\nSizes: S to X\n\nReturn/exchange policy: 90 days\n\nWalmart makes it as easy to shop for your Halloween costumes as they do household items. All costume styles are broken down into 25 categories on the left-side navigation bar, like Harry Potter, zombie or pirate costumes. The top gallery features additional sections like adult, group and even dog costumes.\n\n2. Target\n\nPrices: $\n\nSizes: XS to 2X\n\nReturn/exchange policy: 90 days\n\nIt’s almost as if the Target website should pivot to selling strictly Halloween costumes—that’s how comprehensive their selection and navigational tools are. First select from a panel of categories like couples, men’s, or women’s costumes, and then choose from more narrower selections like scary, funny, or princess storybook costumes. Narrow down even further by choosing between, say, insect animal and team mascot in the women’s jumpsuit costume section, for example.\n\n3. Amazon\n\nPrices: $$\n\nSizes: Varies by brand\n\nReturn/exchange policy: 30 days\n\nShopping for Halloween costumes on Amazon can be a little overwhelming given that there are over 100,000 search results for Halloween costumes. But not to worry! To narrow down your search, select from men’s, women’s, and kid’s costumes (and more) on the left-hand side. Then browse as you normally would on Amazon, searching by star rating, price range, brand, and popularity.\n\n4. Etsy\n\nPrices: $$$\n\nSizes: XXS to 5X\n\nReturn/exchange policy: Varies by brand\n\nEtsy is your destination for all things a little artsy and off-the-beaten-path. The same rings true for their Halloween costume selection, which is both accessible (if you’re looking for a traditional outfit) and niche (if you’re looking to inspire people to think about what exactly you’re dressed up as). When you search for Halloween costumes, narrow it down via women, men, baby, toddler, pet costumes, and more. Then search by price, size, color and theme.\n\n5. Disney\n\nPrices: $$\n\nSizes: XS to 2X\n\nReturn/exchange policy: 30 days\n\nDisney fans rejoice—you can dress up as all your favorite characters thanks to the wide range of customers available at Disney's online store. Not only can you filter your options by size or price but you can also browse by movie or franchise (like Marvel or Pixar). There are costumes for kids, adults, pets, and even the whole family or a group of friends.\n\n6. Party City\n\nPrices: $$\n\nSizes: XS to 3X\n\nReturn/exchange policy: 30 days\n\nFor a comprehensive selection of costumers, look no further than Party City. Under Halloween costumes, you’ll see narrower categories like plus-size, adult, kids and more. Below, you can shop by theme and top-rated options. The retailer really hones in on their pop culture offerings, and as such, you can search by character, like Captain America or Peter Pan.\n\n7. HalloweenCostumes.com\n\nPrices: $$\n\nSizes: XS to XL, XS to 6X\n\nReturn/exchange policy: 30 days\n\nLike its name suggests, you’re—surprise, surprise—getting a really varied selection of Halloween costumes here. Right from the top, they offer a choice of adult, kids, group costumes and more. Scroll down, and you’ll see even narrower categories with bright and beautiful images that give you a sense of their aesthetic right away. Pick your category, and you can then choose from their dozens of themes, like celebrity or sports costumes.\n\n8. Spirit Halloween\n\nPrices: $$$\n\nSizes: XS to 2X\n\nReturn/exchange policy: 14 days\n\nEasy to navigate and even easier to find what you’re looking for, Spirit Halloween is a prime destination for all your spooky party needs. In their costume section, you have the option of selecting from standard categories on the left-hand navigation bar like women’s and plus size costumes, and if you’re more of a visual creature, select from their collage of the same. You’ll then be greeted with even more categories to choose from like occupations and animals. Don’t be sticker spooked if you find their costumes to sell for well over $100—sort by price and you’ll find a great festive option for $50 or less.\n\n9. Overstock\n\nPrices: $$\n\nSizes: XS to 2X\n\nReturn/exchange policy: 30 days\n\nOverstock doesn’t have a ton of categories to choose from, and that’s what makes it a pleasant experience to shop for Halloween costumes there. They still have a vast enough selection to allow you to browse via category on the left-hand side (to the tune of 17 pages’ worth of costumes), like Marvel, Star Wars and Walking Dead. What’s interesting is that you can shop by care instructions. If dry cleaning is out of your budget, for example, you know to opt for something that can be machine or hand washed.\n\n10. Wholesale Halloween Costumes\n\nPrices: $\n\nSizes: XS to 3X\n\nReturn/exchange policy: 30 days\n\nAs the most budget-friendly option of the bunch, you won’t have to sacrifice a great time with Wholesale Halloween Costumes’ selection. The front page lets you navigate via age group, brand (think Disney and Star Wars), major categories like animals, and new releases. If you search by age group, they’ll give you the option to dive into their most popular categories, as well as entire costumes under $20.\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.

Or so they said of the creation, which comes in a can decorated with a hellish scene of fireballs and caution tape.\n\nAfter a brief testing period where the drink sold out in one day, it's now widely available online and in big box retailers across the country.\n\nBefore the rollout was unveiled, I was lucky enough (or unlucky enough) to score a can to review. It arrived at my house along with an oversized tie-die shirt sporting a Grim Reaper cartoon and the message, \"Let's go down in flames together.\" The shirt is a partnership between Mountain Dew and the clothing brand Broken Promises, which has an entire line of Mountain Dew themed clothing products.\n\nBut enough about that, I know you only have one question on your mind.\n\nHere's your ultimate burrito bucket list:25 must-try burros across Arizona\n\nWhat does Mountain Dew Flamin' Hot taste like?\n\nI poured the Mountain Dew into a stemless wine glass and I was struck by its screaming orange color. It's almost like they took orange soda and threw in a little grenadine to make it a touch darker.\n\nThe drink had that familiar Mountain Dew smell of cleaning products and artificial lime juice, but I detected no spicy notes to the nose.\n\nOn my first sip, I expected a pummel of red hot fire that would wreak havoc on my tastebuds. But my first thought? This tastes just like Mountain Dew.\n\nThere was a little tingle, an afterthought of burn. My first inclination was to look at the ingredients to see if there were any chiles at all in there. I am not a scientist, but I didn't see anything on the label that resembled a pepper. Although, to be fair, peppers aren't an ingredient in Flamin' Hot Cheetos either.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the soda is mostly made up of carbonated water, high fructose corn syrup and citric acid.\n\nQuite surprisingly, I was disappointed in the drink's lack of heat. One online reviewer claims that the drink made them feel like they had a sore throat, and I tend to agree. It's almost like they threw some Tajin in a ginger ale and called it a day.\n\nBelieve the hype:This Phoenix restaurant really is one of the best in America\n\nNutrition facts\n\nA 16-ounce can of Mountain Dew Flamin' Hot has 220 calories and 58 grams of added sugars, which is 117% of the recommended daily intake. It has 59 grams of carbohydrates, which is 22% of your daily value.\n\nThe drink contains 72 mg of caffeine, which is still much lower than your average cup of coffee.\n\nThe things I do for you:Our dining critic tried a Taco Bell Crispy Chicken Sandwich Taco.

Netflix series goes out with a bang", "text": "If you Google “Ozark” and “Season 4 Part 2” you find results that include things like “who dies next?”\n\nIt's a fair question. This is the end, after all, as the series, about the Byrde family, which moved from Chicago to the Ozarks to launder money for a drug cartel, finishes its run. You won’t find out who dies here, or even if anyone does.\n\nBut c’mon, it is “Ozark.”\n\nFans of the show know that things typically get wild from the start and only get wilder from there. The fourth season was split into two parts; the first half began with the Byrde family in a rollover accident in their van, then circled back to all kinds of chaotic action.\n\nBut the second half of Season 4 begins at a more leisurely pace, at least for “Ozark.”\n\nThe Byrdes are trying to go legit. Good luck with that\n\nMarty Byrde (Jason Bateman, who also directs several episodes) and his wife Wendy (Laura Linney) are trying to sort out the deal they made with the FBI and with cartel leader Omar Navarro (the outstanding Felix Solis) as the final part of the final season begins.\n\nIt’s a mess, of course, because everything about the Byrdes' lives is a mess; the show has always been a kind of puzzle, an exercise in Houdini-like escapes from trouble and seeming certain death.\n\nThere’s also the matter of Ruth (the great Julia Garner, who has won two Emmys in the role), who is mad with grief and anger over the death of her cousin Wyatt and wants revenge. Garner is magnetic — the show is always a few ticks better every time she enters a scene. A friend of Ruth’s calls her a “redneck success story,” and she is that, but so much more.\n\nRuth for president. Ruth for everything. The world might be a better place.\n\nMight be.\n\nThe women in the story gain power throughout the last seven episodes. One character says of Wendy that she no longer has a soul, and that’s not far off. Her desire to get her foundation off the ground, to become a political kingmaker in the Midwest and get the family out of the cartel’s clinches eclipse all else for her. And Linney plays it ice cold.\n\nThe power dynamic shifts to women in 'Ozark' Season 4\n\nMeanwhile, as Navarro cools his heels in custody, his sister Camila (Veronica Falcon) proves formidable. It’s interesting to see the power dynamics shift — Ruth, Wendy and Camila yield much more influence and strength than the men around them.\n\nThat influence and strength is not necessarily used for good. In fact it rarely is. But it’s there, nonetheless.\n\nIn some form or other, all of the major characters want to change their situations. That’s typical in crime stories. But how often does it really work out? Michael Corleone famously says in “The Godfather: Part III,” “Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in.” The characters in “Ozark” haven’t even made it that far. They’re still mired in the messes they’ve made.\n\nComplicating matters is private investigator Mel Sattem (Adam Rothenberg), who is still sniffing around the Byrdes, this time with a different assignment.\n\nAnd Wendy’s father Nathan (Richard Thomas, a million miles from John-Boy on “The Waltons”) sticks to the family like gum on the bottom of a shoe, desperate to find his missing son. Good luck with that.\n\n“Ozark” has always occupied a slot a notch below other Prestige TV series, never quite measuring up to “Breaking Bad” or “The Sopranos” or “The Wire.” But it’s also made a virtue of aiming lower. It may not carry the emotional or societal heft of the best TV, but once it gets going in the second half of its final season it is what it’s always been: a lot of fun. That’ll be missed.\n\n'Ozark'\n\nStreaming on Netflix April 29.\n\nReach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontz@arizonarepublic.com. Facebook: facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm. Twitter: @goodyk.

It should come as no surprise to Phoenix pizza lovers that Pizzeria Bianco made the list as well, coming in at number 14.\n\nHow the Arizona pizzerias landed on the list\n\nFinding the best pizza around the country is no small task, so there were a few requirements to end up on The Daily Meal's list. The list focuses on \"smaller establishments and local favorites that have found success branching out to a few locations,\" according to the list.\n\nThe entries were sourced from reader recommendations, Yelp reviews and local journalism. After the results were compiled, the list awarding 101 spots nationwide was published on Sept. 10.\n\nThis news comes alongside a big announcement from chef Chris Bianco about changes coming to his restaurant group.\n\nBianco's Italian restaurant Tratto is moving into the building that housed a second location of his sandwich shop Pane Bianco. This means Pane Bianco on Van Buren Street will close. The former Tratto space, which is next to the Uptown Phoenix location of Pizzeria Bianco in the Town & Country shopping center, will transform into a second location of Bar Bianco.\n\nBoth locations of Pizzeria Bianco will stay put. Also, throughout the coronavirus pandemic, Pane Bianco on Central Avenue has offered large 18-inch New York-style pizzas perfect for takeout. Those are going to stick around as well.\n\nCibo Urban Pizzeria is no stranger to accolades either. This pizzeria, nestled into a cozy historic 1913 bungalow, made an appearance on The Arizona Republic's top pizza list and has also ranked on both the 2018 and 2019 Yelp lists of America's most romantic restaurants.\n\nCibo offers a large menu of white and red pizzas, salads, calzones, sandwiches and pasta dishes.\n\nBianco's restaurants are currently open for takeout and dine-in services.

The morning show's anchors threw it over to NBC sportscaster Mike Tirico to introduce \"Football Fright in America.\"\n\nHoda Kotb dressed in a blonde wig and sequin dress in Carrie Underwood fashion to kick off the costumes while lip-syncing Underwood's \"Waiting All Day For Sunday Night,\" which is the theme song for NBC Sunday football coverage.\n\nAfter the opening song finished up, Carson Daly and Willie Geist teamed up to dress in full football padding and several championship rings as Tampa Bay Buccaneers Super Bowl 2021 superstars: Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski. Craig Melvin also dressed up as Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, complete with a curly wig and thin mustache and goatee.\n\nWhile Mahomes, Brady, and Gronkowski all have Super Bowl rings, the real attention grabber is the halftime show. Al Roker took a break from the weather and suited up with a red sequin blazer and afro as The Weeknd, singing \"Blinding Lights\" in front of bandaged background dancers. Sheinelle Jones did a separate halftime show brushing her hair back and opting for a pompadour fade to resemble Bruno Mars during his 2014 halftime show performance.\n\nMore:The Weeknd delivers a charismatic Super Bowl halftime show, but he was no Beyoncé or Prince\n\nFinally, Jenna Bush Hager and Savannah Guthrie cheered the whole \"Today\" show team on as Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders, complete with the iconic blue and white outfits.\n\n'The Ellen DeGeneres Show'\n\nEllen DeGeneres is wrapping up the last season of her daytime talk show. She's rounded up some of her favorite costumes from the past and put them on display on social media in anticipation of her \"Ellen Show\" costume finale which takes a look at the comedian in the future.\n\nDressed in a pink housecoat, leopard fanny pack and visor DeGeneres arrived to the set of her show, which was set up with La-Z-Boy chairs, in a Porsche Power Wheelchair.\n\n\"I’m going to miss doing stuff like this.

The two both reclined back in their chairs as they conducted the interview.\n\n'Live with Kelly and Ryan'\n\nIt is a Halloween extravaganza after all.\n\nRipa and Seacrest clearly wanted to be members of Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin crew as the duo as they rocked blue jumpsuits resembling the ones William Shatner wore when he went into space earlier this month.\n\n'We all need a wake-up call':William Shatner is still reeling from his trip to space\n\nAfter disembarking their \"Boo Origin\" space apparatus, the talk show duo's producer Michael Gelman popped out of the TV as Marvel's Vision in \"Wandavision.\" Their \"Live\" executive Art Moore was dressed as Wanda in a red dress, cape and lilac tights. \"Wanda, you're such a vision,\" Seacrest told Moore.\n\nThe costumes continued throughout show, with Ripa and Seacrest dressing as iconic TV moments as Seacrest donned a Richard Simmons getup and Ripa dressed as Jane Fonda, complete with legwarmers.\n\nMany of the 40 costumes were combined into one scene as they did TV mashups like their interpretation of what Season 2 of \"Queen's Gambit\" could look like if \"Squid Game\" took over a chess match. They also combined Netflix's \"Bridgerton,\" with Ripa dressing as Daphne, and Apple TV+'s \"Ted Lasso\" to create \"BridgerTed.\" The remake paired Ripa's Daphne with Seacrest's Ted as her suitor while they danced to a strings rendition of Sisqo's \"Thong Song.\"\n\n'The Queen's Gambit': This Netflix miniseries about chess is one of the best shows of 2020\n\nOther costumes included dress-up games of \"Star Trek,\" MTV moon men, \"Emily in Paris\" and \"The Jetsons.\"\n\n'Tamron Hall'\n\nTamron Hall joined in on the fun and took her costume \"Up\" to new levels. Hall joined her live studio audience dressed as Cardi B – specifically, when the rapper revealed to the world she was expecting her second baby during the BET Awards in June.\n\nIn a rhinestone-embellished bodysuit with a mesh cut-out around a fake pregnant belly, Hall paired the look with a long black wig and stiletto nails to match.\n\nMore:Cardi B reveals second pregnancy with Offset, shows off baby bump during BET Awards performance\n\nAfter a break, Hall returned to the show dressed as another icon who also welcomed a child this year:Naomi Campbell.

Sesame Street’s biggest star\n\nAvailable in sizes: 12 months to 4T\n\nIt’s a known fact that cute toddlers look even cuter when dressed up in furry Elmo costumes. Always a popular choice for the 4-and-under set, this comfortable costume is easy to put on—it’s a one-piece that zips up the front—and will keep your little one toasty in even the most frigid weather.

This officially licensed Scooby costume includes a zip-front jumpsuit with an attached head and paws, shoe covers, a long tail and the Scooby Doo collar. The costume is nice quality—not cheap polyester like so many others—but it does run on the small side, so be sure to order one size up if you plan to add a layer of warm clothing underneath.\n\nIf your child is more of a Daphne or a Velma type rather than a crime-stopping canine, you’re covered: The Velma costume comes with matching socks and glasses (the wig is separate) while the Daphne costume comes outfitted with a wig and boots, so all your kid has to do is put everything on before she heads out for candy.\n\n5.

A monkey costume that’s curiously adorable\n\nAvailable in sizes: 6 months to 3T\n\nThis cute and cuddly monkey costume includes everything your baby needs to mimic his or her favorite character from the classic Curious George books—even a stuffed banana!

A trio of pajama-clad crime fighters\n\nAvailable in sizes: 2T to 8\n\nThe characters from PJ Masks are A-list celebrities among the 6-and-under crowd, so expect to see quite a few Owlettes, Cat Boys, and Gekkos out trick-or-treating. Each of the PJ Masks costumes includes a jumpsuit with a detachable tail and headpiece. Parents report that the jumpsuits run on the smaller side, so size up for comfort, especially if your kid will want to use it for dress-up in the future. Did we mention the costumes light up?\n\n9. A superhero outfit that works for sensitive kids\n\nAvailable in sizes: 2T to 16\n\nFor kids with sensory issues, costumes with padding, face masks, headpieces—anything that can be plain uncomfortable—are no-go items. If you’re on the search for a sensory-friendly costume so that your child can enjoy a happy Halloween in peace, here’s a pro tip: Go with pajamas! These Superman or Batman pajamas come with a detachable cape so your child can really feel the part.

The fluffy pastel tutu skirt is made for twirling, and the unicorn headband is handmade. There’s no need to be concerned about the sequin bodice: It’s lined in soft cotton, so you won’t have to endure an evening of complaints about it feeling “owie.”\n\nUnicorn Princess costume at Amazon starting at $18\n\n12. A spell-worthy costume\n\nAvailable in sizes: One size\n\nGrab your wand and a Golden Snitch, because the famed residents of Hogwarts are (still) a favorite Halloween costume choice for kids. Going with Harry Potter is a particularly great choice because there's so much variation: is your child not into Gryffindor? Go for Ravenclaw's navy blue theme. Do they want to be a Quidditch player instead? There's a costume options for that too. This Harry Potter costume includes a Gryffindor robe and attached top—add the wand, the corresponding striped tie, and maybe a pair of glasses so that Harry looks totally put together.

Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link.\n\nLondon CNN Business —\n\nBefore the Federal Reserve announced another supersized interest rate hike on Wednesday, investors told Before the Bell they had no problem with the central bank’s messaging that it would continue to aggressively fight decades-high inflation.\n\nIn fact, they relished it, viewing it as a sign the Fed was taking its job seriously after waiting too long to jump into the fray.\n\nSo why did Wall Street cheer Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s seemingly dovish turn? The S&P 500 jumped 2.6% on Wednesday, reaching its highest level since early June.\n\nFirst came the expected. The Fed announced another rate increase of three-quarters of a percentage point, a move that would have seemed unthinkable just six months ago. That will bring the central bank’s key rate to a range of between 2.25% to 2.5%, the highest it’s been since December 2018.\n\nAmong investors, however, attention focused on what comes next. They honed in on comments from Powell during his press conference, which seemed to indicate that the central bank could start to go easier as the US economy slows down.\n\nThere appeared to be two pieces of evidence here:\n\nPowell emphasized that the Fed is moving away from forward guidance, or when it plainly telegraphs to the market what it plans to do next. “We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting,” he said, noting the Fed will carefully comb through data as it comes in. Depending on what this data reveals, Powell said rate hikes could be smaller in magnitude moving forward, as economic growth slows and recession risks rise. “As the stance of monetary policy tightens further, it likely will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases,” he said.\n\nThe read from markets: Digesting this information, investors decided they had priced in a Fed that was far too tough, and that it could pivot sooner than expected. While there had been fears that if the Fed were to relax a bit, inflation wouldn’t be brought under control, this anxiety was put aside.\n\n“This slightest dovish turn was all the market needed to price somewhat looser financial conditions,” said Stefan Koopman, senior macro strategist at Rabobank.\n\nNot so fast: Okay, so Wall Street has decided it doesn’t actually have a problem with a more chilled-out Fed after all, which could theoretically boost expectations for corporate earnings down the line. But debate is now raging about whether that was actually the correct read of Powell’s remarks.\n\n“All Powell could do at the press conference today was talk about how inflation is too high, how the Fed is determined to bring it down, and (implicitly) how he would be willing to tolerate a recession if that’s what’s needed to get the job done,” Piper Sandler’s Roberto Perli and Benson Durham told clients. “In other words, the press conference was hawkish.”\n\nThey have a point. Powell even said that “another unusually large increase could be appropriate” in September if the all-important data supports it.\n\nThe bottom line: Uncertainty remains the name of the game. Where some see hawks, others see doves. The through line is that the Fed doesn’t really know what it will do next, and markets will remain hyper-sensitive to any commentary in the meantime as it tries to puzzle it out.\n\nWhat counts as good news and what counts as bad news — well, that may depend on the day. We give up!\n\nWhat’s happening: The first read of US gross domestic product for the second quarter arrived Thursday. It revealed a 0.9% year over year drop in GDP from April through June. That marks two quarters of shrinking output in a row, which meets one technical definition of a recession.\n\nBut Powell stressed that in his view, the US economy isn’t experiencing a contraction just yet, especially given the strength of the jobs market.\n\n“I do not think the US is currently in a recession and the reason is there are just too many areas of the economy that are performing too well,” he said, adding that the GDP report should be taken “with a grain of salt.”\n\nFacebook posts its first revenue drop as a public company\n\nAfter years of rapid growth, Facebook’s near-term trajectory is clear. The social media giant is in decline.\n\nThe latest: Parent company Meta (FB) reported revenue of $28.8 billion between April and June, a 1% drop from the prior-year quarter and its first year-over-year revenue decline since going public in 2012.\n\nProfit fell more sharply, sliding 36% year-over-year to nearly $6.7 billion. That’s a huge reversal from 2021, when its profit doubled. Shares are down 4% in premarket trading on Thursday.\n\nWhat gives? One of Meta’s biggest problems comes from a slowdown in advertising spending as companies readjust their budgets to prepare for a potential recession. This trend is also battering competitors like Snap. It’s shown up in results from Google and Microsoft, too.\n\nMeta reported a 14% year-over-year decline in the average price per ad.\n\n“We seem to have entered an economic downturn that will have a broad impact on the digital advertising business,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on a call with analysts. “It’s always hard to predict how deep or how long these cycles will be, but I’d say that the situation seems worse than it did a quarter ago.”\n\nFacebook did see daily active users rise to 1.97 billion in June, up from 1.96 billion in March. But greater competition from short-form video app TikTok has the company on high alert.\n\nThe company is doubling down on content recommended by artificial intelligence, which has been one TikTok’s greatest strengths. Zuckerberg said around 15% of content on Facebook feeds — and slightly more on Instagram — is now surfaced by algorithms from accounts that users don’t follow. It expects those numbers to more than double by the end of next year.\n\nBut that’s created backlash from users including Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner, who have complained that they still want to see pictures of their friends. Zuckerberg said that as Meta builds its “discovery engine,” it will still be “a social company.”\n\nWatch this space: Meta wants investors to look to the future, when its success will mostly hinge on its ability to build out a robust virtual reality business. But US regulators are making that task harder. On Wednesday, the Federal Trade Commission moved to block Meta’s acquisition of VR company Within, alleging that it’s illegally attempting to grow its “virtual reality empire.”\n\nJetBlue wins its battle for Spirit Airlines\n\nJetBlue’s months-long campaign to buy Spirit Airlines has finally paid off.\n\nOn Wednesday, Spirit and rival budget carrier Frontier pulled the plug on their proposed tie-up, which had been on life support for months. That cleared the way for JetBlue (JBLU) to quickly step in, announcing a $3.8 billion deal to create the fifth largest US airline.\n\nThis just in: JetBlue announced Thursday that it plans to buy Spirit for $33.50 per share in cash, a 38% premium over the airline’s closing price on Wednesday, my CNN Business colleague Chris Isidore reports. Shares of Spirit leaped 4% to above $25 in premarket trading, while Frontier’s stock is 6% higher.\n\n“Spirit and JetBlue will continue to advance our shared goal of disrupting the industry to bring down fares from the Big Four airlines,” JetBlue CEO Robin Hayes said in a statement.\n\nBut there are still doubts about whether the merger will get the green-light it needs from regulators — a longstanding concern among Spirit management.\n\nJetBlue said it will pay Spirit shareholders an additional 10 cents a month for any delay in closing after December of this year. And if the deal is blocked, JetBlue will pay Spirit $70 million. Its shareholders would get an additional $400 million.\n\nUp next\n\nAltria (MO), Harley-Davidson (HOG), Mastercard (MA), Hershey Foods (HSY), Hertz (HTZ), Honeywell (HON), Pfizer (PFE), Southwest Air (LUV) and Tilray report results before US markets open.

But, as you probably noticed, we’re not rolling out the R-word in any definitive way yet (more on that in a minute).\n\nThe drop in second-quarter GDP activity — data that will be revised two more times — was driven mostly by a decline in inventory levels, my CNN Business colleagues report.\n\nBasically, businesses have been scrambling to replenish stockpiles that got drawn waaaaaay down during the worst of the pandemic, when all of us were stuck at home thinking about ways to spruce up the house or expand the garden.\n\nBut now stores find themselves overstocked — we’re all shopping a bit less now that pandemic aid has dried up and we’re shelling out whole paychecks on food and gas.\n\nThe economy is slowing, which is precisely what the Fed wants to happen so that prices can get back to normal.\n\nSo we’re not in a recession?\n\nI hate to say it, but it depends on whom you ask. A lot of economists, plus President Joe Biden and Fed Chief Jerome Powell, say it’s not likely. Take the GDP data with a grain of salt, as Powell put it yesterday.\n\nPlenty of political pundits might say we are.\n\nThe debate about “recession” vs “not recession” is mostly semantics, but I get it — it’s comforting to be able to put a label on things as a shorthand for everything that feels crummy. The economy right now is kind of like a patient with a mix of symptoms that don’t necessarily align with one disease or another. Something’s off, of course, but your doctor isn’t going to isn’t going to give you a diagnoses if they don’t actually know what’s wrong with you (or we hope they wouldn’t, anyway.)\n\nYeah, we’ve got chronic inflation and less of an appetite for online shopping. But the labor market it is still pretty solid, with unemployment near a 50-year-low.\n\nSo, how do we know when we’re in a recession?\n\nGreat question.\n\nIn the United States, a recession is determined by a panel of eight economists you’ve never heard of at the nonprofit National Bureau of Economic Research.\n\nThey have no predetermined meeting dates; their deliberations are private; they have no term limits and their appointment to the panel is determined by one man, NBER president and MIT economist James Poterba.\n\nThat seems weird, right?\n\nIt sure does! And, as my colleague Nicole Goodkind reports, there’s plenty of fodder for critics of this system.\n\nFor starters, every single one of the eight members is White, and in fact the panel has never included a person of color, according to Gary Hoover, co-chair of the American Economic Association Committee on the Status of Minority Groups in the Economics Profession.\n\nEach is over 60 years old.\n\nThey are all associated with prestigious universities.\n\nThere are just two women, one of whom is married to another member.\n\nAnd don’t hold your breath for this group to spring into action and give us all some clarity. They typically consider a bunch of stats over several months before weighing in.\n\nBOTTOM LINE\n\nEconomists say the biggest reason it would be premature to call a recession based on Thursday’s numbers is that the data can and probably will change. Subsequent revisions to first-quarter GDP figures, for instance, changed from an initial drop of 1.4% to 1.6%, and Thursday’s numbers are just the first of three estimates.\n\nNUMBER OF THE DAY: 5.3%\n\nMortgage rates are falling as recession concerns take root.\n\nThe average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage hit 5.3% this week, down from 5.5% the week before. That is still significantly higher than this time last year when it was 2.8%.\n\nOnce again, this economic indicator is in an awkward transition.\n\n“It’s clear that over the past two years, the combination of the pandemic, record low mortgage rates and the opportunity to work remotely spurred greater demand,” said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist. “Now, as the market adjusts to a higher rate environment, we are seeing a period of deflated sales activity until the market normalizes.”\n\nBUCKLE UP\n\nJetBlue is swooping in to buy Spirit Airlines a day after Spirit pulled the plug on talks to merge with rival budget carrier Frontier. It’s not exactly a match made in aviation industry heaven, but it’s … a match.\n\nHere’s the deal: Spirit and Frontier, two pretty similarly sized carriers with roughly the same approach to customer service (as in, there is none), had been working on a merger for months. Frontier was all set to acquire Spirit with a $2.8 billion cash-and-stock deal.\n\nBut then JetBlue entered the fray this spring, hoping to wrest Spirit away for itself and scuttling what had seemed like a pretty straightforward deal.\n\nAs JetBlue went hostile, Spirit publicly stood by the original Frontier plan and turned down JetBlue’s initial offer. (It was awkward. Like, dude, they’re just not that into you…)\n\nAnyway, long story short, JetBlue’s bid of $3.8 billion, all-cash, became impossible for shareholders to turn down.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nIt’s not a done deal until it clears antitrust regulators, my colleague Chris Isidore writes. The Justice Department under the Biden White House has taken a harder stance on questions of antitrust law, and vowed to promote greater competition within the airline industry.\n\n\n\nJetBlue’s argument is that the deal would create more competition, not less, by creating the US’s fifth-largest airline that can better go up against the Big Four — United, American, Delta and Southwest — which now account for 80% of US air traffic.\n\nWhat does it mean for customers?\n\nDon’t go celebrating cheaper fares anytime soon, besties. Industry experts tell Chris the deal could actually lead to higher fares.\n\n\n\nThat’s because Spirit and Frontier, with their ultra-low-cost business models, serve an important role in forcing larger airlines to cut prices.

The look is meant to convey a “friendly but tough” vibe.\n\nIt’s a design theme expected to carry across Rivian’s planned product line, which should begin coming into view this week as the startup unveils its first concept vehicles — the R1T and an electric SUV — in connection with the Los Angeles Auto Show. The truck is scheduled to be shown first, at LA's Griffith Observatory on Monday.\n\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology-educated Scaringe and other Rivian executives and personnel offered a glimpse of the truck in Antarctic Silver earlier this month to journalists at Rivian’s engineering center west of Detroit in Plymouth Township. In a reimagined industrial space complete with “wellness” rooms, natural lighting and repurposed shipping containers, the executives and engineers showed off the truck that Scaringe and others hope will lead it to a lucrative future.\n\nWhether the company can pull off a successful vehicle launch to deliver the R1T in late 2020 and meet the challenges inherent in auto production and distribution is unknown, but Rivian — a kind of mashup name representing the Indian River in Florida, where Scaringe grew up — has set its own course. Unlike electric vehicle-maker Tesla, which has at times struggled to meet production targets, Rivian, with about 560 staffers, has located its operations both in tech-center corridors, such as San Jose and Irvine, California, and in the industrial heartland, in Plymouth Township and at a former Mitsubishi manufacturing plant in Normal, Illinois.\n\nThe company, which has a logo based on the look of a compass, is aiming for customers who live an active lifestyle. It wants to be, creative director Larry Parker noted, “a brand that brings people in.”\n\nPatagonia template\n\nRivian sees itself fitting into a similar space in the automotive world side as the Patagonia brand is in the clothing universe.\n\n“We’re trying to develop a vehicle that we all love to drive,” said Mark Vinnels, Rivian’s executive director of engineering and programs. “It’s not just designed to look pretty. It’s designed to get dirty. It’s designed to go out and it’s designed to have an adventure.”\n\nThe five-passenger R1T pickup pledges 400 miles of all-electric range (with the largest of three battery options) to eliminate “any hint of range anxiety” and the equivalent of 800 horsepower. Rivian said the R1T will hit 60 m.p.h. in 3 seconds and 100 m.p.h. in less than 7, depending on the battery.\n\nRead more:\n\nDebate over charging stations slows electric car growth in Michigan\n\nInterest in electric vehicles dates back a century\n\nWhen is a good electric car not a good car?

To the rear of the back seats is a “gear tunnel” running the width of the truck, with outside access doors, good for hauling \"snowboards, golf bags or strollers,\" the company said. The access doors also serve as a step for accessing the roof or as a seat while you put on your shoes.\n\nThe truck bed is more than 4½-feet long with the tailgate up, and the company said the truck has a tow rating of 11,000 pounds.\n\nMovable and collapsible crossbars are designed to go over the bed as well as the roof to provide additional options.\n\nThe inside features synthetic leather, floor mats made with material that passes the “ketchup and mustard test” and hidden cup holders, officials said. A rechargeable Rivian-branded flashlight is also tucked into the driver side door.\n\n“The biggest challenge was creating an interior design that delivered a premium experience, while still being comfortable as a space that is heavily used. To do this, we looked outside the automotive industry and took inspiration from contemporary furniture, as well as hiking and outdoor gear, to drive the design,” Jeff Hammoud, vice president of vehicle design, said in the release.\n\nThe company also promises over-the-air software updates and driver assistance features capable of Level 3 (\"hands-off wheel and eyes off road\") autonomy for highway operations.\n\nPricing starts at $61,500 after federal tax rebate.

It’s only the second SUV in the Italian luxury brand’s history and the first that will be available in an all-electric version. It’s an early step toward making the Italian luxury car brand fully electric by 2030.\n\nIn the meantime, all Maserati models will be available in electric versions by 2025, Maserati executives said.\n\nThe Grecale will also be available with a high-performance V6 engine or with a four-cylinder engine with a mild hybrid system. Gas-powered versions of the SUV will be available for sale later this year. The all-electric version, called the Grecale Folgore, will go on sale next year.\n\nThe Maserati Grecale Trofeo will have a high-performance V6 engine but electric and mild-hybrid versions of the SUV will also be available. Maserati\n\nThe Grecale is smaller than the Levante SUV, the model that accounted for 59% of Maserati’s worldwide sales last year. Like the Levante and the Ghibli sedan, the Grecale is named after a wind. The Grecale, pronounced gre-CAH-leh, is an easterly Mediterranean wind.\n\nThe electric Grecale Folgore will be part of the Italian luxury brand’s long-term plan to shift toward selling only electric vehicles. (Folgore means “lightning” in Italian.) Maserati follows a number of other luxury auto brands, including Bentley and Jaguar, in announcing a shift toward fully electric line-ups. In Maserati’s case the shift is somewhat more surprising, given the brand’s strong identification with the raspy, metallic sounds of its usually Ferrari-built internal combustion engines.\n\nMaserati has only recently started production of the new MC20 supercar, which has a Maserati-designed and built 630 horsepower V6 engine. The $216,000 MC20 is the only current Maserati model with an engine not made by Ferrari.\n\nThe high-performance Grecale Trofeo will have a 523 horsepower version of the MC20’s engine. The SUV will be able to go from zero to 60 miles an hour in 3.6 seconds, and will have a top speed of 177 mph, according to Maserati. Maserati has not yet announced horsepower or performance figures for the electric Grecale Folgore\n\nGas-powered versions of the Maserati Trofeo will be available later this year. Maserati\n\nFour-cylinder Grecales will have a mild-hybrid system for improved fuel economy and better performance. The Grecale Modena will have a 325-horsepower version of that system and the Grecale GT, essentially the base model, will have a 296-horsepower version. Prices for the Grecale GT will start at $63,500 in the United States. Maserati did not provide pricing for other versions. These gas-powered versions of the Grecale will be offered for sale later this year.\n\nWhen it goes on sale in 2023, the Grecale Folgore will be Maserati’s second all-electric model. The first will be the all-electric 1,200 horsepower Granturismo Folgore, a new version of Maserati’s two-door four-seat sports car. Maserati has revealed only dimly lit images of the car.\n\nNew, fully redesigned versions of the Quattroporte sedan and Levante SUV, including all-electric versions, will be introduced by 2025, Maserati chief executive Davide Grasso said during a presentation. The smaller Ghibli sedan will be discontinued because there simply isn’t enough market interest in sedans anymore, he said. An all-electric version of the MC20 supercar will also be available by then.\n\nMaserati released dark \"teaser\" images of its upcoming electric sports car. Maserati\n\nMaserati is part of Stellantis, the global automotive conglomerate formed last year which also includes Dodge, Jeep Peugeot, Citroën, Fiat and others. Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has expressed skepticism about the efficacy of the broad auto industry push toward electric vehicles when it comes to actually abating global warming. He believes that offering electric vehicles will do little, he said in a recent interview with CNN Business, in the absence of broader moves for more clean energy, widely available charging infrastructure and cheaper batteries. Regardless, he said, Stellantis is going forward with electrification because of the way the industry is going and what government regulations demand.\n\n“That’s a pure competitive story,” Tavares said. “And we are competitors.”", "authors": ["Peter Valdes-Dapena"], "publish_date": "2022/03/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2019/01/13/cadillac-ev-detroit-auto-show/2567320002/", "title": "Cadillac shows a shot of its first electric car of the future", "text": "Cadillac on Sunday unveiled the brand's first electric vehicle and said it will be General Motors' leader in designing and launching EVs going forward.\n\nGM CEO Mary Barra said Cadillac will be known by consumers for its innovation.\n\n\"Taking the lead in innovation and technology will make Cadillac Cadillac again,\" Barra told reporters at a media event in Detroit where the EV was shown along with Cadillac's new three-row SUV, the XT6.\n\nGM currently offers the Chevrolet Bolt, an electric vehicle, but Barra said allowing Cadillac to take the lead will take the luxury brand to \"the next level.\"\n\nCadillac gave reporters gathered on the eve of the Detroit auto show a peek at the brand's first EV but did not release a launch date or other details.\n\nThe vehicle will be the first off a future platform GM is developing for EVs that will accommodate all-wheel, front- and rear-wheel-drive vehicles across the automaker's four brands.

The futuristic luxury car is also made with a host of innovative recycled and sustainable materials including mushroom fibers, ground up cacti and trash such as food scraps.\n\nA rendering of the Mercedes-Benz Vision EQXX. Mercedes-Benz AG\n\nMercedes’ range claim for this concept vehicle is based on computer simulated testing, not actual driving, the company said. If the claim is accurate, though, the EQXX would be able to drive farther on a single charge than a Toyota Prius hybrid can travel on a full tank of gas, according to United States Environmental Protection Agency estimates. The Prius can only manage 588 miles. It’s nearly as far as the 644 miles that a diesel-powered Chevrolet Suburban can go on a 28-gallon tank of fuel. It’s also much farther than any other electric car currently available in the United States, according to the EPA.\n\nMercedes plans to demonstrate the car’s range in an actual driving test this spring, the company said.\n\nMercedes has said it intends for half its sales to be electric cars by 2025 and, by 2030, for the brand to be virtually “ready to go all electric.” Mercedes referred to the EQXX as a “technology blueprint for series production.” Mercedes plans to put a car with the EQXX’s battery and electric motor technology, as well as some of the car’s other features, into production in 2024, said Markus Schäfer, chief technology officer of Mercedes’ parent company Daimler.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Vision EQXX concept car lacks the traditional grille seen on Mercedes cars today. Mercedes-Benz AG\n\nThe EQXX achieves its remarkable range with a battery pack that is half as large and 30% lighter than the one in the Mercedes EQS, the German automakers current fully electric sedan, while storing the same amount of energy, according to Mercedes. At 620 miles, or 1,000 kilometers, the EQXX would provide about 133 miles more driving distance on a charge than the EQS based on European range estimates for that car.\n\nThe EQXX gains those extra miles largely through efficiency, according to Mercedes. Mercedes claims the EQXX can travel more than 6 miles per kilowatt hour of electricity. That’s almost three times farther per kilowatt hour than a Tesla Model S Long Range, according to US EPA estimates. A kilowatt-hour is a unit of electrical energy stored in a car’s battery so miles per kilowatt hour is like miles per gallon for a gasoline car. The figures are much lower, though, because a gallon of gasoline contains almost 34 kilowatt hours of energy.\n\nTo reach that level of efficiency, Mercedes designers focused on aerodynamics. The EQXX has a drag coefficient of just 0.17, which is sightly more aerodynamic than a properly thrown football. It’s also more aerodynamic than today’s Mercedes EQS which, while still very aerodynamic, has a drag coefficient of 0.20. A Porsche 911 Turbo has a drag coefficient of 0.33, according to Porsche.\n\nThe car is also designed to be as light as possible, according to Mercedes. Besides the relatively light battery pack it has wheels made from magnesium, and aluminum brakes. Springs in the EQXX’s suspension are made from glass-fiber reinforced plastic instead of metal.\n\nMuch of the Mercedes-Benz Vision EQXX's extreme efficiency comes from attention to aerodynamics. Mercedes-Benz AG\n\nThe EQXX’s body includes a web-like subframe designed to have metal only where it’s actually needed for structural integrity and crash safety. Empty spaces in the frame are filled in with a material called UBQ, created by an Israeli startup. UBQ is made from landfill waste that can include things like mixed plastics, cardboard, gardening waste and even diapers, according to Mercedes-Benz. Solar panels in the roof supply supplemental energy for things like air conditioning, lights and the car’s touchscreen systems reducing demands on battery power.\n\nBesides the UBQ filler material in the body, the EQXX also utilizes sustainable materials in other parts of the car. A leather-like material made from mycelium, the underground root-like structures of mushrooms, is used in the seat cushions. Another leather substitute, made from pulverized cactus fibers, is used elsewhere in the interior. The carpets are made entirely of bamboo fiber, according to Mercedes.\n\nInside, the EQXX has an enormous touchscreen that stretches all they way across the dashboard. Unlike the ultra-wide “screen” in the EQS, which is actually three smaller screens under a single sheet of glass, the one in the EQXX really is a single four-foot wide screen. To save energy, unused portions of the screen dim.\n\nMercedes engineers and designers have also tried to give the car’s voice-control system more personality with a lifelike voice that’s more emotionally expressive. The system is represented by a human-shaped avatar made up of tiny stars.

The newly created all-electric vehicle (EV) skill team will be led by Farley.\n\nBy making this move, Farley hopes to speed up innovation, improve quality and cut costs while also ensuring Ford's ability to deliver high-volume production that startups can't.\n\nHere's the overview:\n\nFord is dividing its auto business into three separate units under the Ford automotive umbrella.\n\nFirst is Ford Pro, the automaker's existing commercial arm that doesn't make vehicles but will continue to distribute them, sell them and offer services including hardware and software solutions for vehicle charging and digital support that allows small business owners to manage and maintain fleets. Ford Pro will essentially serve as a distribution and service company. Its CEO is Ted Cannis.\n\nThe second is the internal combustion engine (ICE) business called Ford Blue, which will create products for the whole company, including commercial vehicles for its Ford Pro unit, but also source and sell them to retail customers.\n\nFinally, Ford Model e, with a lowercase \"e,\" is a \"digital electric business\" that will create products for Ford Pro and for retail, and will handle the sourcing and the engineering of those electric vehicles. Ford Model e will also design the facilities for the electric vehicles and digital vehicles and provide services for ICE products, like the interior digital experience or over-the-air technology updates for the ICE vehicles.\n\n\"We have created, effectively, three separate parts of our auto business because we believe they need that focus,\" Farley said. \"You can’t ask an electric person to work on Ford telematics for a Pro customer. You can’t ask an ICE person to work on the sourcing of raw materials for battery electric vehicles. We have to specialize now.\"\n\nLeadership changes\n\nFarley will serve as president of Ford Model e, in addition to his role as CEO and president of Ford. Doug Field, Ford chief advanced technology and embedded systems officer with extensive experience at Apple and Tesla, will lead product creation as chief EV and digital systems officer for Ford Model e and also lead development of software and embedded systems for all of Ford.\n\nThe Model e team includes: Marin Gjaja, a former Boston Consulting managing director, who becomes chief customer officer also heading new business initiatives; Lisa Drake moves from chief operating officer of Ford North America to vice president of EV industrialization, and Darren Palmer, who moves from general manager of battery electric vehicles to vice president of electric vehicle platforms.\n\n\"Designing truly incredible electric and software-driven vehicles — with experiences customers can't even imagine yet — requires a clean sheet approach,\" Field said in a news release issued Wednesday. \"We are creating an organization that benefits from all of Ford's know-how and capabilities, but that can move with speed and unconstrained ambition to create revolutionary new products.\"\n\nLawsuit:Newly unsealed emails suggest Ford targeted high-performing older workers\n\nSettled:Ford settles lawsuit alleging automaker targeted high-performing older workers\n\nGalhotra becomes president of Ford Blue and the rest of his team will be revealed soon, a Ford spokesperson told the Free Press.\n\nStuart Rowley moves from president of Ford of Europe to chief transformation and quality officer focused on reduced complexity and tighter costs.\n\nHau Thai-Tang moves from chief product platform and operations officer to chief industrial platform officer. He will lead product development, supply chain and manufacturing engineering for ICE products and common systems across Ford Pro, Ford Blue and Ford Model e, the company said in the news release.\n\nRowley and Thai-Tang hold \"enterprise positions that don't fall within Ford Blue or Ford Model e and each reports to Farley,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nBut just because these newly created divisions will be separate doesn’t mean they won't rely on each other in certain areas of common technology and materials at a scale that will help save money, Farley said.\n\nTransparency\n\nTo illustrate the company's strength, Ford will also begin tracking profit and loss (P&L) financial statements separately for Ford Pro, Ford Blue and Ford Model e. The statements will summarize the revenue and expenses for each entity.\n\nExcept for Tesla, automakers tend to fold their electric business information into the bigger operation, making it hard to track and critique.\n\n\"We are going further,\" Farley said. \"Now, people are going to understand how profitable our EV business is. They'll know how profitable our Pro business is. They'll know how profitable our ICE business is. We'll need that inside the company, not only for focus but for accountability.\"\n\nFord's new structure is effective immediately, though it will take time to fully evolve, as \"two distinct but strategically interdependent auto businesses.\"\n\nMore:Ford CEO gives employees sobering data about Tesla, challenges ahead\n\nMore:She is chief engineer of all-electric Ford F-150, leading a revolution\n\nThis is about having \"startup speed and unbridled innovation,\" Farley said, that take Ford beyond the award-winning Mustang Mach-E and Ford F-150 Lightning being launched in coming months.\n\nThe creation of Ford Model e was inspired by the success of small teams that developed the Ford GT, Mach-E SUV and Lightning pickup.\n\n\"Ford Model e will be Ford's center of innovation and growth, a team of the world's best software, electrical and automotive talent turned loose to create truly incredible electric vehicles and digital experiences for new generations,\" Farley said in a news release Wednesday.\n\nMore:Ford CEO hired Doug Field away from Apple in 'huge coup'\n\nMore:He's a big deal at Ford, but down-to-earth exec hides in plain sight\n\nMeanwhile, the Ford Blue team \"will be hellbent on delivering leading quality, attacking waste in every corner of the business, maximizing cash flow and optimizing our industrial footprint,\" Farley said in the release.\n\nFord Blue will strengthen the F-Series, Ranger and Maverick trucks, Bronco and Explorer SUVs and Mustang with investment in new models. Ford also plans to invest in brand new ICE vehicles, such as the truck fleet, but Farley declined to go into detail now.\n\nJob cuts?\n\nWith transition comes change in staffing. What about buyouts or layoffs?\n\nFord plans to roll out to its global team the fact that the company is growing, Farley told the Free Press. \"There are going to be areas where we'll have to get our structure costs down. I'm not going into specifics but, generally, this is a growth story for Ford. Will some areas be adjusted? Our business is always that way. But we're not going to make any specific announcements.\"\n\nSuper Duty remains key\n\n\"I'm not going to go into specifics but we're not going to stop investing,\" Farley said. \"It's still going to be 50% of our volume by the end of the decade. And those customers, like Super Duty, if you're hauling a horse trailer in northern Michigan, an electric vehicle won't work on an 800-mile trip. We're going to have a very vibrant ICE business that will continue to be more profitable. Over time, its volume will start to fall off. But we think there's a lot of growth opportunity.\"\n\nPlan:CEO Jim Farley vows Ford Motor will not split in two — previews restructuring\n\nBehind the scenes:Private moments with Ford CEO Jim Farley reveal how he works\n\nClue:Ford CEO Jim Farley gave us big clue automaker's stock was going to surge\n\nThe lucrative ICE business funds the high costs of research and development establishing a battery electric business for all automakers.\n\n\"We're going to have dozens of new electric vehicles that no one has ever seen before. We're working on them now. And that's why we're setting up battery plants,\" Farley told the Free Press. \"This team is working on, not only the development of the vehicles and the platforms — the braking systems, the battery systems, the inverters, the motors — but they're also working on sourcing all of those.\"\n\nFord is planning to get new products to market by 2026, not 2030, Farley said. \"We want to give people the idea that we're moving quickly.\"\n\nCar dealers here to stay\n\nBeating Tesla in customer experience long term is the plan, and car dealers will play an essential role, he said.\n\n\"We’re committing to the dealer model,\" Farley said, which is not how Tesla operates.\n\n\"We’re not keeping dealers in the mix 'for the moment.' We are betting on dealers for the long term,\" he told the Free Press. \"I want to make that really clear. I’m not mincing words. We will have new standards and a new experience. But we learned a lot by watching Tesla.\"\n\nWhile Tesla customers like the digital experience in the first few years, they eventually have problems such as nonworking doors or accident damage or issues related to an over-the-air update, and providing consumers with the ability to speak with real people in person can be really good — and yet Tesla doesn't offer dealership support, Farley noted.\n\n\"Just like your Target experience is different than your Amazon experience, but Target didn’t go away when Amazon became the dominant retailer, they just had a change,\" he said. \"Circuit City went away, and lots of others went away, because they didn’t change. ... We believe in a superior customer experience. I don’t want to mince my words. We are betting on the franchise model.\"\n\nMore:Mach-E just beat out 10 competitors: 'This award is a massive deal'\n\nAs for a possible Genius Bar-style help desk for EV customers, like what Apple provides for its clientele, Farley said everything is on the table. It's likely going to be a WebEx style option that allows for direct interaction.\n\nDearborn forever\n\nDespite the big announcement, all operations will remain under one umbrella company with its world headquarters in Dearborn, Farley told the Free Press.\n\n'We're not moving anywhere. This is our home. We have people coming from all over the world, including the West Coast of the U.S. to move to Michigan to be part of this transformation at all levels,\" he said. \"We ain't going anywhere. Will we open a bigger office in Tel Aviv (Israel) or in Palo Alto (California)? Yeah, probably. But that won't change our headquarters.\"\n\nIn fact, he said, in addition to investing in Corktown, the company is spending \"billions\" revamping its physical presence in Dearborn — the largest investment since the 1950s.\n\nThere is no plan to establish a presence in Kentucky or Tennessee that's any different from other Ford plants, such as Kansas City Assembly in Claycomo, Missouri, Farley said, swatting away rumors of a potential move inspired by the recent battery investment.\n\nThe electric business may also have a presence in Southern California and possibly China, because growth is expected, Farley said. \"There will be more jobs and more growth for the company. We're going to have new expertise areas or hot zones for talent and know-how based around the world, as we do today. But the headquarters, nothing is changing about Ford Motor Co. Dearborn is our home.\"\n\nMore:Ford doubles annual bonuses amid worker fury over controversial formula\n\nMore:Ford memo outlines plan to put unvaccinated salaried workers on unpaid leave\n\nContact Phoebe Wall Howard: 313-222-6512 orphoward@freepress.com.Follow her on Twitter@phoebesaid.

It unveiled the Vision-S 02, a SUV prototype, at the CES conference in Las Vegas.\n\nThe concept SUV uses Sony (SNE) sensors to enable some self-driving functions and makes use of the company’s expertise in entertainment. Passengers would be able to play video games on the go while connected to their PlayStation consoles at home.\n\nSony\n\nSony introduced its first prototype vehicle, the Vision-S 01 two years ago, which it started testing on public roads in Europe in December 2020. The new SUV would use the same EV cloud platform as the first model, Sony said in a press release.\n\nIt is unclear whether the company hopes to build cars under its own brand or partner with other automakers.\n\nSpeculation that Sony competitor Apple (AAPL) is considering making its own electric vehicle has swirled for years. The rumor mill turned again in April last year when CEO Tim Cook hinted autonomous driving would be a core feature of any Apple (AAPL) car, but the $3 trillion company has so far not confirmed plans to build one.", "authors": ["Anna Cooban"], "publish_date": "2022/01/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2021/10/06/gm-investor-day-electric-vehicle-plant-conversions-technology/6023173001/", "title": "GM Investor Day: Electric vehicle plant conversions, new technology", "text": "General Motors secured its pivot to a high-tech future Wednesday by announcing plans to convert more assembly plants in North America to make electric vehicles by the end of the decade and to double company revenues by that time as it unveils more software and new EVs.\n\nGM leaders were expected to reveal new technology, such as an advancement to the automaker's hands-free driving system, as well as more EV products, including a new Chevrolet SUV EV priced at $30,000, during its annual Investor Day presentation, starting at 1 p.m. EDT.\n\n\"Our early investments in these growth trends have transformed GM from automaker to platform innovator, with customers at the center,\" said CEO Mary Barra. \"GM will use its hardware and software platforms to innovate and improve their daily experience, leading everybody on the journey to an all-electric future.\"\n\nBarra emphasized that no hourly workers will lose their jobs in the transition to electric and GM continues to hire salaried employees who have a background in technology and digital software.\n\n\"Late last year we hired 3,000 employees and this year alone we’ve hired 8,000 salaried workers especially in the technology, digital and the software space,\" Barra said. \"When we talked about getting to carbon neutral by 2040, people said, 'I want to be a part of that' and we saw the number of applications go up.\"\n\nAbout 100 investors were expected to attend GM's Investor Day at GM's Global Technical Center in Warren. On Thursday, investors will be at GM’s Milford Proving Grounds to see new products and technologies, including taking a spin in the 2022 GMC Hummer EV pickup and seeing the new BrightDrop all-electric delivery vans.\n\nDoubling revenue\n\nGM was expected to outline for investors detailed plans to double annual revenues by 2030 and grow earnings before interest and taxation adjusted margins as it transitions to an all-electric future.\n\nBarra said much of that revenue growth will come from GM's new businesses such as its upcoming EVs, startup BrightDrop electric delivery trucks and OnStar Insurance, as well as future software that would open up revenue streams through subscriptions.\n\nTo get a sense of how much revenue GM is looking to capture, the company reported revenue of $122.5 billion for 2020. That was down 10.8% compared with 2019 after GM shut down all its factories in North America last year for eight weeks at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Still, GM reported $6.4 billion in net income for 2020 while its adjusted operating profit was $9.7 billion.\n\nGM has been in the process of transforming into a technology innovator, promising to invest $35 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles by mid-decade. GM will launch 30 new EVs by that time, too.\n\nBut it has revenue possibilities from many other tentacles. For example, its majority-owned subsidiary, Cruise, is working on a robotaxi service with self-driving cars. Cruise CEO Dan Ammann is expected to outline the plan for its ride-hailing business to reach $50 billion in revenue as it ramps up operations. No timeline to reach that goal is available yet, but Cruise is expected to start charging for rides next year if it wins approval from California regulators.\n\nIn an investor note Monday, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas wrote of Cruise, \"We don’t forecast such a revenue achievement before 2038 in our model by which point we forecast a Cruise fleet of nearly 600,000 units with 60,000 miles per car, per year and $1.50 revenue per mile.\"\n\nGM President Mark Reuss also noted GM's subsidiary GM Defense, which GM formed in 2017, is a strong revenue source. Last year, the U.S. Army awarded GM Defense its first major contract of $214.3 million to build the Infantry Squad Vehicle. Last month, GM Defense won a $36.4 million contract from the U.S. Department of State to develop the next generation large utility commercial vehicles for the Diplomatic Security Service.\n\nA very different, cool pickup\n\nGM's Ultium platform that will underpin its new EVs and its flexibility will allow GM to bring high-volume entries such as a Chevrolet SUV that will be priced around $30,000. GM said it will also bring all-electric Buick SUVs, pickups from Chevrolet, GMC and Hummer, as well as Cadillac vehicles.\n\nOn Wednesday, GM showed a peek at the Chevrolet Silverado E, the all-electric pickup it plans to debut at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in 2022. GM showed a picture of its all-glass roof.\n\nThe Silverado E will be built at Factory ZERO in Detroit and Hamtramck, Michigan, along with the GMC Hummer EV pickup and Hummer SUV. GM is not providing exact launch dates for the Silverado E, but Reuss said it will start production after the start of Hummer SUV production in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nSilverado E will be positioned and marketed differently from its internal combustion Silverado, Reuss said. He said it will still be targeted to pickup customers, but they will be a different demographic.\n\n\"The proof points of who we’re going to target will be very evident when you see the truck,\" Reuss told reporters. \"This is a highly innovative (approach) and it’ll be something that sparks the interest of people in a growth basis. The design and proportions will be very different and very cool.”\n\nMore EV assembly plants\n\nTo get its 30 new EVs to market, Barra said more than half of GM's North American and China assembly plants will be able to be converted to build EVs by 2030.\n\nGM has already tagged the following plants for EV production:\n\nOrion Assembly in Orion Township, Michigan, which currently builds the Chevrolet Bolt EV and Bolt EUV.\n\nFactory ZERO in Detroit and Hamtramck, to build the GMC Hummer EV pickup and SUV and Silverado E.\n\nSpring Hill Assembly in Spring Hill, Tennessee, to build the Cadillac Lyriq SUV\n\nCAMI in Ontario to build BrightDrop EV delivery vans.\n\nRamos Arzipe Assembly in Mexico to build batteries and electrical components starting later this year.\n\n\"We’ll be able to grow and convert more facilities,\" Barra said. \"We have the plan to get us to 2035 in the U.S. in terms of light-duty vehicles.\"\n\nGM does not have any immediate plans to build any new assembly plants, Barra said, noting it is currently building two Ultium LLC battery plants as part of its joint venture with LG Energy Solutions. One will be in Lordstown, Ohio and the other in Spring Hill, ennessee\n\nBarra said GM’s existing manufacturing footprint will, “allow us to go fast, but if we need a new plant we can do that, too. But we have a trained workforce that knows how to build our vehicles, build high-quality products. We want to make sure we take along all of our workforce, too.”\n\nUltra Cruise\n\nGM also unveiled, Wednesday, Ultra Cruise, which will be a new and advanced driver assistance technology that will enable hands-free driving in 95% of all \"driving scenarios,\" Reuss said.\n\nThe technology is two years away – initially launching in 2023 select models with GM's luxury brand Cadillac vehicles getting it first – and will cover more than two million miles of roads in the U.S. and Canada, with the capacity to expand to up to 3.4 million miles.\n\nReuss said Ultra Cruise will allow customers to drive hands-free on city streets, subdivision streets, paved rural roads and highways.\n\nGM's plans are for Super Cruise, its current hands-free system, to remain on its mainstream vehicles and Ultra Cruise to be on premium cars. Super Cruise currently can be used on 200,000 miles of major highways in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nGM's gradual transition\n\nBarra and other leaders have been gradually laying the groundwork this year for GM's expansion beyond simply producing and selling vehicles. Two weeks ago, the Free Press reported that GM's Senior Vice President of Innovation and Growth Alan Wexler said GM will become a software company that just happens to make hardware: Cars.\n\nWexler said GM's new business model will use vehicles as a platform to deliver GM-developed software that provides services that can be used outside of just the car. He called it \"a potential game changer for delivering subscription services that create recurring revenue.\"\n\nThen last week, GM introduced a new software platform it created called Ultifi, which GM's Scott Miller, vice president of software-defined vehicles, said is a \"big, big step in our software strategy.\"\n\nSimilar to software on a smartphone, Ultifi will be able to provide regular updates and let customers choose from a variety of over-the-air upgrades, personalization options and apps.\n\nOn Tuesday, GM announced that software innovator Aneel Bhusri, 55, is joining its Board of Directors. Bhusri is the co-founder, co-CEO and chairman of Workday Inc. Workday specializes in software to help managers work better with employees. GM now has 13 directors with the addition of Bhusri.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, GM announced a new Digital Business team that will be headed by newly named Chief Digital Officer Edward Kummer, 58, starting Oct. 16. Kummer will build a digital business and accelerate software investments as part of GM's move to offer consumers more software. Kummer, who was president of Nordstrom Rack's online business and Nordstrom's HauteLook brand, will report to Reuss.\n\nMore:GM's future EVs get range boost, shorter charge time with new deal\n\nMore:GM stock up after prominent hedge fund takes stake, backs automaker's EV future\n\nMore:GM to build new battery facility in Warren to support its EV strategy\n\nContact Jamie L.

A flight suit to awaken the Force within your child\n\nAvailable in sizes: 3 to 13\n\nSure, Baby Yoda is all the rage, but if your kid wants to be unique—yet still faithful to his or her Star Wars obsession—why not opt for Poe Dameron, the Resistance’s top pilot.

All you need is a VW Vanagon\n\nAvailable in sizes: small to large\n\nScooby Doo may be more than 50 years old, but in classic Hollywood fashion, his face still looks the same. This officially licensed Scooby costume includes a zip-front jumpsuit with an attached head and paws, shoe covers, a long tail and the Scooby Doo collar.

A superhero outfit that works for sensitive kids\n\nAvailable in sizes: 2T to 16\n\nFor kids with sensory issues, costumes with padding, face masks, headpieces—anything that can be plain uncomfortable—are no-go items.

A spell-worthy costume\n\nAvailable in sizes: One size\n\nGrab your wand and a Golden Snitch, because the famed residents of Hogwarts are (still) a favorite Halloween costume choice for kids.

How a Phoenix rockabilly teen made the cover of Bob Dylan's book\n\n20. 'I Can't Wait'\n\nThis is the closest she will ever come to sounding like Madonna. And the electronic dance vibe suits her better than most people would've guessed before she cut this track, which somehow charted higher on the Mainstream Rock chart than the dance chart. It's among her most infectious hits, with all the touchstones of a massive '80s pop hit — out of character but all the more intriguing for it. In the liner notes to Timespace, Nicks recalled her friend Rick Nowels bringing her the backing track. \"I think this was about the most exciting song that I had ever heard,\" she said. \"The second Rick left, I ran in my little recording studio and wrote 'I Can't Wait.' It took all night, and I think it is all about how electric I felt about this music.\"\n\nInterview: How Tears for Fears moved forward by returning to the way they wrote their early hits\n\n19. 'Planets of the Universe'\n\nNicks wrote this song about the end of her relationship with Buckingham while work was underway on \"Rumours,\" where it would've been surrounded by a bunch of tracks about the end of that relationship. Which may explain why the guitar riff sounds like such a natural extension of \"Rhiannon\" from Fleetwood Mac's previous album. It never made it past the demo stage with Fleetwood Mac. But Nicks revived it decades later, topping Billboard's dance charts in 2001. The groove is only so insistent, though, which means it doesn't undercut the haunting nature of the vocal as she frames the fate of their relationship within the larger context of the universe. \"The planets of the universe go their way,\" she sings. \"Not astounded by the sun or moon.\"\n\nInterview: Dan Auerbach shares the 'magic trick' that keeps The Black Keys going\n\n18. 'Crying in the Night'\n\nThis long-discarded gem from the Buckingham Nicks album made its unexpected live debut on the opening night of the 24 Karat Gold Tour in Phoenix, where she told us, “This was gonna be the single off the Buckingham Nicks record. It was so long ago, I don’t actually remember if it ever was the single or made it out.\" It's the opening track on the album, which is out of print but you can check it out on YouTube. Stylistically speaking, \"Crying in the Night\" is not that far removed from the sort of material she and Buckingham ended up contributing to Fleetwood Mac, an acoustic-guitar-driven midtempo song with a bit of a Badfinger vibe that finds her warning of \"a tarnished pearl\" who's bound to leave you crying in the night.\n\nNostalgia tour? Nah. Duran Duran, Nile Rodgers & Chic's monster hits lit it up in Phoenix\n\n17. 'Gypsy'\n\nThis is among the biggest hits she wrote for Fleetwood Mac, a wistful pop song that romanticizes the lifestyle she enjoyed with Buckingham before they made it. There are references to Nicks' favorite clothing store where Janis Joplin used to buy her clothes in San Francisco, and the way she used to pretty up their mattress on the floor with lace and paper flowers. As with any song reflecting on her time with Buckingham, it also touches on the breakup, with Nicks as the gypsy who's \"dancing away from you now,\" reminding him, \"Her memory is all that is left for you now.\"\n\n16. 'Talk to Me'\n\nReleased as the lead single from her \"Rock a Little\" album, \"Talk to Me\" is one of Nicks' biggest solo hits. It spent two weeks at No. 1 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and peaked at No. 4 on Billboard's Hot 100. It was written by Chas Sanford, who'd co-written one of the previous year's big rock hits, John Waite's \"Missing You.\" Nicks has said she didn't like the song at first and struggled with the vocals. But you'd never know it to hear her lean into those high notes on the bridge, powering through \"Do I seem all that hard, is it all that tough? Now, I've searched through all my cards, well, isn't that enough?\" with a grittier vocal than we're used to hearing from her.\n\n15. 'Sorcerer'\n\nIt's not at all uncommon to find her sitting on a classic song for years or even decades. That was certainly the case with \"Sorcerer,\" a song she wrote in the Buckingham Nicks days and didn't release until \"Trouble In Shangri-La.\" It almost made it onto \"Tusk\" and was recorded then shelved during sessions for 1983's \"The Wild Heart.\" A recording by Marilyn Martin appeared in 1984 on the soundtrack to a film called \"Streets of Fire.\" But it was 2001 before we heard her version of the song, a vaguely psychedelic treatment — that guitar could not be more hypnotic — co-produced by Sheryl Crow, who sings and plays guitar on the recording. It's also blessed with one of Nicks' most beguiling vocal tracks in years.\n\n14. 'Bella Donna'\n\nThis song clearly held a special place in Nicks' heart. Not only did she choose it to open her solo debut, but she also named the album after it. In an interview with Rolling Stone tied to the album's release, she talked about the title track, a deeply moving portrait of a beautiful woman who's so tired, she disappears. It's \"basically a warning to myself and a question to others,\" she said. \"I'm 33 years old, and my life has been very up and down in the last six years.\" And what Nicks ends up telling herself is \"Come in out of the darkness.\"\n\n13. 'If Anyone Falls'\n\nThis synth-driven gem from \"The Wild Heart\" was written as Nicks was falling out love with one person, falling in love with another, a time when — as she noted in the liner notes to \"Timespace\" — \"Nothing else seemed to matter except this person.\" There's a dreamlike quality to the production and the lyrics as she sings of \"dealing with a man when away from me stays deep inside my heart.\" In the opening verse, he predicts, \"If anyone falls in love, it will be one of us,\" which leads into a haunting chorus hook that takes place in \"the twilight dreamtime.\"\n\n12. 'Gold Dust Woman'\n\nIn a 1997 interview with VH1, Nicks said this song was \"really my symbolic look about somebody going through a bad relationship, and doing a lot of drugs, and trying to… just make it, trying to live, trying to get through it to the next thing.\" It also draws on her experience of watching groupies operate. As she told Crawdaddy in 1976, it's \"about women who stand around and give me and Christine (McVie) dirty looks but as soon as a guy comes in the room are overcome with smiles.\" What ultimately matters is the raw emotion she invests in the haunted chorus of \"Well, did she make you cry? Make you break down? Shatter your illusions of love? And is it over now? Do you know how to pick up the pieces and go home?\"\n\n11. 'Leather and Lace'\n\nThis romantic ballad was her second hit duet from \"Bella Donna,\" hitting No. 6 on Billboard's Hot 100. Nicks had written this one as the title track for Waylon Jennings and Jessi Colter's 1981 duets album \"Leather and Lace,\" but for whatever reason, that fell through. So Nicks recorded her own version with Don Henley. And it sounds like something that would definitely speak to Eagles fans, a wistful, country-flavored soft-rock song whose mood is complemented by the use of what certainly sounds like a celeste. It also went Top 10 on the Adult Contemporary charts and would've sounded right at home in that format.\n\n10. 'Stop Draggin' My Heart Around'\n\nThis is the single that set her on her way to a second Hall of Fame induction, a hit duet with Tom Petty recorded with his backing band, the Heartbreakers, for \"Bella Donna.\" It remains her highest-charting entry on the Billboard Hot 100, where it peaked at No. 3. The song was written by Petty and right-hand man Mike Campbell for use on a Heartbreakers record, but producer Jimmy Iovine arranged for Nicks to sing it, which turned out to be a brilliant move. She really makes the song her own, despite phrasing occasional lines in a way that could not be more Petty-esque. It also features one of Petty's most expressive vocals. And their distinctive voice blend together really nicely on the chorus. They make sense together.\n\n9. 'After the Glitter Fades'\n\n\"Well, I never thought I'd make it here in Hollywood\" is the perfect point of entry to this country-tinged lament, a song she's said was written in the early '70s, when she and Buckingham were struggling to make it. It didn't see the light of the day until years later as an understated highlight of the \"Bella Donna\" album, where Dan Dugmore’s haunting pedal steel and Roy Bitten's twinkling piano do much to underscore Nicks' bittersweet delivery as she sings of the dream that \"keeps coming even when you forget to feel\" and seems to find some comfort in the thought that \"the feeling remains even after the glitter fades.\" It peaked at No. 32 on Billboard's Hot 100.\n\n8. 'Rooms on Fire'\n\nNicks told the BBC this hit from 1989's \"The Other Side of the Mirror\" is \"about a girl who is a rock 'n' roll star who has pretty much accepted the fact that she will never ever be able to be married or have those children that she wanted or the husband that she wanted or that deep, deep love that she wanted and she's accepted it.\" The song itself is more upbeat than that explanation suggests with a chorus that could be among her most contagious pop hooks, where she sings, \"Well maybe I'm just thinking that the rooms are all on fire every time that you walk in the room\" (a line inspired by her feelings for producer Rupert Hine). This song hit No. 16 on the Hot 100.\n\n7. 'Has Anyone Ever Written Anything for You?'\n\nThis deeply moving ballad was written in response to \"Song for Emma,\" a song Joe Walsh had written to honor the memory of Emma, his three-year-old daughter who died of injuries sustained on her way home from nursery school in a tragic automobile accident. A melancholy piano sets the tone, then Nicks begins to sing. \"Has anyone ever written anything for you?\" she asks. \"In all your darkest hours, have you ever heard me sing? Listen to me now.\" In the liner notes to \"Timespace,\" she calls this \"the most committed song I ever wrote.\" And you can hear how much it means to her in her heartbreaking delivery of a song she says came spilling out of her in about five minutes after sitting down at the piano in her Paradise Valley home after a trip with Walsh to visit Emma's favorite park.\n\n6. 'Silver Springs'\n\nIt's still amazing to consider that they left this song off \"Rumours.\" Yes, it could be argued that the album did all right without it. But it would've made a more compelling masterpiece if they'd included it. It opens with Nicks at her vulnerable best, trembling her way through an opening line about how \"you could be my silver spring, blue-green colors flashin'\" with no hint of the fiery intensity to follow as she taunts her former lover (the one over there on guitar) with a vow of \"I'll follow you down til' the sound of my voice will haunt you\" and \"You'll never get away from the sound of the woman that loves you.\" It should've been the final track (and it shouldn't have faded out so quickly).\n\n5. 'Rhiannon'\n\n\"Rhiannon\" was the first hit single Nicks contributed to making Fleetwood Mac one of the most successful pop acts of all time, a suitably bewitching portrait of a woman who \"takes to the sky like a bird in flight.\" In an interview with Rolling Stone, Nicks explained that the song had been inspired by \"Triad: A Novel of the Supernatural,\" which tells the story of a Welsh woman who believes she’s been possessed by a woman named Rhiannon. As Nicks told Rolling Stone, “I wrote this song and made her into what I thought was an old Welsh witch. It’s just about a very mystical woman that finds it very, very hard to be tied down in any kind of way.” The song peaked at No. 11 on Billboard's Hot 100 and according to the website setlist.fm, remains the Fleetwood Mac song her fans are most likely to hear at a solo show, narrowly edging out \"Dreams.\"\n\n4. 'Stand Back'\n\nNicks wrote this synth-driven single by humming an alternate melody to Prince's \"Little Red Corvette\" when it came on the radio as she and the man she'd just married were driving to a luxury resort in Santa Barbara, recording a demo that night in their honeymoon suite. When she told Prince the story? He came by the studio to add those very Prince-like synthesizers. In a 1998 interview with WMGK, Nicks said when this song starts out, \"I almost feel like I'm hearing it coming out of a club or something.\" The single peaked at No. 5 on Billboard's Hot 100. Nicks has said this song and 'Dreams' are her two favorites to perform on stage.\n\n3. 'Edge of Seventeen'\n\nThis song was inspired by visiting her Uncle John in Phoenix and holding his hand as he died shortly after the murder of John Lennon. As Nicks told Rolling Stone in 1981, \"The white-winged dove in the song is a spirit that is leaving a body, and I felt a great loss at how both Johns were taken.\" It's not a sad song, though. Years later, in an interview with Vox, she talked about the importance of getting the energy right, from Waddy Wachtel's iconic guitar part (as sampled years later by Destiny's Child) to the point where all that tension she's been building finally gives way to the release of the drums kicking in more than a minute into the record. \"When we recorded the song, the energy that was written into that song was so intense that it took us about two nights to get the track to that, and it's like nobody's feet ever stopped moving,\" she recalled. \"I wanted that song to have all that energy of them and of us going on.\n\n2. 'Dreams'\n\nThere's a reason this became the biggest hit she's ever written, from the timeless melody to the way she hits those high notes on \"It's only right that you should play the way you feel it,\" a line she follows with a withering \"But listen carefully to the sound of your loneliness.\" The production is flawless, the vocal sublime, the overall effect as timeless as pop music gets. It concerns the end of her eight-year relationship with Buckingham, whose job was then to come up with the perfect guitar arrangement to accompany the venom in her lyrics \"in the stillness of remembering what you had... and what you lost.\" In an interview for \"In the Studio with Fleetwood Mac,\" Nicks said, \"I can remember how hard it was for me to play 'Dreams' the first time for the whole band, because I know it would probably really upset Lindsey, and probably really upset Chris and John, and probably really upset Mick and really upset me. And if I could even get through it I'd be lucky.\" Fortunately, she got through it. And continues to get through it as a highlight of her live performances both solo and with Fleetwood Mac.\n\n1. 'Landslide'\n\nThis reflective acoustic-guitar-driven ballad finds her pondering the aging process and the changes that come with it. She was 27 at the time and haunted by the thought that everything she'd spent her whole life working up to could come crashing down around her like an avalanche at any moment. \"Well, I've been afraid of changing 'Cause I've built my life around you,\" she sings, her trembling vocal as vulnerable as Nicks has ever sounded. \"But time makes you bolder / Even children get older / I'm getting older too.\" In the liner notes to \"Crystal Visions,\" Nicks is quoted saying that she wrote that song in Aspen, \"looking out at the Rocky Mountains pondering the avalanche of everything that had come crashing down on us ... at that moment, my life truly felt like a landslide in many ways.\"\n\nReach the reporter at ed.masley@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-4495.

Baby alligators have been reported in parking lots on the causeway that crosses Mobile Bay and along heavily traveled U.S. 98 in Daphne, WKRG-TV reports, so the city posted notes on social media asking residents to be careful, particularly with pets. Charles Epler of Wildlife Solutions, an animal removal services, said the sightings likely were linked to the weather. “They get pushed out. That heavy, torrential rain washes them out of where they’re at, and then they’re going to try and find somewhere else to set up shop,” Epler said. Daphne, a city of about 26,000, is located on the eastern shore of Mobile Bay. “About 83% of their diet in the wild is turtles. I think that’s why there’s so many over here in Daphne,” Epler said.\n\nAlaska\n\nFairbanks: A bus that people sometimes embarked on deadly pilgrimages to visit can now safely be viewed at the University of Alaska Fairbanks while it undergoes preservation work. The bus was moved to the school’s engineering facility last week while it’s being prepared for outdoor display at the Museum of the North, television station KTVF reports. The abandoned Fairbanks city bus became a shelter for hunters and others using the backcountry near Denali National Park and Preserve, but it was a beacon for those wishing to retrace the steps of Christopher McCandless, who hiked to the bus in 1992. The 24-year-old Virginia man died from starvation when he couldn’t hike back out because of the swollen Teklanika River. During his last days he kept a journal that was discovered when his body was found. McCandless’ ordeal was chronicled in Jon Krakauer’s 1996 book “Into the Wild,” followed later by director Sean Penn’s movie of the same name. People from all over the world made the bus a focal point and tried to retrace his steps. The state removed the bus located about 25 miles from the town of Healy after two women from Europe drowned on homages to the bus. There were 15 other search-and-rescue missions since 2009, the state Department of Natural Resources said in August 2020 when the bus was flown out of the wilderness.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Documents and training materials from the Arizona Department of Corrections’ servers contain images of a skull with a sword through it that experts liken to gang and white supremacist symbols. Corrections experts say the designs may offer a window into the mindset of the department’s Special Operations teams, reflecting an us-against-them mentality and members acting out militaristic fantasies, rather than rehabilitating prisoners. PowerPoint presentations featuring the skull and sword emblem also define the imagery. “Skull = Death before dishonor,” a slide says, while the shotguns are “tools of the trade,” and the eyes of the skull, embellished with gun sights, indicate: “We are always watching you.” Set to Guns N’ Roses’ “Welcome to the Jungle,” a training video depicts special operations teams responding to riots at the Yuma and Kingman prisons. The video contains graphic images of the aftermath, including zip-tied prisoners, officers using dogs to intimidate prisoners, blood-stained walls and floors, and nonlethal weapons used on inmates. Prisoners alleged special operations officers committed civil rights abuses in the aftermath of the deadly riot at the Yuma prison in March 2018. Thirty-seven people were injured, one prisoner died, and six officers were fired and criminally charged for destroying prisoner property.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Wednesday effectively approved a new law that will allow employees to opt out of COVID-19 vaccine requirements, a move by fellow Republicans to challenge federal vaccine mandates. Hutchinson allowed the measure to become law without his signature despite his concerns about the impact it will have on businesses in the state. The new law won’t take effect until early next year. In Arkansas, a bill becomes law after it sits on the governor’s desk for five days without any action. Governors have traditionally used that approach to express opposition to legislation without prompting a veto fight with the Legislature. Hutchinson said the amount of time before the opt-out law takes effect gives the state more time to weigh its impact on businesses and for any court challenges to be filed. But he also called the proposal unnecessary and counterproductive. “The debate on these bills has been harmful to our goal of increasing vaccination rates in Arkansas,” he told reporters. The measure requires employers to allow workers to opt out of COVID-19 vaccine requirements if they’re tested weekly for the coronavirus or can prove they have antibodies. Health officials have said antibody tests should not be used to assess immunity, those who’ve recovered should still get vaccinated.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSanta Barbara: A wildfire raging through Southern California coastal mountains threatened ranches and rural homes and kept a major highway shut down Wednesday as the fire-scarred state faced a new round of dry winds that raise risk of flames. The Alisal Fire covered more than 22 square miles in the Santa Ynez Mountains west of Santa Barbara, and the number of firefighters was nearly doubled to 1,300, with more on the way. Containment remained at 5%. While the scenic region along the Pacific shoreline is lightly populated, the blaze was a threat to more than 100 homes, ranches and other buildings, fire officials said. Fire crews were protecting Rancho del Cielo, which was once owned by Ronald and Nancy Reagan and was known as the Western White House during his presidency. The 688-acre ranch where Reagan hosted world leaders sits atop the mountain range, above the flames feeding on dense chaparral and grasses. The area hadn’t burned since 1955, according to the conservative youth organization Young America’s Foundation, which now operates the ranch. Crews also protected an Exxon/Mobil gas processing facility in a canyon surrounded by flames. The fire erupted Monday near the Alisal Reservoir and swept down through the mountains, forcing the closure of U.S. 101. At one point, the fire jumped the highway and reached a beach.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Colorado will include gender confirmation care in its individual and small-group health insurance plans, state and federal officials announced Tuesday. The state’s plan under the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will include jaw, cheek and eye modifications, face tightening, facial bone remodeling for facial feminization, breast or chest construction and reductions, and laser hair removal. Additional health benefits for Colorado’s plan include an annual mental health exam and expanded coverage of opioid alternatives for pain management, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis said. The new plan adds 15 drugs as alternatives and will cover up to six acupuncture visits per year, according to the Colorado Division of Insurance. The changes will go into effect Jan. 1, 2023. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services approved Colorado’s request to provide gender-confirming care as part of the state’s “essential health benefits,” which are requirements for individual and small-employer plans set forth under former the Affordable Care Act. Christy Mallory, legal director at the Williams Institute, a research institute based in the University of California Los Angeles’ School of Law, said without insurance, much of gender-confirming care is “prohibitively expensive,” so Colorado’s move increases access to medically necessary care for trans people.\n\nConnecticut\n\nStorrs: President Joe Biden plans to visit the University of Connecticut on Friday for the dedication of a human rights center named after former U.S. Sens. Thomas and Christopher Dodd. The Dodd Center for Human Rights serves as an umbrella home for the school’s human rights programs and archives. Those include the Human Rights Institute, which houses the largest undergraduate and graduate human rights program at a public university in the U.S., and Dodd Impact, which focuses on community-based human rights initiatives. It had been known as the Thomas J. Dodd Research Center since its opening in 1995, named for the late senator who also was a lead prosecutor for the International Military Tribunal in Nuremberg, Germany, after World War II. UConn’s Board of Trustees voted in August to change the name to the Dodd Center for Human Rights to recognize the work of both Democratic senators and their family. “I’m deeply grateful to UConn for recognizing me and my family by dedicating the Dodd Center for Human Rights, and I’m honored that my good friend President Biden is joining us to mark this occasion,” said former Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, who is Thomas Dodd’s son. He served as a senator from 1981 to 2011, gaining a reputation as a human rights advocate for his work to end abuses in Central America.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: State Auditor Kathy McGuiness turned herself in to authorities and pleaded not guilty to corruption charges Tuesday morning. Accompanied by her attorney, McGuiness entered the Leonard L. Williams Justice Center just before 10 a.m. to turn herself in to Delaware Capitol Police. Steve Wood, her attorney, told the court in a brief hearing that she pleaded not guilty to the charges, including felony theft and intimidation, as well as public service misdemeanors like official misconduct. The basis of the charges is that she violated conflict-of-interest laws by arranging a job for her daughter and her daughter’s friend in the auditor’s office, that she rigged public payments to a campaign consultant to avoid regulatory scrutiny, and that she sought to spy on and intimidate those who questioned her conduct. McGuiness and Wood opposed prosecutors’ request that she be barred from speaking about the case to her daughter. Deputy Attorney General Mark Denney argued that Elizabeth McGuiness is an “unindicted co-conspirator” and a witness. But “to say to a mother that you may not talk to your young daughter about probably the most traumatic event that has occurred for either of them in their lives is unnecessary and inhumane,” Wood argued to the court. The judge sided with McGuiness’ attorney and denied the request.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The Washington National Cathedral formally dedicated a new stone carving of Holocaust survivor and Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel in a ceremony Wednesday, WUSA-TV reports. The carving, completed in April, shows Wiesel’s likeness inside the cathedral’s Human Rights Porch, which features carvings of leading human rights defenders throughout history, including Rosa Parks, Mother Teresa, Jonathan Daniels and Eleanor Roosevelt. The dedication was a collaboration among the cathedral, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and the Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity. “From surviving the Holocaust to becoming one of the world’s leading lights in preserving the memory of that unspeakable tragedy forevermore, we owe a great debt of gratitude to Elie Wiesel,” Cathedral Dean Randy Hollerith said. “It is an honor to have his memory and his legacy included in our Human Rights Porch so he can serve as a reminder of the consequences of hate, as well as the resiliency and indomitability of the human spirit.” Wednesday’s ceremony featured remarks from former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and author John Meacham, who is canon historian of the cathedral. A survivor of the Auschwitz and Buchenwald camps, Wiesel told his story to millions through his autobiographical novel “Night.”\n\nFlorida\n\nDaytona Beach: A statue of Black educator Mary McLeod Bethune will be on display for two months in the city before heading to its permanent home in the U.S. Capitol, where it’s replacing a sculpture of a Confederate soldier as one of two statues from the Sunshine State in the building’s National Statuary Hall. The 11-foot marble statue of Bethune, a civil rights leader and adviser to President Franklin Roosevelt, was unveiled Monday at the News-Journal Center in Daytona Beach. The statue depicts Bethune, a founder of Bethune-Cookman University in Daytona Beach, wearing a graduation cap and gown and holding a black rose. Early next year, Bethune will become the first Black woman represented in the National Statuary Hall, where each state has two likenesses of prominent native sons and daughters. “The sculpture is a gleaming representation of what is possible with unyielding tenacity and dogged determination,” Daytona Beach Mayor Derrick Henry said. The statue of Bethune replaces one of Confederate Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith. Confederate monuments across the country have fallen in recent years amid contentious debate over whether they are proud monuments to Southern heritage or hated symbols of racism and past slavery.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A judge on Wednesday dismissed a lawsuit alleging fraud in the state’s most populous county during the 2020 election. The suit sought a review of some 147,000 absentee ballots to see if any were illegitimate. Originally filed in December, the lawsuit that alleged evidence of fraudulent ballots and improper ballot counting in Fulton County was filed by nine Georgia voters and spearheaded by Garland Favorito, a longtime critic of the state’s election systems. Henry County Superior Court Chief Judge Brian Amero’s order dismissing the case said the voters who brought the suit “failed to allege a particularized injury” and therefore lacked the standing to claim their state constitutional rights to equal protection and due process had been violated. Amero also noted that Georgia’s Secretary of State’s Office had provided a “substantive and detailed response” to his request for an update on any investigations into allegations of fraudulent or counterfeit ballots in Fulton County. Favorito expressed frustration after the ruling, saying his team had “prepared diligently to show the evidence of our allegations” at a hearing the judge had previously scheduled for Nov. 15. Angered by his narrow loss in a traditionally red state, former President Donald Trump had focused his fury on Georgia and particularly on Fulton County.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state has not experienced a large spike in evictions despite the expiration of state and federal moratoriums meant to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and protect renters during the pandemic’s economic downturn. Tracey Wiltgen, executive director of the Mediation Center of the Pacific, said her organization has handled more cases in recent months but not as many as she anticipated, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Between Aug. 7 and Oct. 2, the center opened 565 eviction cases for mediation – fewer than the 1,000-1,500 cases it had expected. Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, Wiltgen said, the center mediated about 200 eviction cases per month. A state-level moratorium ended Aug. 6. A few weeks later, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a federal moratorium that was announced by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. David Chee, an attorney who mostly represents landlords, said some cases are being kept out of court because tenants are choosing to leave their units without fighting the eviction. “A lot of tenants have just run away,” Chee said. “So once the moratoriums were done, a lot of tenants, as soon as they figured out their landlords were going to evict them, just simply left.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little said Tuesday that he wants to use federal coronavirus relief money to increase day care capacity to help alleviate the state’s worker shortage. The Republican governor, in a speech about the future of work that was followed by several questions, said expanding day care could help get more workers back in the workforce. Idaho’s current unemployment rate of 2.9% puts the state back at pre-pandemic levels last seen in early 2020, a span that includes a period of double-digit unemployment as COVID-19 spread and jobs evaporated. But now, many employers can’t find enough workers. “We know part of that is parents who are staying home,” Little said. “We think we can take some one-time money and build some (day care) capacity.” The U.S. Department of Labor has said the national unemployment rate last month dropped from 5.2% to 4.8%. Officials said 194,000 people found work, a tepid number and evidence that the pandemic remained a problem, with many companies struggling to fill millions of open jobs. Idaho has had problems with the coronavirus’ highly contagious delta variant, with the state currently on crisis standards of care due to so many unvaccinated patients filling hospitals. Crisis care standards mean scarce resources such as intensive care beds will be allotted to the patients most likely to survive.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The head of a police union has called on its members to defy the city’s requirement to report their COVID-19 vaccination status by Friday or be placed on unpaid leave. In the video posted online Tuesday and first reported on by the Chicago Sun-Times, Fraternal Order of Police President John Catanzara vowed to take Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s administration to court if it tries to enforce the mandate, which requires city workers to report their vaccine status by the end of the workweek. After Friday, unvaccinated workers who won’t submit to semiweekly coronavirus testing will be placed on unpaid leave. Catanzara suggested that if the city does enforce its requirement, and many union members refuse to comply with it, “it’s safe to say that the city of Chicago will have a police force at 50% or less for this weekend coming up.” In the video, Catanzara instructs officers to file for exemptions to receiving the vaccine but not to enter that information into the city’s vaccine portal. He said that although he has made clear his vaccine status, “I do not believe the city has the authority to mandate that to anybody, let alone that information about your medical history.” During a news conference Wednesday, Lightfoot accused Cantazara of spreading false information and dismissed most of his statements as “untrue or patently false.”\n\nIndiana\n\nBloomington: Monroe County officials are buying part of a site dotted with old limestone quarries for a possible tourist destination despite chemical contamination found in the area. The Monroe County Council this past week approve the $370,000 purchase of nearly 30 acres near Bloomington just northwest of the Interstate 69 and Indiana 46 interchange. County leaders have discussed over the past couple years buying about 100 acres of wooded former quarry property with the idea of building trails, exhibits about the limestone industry and an outdoor concert venue. Tests by an Indiana University researcher have found low contamination levels of polychlorinated biphenyls in sections of the quarry site not yet purchased by the county. Several sites around Bloomington contaminated with the toxic industrial chemicals have faced multimillion-dollar cleanups since the 1980s. County Council member Kate Wiltz said the proposed park project could acknowledge the negative impact of industrial pollution on the community while being a tribute to the area’s limestone heritage. “I think that’s a side of parks and public lands that we don’t often promote, but that’s every bit as important reason to purchase and steward the property,” Wiltz said.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: With the threat of a United Auto Workers strike looming, Deere & Co. managers told employees at factories across the state not to come in Wednesday. Workers said managers ordered third-shift employees in Waterloo not to report to work at their usual 11 p.m. start time. Employees at the company’s Ankeny and Ottumwa plants said Deere also canceled their second shifts. Employees are working under a contract that expires Friday, but the UAW told Deere that its 10,100 members will go on strike Thursday morning if the two sides cannot reach a tentative agreement. Workers have not gone on strike against Deere since 1986. UAW International spokesperson Brian Rothenberg said Wednesday that his team was looking into reports of temporary layoffs. “We’ve gotten no formal notification about anything,” he said. In addition to plants in Ankeny, Ottumwa and Waterloo, the UAW represents Deere workers in Davenport and Dubuque, as well as in Illinois and Kansas. The Waterloo plant, with about 3,000 members, is Deere’s largest. On Sunday, UAW members overwhelmingly rejected a proposed six-year contract with Deere that would have raised wages and bolstered current employees’ retirement payments while ending traditional pensions for new hires, who would participate in an enhanced 401(k) plan.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: The City Council has passed an ordinance aimed at banning discrimination in housing, employment and public accommodations. After four months of delays, the council voted 6-1 to approve the measure Tuesday, the Wichita Eagle reports. Council member Jeff Blubaugh cast the lone dissenting vote. Council members rejected a proposed exemption that would have allowed religious groups to fire or refuse to hire LGBTQ individuals, an amendment proposed by council member Jared Cerullo, the first openly gay man to serve on the council. Cerullo said the proposed amendment would help bridge the divide between religious groups who opposed it and those who wanted it. But council members Becky Tuttle and Cindy Claycomb said it would “dilute” the ordinance. The measure seeks to prohibit discrimination based on age, color, disability, familial status, gender identity, genetic information, national origin or ancestry, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, citizenship, veteran status or any other factor protected by law. The city will begin accepting complaints under the ordinance Jan. 1.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Democratic U.S. Rep. John Yarmuth, the influential chairman of the House Budget Committee who has played a key role in pushing for President Joe Biden’s agenda to expand the nation’s social safety net, announced Tuesday that he will not seek another term in next year’s election. At age 74, Yarmuth – first elected to Congress in 2006, when he unseated a Republican incumbent in his Louisville-area district – said he wanted to spend more time with his family. The congressman is the 10th Democrat to announce plans to retire ahead of the 2022 election. Although the district he represents has become increasingly blue, the retirement of a Democrat in a senior leadership position sends yet another ominous sign about the party’s chances heading into next year’s midterms, when its thin majority in both U.S. chambers will be at stake. The party that wins control of the White House typically loses congressional seats in subsequent elections. Yarmuth is the only Democrat in Kentucky’s six-member U.S. House delegation. State Sen. Morgan McGarvey, the top-ranking Democrat in the GOP-controlled state Senate, quickly announced he’d run for the seat. State Rep. Attica Scott was already waging a primary challenge against Yarmuth, and his son, Aaron Yarmuth, said he is weighing throwing his hat in the ring.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Billionaire Richard Branson said it was an honor and a once-in-a-lifetime experience to don a drum major’s uniform and march ahead of a New Orleans high school band. But some of the Catholic school’s fans apparently were less enthusiastic about Branson’s appearance last week with the St. Augustine High School Marching 100 – the band that integrated an exclusive Mardi Gras parade. The band and Branson paraded to a new Virgin Hotel in New Orleans as part of opening ceremonies Thursday. “I’ve had quite a few exciting experiences in my time, but I’ve never got (a) chance to lead a marching band before – let alone the best marching band in the world,” Branson wrote on his blog Friday. “What an honour to join the legendary St. Augustine High School band for a performance through the streets of New Orleans.” Aulston G. Taylor, president and CEO of the school, tweeted a letter late Sunday acknowledging that many people had told him only students who have earned it should be allowed to wear the purple and gold uniform. Others felt that “Sir Branson adorning our drum major uniform with honor across his millions of followers was great for the school and sets us apart as a global brand,” he wrote. He said both viewpoints are valid.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Republicans in the state Senate want to return to taxpayers a portion of the surplus that accumulated during the pandemic, thanks in part to historic federal assistance. The “Give It Back” plan is seen as a major piece of the GOP’s messaging push ahead of the 2022 legislative session and comes as former Republican Gov. Paul LePage seeks to unseat current Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, the Bangor Daily News reports. The plan calls for splitting unused monthly revenue, sending half to the state’s rainy day fund and half to taxpaying residents. The proposal is in line with LePage’s campaign promise of eliminating Maine’s income tax if he wins in 2022. Mills has overseen a healthy state budget during her time as governor despite higher spending. A spokesperson for her administration called the GOP proposal a tacit acknowledgement of the state’s good fiscal situation under Mills’ leadership, according to the newspaper. Maine Republican legislators have fought with Mills over the $1 billion in federal relief that was used to bail state government out during the pandemic. Party leaders have called the aid excessive.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The city’s public schools are using software that alerts officials when a student using one of the system’s laptops might be considering suicide. Since March, GoGuardian’s Beacon software has identified nine students as having a severe mental health crisis. All were taken to an emergency room, Stacey Davis, the city schools’ coordinator of media and instructional technology, told The Baltimore Sun. But the practice, which came about as the system loaned out laptops for students’ home use during the pandemic, is raising questions about privacy and equity. Two recent reports warn that such technology could be used for disciplinary purposes, unintentionally out LGBTQ students or squash student expression. They also note that economically disadvantaged students may be tracked more frequently because school-owned laptops may be their only devices. “Privacy and equity was not being considered as much as it needs to be,” said Elizabeth Laird, director of equity in civic technology at the Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington and co-author of one of the reports. “Student activity monitoring is quite widespread.” Baltimore schools have gotten 786 alerts from Beacon since March. Of those, clinicians responded 401 times, and school police went to homes 12 times.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBarnstable: A rare two-headed diamondback terrapin turtle is alive and kicking – with all six of its legs – at the Birdsey Cape Wildlife Center after hatching a little over two weeks ago. A threatened species in the state, this turtle is feeding well on bloodworms and food pellets, staff at the center said. The two heads operate independently, coming up for air at different times, and inside its shell are two gastrointestinal systems to feed both sides of its body. The turtle originally came from a nest in West Barnstable that researchers determined was in a hazardous location and needed to be moved. After hatching, turtles in these so-called head start nests are sent to different care centers to be monitored before their release in the spring. Center veterinarian Pria Patel and other staff members will continue to monitor the turtle, which they nicknamed Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen after the twins who rose to prominence as child actors, beginning with “Full House” in 1987 when they were babies, and now are the famously elusive designers behind fashion label The Row. The staff is hoping to perform a CT scan to learn more about the turtle’s circulatory system.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Backers of former President Donald Trump will launch a ballot drive to require a “full forensic audit” of the 2020 presidential election, rallygoers were told Tuesday. Jon Rocha, of Portage, a Republican who is running against U.S. Rep. Fred Upton, R-St. Joseph, said he expects paperwork for the legislative initiative to be filed with the Board of State Canvassers next week. “This is how a revolution begins,” Rocha told several hundred people gathered on the state Capitol lawn. If about 340,000 valid signatures are collected, and the measure is approved by the GOP-controlled Legislature, “it is absolutely veto-proof,” Rocha said. “That’s the best part about it.” Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer “cannot stop this bill.” Should lawmakers fail to act on the measure, it would go to voters at the November 2022 election, he said. Though ill-defined, a “forensic audit” is the phrase that has been embraced by large numbers of people unhappy with the result of the 2020 presidential election, in which President Joe Biden, a Democrat, defeated Trump, a Republican. Biden won 306 to 232 in the Electoral College and by more than 7 million popular votes. Biden prevailed in Michigan by more than 150,000 votes. Several private donors have agreed to help fund the effort, Rocha said. He would not name them.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Moccasin maker Minnetonka is publicly apologizing for making money off Native American culture and promised to do more to support Indigenous communities in the future after 75 years in business. In a statement posted Monday on Minnetonka’s website, CEO David Miller said the company is not a Native-owned business. He noted the Minneapolis-based firm acknowledged its appropriation in summer 2020 but said this public apology was long overdue. “We deeply and meaningfully apologize for having benefited from selling Native-inspired designs without directly honoring Native culture or communities,” Miller said. The company timed the apology to coincide with Indigenous Peoples Day. To better address the needs of the Native American community, Minnetonka said it has hired Adrienne Benjamin – a Minnesotan, Anishinaabe, and a member of the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe – as a reconciliation advisor. The company said it’s also making a concerted effort to improve diversity, equity and inclusion of underrepresented groups and will seek out more partnerships with Native-owned businesses as vendors and suppliers. In the past year, it has done business with two different Native-owned companies, the company said.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Students who left college at least two years ago without a degree can apply for a grant to help them return to and finish school. The W.K. Kellogg Foundation recently awarded the Mississippi Institutions of Higher Learning $1.3 million to fund the state’s Complete 2 Compete tuition assistance grants through 2023. The Complete 2 Compete program provides one-on-one support for adult learners who have earned college credits – but not a degree – and works with them to complete their education. Qualifying returning students can receive a $1,000 grant that can be renewed every semester. The award helps pay for any coursework needed to graduate and can help repay prior debt. Funds can be used at any Mississippi public universities or community colleges. A total of 2,400 students have graduated since the program launched in 2017. More than 200,000 prior students qualify for the Complete 2 Compete program, according to a press release from the Mississippi Community College Board. Since May, the program has reached out to former students through postcards as well as internet and social media ads. More than 2,700 former students’ applications were processed over the summer, with 620 returning to enroll in one of 15 community colleges, eight universities and a medical center.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: A federal judge has struck down the state’s requirement that a majority of the owners of companies that dispense, grow or manufacture marijuana must be Missouri residents. U.S. District Judge Nanette Laughrey last week issued a permanent injunction against the residency requirement, The Kansas City Star reports. She had issued a temporary injunction in June. Missouri voters approved creation of a medical marijuana industry in the state in 2018. One of the regulations required that state-licensed marijuana cultivation plants, dispensaries and manufacturing facilities must be at least 51% owned by people who had lived in Missouri for at least one year. Mark Toigo, a Pennsylvania-based investor, filed a lawsuit last December challenging the requirement, arguing that it violated the U.S. Constitution’s commerce clause. Lisa Cox, a spokeswoman for the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, said in a statement that the agency is “happy to have clarity on how we should handle the ownership residency requirement in the Missouri Constitution and will comply with the court’s decision.” The health department oversees the medical marijuana program.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A lawsuit filed Tuesday is challenging a new state law banning voter registration and get-out-the-vote efforts in certain areas of college campuses. The lawsuit filed by the Montana Democratic Party, Montanans for Tester and University of Montana student Macee Patritti is one of several challenging the law passed by the Republican-dominated Legislature earlier this year. The plaintiffs argue the law is suppressing the vote of young people, who typically favor Democratic candidates. The law prohibits political committees including student organizations from conducting voter registration drives and other political activities inside certain high-traffic public university spaces including residence halls, dining facilities and athletic facilities. The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Missoula argues the law “imposes arbitrary, vague, and onerous restrictions on the rights of college students” to participate fully in the political process. Patritti, a 19-year-old freshman, registered students to vote at the Montana Technological University in Butte as an intern with the Montana Democratic Party ahead of the 2020 election, according to the court filing. The plaintiffs argue that her First Amendment rights to political expression would be curtailed under the new law, which would prohibit such activities.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The University of Nebraska-Lincoln has announced a five-year ban on Phi Gamma Delta fraternity for student conduct code violations following a report of a sexual assault at the fraternity’s house in August. The report led to a protest of about 1,000 people outside the fraternity house Aug. 25 and sparked similar protests on college campuses around the country. The UNL chapter of Phi Gamma Delta – better known as Fiji – was temporarily suspended in late August while the university investigated possible violations of a previous probation. The university said Tuesday in a news release that an investigation by the University Conduct Board showed violations had occurred and that Fiji is no longer recognized by the university. The fraternity is suspended from the Lincoln campus at least through 2026, the release said. Fiji was already on probation for previous violations of university policy when the assault was reported. That report is still being actively investigated by the University Police Department, according to the university.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: The state’s top election official is challenging the status of two ballot measures that Nevada’s largest teachers union promised to withdraw after successfully using them as bargaining chips and pressuring legislators to boost education funding. In a Sept. 7 letter first published by the Las Vegas Review-Journal, Republican Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske wrote that state law required she include measures that propose raising taxes on sales and gambling on the 2022 ballot. Neither Democrats nor Nevada’s powerful resort industry want the tax measures to appear before voters next year, both have said. Democrats worry their inclusion could allow Republicans to frame the election around taxes. And resorts and casinos do not want to risk a hike that could deter tourists from visiting Las Vegas. The initiatives originated almost a year ago, when the Clark County Education Association submitted the tens of thousands of signatures necessary to qualify the two proposals for the 2022 ballot. John Vellardita, the teachers union’s executive director, said in March that the measures were designed to “start a conversation” about education funding and said they’d remain on the ballot unless lawmakers increased education funding before adjourning in June, which they did.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state’s Executive Council on Wednesday rejected $27 million in federal funds for vaccination outreach, thrilling outspoken activists who previously derailed a public meeting and delayed the vote. Several were arrested Wednesday after audience members repeatedly interrupted the debate. Among other things, the money would have allowed the state to hire a public health manager and a dozen workers to promote the COVID-19 vaccines and address public concerns about them. Opponents argued the grant language would have required the state to comply with any “future directives” issued by the Biden administration regarding COVID-19, such as vaccine mandates. The same language has appeared in other grants accepted by the council, a five-member body that approves state contracts. And it does not in any way impede the state’s sovereignty, said both Attorney General John Formella and Republican Gov. Chris Sununu. “I appreciate that you have concerns, but they’re based on fantasy,” Sununu told Councilor Joe Kenney. All four of the Republican councilors voted against the grants. “You want the government to tell private businesses who to hire and fire?” the governor said. “That is completely un-American.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nKearny: The state has awarded a contract to replace a century-old rail bridge that has been the source of regular delays for years, officials announced Tuesday. The $1.56 billion contract is the largest in NJ Transit’s history, CEO Kevin Corbett said in a statement. The board of directors approved a joint venture by Sweden-based Skanska and Traylor Brothers, a civil construction company based in Evansville, Indiana. Construction is expected to take about five years. The Portal North Bridge is to replace a 111-year-old swing bridge over the Hackensack River that occasionally becomes stuck after it opens to allow boats to pass and must be manually hammered back into place. The new bridge will allow marine traffic to pass underneath without interrupting rail traffic. The project completed its design phase and received environmental approvals several years ago but languished while New York and New Jersey officials squabbled with the Trump administration over dividing up the costs between the states and the federal government. “Few infrastructure projects are as critical to the nation as replacing the aging Portal Bridge,” Democratic New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said in a statement.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: After seven years of mining, federal officials say work to carve out the eighth disposal area at the U.S. government’s underground nuclear waste repository is complete. Managers at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant are planning to use the space beginning next year. Workers still need to run power to the excavated area known as Panel 8 and install air monitors and chain link to protect the walls. Constructed in a deep layer of salt in southern New Mexico, the repository entombs the radioactive remnants of decades of nuclear research and bomb-making. That includes special boxes and barrels packed with lab coats, rubber gloves, tools and debris contaminated with plutonium and other radioactive elements. Having enough space for the waste became more of an issue in 2014, when a radiation release contaminated parts of the underground facility and forced an expensive, nearly three-year closure. Some parts of the repository became off-limits. State regulators currently are weighing a permit change that some critics say could open the door to expanded operations at the repository. A decision is expected this year. In operation for more than two decades, the repository has received nearly 13,000 shipments. The idea is that the shifting salt will eventually encapsulate the waste after the underground vaults are filled and sealed.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A $2 billion project to build a rail link to LaGuardia Airport was officially put on hold Tuesday, after weeks of criticism from public officials and a lawsuit from neighborhood and environmental groups. In a news release, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said it is pausing the project to consider alternatives. In recent weeks, Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul had criticized the project, championed by her predecessor, Andrew Cuomo. Democratic U.S. Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, who represents part of the area through which the link would pass, also has spoken out against it, as has outgoing Mayor Bill de Blasio. The Federal Aviation Administration issued environmental approval in July but recently had asked the Port Authority to reconsider in light of a lawsuit filed by neighborhood and environmental groups. Preliminary construction on the roughly $2 billion, 1.5-mile elevated link was to begin this year. Public transit officials have sought for years to build a rail link to LaGuardia, one of the few major U.S. airports without rail service. Critics had opposed the plan, saying it would negatively impact Queens neighborhoods and wouldn’t be appreciably faster than driving, as it would involve taking a train or subway from points east or west to a stop serving CitiField, home of the New York Mets, then switching to the rail link.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: A jail violated regulations requiring guards to observe inmates at least twice an hour, according to a state agency probing the deaths of two inmates last spring. On May 22, John Devin Haley, 41, of Charlotte, was found hanging below his cell window at the Mecklenburg County jail with a strip of blanket tied around his neck, The Charlotte Observer reports. Haley had a history of addiction and mental health problems when he entered the jail April 3 and was temporarily placed on suicide watch, according to jail records. Karon Golightly of Gastonia died at the jail May 14. Five months later, the cause of his death has not been made public, the newspaper reports. In North Carolina, jailers are required to observe each inmate “at least twice an hour on an irregular basis, with no more than 40 minutes between rounds,” according to state regulations. That standard was repeatedly violated in the hours leading up to the two deaths, according to investigators with the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services. A DHHS report obtained by the newspaper says 52 minutes elapsed between the time Golightly was seen healthy and being discovered in distress in another inmate’s cell. The state also pointed to a camera near where Golightly collapsed that apparently was malfunctioning.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Budget writers in the Legislature began mulling proposals Tuesday on how to spend hundreds of millions of dollars in federal coronavirus aid the state received this year. House and Senate appropriations committees met separately in all-day meetings at the Capitol, listening to pitches from fellow lawmakers and others on a wish list that totaled $9.2 billion – significantly more than the $1.1 billion in federal coronavirus relief funds transferred to the state-owned Bank of North Dakota in June. The meetings, attended heavily by lobbyists, were the first in a series being held this month to prioritize projects ahead of a Nov. 8 special session, when the full GOP-led Legislature will debate the proposals. The $1.1 billion in federal coronavirus funds represents the single-largest deposit into state coffers in history. The money currently is parked in short-term CDs, earning less than 1% interest. Senate Appropriations Chairman Ray Holmberg and his counterpart in the House, Jeff Delzer, said priority for the funding will be given to water, sewer and infrastructure projects, for which there is an immediate need, and those that won’t require a commitment of funds from taxpayers in the future.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Recreational marijuana would be legalized for adults 21 and older under Republican legislation coming in the state House that would levy a 10% sales tax on the product, a lawmaker announced Tuesday. Ohio facilities currently producing and processing medical marijuana would be grandfathered into the program, with new producers to be added to meet the expected demand, said Rep. Jamie Callender, R-Lake County. He said he’s currently looking for co-sponsors for the legislation, which has been in the works for months. The bill “is the responsible approach for adult use,” Callender said. A quarter of the sales tax revenue would go to police departments to purchase equipment used in detecting impaired drivers and another quarter toward addiction and recovery programs. The remaining 50% would not be earmarked, which could help the state during a precarious economic time, Callender said. In addition to the legislation being announced Tuesday, a separate ballot issue to legalize marijuana use and sales in Ohio is underway. A spokesperson for the Coalition to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol, which proposed that statute, said Tuesday that the group applauded Callender’s plan and said it continues to welcome the chance to work with the Legislature on passing a recreational marijuana bill.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A retired New York attorney is suing the Oklahoma Department of Corrections, saying its claim to have no records pertaining to the drugs it plans to use in upcoming executions “defies belief.” Fred Hodara, who filed the lawsuit Tuesday in Oklahoma County District Court, is asking the court to compel the corrections department to comply with his open records requests for documentation of its execution plans. He said in his lawsuit that in response to his requests for the records, including some the department is legally required to keep, the department told him none exist, the Tulsa World reports. “In light of the scope and nature of the requests, the assertation defies belief,” the lawsuit said, arguing that the agency has a history of refusing to search for and produce records that are subject to the state’s Open Records Act. A department spokesman told the newspaper that the department doesn’t comment on pending litigation. Oklahoma is preparing to execute John Marion Grant on Oct. 28. It would be the state’s first execution since 2015, when then-Gov. Mary Fallin put a moratorium on capital punishment following the execution of Charles Warner with a drug that wasn’t authorized to be used that way.\n\nOregon\n\nKeizer: Republican state lawmaker Bill Post has announced his resignation from the Legislature after saying he misunderstood the residency requirements for being in office when he moved out of Oregon. His resignation announced Tuesday will be effective Nov. 30. Post previously said he wouldn’t seek reelection in 2022 but said Tuesday that he would resign after “discussions with an elections attorney.” Post, a former talk radio host, has served in the Oregon House of Representatives since 2015. He and his wife moved to Fallon, Nevada, which is east of Reno. In a Sept. 27 Facebook message, Post said his wife accepted a job, and they had sold their Keizer house and bought one in Fallon. He said he’d be in the district “at least once per month.” “My intent was to be open with my constituents about my move out of state and the steps I’d be taking to continue to fulfill my duties for the rest of my term to the best of my knowledge and ability,” Post said in a statement. Republican precinct committee members from House District 25 will select three to five candidates to replace Post. County commissioners from Marion and Yamhill counties will then choose a candidate to serve out the remainder of Post’s term. A Republican has held the seat since 2003.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nYork: Love was unexpectedly on the court docket when a man accused of murder made an unusual request of the judge who will preside over his trial. Kashawn Flowers’ lawyer on Tuesday asked York County Judge Harry Ness whether he’d consider marrying Flowers and his girlfriend. Attorney Brian Perry acknowledged it was the first time he had ever made such a request. Flowers is accused of gunning down a man in York in August 2014. His girlfriend would not be a witness at the trial, his attorney said. Prosecutors did not object, and neither did the judge. But the marriage is on hold until after the trial. “We’ll take care of it next week,” the judge said. Flowers remains held in the county jail without bail.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A series of controversial murals at a school have been painted over following criticism that they depicted children of color in a disparaging light. Among the four painted panels at Robert F. Kennedy Elementary School, only one shows children with different skin tones together, while the others show varying races separated. Two white children are shown playing on a beach in one scene, while two Black children build a snowman in another. Meanwhile, in a separate image, other children of color tidy up the school and collect trash. City Councilman David Salvatore said he received complaints about the murals, focusing in part on their apparent themes of inequality and segregation, and held community meetings on the issue. Initially, Salvatore explored the idea of removing the murals, preserving them and putting them on display, though he said it would have cost tens of thousands of dollars. Eventually, the murals were painted over just before the school year began. Considerations for a new mural will be made. The city’s decision generated backlash from state Rep. Anastasia Williams, who said the paintings represented desegregation and anti-racism to her. Officials have been unable to find any mention of the murals in city archives; it’s only known that they were painted decades ago.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Two civil rights groups are suing the state, saying lawmakers are taking too long to draw new maps for U.S. and state House districts. Candidates are required to file to run for the 2022 races by the end of March, but time is running out for potential candidates to research the new districts and settle any lawsuits asking judges to decide if the new maps are fair, according to the suit. It was filed Tuesday by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People with assistance from the American Civil Liberties Union. The groups are asking a panel of three federal judges to set a specific timeline for maps to be drawn and approved and not allow any elections until the new districts get judicial approval. The suit said lawmakers should have kept to suggestions when they adjourned in June that there would be a special session in September or October to approve maps. Those plans became less firm as lawmakers dealt with the aftermath of a budget provision that prevented districts from passing mask requirements this school year. South Carolina Senate President Harvey Peeler called for an Oct. 12 special session last month but canceled it about a week later, saying a committee working on the school district issues wouldn’t be finished in time.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Zoo officials say COVID-19 may have killed a snow leopard. The animal, named Baya, died at the Great Plains Zoo on Thursday of a respiratory illness that might have been COVID-19. Coronavirus test results are pending. The snow leopard began coughing Oct. 3. By Oct. 4 she was acting lethargic and wouldn’t eat. Zoo veterinarians gave Baya antibiotics Thursday, but she was in critical condition later in the day. Baya was 21/ 2 years old and had been at the zoo since early 2021. Officials had hoped she would mate with another snow leopard named Strut. Zoo officials said Monday that an Amur tiger at the zoo tested positive for the virus Oct. 6, the day before Baya died. Five other big cats at the zoo have shown COVID-19 symptoms, including Strut. Most of the animals have been on antibiotics and are improving, said Matt Eschenbrenner, the zoo’s director of animal care and conservation. He said the zoo hopes to bring in another snow leopard to replace Baya, but it’s unclear when that animal might arrive. “We can’t even think about bringing in another animal until we know everything has passed and our animals are healthy, 100%,” Eschenbrenner said.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Three U.S. Postal Service workers died in a shooting spree at a sorting facility Tuesday, including a supervisor, a manager and a letter carrier temporarily assigned to the postal annex, relatives and co-workers said. Two workers were fatally shot by a third who died from a self-inflicted gunshot, authorities said. The FBI and U.S. Postal Service didn’t immediately name those involved. The postal facility reopened Wednesday. Laquita Benjamin, president of the local branch of the National Association of Postal Supervisors, said those killed were a carrier, a supervisor and a manager. “You can’t just relate it to the Postal Service because you have school shootings, store shootings – you have shootings all over,” Benjamin said. A family member identified one of the dead as James Wilson, a manager at the East Lamar Carrier Annex in Orange Mound, a historic Memphis neighborhood. “He was a humble soul, one of the nicest supervising managers you could ever wish there was,” Roxanne Rogers said of Wilson, her cousin. Rogers, herself a postal worker, said Wilson had just returned to the annex after filling in at a different location. Melvin Richardson, president of the American Postal Workers Union Local 96, said the annex is only used by employees.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The U.S. Justice Department on Wednesday launched an investigation into allegations of widespread mistreatment at the state’s embattled youth lockups, where at least 11 staffers have been arrested on sexual abuse charges in recent years. The move by the Biden administration is the latest sign of trouble for the Texas Juvenile Justice Department, which for more than a decade has been beset by scandal, staff shake-ups and investigations into allegations of abuse. Just last week, a former coach at a West Texas facility was arrested on charges alleging that he touched the breast of an 18-year-old in custody. The announcement comes a year after advocates in Texas filed a complaint with federal investigators that outlined “grave problems” at the state’s five youth lockups. Texas put more than 800 youths in state juvenile detention in 2019 – more than any other state – according to an agency report published in September. “Being subjected to harmful conditions does not rehabilitate children; it only leads to worse life outcomes,” said Kristen Clarke, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. Spokespeople for the state agency and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In July, Abbott ordered a new investigation into the agency.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Apple CEO Tim Cook and NBA All-Star Dwayne Wade joined Utah leaders Wednesday to announce the completion of a local advocacy group’s campaign to build new homes that provide services for LGBTQ youth in the West. Encircle, a nonprofit providing mental health services for LGBTQ youth, has surpassed its goal of raising $8 million to build eight new homes with locations in Arizona, Idaho, Nevada and Utah aimed at providing safe spaces and preventing teen suicide. “Encircle’s mission is very personal to me because I see myself in so many of these young people,” Cook told reporters at a press briefing Wednesday. “It’s not easy when you’re made to feel different or less than because of who you are or who you love. It’s a feeling that so many LGBTQ people know far too well.” Wade, who joined the Utah Jazz ownership group in April, shared his experience as the parent of a transgender child and voiced his support for Encircle’s mission. “I stand here as a proud parent of a beautiful daughter that’s a part of the LGBT+ community,” Wade said. “I don’t have all the answers. I don’t know everything, but I’m willing to listen.”\n\nVermont\n\nRutland: A dam built at the end of the 18th century has been fully removed after it was abandoned and contributed to flooding that threatened nearby homes in central Vermont. The removal of the Dunklee Pond dam started in 2019 and was completed in the past month, WCAX-TV reports. In the decades after it was built, the dam powered industries including a linseed oil mill, a wood planing mill, a metal mill, a slate pencil mill and a tannery, the broadcaster reports. More recently, it was used as a skating rink and swimming hole. “In the ’50s, ’60s, there were photos of the people diving, jumping off the dam, off the wall up here, swimming, fishing,” said Todd Menees of the Vermont Rivers Program. But the dam deteriorated, and Rutland City Fire Chief Bill Lovett said if it failed, it would have threatened dozens of homes downstream, and a bridge over a busy roadway could have been destroyed. The Vermont Natural Resources Council and the city of Rutland coordinated the project, using about $500,000 of state and federal funding. The project removed sediment that accumulated behind the dam, which the city of Rutland will use for road repairs.\n\nVirginia\n\nRoanoke: The family of a slain journalist is asking the Federal Trade Commission to take action against Facebook for failing to remove online footage of her shooting death. Andy Parker said the company is violating its own terms of service in hosting videos on Facebook and its sibling service, Instagram, that glorify violence. His daughter, TV news reporter Alison Parker, and cameraman Adam Ward were killed by a former co-worker while reporting for Roanoke’s WDBJ-TV in August 2015. Video footage of the shooting – some of which was taken by the gunman – repeatedly resurfaces on Facebook and Instagram despite assurances from top executives that it will be removed, according to a complaint filed Tuesday by Parker and attorneys with the Georgetown Law Civil Rights Clinic. “The reality is that Facebook and Instagram put the onus on victims and their families to do the policing of graphic content – requiring them to relive their worst moments over and over to curb the proliferation of these videos,” the complaint said. It said Facebook is engaging in deceptive trade practices by violating its own terms of service and misrepresenting the safety of the platform and how hard it is for users to get harmful and traumatic content removed.\n\nWashington\n\nYakima: The pace of the 20-acre Rattlesnake Ridge landslide in central Washington near Union Gap is continuing to slow, officials said. Yakima County emergency services director Tony Miller said measurements taken in August show the slab is moving less than 2 inches each week, The Yakima Herald-Republic reports. In 2020, the slab was sliding 2 to 3 inches each week. The slab is expected to continue sliding south, with debris depositing in a nearby quarry. “It’s moving a little bit, crumbling and falling right into the pit,” Miller said. State and county officials, as well as scientists, have been monitoring the slide since a crack was spotted on the ridge in 2017. Initially, officials said the slide could pose an immediate danger, and 60 people living nearby were evacuated. Some residents returned after an assessment firm hired by the state confirmed the landslide was not likely to rapidly slip. Stephen Reidel, a research faculty member at Washington State University, said the slab is sliding on a sedimentary layer between basalt flows. As the basalt slides into the quarry, it will stack up and eventually build up enough to act as a barrier, stopping the landslide. “It’ll just stabilize itself and then stop moving,” he said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Employers would be limited in their ability to require workers to be vaccinated against COVID-19 under a bill introduced by Gov. Jim Justice on Wednesday. The proposal, which would allow certain medical and religious exemptions to company vaccine mandates, comes as the state approaches 4,000 deaths since the start of the pandemic. Employers would be barred under the bill from penalizing or discriminating against current or prospective employees for pursuing the exemptions. The bill, which covers businesses and state government agencies, was advanced in the state Senate on first reading Wednesday. In the House of Delegates, it was referred to a committee. Justice, a Republican, lifted an earlier indoor mask mandate in June and opposes any new mask or vaccine mandates. Businesses can mandate the COVID-19 vaccine, “but at the same time they need to allow for these exemptions,” Justice said at a news conference. Under the bill, a doctor or nurse can provide signed documentation that the employee has a physical condition preventing them from safely receiving the COVID-19 vaccine or that the worker has recovered from COVID-19 and can show they have antibodies for the coronavirus. The worker also can present a notarized certification for a religious exemption.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Republicans brought in rocker and avid hunter Ted Nugent on Wednesday to publicize a package of bills that would declare open hunting season on sandhill cranes and allow anyone 18 or older to carry concealed firearms without a permit. Nugent appeared with more than 20 Republican lawmakers, including state Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu, inside the Assembly chamber. The musician and conservative activist said that “hunting is essential, and any regulation that doesn’t deal with safety or science-based wildlife management is an obstacle to participation.” The package of 13 bills is making its way through the Republican-controlled Legislature. Even if they passed, to become law they would need the approval of Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, who would likely veto many of them. Nugent, who lives in neighboring Michigan, is the national spokesman for Hunter Nation, a group that outraged conservationists when it won a court order forcing an unprecedented late-winter wolf hunt in Wisconsin during the animal’s breeding season. The proposal to create a sandhill crane hunting season mirrors another that died in 2012 in home state of the International Crane Foundation. Nugent said in addition to population control, sandhills are tasty. “Are you familiar with the term ribeye?” he said. “They’re ribeyes in the sky.”\n\nWyoming\n\nLaramie: Trustees at the University of Wyoming say they’ll continue a policy requiring masks in indoor campus spaces where social distance can’t be maintained, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Only about 40% of students have confirmed COVID-19 vaccinations, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/12/01/sea-turtle-musical-rosa-parks-sandhill-crane-rescued-news-around-states/49460813/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery:The latest tribute to civil rights icon Rosa Parks, a memorial piece set just outside the Rosa Parks Museum in a spot where a fountain was located, will be officially revealed at 11:30 a.m. Wednesday during Rosa Parks Day, which kicks off a week of Montgomery Bus Boycott anniversary events. A public viewing begins at 1 p.m. This memorial work of black steel spires in a “V” shape with an outline of Parks’ face was created by Montgomery artist Ian Mangum. “The museum hopes that this piece will help elevate Mangum’s work and provide visitors a new way to interact with history and Rosa Parks’ legacy,” said Madeline Burkhardt, the museum’s adult education coordinator and curator. It’s identical to a piece Mangum made a year ago for Maxwell Air Force Base, where he works as an assistant logistic superintendent. The Maxwell one was designed, built and installed in under three months. It’s across from the building Parks worked at on the base, next to the elementary and middle school. Col. Eries Mentzer, commander of the 42nd Air Base Wing, had the idea to create it.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Rep. Christopher Kurka, a conservative freshman state legislator, said he plans to run for governor, joining a field that includes Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy. Kurka, a Wasilla Republican, announced his plans in a video on social media in which he levied criticisms at Dunleavy. “The dirty little secret of Juneau and Washington, D.C. is that while most conservative officials talk tough about Republican ideals, very few have the intestinal fortitude, moral compass or even the intent to take the principled stand necessary to accomplish any real change,” he said. A message seeking comment about the Republican challenger was sent to Dunleavy’s campaign. Bill Walker, an independent and former governor; former state Rep. Les Gara, a Democrat; and Libertarian William “Billy” Toien are among those who also have said they plan to run. Voters last year approved a new elections process that would end party primaries and institute ranked choice voting in general elections. The top four vote-getters in the primary would advance to the general election, regardless of party affiliation.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Former President Donald Trump has endorsed two Arizona legislative candidates who gained national notoriety for promoting the state Senate’s review of the 2020 election. Trump issued statements Monday endorsing Sen. Wendy Rogers and former Rep. Anthony Kern. Rogers has grown to prominence in pro-Trump circles for claiming Arizona’s election was marred by fraud and demanding the results be decertified. Rogers so far faces no Republican opposition. One Democrat has notified the secretary of state he intends to challenge her, though it’s unknown how competitive her district will be once final boundaries are adopted. Kern was the only Republican lawmaker to lose his reelection bid in 2020. He was spotted counting ballots for several days at the Senate’s election review despite the leaders’ promises that they would screen counters for political biases. Kern also was a plaintiff on a federal lawsuit challenging Arizona’s 2020 election results, which was rejected by a judge. Kern is running for the state Senate seat held by Republican Paul Boyer, who has infuriated Trump and his allies with his criticism of the Senate’s ballot review. Boyer is not seeking reelection.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A Republican panel approved new boundaries for state House and Senate seats that create a new majority-Hispanic district but still drew complaints that it diluted minority voters’ representation in the Legislature. The Board of Apportionment unanimously approved the new district lines for the state’s 100 House and 35 Senate seats. The board is composed of Gov. Asa Hutchinson, Attorney General Leslie Rutledge and Secretary of State John Thurston, who are all Republicans. Republicans hold a majority in both chambers of the Legislature. The redistricting maps were approved after the panel tweaked parts of the map that were released to the public a month ago. The new boundaries keep the number of majority-Black Senate districts the same at four. In the House, the number of majority-Black districts decreased by one to 11, and a new majority-Hispanic district was created in northwest Arkansas. That district, however, doesn’t include Democratic Rep. Megan Godfrey, who represents the area and has been an advocate for the Hispanic community in the Legislature. Minutes after the map was approved, Godfrey tweeted that she would not seek reelection. Democrats also said the map dilutes the representation of racial minorities altogether, saying the number of House districts where racial minorities make up a majority of the voting age population decreased from 17 to 14.\n\nCalifornia\n\nHuntington Beach: California reopened fishing along a stretch of southern coastline after barring the activity for weeks following an offshore oil spill. The state’s Department of Fish and Wildlife said a ban on the taking of fish and shellfish would be lifted at 11:59 a.m. Tuesday and fishing can resume at midday. The closure in early October covered 650 square miles of coastal waters and approximately 45 miles of shoreline, mainly in Orange County. The decision came after testing to ensure the fish along the coast were safe for human consumption after pipeline owned by Houston-based Amplify Energy leaked about 25,000 gallons (94,635 liters) of crude oil in early October. The weekslong closure dealt a blow to fishermen who said customers didn’t want to buy their catch, fearing it was contaminated and walloped charter operators who run fishing trips off the Southern California coast. Some have joined lawsuits against Amplify and said their biggest fear is that the spill’s stigma will drive away tourists even after the oily tar that washed up on the beaches is long gone.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins:Four popular Northern Colorado state wildlife areas no longer require a special pass to access after the Parks and Wildlife Commission created an exemption for the areas at its November meeting. Bellaire Lake, Dowdy Lake, West Lake and Poudre River state wildlife areas were among 24 areas that received an exemption to the Colorado State Wildlife Area Pass, which went on sale May 1. The exempt areas were determined by site-specific factors such as enforcement and public accessibility, according to the commission. The three small lakes in the Red Feather Lakes area northwest of Fort Collins include Roosevelt National Forest campgrounds and are popular with kayakers and canoeists in addition to fishing. The Poudre River site contains land along the river in the lower Poudre Canyon and includes Picnic Rock, which is a popular swimming and whitewater area of the river. Larimer County is home to 19 state wildlife area properties totaling 30,939 acres of land and water. The annual pass fee is $46.48 (including a required $10.40 Colorado Wildlife Habitat Stamp, which also is required when purchasing a hunting or fishing license). Annual passes for youths (16-17 years of age), seniors (65 and older) and low-income residents are $10.07 with no requirement to purchase a habitat stamp. A one-day pass is $9, with no habitat stamp purchase required.\n\nConnecticut\n\nUncasville: Mohegan Gaming & Entertainment, the corporation that owns the Mohegan Tribe’s various gambling enterprises, said it has completed the $1.5 billion in financing needed to develop the first stage of a casino and entertainment resort in South Korea. The initial phase of the Inspire Entertainment Resort, to be built on Yeongjong Island in Incheon, about 25 miles from Seoul, is targeted to open in 2023. It is expected to include more than 1,200 guest rooms in three hotel towers, a 15,000-seat arena, a foreigners-only casino, an indoor water park, convention facilities and other amenities. Bobby Soper, international president for MGE, said the corporation is anticipating a “significant rebound in the tourism and leisure industry following the pandemic.” The Mohegan Tribe owns and operates Connecticut’s Mohegan Sun, one of the largest casinos in North America. The Mohegans were awarded a license by the South Korean government in 2016 to develop a $5 billion resort at Incheon International Airport. It will be the tribal corporation’s first international project.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Two Native American tribes in Delaware are buying back land that had been part of their ancestral homelands. The Washington Post reported the Nanticoke Indian tribe acquired 30 acres in Millsboro this fall. The Lenape Indian tribe is expected to close a deal in early 2022 for 11 acres near Fork Branch Nature Preserve in Dover. Behind the land deals are partnerships between the individual tribes and several other entities. They include the environmental nonprofit Conservation Fund, the state of Delaware and a private conservation group located near Wilmington that is called Mt. Cuba Center. Blaine Phillips, a senior vice president for the Conservation Fund, said the land deals are “about restoring culture. It’s about honoring their ancestral rights.” Leaders of both tribes said they tried for years to buy the parcels of the land. But they said that they either couldn’t make the deal come together or lacked the money. “We, the Indians, had free run of the state of Delaware before contact with Europeans,” said Dennis “White Otter” Coker, the principal chief of the Lenape Indian tribe of Delaware. “All of this land was ours.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:About 100 firefighters fought a large blaze in an apparently vacant home in northwest D.C. on Tuesday morning. WUSA-TV reported. Crews responded to a fire in the 5400 block of Colorado Avenue Northwest to find flames shooting from the windows of the home just before 8 a.m. Firefighters upgraded the response to a second-alarm because of heavy fire conditions. The flames forced firefighters from the home and attack the blaze from the outside, using ladders and hoses. No one was inside the home at the time the fire broke out and D.C. fire and EMS said in a tweet that the home appeared to be vacant. All firefighters have been accounted for, and no injuries were reported. Investigators from the Washington bureau of the ATF were on scene to assist firefighters. The cause of the fire remains under investigation.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis said he will include raises and bonuses for law enforcement when he announces his overall state budget proposal next week. DeSantis is proposing repeating the $1,000 bonuses law enforcement, firefighters and emergency medical technicians received this year. He also wants $73 million to raise the minimum salary for entry-level state law enforcement officers by 20% and give existing state law enforcement officers a 25% raise. “Increasing salaries for state law enforcement by 20 and 25% respectively is going to make a real difference for those officers, it will make a real difference for the families, it will help retain a lot of the talented people we have as well as recruit new people,” DeSantis said. The Legislature is still weeks away from releasing its budget proposals, and lawmakers do not have to follow the governor’s recommendations. But the House and Senate are dominated by Republicans and the chambers’ leaders have helped DeSantis pass previous budget priorities. And this is DeSantis’ final budget before the November election, which gives Republicans more incentive to let him tout legislative victories.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: At least seven colleges in Georgia and one in Louisiana are now offering classes about late civil rights leader the Rev. C.T. Vivian, and those involved in creating the curriculum hope to expand that number to at least 50 schools by next year, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. Vivian, an early and key adviser to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. who organized pivotal campaigns for equality, died last year at the age of 95. The effort to teach college students about him is being led by longtime friends and educators, according to the newspaper. “The life and work of C.T. Vivian provides a useful case study and a template for action that will both educate and inspire the next generation of servant leaders,” said Beverly Tatum, a former Spelman College president. The lessons use Vivian’s books and videos as a foundation, but professors can create their own syllabuses. In Georgia, Emory University and Kennesaw State University are among the schools offering courses based on Vivian’s teachings. Louisiana State University at Shreveport is also part of the effort. Vivian began staging sit-ins against segregation in Peoria, Illinois, in the 1940s. He met King soon after the budding civil rights leader’s leadership of the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott and helped organize the Freedom Rides that forced federal intervention across the South.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A $377 million rental car center with room for 4,500 vehicles is scheduled to open at Honolulu’s airport this week. Gov. David Ige and other state officials were scheduled to dedicate the center at Daniel K. Inouye International Airport on Tuesday. It will open for business on Wednesday. The five-story facility will allow rental car companies to house their operations in the same centrally located, covered airport structure directly across from airline terminals, said Ross Higashi, the deputy director of the state Department of Transportation’s airports division. Higashi told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser the project will make it easier for car rental companies to control and maintain their inventory. Companies will have room to store, rent, fuel, wash and repair cars. Many customers will be able to walk to the center from the terminals, eliminating the need for rental car companies to run pickup shuttles on a constant loop. A consolidated busing system will transport remaining customers. Higashi said the project was built with revenue from a $4.50 daily fee applied to car rentals. Planning for the facility began in 2012 and construction started in 2016.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: An Idaho law banning nearly all abortions would take effect if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 ruling that declared a nationwide right to abortion. The court with a 6-3 conservative majority on Wednesday will hear arguments over a Mississippi law that bans abortions after 15 weeks. That law is on hold following a 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling. The Mississippi law is also at odds with a 1992 Supreme Court ruling that states can’t prevent women from terminating pregnancies before viability, around 24 weeks. If those rulings are overturned, as Mississippi officials argued they should be, states would decide whether to regulate abortion before a baby can survive outside the womb. That would trigger an Idaho law, passed in 2020, banning all abortions except in cases of rape, incest or to protect the life of the mother. That law would take effect in Idaho 30 days after the Supreme Court decision. That law passed the Republican-dominated Idaho House and Senate with no Democratic support, and was signed into law by Republican Gov. Brad Little. Under the law, criminal punishment would be a felony and apply to the person performing the abortion, not the woman. Little in July signed onto an amicus brief with Republican governors from 11 other states supporting the Mississippi law now before the Supreme Court.\n\nIllinois\n\nEvanston: A sandhill crane that couldn’t eat because a piece of plastic was wedged on its beak is on the mend after getting a helping hand from a group of suburban Chicago volunteers. Shana Conner, a volunteer with the Chicago Bird Collision Monitors, helped rescue the crane Friday after getting a call on Thanksgiving that the troubled bird had been seen in Rogers Park. “I was worried about this bird all night because I was like ‘it’s going to starve to death, and I couldn’t find it,’ ” Conner told the Chicago Sun-Times. After the crane was spotted Friday by alert neighbors in nearby Evanston, Conner rushed to the scene while two other volunteers tried to capture the bird. Scott Judd, one of those volunteers, said the crane didn’t give up without a struggle. But they finally netted it and Conner pulled the plastic piece from its beak. The bird was then placed in a cage and soon laid down.“It was exhausted; it probably hadn’t eaten in days,” Judd said. The bird was taken to the Willowbrook Wildlife Hospital for treatment and was being treated Sunday for emaciation and beak wounds. Judd said he suspects the crane was among some 20,000 sandhill cranes he witnessed flying over Chicago on Nov. 22 on their way to warmer climates.\n\nIndiana\n\nMichigan City: A towering sand dune at the Indiana Dunes National Park has kept up its inland creep, covering up an access road and threatening to bury a parking lot in the coming years. The park’s landmark Mount Baldy has largely been closed to public climbing since a 6-year-old boy was rescued in 2013 after being buried in a cavity in the dune that researchers blamed on decaying sand-covered trees. The dune lacks much stabilizing grasses, so winds off Lake Michigan have taken as much as 30 feet off its previous 125-foot peak, National Park Service Ranger Rafi Wilkinson told The (Northwest Indiana) Times. Sand from the dune moved about 10 feet this past year, covering part of a road leading from the parking lot for those visiting Mount Baldy and its nearby beach on the park’s eastern edge. The shifting sands could consume the entire parking lot and a restroom building at the site. “It’s an extremely popular place to park, but the lake always wins,” Wilkinson said. “Mother Nature always wins at this level. It would be impractical to remove that much sand. Indiana Dunes National Park drew nearly 2.3 million visitors during 2020, its second year with national park status.\n\nIowa\n\nNorth Liberty: A nonprofit is working with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to develop a plan to save a suburban Iowa City lake from rapid sedimentation that threatens to render it unusable in as few as 20 years. Jon Kounkel is president of the group, Friends of Coralville Lake, The Gazette reported. He bought a house in nearby North Liberty during the winter nearly two decades ago. But when the ice melted, he discovered the lake’s dirty brown water. “The lake was beautiful when it was frozen over and covered in snow,” Kounkel said. When he and his family went out onto the lake for the first time, his daughter pointed out the “chocolate bubbles” in the water. Kounkel said he has watched the lake declined as 1,300 acre-feet of additional sediment per year drops into the lake. That’s the equivalent of two Empire State Buildings a year. The Army Corps estimated it will be 20 to 30 years before the lake becomes unusable for boating and other recreation because of the silt. The group will look at several possible solutions, including setting up a watershed management authority that would work to reduce sedimentation flow into the lake. Other possibilities include buffer strips and silt traps to slow or catch the silt. One action not being considered is dredging the lake, which is costly and dangerous for the environment, according to Jonathan Wuebker, assistant operations manager for the Corps.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly appointed Janet Stanek, a former Topeka hospital executive, as the new secretary of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment. Stanek most recently was director of the state employee health benefits program. She replaces Dr. Lee Norman, who announced his resignation Nov. 19. He had been the health department’s top administrator since Kelly took office in January 2019. “With Janet’s decades of experience as well as the relationships she has built across the medical community in Kansas, I have no doubt that she will be able to step into this role immediately and continue the agency’s critical work,” Kelly said in a news release. Kelly’s office said Stanek has held health care leadership positions in Pennsylvania, New York and Kansas, including 21 years at Stormont Vail Health Topeka, where she last was chief operating officer and senior vice president. Stanek also is board chair of the Kansas Health Institute, a nonpartisan health policy organization. Stanek will serve as acting secretary until the Senate confirms her appointment.\n\nKentucky\n\nLexington: The Kentucky National Guard said about 150 soldiers are deploying to eastern Africa. A ceremony Saturday at the Lexington airport honored members of the Somerset-based 149th Infantry Regiment as they entered federal active duty, the National Guard said in a news release. The unit will deploy under the command of a task force from the Virginia Army National Guard and provide security around the Horn of Africa, the statement said. About 200 other Kentucky National Guard members are preparing for a separate mobilization to southeast Europe in early 2022. They will work with the Virginia National Guard in a NATO-led peacekeeping mission in Kosovo, the statement said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Tulane University, a private institution in New Orleans, will be the lead tenant of a former public hospital building that has been closed since Hurricane Katrina flooded it in 2005. The school will occupy more than one-third of the Charity Hospital building. “The plan at this point is that it will be the new home for the Tulane School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine – as well as laboratories, academic, and instructional space for the Tulane School of Medicine and Tulane School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine,” Patrick Norton, Tulane’s senior vice president and chief operating officer, said in a statement emailed by a school spokesman. The 20-story art deco building, which was completed in 1938 and covers a city block, was a hospital for nearly 70 years. Tulane will occupy a 12-story wing, university spokesman Mike Strecker said. The wing is expected to open in 2025.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A ski mountain is set to remove a derogatory term for Native American women from its name – two decades after state law eliminated the slur from names of communities and public landmarks. The leader of a group of investors that’s buying Big Squaw Mountain Resort in Greenville vowed to retire the name upon completion of the purchase, the Portland Press Herald reported. “It’s going to change. There is no doubt about that,” said Perry Williams, managing partner at Big Lake Development Co. “It’s about time,” Penobscot National Tribe Ambassador Maulian Dana said of the prospective owners’ plans. The mountain’s name was changed from Big Squaw Mountain to Big Moose Mountain after the state banned the word from public place names such as towns, mountains and lakes in 2000. But the offensive word had carried on at the ski resort because it’s a privately owned business. The word “squaw,” derived from the Algonquin language, might have once meant “woman,” but over generations, the word morphed into a misogynist and racist term to disparage Indigenous women, according to experts.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A panel of state lawmakers voted Monday to recommend Del. Dereck Davis to become the state’s next treasurer. The Special Joint Legislative Committee to Select the State Treasurer voted 10-0 for Davis, a Prince George’s County Democrat who has been the House Economic Matters chairman. The panel heard from four candidates who are seeking the position before voting on the recommendation. The other three candidates were Jorge Cortes, Joseph Zimmerman and John Douglass. All four names will be submitted to the Maryland General Assembly, which is scheduled to vote on selecting a new treasurer during a special session of the legislature, which is convening next week for a special session on redistricting to create a new congressional map. The treasurer’s office is becoming vacant with the retirement of Nancy Kopp.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nQuincy: Sea turtle strandings on Cape Cod are picking up after a slow start to the season, experts at the New England Aquarium said. The aquarium has so far cared for almost 120 of the animals at its Quincy turtle hospital, the vast majority of which have been endangered Kemp’s ridley turtles. But scientists have also treated eight green turtles and two loggerheads. The turtles are treated for life-threatening conditions, including pneumonia and dehydration, a result of days or weeks of hypothermia and the inability to feed. “Early in the season, we typically see the smaller Kemp’s ridley and green turtles. The larger loggerhead turtles will start to wash ashore in December, though we saw our first loggerhead of the season on Thanksgiving Day,” said Charles Innis, the aquarium’s director of animal health. The turtles get trapped in Cape Cod Bay as temperatures drop and wind patterns change, and they quickly become hypothermic. The stranding season started late this year because of temperature fluctuations that kept water in the bay warm. The turtles are assessed and treated in Massachusetts, a process that can take weeks or even months, before being flown to Southern states for continued rehabilitation and eventual release back into the ocean.\n\nMichigan\n\nBenton Harbor: City leaders said they are accepting bids from contractors for an ambitious project to replace all lead water pipes no later than 2023 because of elevated levels of the toxic metal in the municipal supply. Because the “action level” for lead has been exceeded, for three years, the estimated 2,800 service lines generally must be removed over 14 to 15 years under federal and state regulations. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer promised last month to spend millions of dollars to replace them in 18 months. Benton Harbor formally invited bids last week and released details about the plan Monday. “We’re very excited here in the city to make that announcement. I know that it will be received gladly,” Mayor Marcus Muhammad said. Residents in the impoverished, predominantly Black community have been encouraged to use bottled water for cooking, drinking, brushing teeth, rinsing foods and mixing powdered infant formula. Companies will be required to use trenchless technology to minimize the disruption to properties. They will have to restore the condition of driveways, sidewalks and landscaping. And there will be incentives and penalties to ensure the work is done well and on time.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Police are investigating a fight that erupted in a terminal at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport shortly after a plane had landed from Orlando, Florida. About a dozen male and female passengers were involved in the scrape after two large groups of travelers deplaned from a Frontier Airlines flight just before midnight Friday, said Patrick Hogan, spokesman for the Metropolitan Airports Commission. “I don’t have the motivation for the fight yet,” Hogan said Monday. “That’s part of the investigation that’s going on.” A video of the incident, which lasted just over a minute, was posted on social media and shared by more than 7,000 people by midday Monday, the Star Tribune reported. Punches were exchanged among several people and some of them threw stanchions and broke chairs, Hogan said. Airport police responded to the scene in less than two minutes and Bloomington police were on hand at the baggage claim area to help “keep the peace,” he said. Injuries appeared to be minor and all of the people involved in the incident declined to be transported to a hospital for treatment, Hogan said. No arrests have been made. Hogan said police will assess charges after reviewing video and other evidence.\n\nMississippi\n\nGulfport: A green sea turtle named Banner has inspired a children’s musical, “Banner: A Sea Turtle Saga,” put on by theater students from Mississippi State University. It debuted at Mississippi State in early November and was performed on Monday at the Mississippi Aquarium in Gulfport. The show, written by Mississippi State Associate Professor of Communications Tonya Hays and marine scientist and Northern Gulf Institute Education and Outreach Director Jonathan Harris, tells the story of Banner and his sea-creature friends who go on an underwater adventure. The story teaches about the dangers marine animals face, from plastic pollution and oil spills. Banner was rescued in Florida after being severely injured by a boat propeller. The green sea turtle is the world’s largest species of hard-shelled turtle. It is a threatened species in U.S. Atlantic waters, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The show featured student performers wearing puppets of various marine life designed by Mississippi coast theater veteran Tim Baker, of Gulfport. Baker, a professional sculptor, propmaker and special effects artist, has worked with Marvel Studios and Universal Orlando on multiple film projects.\n\nMissouri\n\nMarble Hill: University of Minnesota paleontologist Peter Makovicky, who helped lead a dig in Bollinger County that uncovered fossils of a large duck-billed dinosaur, said he believes the remains of many other dinosaurs will be found at the site. The latest fossils are a specimen of Parrosaurus missouriensis, first discovered at the same site nearly 80 years ago but not confirmed as a new species until the latest dig. Experts believe the plant-eating dinosaurs grew to about 35 feet in length. Remains of four of the species have been found in the same area about 110 miles south of St. Louis. Last month, a crane hoisted a 2,500-pound chunk of remains from the latest find from the glen of a wooded area. The fossils will go to Chicago’s Field Museum for further research. “We actually have something that’s probably a mass death locality, where we have a herd of dinosaurs dying and being sort of buried together, and individuals of different ages,” Makovicky said. The first dinosaur fossils at the site were found in the early 1940s, uncovered by a family digging a well. Experts weren’t sure what sort of dinosaur it was and the bones were shelved for a long time. A Missouri paleontologist purchased the property in the 1980s. A second set of dinosaur bones were found then. Beyond dinosaur bones, the teams have found remains of massive turtles, prehistoric fish, even crocodiles that might have been to up 50 feet long.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls:A Great Falls man was sentenced Monday to 65 years in prison for killing another man with a hatchet during a March 2018 street fight. A Cascade County jury in September convicted James Michael Parker, 35, of deliberate homicide, assault with a weapon and witness tampering in the death of Lloyd Geadry, 45. Geaudry died of a sharp force injury to his neck that fractured his spine and severed an artery, court records said. “A total of 11 people were involved in the street fight in Great Falls, prosecutors said. District Court Judge Elizabeth Best sentenced Parker to 55 years for the homicide and another 10 years for assaulting another person during the fight, the Great Falls Tribune reported. She also sentenced him to a concurrent 10 years for witness tampering. Best also ordered Parker to pay $14,000 in restitution. Parker has been in custody since November 2018, according to county jail records.\n\nNebraska\n\nDenton: A garage fire near Denton has caused more than $1 million in damage to several classic cars and motorcycles. The Lincoln Journal Star reported the fire broke out Saturday in a detached garage. Lancaster County Sheriff Terry Wagner said the 50-by-100-foot garage was fully engulfed in flames by the time deputies arrived. Corvettes from 1956, 1958, 1962 and 1969 were destroyed, along with other vintage cars and four Harley Davidson motorcycles. The building was a total loss. Authorities said the fires cause was accidental.\n\nNevada\n\nHenderson: Democratic Mayor Debra March said she plans to run for lieutenant governor in 2022. March has served on Henderson’s city council since 2009 and as mayor since 2017. She said in a press release last week that her platform would focus on economic development and diversification and draw from her experience attracting jobs to Henderson, which is Nevada’s second-largest incorporated city. There is no office-holder serving as lieutenant governor in Nevada. Former Lt. Gov. Kate Marshall resigned in August to accept a position as an advisor in the White House’s Office of Intergovernmental Affairs. Although it wouldn’t be months until she entered the race, the Nevada Democratic Party endorsed March in the following days. Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak has not appointed a replacement for Marshall. Beyond March, Carson City Democrat Kimi Cole and Republicans Dan Schwartz, Stavros Anthony and Mack Miller have also announced plans to run for the seat. The lieutenant governor in Nevada is a part-time position, presides over the state Senate and chairs the state commission on tourism.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDurham: Researchers at the University of New Hampshire are getting nearly $3 million to study how teens and young adults are affected when their peers harm themselves. The grant from the National Institutes of Health will help researchers explore how bystanders handle incidents involving self-directed violence, how often such incidents happen and the results when bystanders intercede. Kimberly Mitchell, at the university’s Crimes Against Children Research Center, said self-directed violence including suicide is a significant public health issue, but there is very limited information about how bystanders to such violence are impacted by the help they might provide. Researchers hope their work will lead to successful suicide prevention programs that also could help the bystanders themselves.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nPaterson:City education officials paid their custodial services vendor $6.34 million during a recent 16-month period while Paterson’s schools were closed to students because of COVID-19, according to public records. The Paterson Board of Education has asked the district’s attorneys to investigate the payments, which were made to Pritchard Industries of Florham Park, officials said. From April 2020 through July 2021, the district paid Pritchard $6.34 million, records showed. The monthly payments varied greatly, ranging from $60,800 to $620,250. In eight of those months, the payments exceeded $500,000. By comparison, before the COVID-19 school closure, the district had been paying Pritchard $681,050 a month, according to public records. During the remote learning period, Paterson schools were open on a limited basis, mainly for such activities as the distribution of meals and Chromebooks. A few employees reported for work at city schools during that time – including principals and their assistants – but almost all other educators and students stayed home. Paterson Board of Education members said a portion of the money paid to Pritchard during the coronavirus shutdown stemmed from a state law adopted at the outset of the pandemic that required school districts to continue paying “contracted service providers” during a public health emergency.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: New Mexico oil and gas regulators are watching closely as increased seismic activity is being reported in the Permian Basin along the Texas state line. Under a plan recently rolled out by the New Mexico Oil Conservation Division, pending permits for wastewater injection in certain areas will require extra review. More reporting and monitoring also could be required and if things worsen, the state could limit how much wastewater is injected in disposal wells. State officials said the protocols were developed in partnership with New Mexico Tech and after getting feedback from the oil and gas industry. Division Director Adrienne Sandoval said New Mexico is trying to be proactive with what she described as a pragmatic approach. The protocols call for reporting and monitoring when two magnitude 2.5 events occur within 30 days and within a 10-mile radius. Within that area, operators will be required to provide weekly reports on daily injection volumes and average daily surface pressure and share that with the state when requested. If one magnitude 3.0 occurs, operators will have to reduce their injection rates – with higher reductions required closer to the epicenter. Between March and September, the Oil Conservation Division received reports of seven earthquakes with magnitudes from 2.5 to 4.0 in an area about 35 miles east southeast of Malaga in southeastern New Mexico. Of these earthquakes, four were magnitude 3.0 or greater.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: Democratic U.S. Rep. Tom Suozzi said he is running for governor in next year's election, joining a competitive primary race that became wide open when former Gov. Andrew Cuomo resigned. Suozzi told reporters on a virtual news conference that he's jumping into the 2022 race. “I’m a common sense Democrat,\" Suozzi said. “I don’t believe it’s about going to the far left or to the far right; it’s about trying to find the answers to the problems that we face.” Suozzi represents Long Island, including its wealthy north shore, and parts of Queens in New York's 3rd Congressional District. He survived a tough reelection in 2020, gaining a narrow victory in the swing district that tilts toward Democrats. The open race to replace him will likely be highly contested by both parties. The Democratic primary race includes Gov. Kathy Hochul, who took office after Cuomo resigned amid sexual harassment allegations; Attorney General Letitia James, whose investigation of the allegations prompted Cuomo’s resignation; and Jumaane Williams, New York City’s elected public advocate. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, whose term ends this year, has also been hinting that he might enter the race. De Blasio filed paperwork to create a fundraising committee last month.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nPilot Mountain: Fire crews are working to control a fire in Pilot Mountain State Park that has burned hundreds of acres. Meanwhile the N.C. Forest Service said there is a ban on all open burning and has canceled all burning permits statewide until further notice. The fire that covered about 300 acres Monday grew by about 75 acres overnight, Forestry Service spokeswoman Christie Adams said. A team was expected to arrive Monday to take over management of the fire, Adams said. There were about 30 to 40 people involved in the fight Monday morning, she said. The fire was first reported Saturday night in the area of the Three Bear Gully Trail. The cause hasn’t been determined, Adams said. The State Parks and Recreation Department has said the park likely will be closed all week. The park northwest of Winston-Salem is known for its iconic knob that rises about 1,500 feet above the surrounding terrain.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nGrand Forks: A former University of North Dakota student is accused of stealing more than $330,000 in federal coronavirus relief money, according to federal court documents. Enroy Duncan allegedly devised a scheme to defraud the government by filing a false application for Paycheck Protection Program funds. He is charged with wire fraud. Duncan falsely stated that his company, called “Homeinhome Senior Care,” had 17 employees and paid more than $1.6 million in wages, tips and compensation, court documents showed. The indictment said Duncan’s Grand Forks apartment was listed as the company’s address, but no records of the business could be found at the North Dakota Secretary of State’s office or Job Service. Duncan is living in Florida, where he made his first court appearance on Nov. 18, KVRR-TV reported. Court document do not list an attorney for Duncan.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus:Bernita Reese has been named the director of the city’s Department of Recreation and Parks, succeeding Paul Rakosky, who has been interim director since 2019. Reese was introduced Monday at the Beatty Community Center on the Near East Side by Mayor Andrew J. Ginther and Derrick Clay, president of the Columbus Recreation and Parks Commission. She is the first Black woman to be named the city's rec and parks director. Her annual salary will be $180,003. Reese said that first and foremost, parks and recreation centers are safe, and she will be working on ways to make them safer. She said she plans on meeting with Police Chief Elaine Bryant after she starts her job in January. People have been concerned about park safety since two homicides in city parks earlier this year. Reese most recently was director of parks and recreation for the city of Huntsville, Alabama. She had served for more than three years as assistant director for Columbus recreation and parks, then left for Huntsville in April. In Huntsville, Reese developed a playground replacement program and worked with community leaders to increase athletic tourism.\n\nOklahoma\n\nPerry: Authorities are investigating after a helicopter crashed in Oklahoma, killing one person and injuring another. The Oklahoma Highway Patrol said the crash happened Sunday in Perry, about 60 miles north of Oklahoma City. The helicopter was privately owned and two people were on board at the time, Oklahoma City station KWTV reported. One person was pronounced dead at the scene and another was taken to a hospital, authorities said. The National Transportation Safety Board said it was investigating the crash.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland:The Oregon Health Authority is offering to pay pharmacies $35 for each dose of COVID-19 vaccine they administer, with the intention to boost vaccination rates. Based on the health authority’s database, 79% of people 18 years or older in Oregon have received at least their first vaccine dose. In addition, the Statesman Journal reported the program – which launched this month – directly addresses staffing shortages at pharmacies, where growing workloads have resulted in long lines across the state. In some cases, customers have reported having to wait two or three hours to pick up their prescriptions. The state is offering to pay temporary pharmacists in order to bolster workforces, said Rudy Owens, a public affairs specialist for the Oregon Health Authority. However, the temporary staffing program is only available to independent pharmacies. Corporate-owned pharmacies are not eligible, but they can still receive vaccine payments from the state. To qualify for the payments, pharmacies must meet certain standards for “vaccine equity,” including offering multilingual signs for COVID-19 vaccinations, “expanded vaccine-related counseling aimed at boosting vaccine confidence,” and “a plan for ongoing evaluation and continuous improvement to ensure equitable access,” according to a flyer from the health authority. Owens said the state doesn’t have data yet on how many pharmacies have applied for the supplemental payments.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf said he is not considering additional containment measures as the omicron variant of the coronavirus spreads overseas, but continued to urge people to get vaccinated. Wolf said there is no cause for panic, noting that no cases of the omicron variant have been discovered in the United States. “In Pennsylvania and around the country, the vaccine is still our strategy, so get your shot,” Wolf said on a regularly scheduled appearance on KDKA-AM radio in Pittsburgh. “Get your vaccine. That’s our strategy and it seems to be working.” Infections, hospitalizations and intensive-care unit cases are rising in Pennsylvania and many other states. About 3,600 patients are hospitalized with COVID-19 in Pennsylvania, according to Department of Health figures. Wolf called that “very few” and said he doesn’t “see any need for Pennsylvania to do anything draconian at this point,” such as limiting elective surgeries to clear up hospital space.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The median price of a single-family home in Rhode Island has continued to rise as the number of sales has slowed, according to the Rhode Island Association of Realtors. The median price rose 12.7% in the past year, but the number of single-family home sales fell 22.3%, according to association data. Pending sales also decreased slightly. Agueda Del Borgo, the association’s president, said the housing market will likely show more tempered activity in 2022 but the association still expects sales to remain strong. There were similar trends in the condominium sector, but pending sales rose 10.8%. The association said that could indicate frustrated buyers in the single-family home market might be focusing on condominiums. Sales of multifamily homes, on the other hand, rose by 8.8% and the median price increased 15% annually.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nOrangeburg: Duke Energy is giving a historically Black South Carolina university $150,000 in scholarships to help train and educate nuclear engineers. South Carolina State University said the money will provide about 15 scholarships over three years in its nuclear engineering program, which is the only undergraduate one of its kind in the state, interim university President Alexander Conyers said. The money from the Duke Energy Foundation is intended to strengthen the utility’s relationships with historically Black colleges and universities and bring more diverse talent into the company. “South Carolina State University has a significant reputation as a leader in building the high-quality workforce our state and nation need today and in years to come,” said Mike Callahan, president of Duke Energy's utility operations in South Carolina.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nEllsworth Air Force Base: The primary adviser to the commander of the 28th Bomb Wing at Ellsworth Air Force Base has been removed from his post for what officials described as inappropriate conduct. Chief Master Sgt. Just Deisch, the wing command chief, showed behavior that demonstrated a lack of respect, judgment and professionalism expected of a senior noncommissioned officer, base commander Col. Joseph Sheffield said. Base officials declined to release details. “All Airmen should be treated with dignity and respect, and senior leaders should set the example for subordinates by exercising sound judgement and decision-making both on and off duty,” Sheffield said in a statement. A phone number for Deisch could not be found. Base officials did not immediately respond to a message from the Associated Press. Base officials said the command chief is responsible for advising the commander on matters such as morale, welfare, warfighting effectiveness and professional development of the nearly 3,200 enlisted airmen at the base. Ellsworth Air Force Base is the largest B-1 bomber combat wing in the Air Force.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville:Gov. Bill Lee named Lisa Helton interim leader of the state Department of Correction after Commissioner Tony Parker said he would retire from his post. Helton will take over starting Wednesday and will fill the role until a permanent leader is picked. Helton is the assistant commissioner for the department’s community supervision division. Lee’s office said Helton has more than 25 years of experience in the criminal justice field. Parker is starting a job on Jan. 1 as president of a Knoxville-based criminal justice reform organization named 4th Purpose Foundation. Parker previously announced he would retire from the state this fall after almost four decades with the department.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: A Houston man has been sentenced to more than nine years in prison after he was accused of using federal COVID-19 relief funding on a Lamborghini, a Rolex watch and trips to strip clubs, federal prosecutors said. Lee Price III, 30, was sentenced Monday to 110 months in prison. Price pleaded guilty in September to wire fraud and money laundering. “Mr. Price hopes that others will learn from his reckoning that there is no easy money,” Price’s attoney Tom Berg said in an email to news outlets. “He has the balance of the 110-month sentence to reflect, repent and rebuild his misspent life.” Prosecutors accused Price of fraudulently using more than $1.6 million in funding from the Paycheck Protection Program, which gave low-interest loans to small businesses struggling during the pandemic. According to prosecutors, Price also used the money to buy an $85,000 pickup truck and to pay off a loan on a residential property.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George:Zion National Park is halting its shuttle service for the winter season. Patrons can drive their vehicles up the Zion Canyon Scenic Drive starting Monday until Dec. 23, when the shuttle service will reopen for 10 days during the holiday season. As the number of annual visitors to Zion National Park recently reached a peak of nearly 4.52 million – a record for the park – officials are warning of packed parking lots and potential closures throughout the winter. During the 10-day shuttle run next month, private cars will not be allowed up the Scenic Drive, but will be allowed back on Jan. 2. Weekend shuttle service will resume in mid-February and daily shuttle service will resume in mid-March. Officials said to check on the park's website next year for more specific dates.\n\nVermont\n\nBarton: Gov. Phil Scott celebrated the beginning of the state’s unofficial Christmas tree season Monday by cutting trees for the Montpelier building where his office is located. The trees cut by Scott and Agriculture Secretary Anson Tebbetts at the Maple Hill Farm in Barton will decorate the Pavilion Building. “This is a time of year to take note of the good and unite around the true meaning behind each of the seasons’ traditions: Togetherness, community and hope,” Scott said in a statement. The U.S. Department of Agriculture said as of 2017, there were 3,650 acres of Christmas tree production in Vermont across 70 farms. The crop is worth more than $2.6 million. Jim Horst of the New Hampshire-Vermont Christmas Tree Association said many Vermonters bring to market Christmas trees, wreaths, garland and other decorative items. “Many trees are sold to the wholesale market for ultimate resale throughout the region,” Horst said. “Others, though, are sold directly to the consumer, who enjoy the process of actually visiting the farm and taking part in the ‘cut your own’ experience.”\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Enrollment at Virginia’s public schools has not returned to pre-pandemic levels, according to state data. Last year, 44,000 students left the state’s public schools, The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported. Even after the state mandated reopening schools for five days a week, the number of students lagged by 46,000 students this year, compared to 2019. Henrico’s enrollment dropped below 50,000 students for the first time in more than a decade at 49,991 students. The district said it lost 1,400 students last year and saw a 118% increase in the number of students who left to attend private school. Much of the loss is in early grade levels. About 80,000 kindergartners enrolled last school year, nearly 12,000 fewer than the previous school year. This year, kindergarten enrollment grew to around 87,000, which is an increase, but not a return to pre-pandemic levels. The enrollment loss could affect how much the legislature is willing to offer in local budgets, unless it holds school districts harmless for enrollment loss like last year.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Mayor Jenny Durkan said repairs on the closed West Seattle Bridge are on schedule and the bridge should reopen for vehicular traffic sometime in mid-2022. Durkan said in a news conference that the city is on time and on budget, adding that the city knows the timeline still seems too slow for the communities being impacted, KOMO-TV reported. “We really are moving forward,” she said. The city closed the bridge abruptly in March 2020 after questions were raised about its structural integrity following the discovery of cracks. The bridge opened in 1984 and was projected to have a life of at least 40 years. The city opted to repair instead of replace the bridge to reopen it sooner for the thousands of motorists who use it daily. A West Seattle High-Rise Bridge Cost-Benefit Analysis report concluded the city could proceed with spending $47 million to repair the bridge. The bridge closure has caused ongoing traffic gridlock in the area. Durkan said the bridge is an economic driver in the city and state. Officials said the city secured $19 million in funding from the federal government to help pay for the needed repairs, along with $9 million from the Port of Seattle.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The West Virginia Turnpike saw a big leap in traffic numbers during Thanksgiving week compared with the same week last year. Turnpike booths saw almost 733,000 vehicles pass through between Tuesday and Sunday, almost 30% more than the same period in 2020, the Department of Transportation said. Wednesday and Sunday were the busiest days on the Turnpike. Nearly 157,000 vehicles went through toll booths Wednesday and more than 165,000 on Sunday. The state Parkways Authority and the West Virginia Tourism Office came up with colorful wrappings for toll booths showing visitors what the state offers. There were strong sales during the week at Tamarack, Turnpike travel plazas and welcome centers, the Transportation Department said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Hunters killed thousands fewer deer during Wisconsin’s nine-day gun season this year than in 2020, according to preliminary state Department of Natural Resources data. The DNR offers multiple deer hunting seasons each fall, but the nine-day season remains the pinnacle for hunters. It began at dawn on Nov. 20 and ran until nightfall Sunday. Hunters killed 175,667 deer, down 8% from the 190,646 killed during the 2020 nine-day stretch. The number of bucks killed was down 1.3% from last year. The antlerless take was down 13%. Hunters killed 9.3% more deer in the northern forest management zone this year than last, the only one of the state’s four management zones that saw an increase. The southern farmland zone, which includes most of the southern third of the state, saw a 17% drop in kills. The number of hunters who could have ventured into the woods remained virtually unchanged from 2020. The DNR reported it sold 564,440 hunting licenses that would allow someone to kill a deer using a gun during any of the state’s multiple gun seasons as of the Sunday close. That’s down about 0.8% from the 564,440 licenses sold at the same point last year.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: A Wyoming woman died Saturday when a car she was traveling in rolled along U.S. Highway 20-26 between Casper and Glenrock. The Wyoming Highway Patrol identified the victim as 32-year-old Lindsay Ritter, the Casper Star Tribune reported. The crash occurred about 7:45 p.m. Saturday as Ritter was traveling east in a Chevrolet Impala. The sedan drove off the road to the right, overcorrected to the left and then lost control, according to a highway patrol report. The report did not list any contributing factors to the crash.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/12/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2015/11/24/whats-your-fave-album-every-year-your-life/73694002/", "title": "What's your fave album — for every year of your life?", "text": "Chris Shields\n\nclshields@stcloudtimes.com\n\nI find it is good policy to give credit where it is due. I saw some of my Facebook friends naming their favorite albums for every year they've been alive. Cool, right? You can get neat ideas from social media.\n\nThen I saw some other folks start joining in. And before long, I was seeing Facebook groups getting into it. In a very short time, it seemed to become a minor viral event.\n\nAnd it got me thinking about my favorite albums, from 1980 to 2015. Boy, it is difficult. Some years had so many fantastic albums. Other years, well ... Yeah, they were easier.\n\nIt took me a while. I had to look at charts, I looked for lists of album releases. You wouldn't believe how incomplete and patchy they can be. You have to be a detective to start piecing things together just to make a list that doesn't completely overlook genres like country, hip-hop and some alternative albums.\n\nAfter I'd made my list, I was kind of surprised at how relatively predictable it was. But you know what, we like what we like. I make no apologies for the music I love.\n\nI started thinking about how this would make a great column. That I could talk about each album, discuss why it made the cut, do a miniature review for each one.\n\nThen I started to face some realities. There are 36 albums on this list. If I did two paragraphs for each one, I'd have this massive story that would eat up too much real estate in the print world. And for online, I'd feel like I'd only brushed on things and would want desperately to build on it.\n\nThus, inspiration led to a special project. I allowed myself to really stretch out and tackle this idea in a special online presentation. It is too large for print, so the Times won't be reproducing it in the newspaper.\n\nWith this special package, you'll get my album reviews, with some album art and a video for each. Yup, I just might eat up your afternoon. Or maybe you'll want to space it out over the weekend.\n\nAnd I want to stress that this is about favorite albums, not best albums. In some cases, you'll often find that there's a superior artistic expression, or a more controversial or critically acclaimed work in the mix ... but it doesn't trump an album that you just like better, for whatever reason. To thine own self, be true.\n\nIn any event, I enjoyed seeing so many people get into this idea on Facebook. And I want to give special props to a musician, music fan and music columnist who I feel fortunate to consider a friend. Thanks, Jon Hunt, for being one of the sparks that got me launched on this project. Music you love is always best shared with people you enjoy.\n\nAfter reading my picks, maybe you would enjoy making your own list. Maybe this will give you some ideas. Or heck, maybe this is a good conversation starter as you get together with your families for the holidays. Maybe it'll make some fun office talk. \"Say, what was your favorite birth-year album?\" For you, my fellow music fans, I hope you have a ball. You may agree with some of the picks, you may disagree, you'll no doubt have your own thoughts. Share them! Let's jaw a bit about our favorite music.\n\nAnd with that, let's get to the fun. I hope you enjoy it, and that it inspires you to think about your favorite music over the years.\n\nThis is the opinion of music enthusiast and audio addict Chris Shields. Contact him at clshields@stcloudtimes.com and follow him on Twitter @clshields1980. Read more of his columns at www.sctimes.com/cshields.\n\nWhen I listen to music, I hear details that make a difference, that leave a mark. If a song isn't particularly amazing in terms of songwriting or construction, genuine feeling and zeal can still elevate it. Take \"Tutti Frutti\" for instance. There's a great hook to it, but what sells it? Little Richard's vocal investment. \"A wop bop a loo bop,\" indeed.\n\nBob Dylan's \"Saved,\" if nothing else, is a triumph of conviction. And by nothing else, I only mean that some will dismiss it for the direction of the content. As the middle of the \"Born Again\" albums (sandwiched between \"Slow Train Coming\" and \"Shot of Love\"), \"Saved\" often gets ignored. \"Slow Train Coming\" has great songs, sounds great and was something new as Dylan \"reinvented\" himself yet again. And \"Shot of Love\" features \"Every Grain of Sand,\" one of Dylan's finest songs.\n\nConviction, I say, and conviction I mean. Listen to Dylan's voice. His earnestness. He is invested in these songs. His passion was righteous, the words and beliefs sincerely conveyed. The gospel stylings he encourages and invests into album opener \"A Satisfied Mind\" gets things going. Hums and affirmations abound, and show that Dylan really is identifying with this sound, with these feelings.\n\nAt the time of release, Dylan often spoke of his belief that Jesus' return was nigh, that the end times were upon us and that any moment we'd face Armageddon. There's fear, there's guidance, strong declarations of faith and stirring warnings in this music. And you'd better believe that Dylan puts everything he has into this album. He sounds so committed, you can't help but believe the dedication. It's potent stuff, no matter your religious outlook.\n\nYou don't have to share the beliefs to appreciate the sincerity, or even to be moved by the outpouring of faith. You'll get portions of devotion and grace with condemnation and hellfire. And Dylan tends to work some magic when he is properly motivated. Considering the uneven quality of Dylan's 1980s albums, it is worth noting the high quality with which he started the decade.\n\nI think one reason \"Saved\" gets little love is that it tends to go unrepresented in compilations, and the period hasn't really gotten any love in the \"Bootleg Series\" collection so far. But some artists don't work well in a \"greatest hits\" or \"best of\" situation. In Dylan's case, there are precious few actual \"hits\" but so many high-quality compositions and performances. So maybe \"Saved\" also gets lost in the shuffle because of so many wonderful records. But with such great songs as \"Pressing On\" and \"In the Garden\" among the tracks, this is an album that really deserves reappraisal. This material is inspired, his performances top notch.\n\nI know, I know, reading about and listening to \"Christian music\" isn't always the cool thing to do. But I encourage you to listen to Dylan's take on the gospel/faith genre. When he tackled this material, it wasn't to tap into a solid commercial base. If anything, it put him on dangerous financial grounds. The guy refused to do his best-known songs in concert and would only perform his new, Christian-aligned material. Hard to entice old and new audiences with that. But artists follow their inspirations and instincts. Even if it was a path Dylan would soon abandon (at least in a direct musical fashion), it took great courage to pursue higher truths and find spiritual, personal fulfillment.\n\nAnd it led to a great album.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1980\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nBilly Joel's \"Glass Houses.\"\n\nQueen's \"The Game.\"\n\nAC/DC's \"Back in Black.\"\n\nABBA's \"Super Trouper.\"\n\nJohn Lennon & Yoko Ono's \"Double Fantasy.\"\n\nSome concept albums can feel overblown. Pretentious. Bloated.\n\nAnd taken at face value, a concept album that charts the successful opening and the eventual dilapidated closing of Chicago's Paradise Theatre, and also incorporates elements to mirror the evolving social and economic realities in contemporary times, certainly sounds like it could be, er, well ... overreaching.\n\nBut it is one of those rare marvels, a single-record concept album that works AND carries the concept throughout with enjoyable music, memorable melodies and some bombastic choruses.\n\nWhen I was growing up, we had three Styx albums in the house: \"The Grand Illusion\" and \"Pieces of Eight\" on vinyl, and \"Paradise Theatre\" on cassette. And while I spent most of my time with Beatles records, hearing the bombastic and catchy-as-heck music by Styx definitely grabbed my attention.\n\nWhen my father loaned me some of his cassettes, I was curious about the \"Paradise Theatre\" tape. I recognized a couple of songs (like \"Too Much Time on My Hands,\" \"The Best of Times\" and \"Snowblind\"), but the others? Brand new. And I remember my first listen. I was sitting next to my bed, with my dad's headphones on. When \"A.D. 1928\" started up, I had to check the cassette lineup. Isn't this \"The Best of Times?\" Nope! But it established the narrative musical thread. And it segues directly into \"Rockin' the Paradise,\" a very cool li'l rock track.\n\nI'm an unabashed Styx fan. I love the pure pop confection of \"Lorelei.\" I really dig the almost Beach Boys-esque arrangement of \"Mademoiselle\" (if you think about the \"20/20\" and \"Sunflower\" era of the Beach Boys, maybe you'll dig where I'm coming from). I think that all members of the band, but most especially Dennis DeYoung, Tommy Shaw and James Young, were able to tap into a spirit that is so American — bold, brash, occasionally dramatic but with an embrace for the good things in life. And \"Paradise Theatre,\" a No. 1 album for the group, should have helped establish the group's legacy in American music. And maybe it did, for those listeners who don't get too hung up on what's \"hip.\"\n\nBut maybe the album is better known for its controversy. If you Google backward messages and Styx, I'm sure you'll find everything you'd want to know about the Parents Music Resource Center and the allegations of satanic messages in the music, particularly \"Snowblind.\" It's a fun story, popular, but it just isn't true — Styx wasn't trying to warp minds with unholy images and messages. But I'm betting the headlines didn't hurt the band get some sales from curious younger (and older) listeners.\n\nStill, Styx is Styx. Bad headlines, bad reviews, bad impressions, polarization of fans in a \"Dennis camp\" or a \"Tommy Camp,\" Styx seems to regularly find itself on the receiving end of misfortune. It's a shame. But that's where I can let the music speak for itself.\n\nUnfortunately, good music or not, some bands seem easier to dismiss. As I've written before, Styx is one of those bands people say they just don't like. But if you give them a chance, and \"Paradise Theatre\" in particular, you might just hear a few songs (or a whole album) that you'll find refreshing. Set aside popularity contests, unburden yourself of the need to diss \"uncool\" music and give yourself permission to embrace the pop-rock goodness of Styx.\n\nOr just groove to \"Rockin' the Paradise\" in the safety of your car, bedroom or office.\n\nSo, whatcha doin' tonight?\n\nHonorable mentions, 1981\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nTom Petty and The Heartbreakers' \"Hard Promises.\"\n\nThe Replacements' \"Sorry Ma, Forgot to Take Out the Trash.\"\n\nBob Dylan's \"Shot of Love.\"\n\nThe Rolling Stones' \"Tattoo You.\"\n\nJoan Jett & The Blackhearts' \"I Love Rock 'n Roll.\"\n\nI read about it before I ever heard the record.\n\nI'm sure I was reading a John Lennon biography and I'd gotten to the post-murder material, when reactions and tributes were discussed. No doubt there was a mention of the track \"Here Today\" on \"Tug of War,\" Paul McCartney's first album to follow Lennon's death.\n\nThe curiosity was planted. Obviously, I knew some of McCartney's solo stuff. You couldn't be a big Beatles fan like I was and not have been exposed to \"Band on the Run\" and other material. But the only connections I had to most of the \"Tug of War\" material came from some of the songs being featured in McCartney's feature film \"Give My Regards to Broad Street\" (though in re-recorded form).\n\nHearing the album the first time, I was struck by the variety of styles and how McCartney's gift as a tunesmith hadn't been hurt by the loss of his friend and former songwriting partner. Even the oft-mocked \"Ebony and Ivory\" holds its own (yes, the white keys and black keys on a piano might actually lead to more dissonance than harmony, but Paul and Stevie Wonder still get the noble point across).\n\nTwo of my favorites on the album, \"Wanderlust\" and \"Ballroom Dancing,\" are pure McCartney — I can't imagine anyone else writing them. \"Wanderlust\" is a cousin to \"Mull of Kintyre,\" this irresistible melody that feels somehow timeless. \"Ballroom Dancing\" more fits the mold of \"When I'm 64,\" \"Your Mother Should Know\" and \"You Gave Me the Answer.\" It's the kind of song that would appeal to moms and grandmas, but with a bouncier track. Fun for the sake of fun.\n\nAnd what can be said about \"Here Today\" that hasn't been said over the years? Paul sings to John, and he is holding back the tears no more. If you've seen Paul perform the song in concert the last several years, he often does tear up, choke up, the emotions are palpable. Paul lost a brother, a partner, a rival, an important figure in his life. The song conveys that in every possible way.\n\nReally, when it comes right down to it, there aren't any songs I dislike on \"Tug of War.\" The title track and \"Take It Away\" are pure Paul at his best. And the album's other duet with Stevie Wonder, \"What's That You're Doing,\" basically lays the groundwork for Michael Jackson's \"Thriller.\" Stevie's scatting at the end is ... odd, but fun.\n\nThere are link tracks, brief interludes. Maybe some folks would call them scraps, or would find them jarring. Me, I find them to be emotional and creative transitions.\n\n\"Tug of War\" is an album that justifies every view of McCartney as a musician, for good or bad. It stands as a synthesis of McCartney's skills as a Beatle, as a solo artist and as the leader of Wings. And \"Tug of War\" climbed to No. 1. It established itself as a classic, one that sets a standard that all following McCartney albums have had to measure against.\n\nPaul weathered the storm after Lennon's untimely death, and emerged from the darkness with an album that still stands the test of time today. He endured his own internal and external tugs of war, and came out on top. You gotta respect that.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1982\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nRichard and Linda Thompson's \"Shoot Out the Lights.\"\n\nQueen's \"Hot Space.\"\n\nBilly Joel's \"The Nylon Curtain.\"\n\nPrince's \"1999.\"\n\nMichael Jackson's \"Thriller.\"\n\nYou can learn a lot about a person when you talk about favorites. And you can learn a lot about Pink Floyd fans from their favorite albums.\n\nI honestly have different favorites based on my moods. Sometimes I want \"Wish You Were Here,\" sometimes I want \"Meddle,\" sometimes I want \"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,\" etc.\n\nBut one album that I always find myself putting on the list, at No. 1 or No. 2, is \"The Final Cut.\"\n\nThe last studio album to feature Roger Waters, \"The Final Cut\" also is the first Pink Floyd album not to credit Richard Wright as a member. Tensions were high, creative differences had forced some unpleasant ultimatums, and group members David Gilmour and Nick Mason were shunted to the side and used basically as session players. Gilmour, who'd been one of the primary vocalists of the group from 1968-1977, had seen his vocal presence (and artistic input) diminish in the group as Waters took on more of the vocals and asserted himself as the creative force of the band. On \"The Final Cut,\" Gilmour contributes some tasty guitar lines, but he only features as the lead vocal on one track: \"Not Now John.\"\n\nThe drama aside, the narrative of the album is one of the group's strongest. It builds upon themes expressed in \"Dark Side of the Moon,\" \"Animals\" and \"The Wall.\" The struggle to live life in a world controlled by corporate and military forces, humans treated as pawns in a global chess game, the loss of family, isolation, etc. You get it — not the cheeriest content. And how does the album end? \"Two Suns in the Sunset\" might give you all the clues you need. (No? Nuclear annihilation.)\n\nWaters' vocals are strong and expressive. The lyrics are personal, and illustrative. The album unfolds in such a cinematic fashion. And the production? Wow.\n\n\"The Final Cut\" polarizes fans. Some see it as Waters seizing ultimate control for his own glory, and attempting to tank the band. Some see it as the most powerful and focused album in the group's catalog. But with songs like \"Your Possible Pasts,\" \"The Hero's Return,\" \"The Gunner's Dream,\" \"The Fletcher Memorial Home,\" \"Southampton Dock\" and \"The Final Cut,\" it's impossible to dismiss it as artistically bankrupt.\n\nMy younger brother and I got into the album after we'd devoured \"The Wall.\" We were in our mid teens and that kind of power, that kind of imagery, that kind of angst was impossible to ignore. It was passionate. It was fearful. It was angry. And sadly, the themes of the album were still relevant. And they still are.\n\nArt endures, right? And while some of the references may have dated, the sense of betrayal to those who make the ultimate sacrifice, to the families who lose loved ones, to the people who work hard to live their lives only to have \"the powers that be\" control (and end) them, well ... I imagine many of us can understand that anger and identify with the emotional outpouring.\n\n\"The Final Cut\" may have been Waters' final work with Pink Floyd, but what a way to go. You can't ask for a better exit than this.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1983\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nThe Police's \"Synchronicity.\"\n\nBilly Joel's \"An Innocent Man.\"\n\nTom Waits' \"Swordfishtrombones.\"\n\nBob Dylan's \"Infidels.\"\n\nPaul Simon's \"Hearts and Bones.\"\n\nJohn Lennon was brutally killed on Dec. 8, 1980. He was shot outside of his home. And with his death, many of the dreams and hopes that had taken shape in the 1960s and had endured the 1970s came to an abrupt end. No possibility of a full Beatles reunion. No more collaborations with Paul McCartney. No more concerts. No more songs that were so personal and somehow universal at the same time. No more lyrical gobbledygook that captured the imagination.\n\nNo more Lennon songs.\n\nA couple weeks before his murder, Lennon had released \"Double Fantasy,\" a collaborative album with wife Yoko Ono. The album seemed to celebrate a mature outlook on life, a more domestically inclined point of view. Songs like \"(Just Like) Starting Over,\" \"Woman\" and \"Watching the Wheels\" were welcome additions to Lennon's output, and his song for son Sean — \"Beautiful Boy (Darling Boy)\" — is touching beyond words. But not everything was flowers and rainbows. \"I'm Losing You\" taps into a bit of anger and desperation, and \"Cleanup Time\" is pretty forward looking in how it was time to clear the slate and get moving again.\n\nThe album certainly set the stage for a follow up, one that could build on the positives established in \"Double Fantasy.\" And the material existed, as another album was being worked on simultaneously with \"Double Fantasy.\"\n\nComing in early 1984, a full three years after Lennon's death, \"Milk and Honey\" gave fans some of the final fruits of Lennon's studio labors. And the songs on this new album were fun. Vital. Maybe even a little more scattered or casual. Obviously, the final polishing and mixing with Lennon's cooperation had never been done before his death. But the energy and off-the-cuff looseness of some of the performances make his songs on \"Milk and Honey\" easily the equals of those on \"Double Fantasy,\" and possibly even superior.\n\n\"Nobody Told Me\" may have been meant for Ringo Starr's \"Stop and Smell the Roses\" album, but Lennon's engaged vocal and the snappy arrangement make it one of my favorite late Lennon tracks. \"I'm Stepping Out\" has such a groove, and gives a few clues that Lennon's \"househusband\" role wasn't one he always embraced (just check out his vocal ad-libs near the end at the fade). \"I Don't Wanna Face It\" and \"Borrowed Time\" seem somehow ... foreboding, but without darkness or depression. It's like Lennon had a premonition that the end was near. Listen to the songs, tell me I'm wrong.\n\nAnd then there's \"Grow Old With Me.\" Oh, beautiful. Simple, and showing its home recording demo roots, the song was envisioned to become the kind of standard that people would play at weddings. It is beautiful, touching, sweet without being saccharine, and devastating considering Lennon's death.\n\nOno's contributions to \"Double Fantasy\" and \"Milk and Honey\" are pretty progressive, and show some skill. Ono will always have her detractors, but her songs work to both enhance Lennon's and also to provide artistic contrasts that may have been more commercially viable in the early 1980s than Lennon's own songs. Her talent should not be denied, nor should the loss she faced.\n\nThese albums stand as monuments to Lennon's life, his hopes for the future and for the love he had in his heart. There would be more posthumous releases, but \"Milk and Honey\" and its Lennon songs send the man off on a high note. The rock-and-roller, the guy with the mischievous twinkle in his eye, he was still there. And then he was gone.\n\nThe parting after \"Milk and Honey\" certainly was some sweet sorrow.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1984\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (1984 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nVan Halen's \"1984.\"\n\nQueen's \"The Works.\"\n\nRoger Waters' \"The Pros and cons of Hitch Hiking.\"\n\nSpinal Tap's \"This is Spinal Tap.\"\n\nBruce Springsteen's \"Born in the U.S.A.\"\n\nPrince's \"Purple Rain.\"\n\nThe Replacements' \"Let It Be.\"\n\nJulian Lennon's \"Valotte.\"\n\nMadonna's \"Like a Virgin.\"\n\nThe Meat Puppets' \"Meat Puppets II.\"\n\n\"Sometimes I think life is just a rodeo / The trick is to ride and make it to the bell.\"\n\nKnow my first memory of John Fogerty's \"Centerfield\" album? It isn't the use of the title song at baseball games. It's of mowing.\n\nI'd been a fan of Creedence Clearwater Revival's music for, well, pretty much my whole life. I can remember hearing the songs on the radio as a very young boy. One of the first cassettes I owned (a gift from my grandmother) was of CCR's \"Chronicle\" album, a great selection of the group's hits. Fogerty's voice is one of the greats in rock and roll.\n\nSo what does mowing have to do with \"Centerfield?\"\n\nI'd done some reading about Fogerty and CCR that mentioned the acrimony of the group's split. And I remember reading about the comeback that was Fogerty's 1985 album. So I got curious. I picked up a bargain bin copy of the album on cassette. I popped it into my Walkman and got on the riding lawnmower and started to mow.\n\nAnd wow! What an album. What a good, solid, punchy record.\n\nThe album starts off with a sound that is pure Creedence. \"The Old Man Down the Road\" has that classic Fogerty sneering drawl, a ridiculous guitar hook and a jumping rhythm. Apparently others thought it sounded like pure Creedence, too ... almost too pure. Fogerty was sued by the owner of Fantasy Records, the label CCR recorded for. It was alleged that Fogerty had plagiarized his own earlier work, ripping off \"Run Through the Jungle.\" Eventually the case closed in favor of Fogerty. But forget that. Just listen to the song, It cooks!\n\nAnd then there's \"Rock and Roll Girls,\" the song that opens with the lyrics I quoted at the start of this chapter. Fogerty's voice comes across so high and clear, a blast of summer sunshine and hope. \"Hey, let's go all over the world.\" It puts a rainbow in my mind, for sure.\n\nAnd of course, there's the title track. \"Centerfield\" and baseball, the song and the sport belong together. And when Fogerty performs the song in concert, he even uses a guitar shaped like a Louisville Slugger baseball bat. It's a history lesson and a vibe that all fans and participants of the sport can appreciate, can feel.\n\nThere are sounds that put this album clearly in the 1980s, but if you listen to the songs, if you listen to Fogerty as he sings and whoops, you could be forgiven for thinking this album slots in at the end of the 1960s, maybe between \"Willy and the Poor Boys\" and \"Cosmo's Factory.\" That's no faint praise, \"Centerfield\" is that solid, it's that classic sounding.\n\nSome voices in music just have the right feel. A little sandpaper here, a little smoke, the right amount of power and an absolute sense of purpose. Fogerty has one of those voices. His vocals reach you all the way out in center field, and his songwriting just tends to feel comfortable. Lived in. Real. Like an old ball glove, perfectly worn, battle tested and trustworthy.\n\nIt'll be several months until green grass pokes through and we're enjoying another season of baseball.\n\nBut that's OK. We have \"Centerfield.\" And say, do you smell something? I swear, it smells just like freshly cut grass ...\n\nHonorable mentions, 1985\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nTom Petty and The Heartbreakers' \"Southern Accents.\"\n\nDire Straits' \"Brothers in Arms.\"\n\n\"Weird Al\" Yankovic's \"Dare to Be Stupid.\"\n\nTom Waits' \"Rain Dogs.\"\n\nThe Jesus and Mary Chain's \"Psychocandy.\"\n\nWhen you hear \"Graceland,\" what's the first thought that comes to your mind?\n\nElvis Presley, maybe?\n\nI'd understand that. And hey, Elvis, the King of rock and roll. The man who inspired so many major artists of the 1960s. The swiveling hips, the curling lip. You ain't nothing but a hound dog!\n\nSo if an artist names an album \"Graceland,\" maybe you'd expect ... what? A tribute album? An album in the style of Elvis? Or at the very least, maybe a record recorded at the site?\n\nBut if you're giving Paul Simon's \"Graceland\" a spin, you aren't gonna get that. Any of that. Sure, the title track mentions Elvis' estate. The narrator (Simon) is traveling with his son. For reasons he can't explain, some part of him wants to see Graceland (in Memphis, Tennessee). But after that? Not much Big E.\n\nBut that's OK. In fact, it's more than OK. Paul Simon may have wanted to find something new. He may have wanted inspiration. He may have wanted to visit the site of Elvis' home, to try to plug into the spirit that may have once moved him, but this new album and the songs on it are a big departure. His muse took him to South Africa. Rhythms, complex vocal arrangements, energy ... \"Graceland\" has all the promise and mystery and soul one might expect from Presley's manor, but it all comes in an unexpected direction. Elvis grew up with gospel and soul music, American \"black\" music. Simon comes back with mbaqanga and isicathamiya, South African \"black\" music.\n\nYou get the parallels?\n\nOK, OK, so let's get to the music. It's fresh. It's fantastic. The record came out in 1986 and it still feels so different than what we hear so regularly on TV, radio, the Internet, etc. While the genre of \"world music\" has grown, I still don't expect that I could just spin a dial on the Minnesota AM/FM spectrum and come across Ladysmith Black Mambazo unless it is one of the \"Graceland\" songs the group sings on.\n\nDepending on who you are, that isn't necessarily a good thing. But for me? It opened my ears to different music. Not just genres, like rap or country or rockabilly. Hearing music made in different styles, with different instruments, in arrangements we wouldn't consider conventional because of our Western mindset, it was (and still is) kinda exciting.\n\nOh, \"The Boy in the Bubble.\" THE SOUND. You can be completely consumed in that track. \"These are the days of miracle and wonder,\" indeed. Then there's the title track (I just love the lyric \"the Mississippi Delta was shining like a national guitar\" ... not only because it refers to resonator guitars, but because you can also consider the Mississippi River and the music that has grown out of the blues traditions around it to be a national treasure, a national emblem).\n\nI figure just about everyone knows \"You Can Call Me Al,\" even if you haven't heard any of the other songs. And the video with Simon with Chevy Chase is pretty fun. But what about the other gems on the album? \"Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes,\" \"Under African Skies,\" \"Homeless\" and \"That Was Your Mother\" are so vital. And ... can you hear country music in the background? Is that a hint of rockabilly? Sweet lord, that guitar is cooking. Rock and roll!\n\nI guess it doesn't matter if you are visiting Elvis' Graceland or if you're just drawing inspiration from it, maybe there's something transcendent in the experience. Something motivational in the place, in the man, in his music. Maybe it takes you on a search, until you find just the right something, the right sound, the right instrument, the right collaborators. Something that encourages a kind of musical alchemy, a combination of cultures and sounds that leads to vibrant, beautiful sound.\n\nThe music hits us in different ways, takes us down different paths. The journey is what's important, and what you take from it. An appreciation of other cultures? A love for new sounds? What you find on the path is all that matters. And I've reason to believe we all will be received in \"Graceland.\"\n\nHonorable mentions, 1986\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nPeter Gabriel's \"So.\"\n\nQueen's \"A Kind of Magic.\"\n\nMadonna's \"True Blue.\"\n\nThe Beastie Boys' \"Licensed to Ill.\"\n\nBob Geldof's \"Deep in the Heart of Nowhere.\"\n\nYou know, I really had no idea that \"Got My Mind Set on You\" was George Harrison.\n\nOh, don't get me wrong. I know he didn't write it. But that sound, that song, that voice ... I'd heard it all over the radio. I remember hearing older kids singing bits of it when I was 9 or 10. That hook. \"I got my mind / SET ON YOU.\" Sure, now that I'm older and pay attention to things like voices, of course it's George Harrison.\n\nBut when I picked up my first copy of \"Cloud Nine,\" I really had no idea.\n\nI picked up a used copy of a CD after The Beatles' Anthology project wrapped up. I'd loved a lot of George's Beatles music, and I owned a couple of the solo albums (\"All Things Must Pass\" is an essential album, gotta have it), but I had never really made an effort to pick up his solo works.\n\nBig mistake.\n\nHere's the thing: John Lennon and Paul McCartney get all the credit for The Beatles. I get it, they were two of the greatest songwriters of the 20th century, one of the most powerful songwriting partnerships. But the sound? That took the whole group. And after The Beatles broke up, Lennon went one way with his sound and McCartney went another. But Harrison? Listen to his music. I often think that George may have been the musical glue of the group. When I listen to \"Cloud Nine,\" I hear what The Beatles could have sounded like had they gotten together in 1986 to start putting a record together. The Rolling Stones had \"Dirty Work,\" and I think this sound could have easily skunked that.\n\nBut this isn't about The Beatles, It's about Harrison's last album released while he was still alive. And it is song after song of great quality. Yes, the album \"suffers\" from the 1980s production and Jeff Lynne's bright touches (as you can probably tell, I don't think the album \"suffers\" at all ... I like the lively sound).\n\nThe opening track is also the song from which the album takes its name, and I love that bass sound, the funkier feel. Starting off the album with this kind of track is brave, in that it isn't a sure-fire hook-driven ear grabber, but it is a wonderful song. Then you launch into other terrific songs. \"That's What It Takes,\" \"Fish on the Sand,\" both songs I really got into.\n\nBut the big songs? \"This Is Love\" is catchy and strident; you feel the breeze behind you. \"When We Was Fab\" recalls \"I Am the Walrus\" and certainly comes across as a tribute to the fallen Lennon. And if you don't love \"Devil's Radio,\" well ... maybe you just like your gossip too much.\n\nAnd there's the last song on the album ... \"Got My Mind Set on You.\" It has that 1980s sound, but with a real feel. The singing is true, and you buy into the music. Go on, listen. If you're not tapping your toe, bobbing your head, snapping your fingers or singing along, maybe your ears aren't working.\n\nThere would be some music released posthumously, and there was the Traveling Wilburys music as well, but \"Cloud Nine\" was the last album of original material to bear George's name while he still walked the earth. And what a joy it is, what a revelation. It feels so good, it makes you feel good. In a way, it puts you on your own cloud nine. Nice when the music lives up to its name, isn't it?\n\nHonorable mentions, 1987\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nU2's \"The Joshua Tree.\"\n\nRoger Waters' \"Radio K.A.O.S.\"\n\nThe Replacements' \"Pleased to Meet Me.\"\n\nMichael Jackson's \"Bad.\"\n\nR.E.M.'s \"Document.\"\n\nAll things considered, I'm a relatively recent convert to Beach Boys / Brian Wilson fandom. But as happens with so many converts, I have a tremendous zeal and loyalty now that I'm in the tent.\n\nAnd when I was first digging into Brian Wilson's solo catalog, there wasn't a lot to track down. At the time, the only legitimate releases were Brian's self-titled solo debut, the \"I Just Wasn't Made for These Times\" soundtrack, the \"Imagination\" album and his \"Live at the Roxy\" release. (The Van Dyke Parks collaboration \"Orange Crate Art\" is quite good, but Wilson contributes only vocals to it). And the only one of the bunch I could actually buy in stores at the time was \"Imagination.\"\n\nI think \"Imagination\" gets a bad rap. For me, it is one of those perfect summer albums. And I listened to it a lot in the summer of 1998.\n\nBut the summer of 1999? I spent it with Wilson's 1988 effort.\n\nIf you've seen this year's \"Love & Mercy\" film starring Paul Dano and John Cusack, it is this album that Brian is working on with Eugene Landy when Melinda (played by Elizabeth Banks) tries to help Wilson break free.\n\nStrip away the history and the drama (and some of that late 1980s production), and you get some pretty great songs. \"Pet Sounds '88\" might be a bit of a stretch, but it was still the finest collection at the time of Brian Wilson tunes since 1977's \"Love You\" (or 1968's \"Friends\" album).\n\nFrom 1997-99, I was hitting eBay regularly. I bought a lot of Beach Boys / Brian Wilson material (legit and bootleg). And my first copy of Wilson's debut album was an eBay purchase. I remember the excitement I had as I ripped open the mailing packaging to find the CD looking up at me. (I still dig the cover art ... I feel oceans and darkness and light in it).\n\nAs for the music: Want a timeless ballad, with a lot of spirituality and heart? You get \"Love and Mercy.\" Want a cool rock tune? \"Walkin' the Line\" (and its footstep percussion) might get you where you want to go. Want some lovely vocals and that traditional Beach Boys harmony? You have got to try \"Melt Away.\" That's three-for-three in great tunes, and all at the front of the album.\n\nIf you like something a bit more challenging, a bit more progressive, something more \"pocket symphony\" like the \"SMiLE\" music, give \"Rio Grande\" a shot.\n\nMy favorite track on the album is \"Meet Me In My Dreams Tonight.\" The arrangement, the sounds, the sleigh bells! It's Brian freaking Wilson, man! Here he is! He's still got it. And is that a little bit of \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" in there? Shhhhh ... (And before I forget, I've gotta give a lot of praise to producer, musician, singer and songwriter Andy Paley for meeting the challenges, collaborating with Brian, getting the best out of him, giving Brian the immediacy and versatility he demands in the studio).\n\nWhen the album came out, it received a lot of praise from critics. And the Brian Wilson faithful rallied around it. But it was a different Beach Boys-related project that got the success. \"Kokomo\" came out and it became the sound of The Beach Boys, the song of the summer and the major hit.\n\nYou can say what you want about \"Kokomo\" (and EVERYBODY has an opinion), but none of it changes the fact that Wilson's solo debut is a work of tremendous talent and skill. It feels like an old friend. And that's because the music is from an old friend. An old friend who saw a world full of sex and violence and upheaval, and offered up a little hymn that gives everyone a little bit of what they need — a comforting helping of love and mercy.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1988\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nLeonard Cohen's \"I'm Your Man.\"\n\nKeith Richards' \"Talk Is Cheap.\"\n\nFreddie Mercury's and Montserrat Caballe's \"Barcelona.\"\n\nThe Traveling Wilburys' \"The Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1.\"\n\nSonic Youth's \"Daydream Nation.\"\n\nMy first introduction to The Beastie Boys has nothing to do with \"Paul's Boutique.\" But we'll get to the album soon, I promise.\n\nMy introduction didn't even come from the ubiquitous \"(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!).\" No, even that came later.\n\nI got introduced to The Beasties from the unlikely source of \"Beavis and Butt-head.\" At least, that's my memory. I remember my brother and I enjoying some parentless cable TV time and watching a \"moron-a-thon.\" And in one of the episodes, I seem to recall one of the music videos showing this really cheesy, 1970s-influenced cop schtick scene. But that music was so insistent. There was nothing schtick about it.\n\nThe song was \"Sabotage,\" and it is still one of my favorite Beastie Boys songs. But we always tend to have special feelings for our firsts, right?\n\nIt was in the later 1990s, after high school graduation, maybe even during my freshman year of college, when I heard bits of Beatles songs being worked into this, well, audio collage. What the heck is this?\n\nAnd that, my friends, was how I found \"Paul's Boutique.\"\n\nThe Beastie Boys made heavy use of samplings in their music. What makes \"Paul's Boutique\" so special over many other artists and albums that feature the same technique is that The Beasties were very, very, very unfettered in their use of other people's music. And The Beatles' material had never really seen that kind of use in anything before. It maybe even led to some artists and companies to re-examine their policies and restrictions, because of lawsuits (and threats of lawsuits) from the blatant sampling.\n\n(As a brief aside: A lot of the music sampled actually did have permission given for use. But The Beastie Boys paid a lot less for the samples than would become the standard. It is unlikely you'd see people being able to sample Beatles music in such a way again, because it would be so cost prohibitive.)\n\nI don't think it'd be unfair to suggest that \"Paul's Boutique\" changed the industry and shook up hip-hop. It wasn't just in the sampling, either. There are references, musically and lyrically, that work together to create these huge messages and homages. And the variety! This isn't \"thrown in a blender and see what happens\" material. Nor is it noise, for the sake of sound. This is an elaborate aural tapestry, where everything has its place.\n\nThe lyrics are still pretty great today. Consider this material, from \"Shadrach\":\n\n\"It's not how you play the game, it's how you win it / I cheat and steal and sin and I'm a cynic.\n\n\"For those about to rock, we salute you / The dirty thoughts for dirty minds we contribute to.\n\n\"I once was lost but now I'm found / The music washes over and you're one with the sound.\"\n\nThese guys knew what they were doing, from the sampling and to the allegations of how they were contributing to the delinquency of younger listeners, but it also revels in this music. Not just their music, but the music that came before them, the music that they use to contribute to their own sound. Ya know, if it wasn't for the rapping and sampling and the arrangements, this follows a lot of the folk tradition of appropriation.\n\nLet that sink in for a minute ...\n\nOne of the issues I see in classifying music under any kind of genre is that it is package-to-sell labeling. And if you are packaging to sell, you also are packaging to avoid. \"I don't like rap, and that is in the rap section, so I won't like it.\" Ditto country, rock, metal, etc.\n\nBut if you listen to \"Paul's Boutique,\" you get a lot of styles. It's not just hip-hop. It's not just using The Beatles or following usual hip-hop tropes of being \"bad\" or substance abuse or violence. There's complexity, sophistication. Would it go too far to say this material is literate, skilled? No. It'd be totally fair. What's even cooler is that it isn't pretentious, it isn't beating you over the head with a \"look how clever we are\" vibe. It's just, simply, great.\n\nGive The Beastie Boys their due, they were true MCs. They'd do more albums, including the \"Ill Communication\" album that features the song \"Sabotage,\" but my favorite remains \"Paul's Boutique.\" I get something new every time I listen to it.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1989\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (1989 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nLou Reed's \"New York.\"\n\nMadonna's \"Like a Prayer.\"\n\nTom Petty's \"Full Moon Fever.\"\n\nThe Cure's \"Disintegration.\"\n\nThe Stone Roses' \"The Stone Roses.\"\n\nPaul McCartney's \"Flowers in the Dirt.\"\n\nNirvana's \"Bleach.\"\n\nDon Henley's \"The End of the Innocence.\"\n\nThe Rolling Stones' \"Steel Wheels.\"\n\nBob Dylan's \"Oh Mercy.\"\n\nBefore I get to the actual assessment of the They Might Be Giants' album \"Flood,\" I really have to apologize.\n\nIn high school, a good friend of mine tried to get me to give the album a chance. But I was really heavily into The Beatles at the time, and I considered everything else inferior music. And not just inferior, but irrelevant.\n\nTo my friend: I am sorry.\n\nI'm sorry I didn't listen to the music with open ears. There's some fun stuff here! (\"Dead\" is one heck of a trip.) There's some serious stuff cloaked as fun stuff, too. (\"Your Racist Friend\" is some great social commentary.) There's some classic singalong goofiness. (\"Birdhouse in Your Soul\" is just so oddly compelling.) There's a great cover song. (\"Istanbul (Not Constantinople)\" is catchy and fun, the kind to crank loudly in the car.)\n\nI'm sorry I didn't appreciate the variety. There's brevity (\"Minimum Wage\" and its whip, ha!), there's comic book hijinx (\"Particle Man\") and great grooves (\"Whistling in the Dark\").\n\nAnd I'm sorry that I was so caught up in the greatness that IS The Beatles that I couldn't appreciate that other music was also great, on its own terms. It took a while, but I got there. I learned that fun music, and pop music, and all kinds of music, are all as important and vital as anything \"serious\" or \"classic.\"\n\nSo ... about the album \"Flood.\"\n\nIt's pretty darn good. It is the kind of album you can love as a 9-year-old or as a 19-year-old or as a 29-year-old. Different jokes hit you as funnier when you have your own experiences. And some remain oddly touching. I first heard \"Particle Man\" as a boy, in an episode of \"Tiny Toon Adventures,\" the spinoff of \"Looney Tunes.\" The lyric seemed so easy, and the animation of the cartoon suited it so well. So when I hear the song today, I remember watching the cartoons with my younger brother, and I remember that video. Funny how we can be sentimental about such light fare.\n\nHow often do you laugh out loud at music that isn't parody, or that isn't strictly comedy music? Because this is real music. And it isn't all laughs and grins. It just doesn't take itself too seriously. The group, the songs, the album all have this open-door communication that is almost childlike without being childish. Sounds and textures and words that come out as these very colorful expressions.\n\nAhhhh, \"Dead.\" Coming back as a bag of groceries? How'd TMBG get there? No idea. But bless the quirkiness. Sometimes off-the-wall is just what you need. Let the world wash away for a bit with \"Flood,\" you'll come out of the album feeling refreshed.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1990\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nWilson Phillips' \"Wilson Phillips.\"\n\nBob Geldof's \"The Vegetarians of Love.\"\n\nDread Zeppelin's \"Un-Led-Ed.\"\n\nPaul Simon's \"The Rhythm of the Saints.\"\n\nThe Traveling Wilburys' \"Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3.\"\n\nConsidering that Freddie Mercury was dying, and that he knew he was dying, and that his bandmates knew he was dying, \"Innuendo\" could have been a very dark, very sad, very downbeat album.\n\nAnd while the album certainly has its reflective and introspective moments, songs that touch on mortality, \"Innuendo\" is one of the best Queen albums released in several years. It was the last Queen album released before Mercury's death in late 1991, and it sounds like a return to the progressive hey-days of the 1970s albums like \"Queen II,\" \"A Night at the Opera\" and \"A Day at the Races.\" Whereas the 1980s seemed to latch on to R&B, dance music and middle-of-the-road chart pleasers (and I'm not knocking any of that), the edge and energy and charisma in the music was lacking.\n\nSongs like \"The Show Must Go On\" and \"These are the Days of Our Lives\" cannot be seen in any other context than through Mercury's impending death. But the former is active, raging at the dying of the light. \"I'll face it with a grin, I'm never giving in, on with the show!\" I get chills. And the latter is touching, a love song, a song that finds peace in the immutable truth that we all go someday, to enjoy the days we have. \"I still love you.\" Freddie's last four words of the song drive it home.\n\nThe title track recalls the days when the band would construct elaborate multi-section songs, like \"March of the Black Queen,\" \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" and \"The Prophet's Song.\" And the song, written and intended as a sort of homage to Led Zeppelin's \"Kashmir,\" succeeds as a modern Queen epic. It is masterful, powerful and fabulous.\n\n\"I'm Going Slightly Mad\" seems an exercise in bizarre one-liners, and \"Delilah\" is really just a charming ode to one of Freddie's favorite cats (you won't find another song with the lyric \"And then you make me slightly mad / when you pee all over my Chippendale suite\").\n\nWant something a little more rock and roll? \"Headlong\" is more of a traditional rocker, and certainly would have made a concert staple had Mercury been healthy and the band had toured.\n\nAnd the beauty of \"Bijou\" ... rather than being a Queen track that's mostly vocal with a guitar solo, the guitar is the main presence and Freddie's vocal is the solo. And the singing and lyrics are so touching, so wonderful, that I ache every time I listen to the song:\n\n\"You and me, we are destined / you'll agree ...\n\n\"To spend the rest of our lives with each other / the rest of our days like two lovers ...\n\n\"Forever, yeah forever ...\"\n\nFreddie knew he was dying, and he puts his heart into that short lyric. It is electrifying, crushing and breathtaking all at once.\n\nThat's the album in a nutshell: Electrifying, crushing and breathtaking. Every element that had made Queen so great, so alluring, so fun and fabulous, is right here on this album. It was a grand, eclectic, satisfying work with which to bow out.\n\nThere'd be more music after Freddie passed, including the \"Made in Heaven\" album that featured Freddie's last works before he succumbed to AIDS. There'd be live albums issued, and so many compilations of the band's work. Queen's legacy will never fade, the music retains its power and catches new generations by storm with regularity.\n\nFreddie went out on a high note, and who could ask for anything more?\n\nHonorable mentions, 1991\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nThe Smashing Pumpkins' \"Gish.\"\n\nTom Petty and The Heartbreakers' \"Into the Great Wide Open.\"\n\nJulian Lennon's \"Help Yourself.\"\n\nNirvana's \"Nevermind.\"\n\nMy Bloody Valentine's \"Loveless.\"\n\nEven if it was only \"Drive\" on this record, \"Automatic for the People\" would top my list for the year.\n\nWith \"Drive,\" I was unexpectedly pulled out of contemporary sounds and was rocketed back to ... when? I don't know. Some 1850s Western setting? A 1950s Western TV show? The song has this guitar progression and effect that brings to mind cowboys. It kind of reminds me of Bon Jovi's \"Wanted Dead or Alive,\" but I prefer R.E.M.'s take.\n\nBut the song has transitions and a build in strings, it has processing, it's kind of a throwback sound with a futuristic process. Make sense? No? Just listen.\n\nAnd \"Automatic for the People\" isn't limited just to the glory of \"Drive.\" As far as the well-known songs are concerned, it also boasts \"The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite,\" \"Everybody Hurts,\" \"Man on the Moon\" and \"Nightswimming.\" That's a veritable greatest hits collection right off the bat (even if some, like \"Everybody Hurts,\" got overplayed and overexposed to the point where it's hard to listen to the music without an automatic groan).\n\nThe first copy of \"Automatic for the People\" that I owned came in used condition from a store I worked at, and it came into my possession years after the album was recorded. And though it kind of embarrasses me to admit it, I bought it because of the \"Man on the Moon\" song, which had been used as the title song to an Andy Kaufman movie starring Jim Carrey. I liked the song, I got curious, I looked for the original album (avoiding the film's soundtrack). When I found which album the song was on, and saw some familiar song titles rounding out the album, I pulled out my wallet.\n\nYou ever have that one album that is just bliss on a first listen? Where every song seems to hang together, weaving some kind of beyond-words perfection? \"Automatic for the People\" was that kind of record for me. Even when \"Everybody Hurts\" had its turn in the sequence, I was amazed at how much I actually enjoyed hearing it in the album context. It hung as part of the record's fabric. Whereas radio listens never did much for me, hearing it as a part of the greater whole made a kind of sense to me.\n\nAnd of course, I was transfixed by opening track \"Drive.\" I grabbed my brother and played it for him, and we both saw it as an incredibly picturesque, vivid soundscape with a vocal that struck something inside us. I STILL don't know whythat song resonates with me, but it does. \"Drive\" remains one of my all-time favorite R.E.M. songs, and it feels like a major piece just waiting for the right exposure to become a mammoth anthem. The album only came out in 1992, there's still time ...\n\n\"Automatic for the People\" has its big majestic moments, but largely feels more intimate, more pared down. It is music that demands to be taken seriously, with lyrics that insist upon being heard. Everyone has their favorite R.E.M. records, but I don't think the group has ever topped the glory or the beauty of this record.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1992\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (1992 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nGreen Day's \"Kerplunk.\"\n\nThey Might Be Giants' \"Apollo 18.\"\n\nRingo Starr's \"Time Takes Time.\"\n\nSonic Youth's \"Dirty.\"\n\nBarenaked Ladies' \"Gordon.\"\n\nRoger Waters' \"Amused to Death.\"\n\nSugar's \"Copper Blue.\"\n\nTom Waits' \"Bone Machine.\"\n\nBlind Melon's \"Blind Melon.\"\n\nDr. Dre's \"The Chronic.\"\n\nEvery time I listen to \"In Utero,\" I get a tingle of electricity down my spine.\n\nEvery time.\n\nThere's something in the music, something in the sound, something in Kurt Cobain's voice and in the band's collective presence. Something primal and pure, it strikes right at the nervous system.\n\nThere's no doubt that \"Nevermind\" is the group's commercial masterpiece, but \"In Utero\" is my favorite. It's a more organic record, it's got such a punk discipline in sound. The songs feel immediate, even now, more than 20 years after the album's release. Every note, every jagged shot of feedback, every howl feels so precisely perfect on a record that was to be the antithesis to precise perfection.\n\nI've written about Cobain and Nirvana before, and touched on my love for the \"In Utero\" album. But sometimes words fail to convey the power that music holds on you, emotionally and spiritually.\n\nIsolate that bassline to \"Heart Shaped Box\" and tell me that isn't the most supremely wicked, fascinatingly dark sound you can conjure. (You can tell me otherwise, but I'll disagree with you.) I think you could release just that bassline for Halloween CDs and it'd be massively popular in its own right.\n\nListen to that overblown surf guitar sound on \"Serve the Servants.\" Surf guitar sound? How so? Man, imagine Dick Dale in plaid, with emotional baggage, more than a little anger and the commercial clout to do whatever he wants. Then get back to me. The guitar skips and dives, runs up and down, it jitters and it conjures frantic power. 'Nuff said.\n\nListen to the words of \"Dumb.\" \"I think I'm just happy.\" I mean, doesn't that say something to you? Have you ever been able to relate to a mindset where something negative might actually be positive, or vice versa? Sniffing glue? Floating on clouds? The lyrics maybe sound like teenage foolishness, but dig the sound with it. The song is like a burned-out daydream.\n\nOh, \"Pennyroyal Tea.\" How many people did I know when I was growing up who tried to make this concoction? And how many songs do you know that manage to work \"cherry-flavored antacids\" into the lyric? And that sound ... Desperation? I don't know, but it has a soothing quality to it.\n\nWhen I think of all the great work Nirvana did, all the excellent material recorded in the various incarnations of the group, and I reflect on what was lost when Cobain died, the first thing that comes to mind isn't the immortal \"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" or the baby in the swimming pool cover of \"Nevermind.\" It is the power and depth of \"In Utero.\"\n\n\"In Utero\" was everything that was scary and unfettered and powerful in Nirvana. It was everything honest and dishonest and playful. \"In Utero\" is power and introversion, combined, a sonic and emotional powerhouse that darn few can claim to approach in quality. John Lennon's \"Plastic Ono Band\" is the only album that I'd put above \"In Utero\" for the complete catharsis and pain and psyche examination found in the music.\n\nNot bad for a record recorded at Pachyderm Studio in Minnesota's own Cannon Falls.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1993\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nBob Geldof's \"The Happy Club.\"\n\nPaul McCartney's \"Off the Ground.\"\n\nAerosmith's \"Get a Grip.\"\n\nThe Smashing Pumpkins' \"Siamese Dream.\"\n\nBilly Joel's \"River of Dreams.\"\n\nI was driving back from a Boy Scouts camping trip when my friend asked, \"Do you listen to much Johnny Cash?\"\n\nI didn't. As I've written elsewhere, my parents weren't big on country music. But I knew some of the big Cash songs, like \"Ring of Fire,\" Walk the Line\" and those early hits. So I told my friend, \"I know a couple songs, but not enough to call myself a fan or anything.\"\n\nHe said, \"Oh, you have to try out this album. It is track after track of good stuff.\" And he handed me a copy of Johnny Cash's \"American Recordings.\"\n\nI admit, I didn't get to it right away. I imagine you've been in the situation where people loan you music, encourage you to try it, piling adjective upon adjective so that you'll listen to it ... but you're just really not that interested. It is no reflection on that music itself, it's more of your state of mind.\n\nAfter a couple weeks, I had nothing going on and was starting to feel bad that I was still borrowing the album and hadn't even tried it. So I popped it in.\n\nWhat can I say? I liked it. But I didn't love it. It sounded good, I liked the variety. \"The Beast in Me\" and \"Drive On\" were pretty cool, and \"Thirteen\" was a dark classic. I enjoyed pretty much all of the songs, but none of them made me want to drop what I was doing and devote my full attention to the record. So I returned the CD to my friend, thanked him, offered a few bland compliments (\"Boy, he sure sounds good on this album\") and moved on.\n\nFast forward five or more years, to when I was living in St. Cloud. Mick Hatten and I were having one of our many music talks, and the discussion turned to Johnny Cash in general and the American albums, in particular. Beyond having heard the first album and then enjoying some of the songs on \"IV,\" I had nothing much to contribute. So Mick loaded me up and my education began.\n\nWhile the \"American Recordings\" album in its own right isn't my favorite of the series, it is nonetheless a landmark album and a treat from start to finish. It is a record that tends to feel like an old friend, a record you enjoy spending time with whenever you put it on. Listening to Cash's voice soar on \"Down There by the Train\" is a treat, and his recitation of \"Delia's Gone\" is by turns sorrowful and regretful, then plainspoken and matter-of-fact.\n\nWithout the \"American Recordings\" album and the series of records under the American label, Cash's legacy would still have been strong and defined by a number of hits and stylistic evolutions. However, the American albums created a foundation for a new image, perhaps even a new myth, of the man in black. The quality was supremely high, the content varied, the myriad styles somehow all brought under the sound of Cash's guitar and voice. He proved himself the master of song, of any song.\n\nAnd that is made abundantly clear on the first record of the American series. For that reason alone, \"American Recordings\" should be feted.\n\nWhat about Tom Petty?\n\nMy actual favorite album for 1994 is Tom Petty's \"Wildflowers.\" But I've already written about that album, and I didn't want to repurpose copy for this project. I figure if you good folks are taking the time to read my words, I could at least give you fresh material.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1994\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (1994 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nThe new Beatles, man! The biggest thing to hit music since Elvis! The best songs since (insert artist here) gave us (insert song here)!\n\nGet the point?\n\nOK, all those qualities may be exaggerations, but in 1995 all the hyperbole was in the air, on TV and in the trades. It sure felt true, at the time.\n\nAnd \"(What's the Story) Morning Glory?\" was the album that sealed it. Whether or not you liked Oasis, you couldn't have gone through the 1990s without hearing \"Wonderwall\" or \"Champagne Supernova.\" It sounded enough like 1960s pop that oldies stations would play it, and it was a bright pop sound, so it did well on contemporary stations.\n\nI was 15 at the time, and my devotion to The Beatles was nearing its peak. What was this blasphemy? A new Beatles? Hadn't this label been used before? (The Knack come to mind.) Was music so creatively bankrupt that soundalikes were the only way to make it big?\n\nAh, but then, I hadn't heard any of the music. And judging any artist or album without hearing the music for yourself is always bad policy (beware of tastemakers who encourage you to skip something on their say-so ... you have your own ears).\n\nSo I gave the album a listen, and I loved it. The next Beatles? Yes, that was an exaggeration. But darned if the album didn't sound really good. My favorites were \"Don't Look Back in Anger\" (which truly does sound Beatles-esque) and \"She's Electric,\" which to this day is one of my favorite Britpop songs. \"There's lots and lots for us to do / she is electric, can I be electric too?\" Gets me every time.\n\nIn the 1990s, if you were into the Britpop sound, you tended to either be in the Oasis camp or the Blur camp. I didn't listen to Blur much, and I still haven't. I'm sure Damon Albarn and company are great, but ... I had Oasis. I was pretty comfortable with that selection.\n\nOf course, the band's lineup changed over the years. And then brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher had yet another huge falling out (shades of The Kinks and their brothers, Ray and Dave Davies) and Oasis split.\n\nConsidering the \"next Beatles\" label that Oasis itself was pinned with, I won't go so far as to say that we'll never see the like of Oasis again. But records like \"Definitely Maybe\" and \"(What's the Story) Morning Glory?\" reflect just how good it was to have the band while it was here. And if you haven't already, check out \"Don't Believe the Truth\" and \"Dig Out Your Soul,\" the band's last two albums. The band went out the way it came in, with two excellent albums and a high bar set for its contemporaries.\n\nSo if you enjoy some good British pop music, with a solid back beat and catchy guitar solos and plenty of \"that sounds like ...\" hooks, you can do far worse than revisiting this Oasis classic. As their song \"Roll With It\" suggests, \"don't let anybody get in your way.\" The album was big for a reason, no shame in enjoying it now. Who cares what some might say?\n\nHonorable mentions, 1995\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (1995 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nRadiohead's \"The Bends.\"\n\nSupergrass' \"I Should Coco.\"\n\nAlanis Morissette's \"Jagged Little Pill.\"\n\nThe Presidents of the United States of America's \"The Presidents of the United States of America.\"\n\nThe Flaming Lips' \"Clouds Taste Metallic.\"\n\nShane MacGowan and the Popes' \"The Snake.\"\n\nGreen Day's \"Insomniac.\"\n\nThe Smashing Pumpkins' \"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness.\"\n\nThe Rentals' \"Return of the Rentals.\"\n\nQueen's \"Made in Heaven.\"\n\nThe Beatles' \"Anthology 1.\"\n\nWhen I first heard Weezer's \"Pinkerton,\" I hated it. Like, HATED it.\n\nMy best friend got me into Weezer, with their debut album, and it took me a while to get into it. But once I got there, I really enjoyed it. Songs like \"The World Has Turned and Left Me Here\" left a big mark on me, and I had a set belief in how the band should sound and the kinds of songs it should perform.\n\n\"Pinkerton\" took those notions and tossed them into the trash.\n\nThe sound was raw, dark. Where were the peppy, geeky kind of songs? I sure didn't hear them in the mix of songs about sex, lesbians and Japanese girls.\n\nAfter the success of Weezer's debut album (known affectionately as the \"Blue Album\"), group leader and main songwriter Rivers Cuomo went to Harvard. He wrote about some confusion, some anger, some physical ailments (walking with an old man's cane), and it all took this kind of anguished, introverted atmosphere.\n\nIf you wanted more \"Buddy Holly,\" you didn't get it. Instead, you got the grandfather of emo records. \"Getchoo\" maybe puts things in the proper perspective: \"This is beginning to hurt, this is beginning to be serious.\" The sound is live, the bass thrums and guitar lines are jagged. Cuomo gives some of his best tuneful howls, and \"Pinkerton\" becomes this great flood of passion and pain.\n\nBut on the first few listens, it just seemed like noise. Melodic noise, anthemic noise, but noise nonetheless.\n\nI think my younger brother caught on to it before I did, really. He listened to it with more regularity, and stuff started to sink in. I started to get into songs like \"The Good Life\" (a song I'll always associate with my brother), and I enjoyed the intricate lyrics of \"Across the Sea.\" And album closer \"Butterfly\" has such a wistful tune and ends with the words \"I'm sorry,\" in a straight-from-the-heart voice.\n\nAnd I think that kind of emotional and stylistic purity is what keeps \"Pinkerton\" so fresh and important to me. Strip away the Ric Ocasek production from the first album, get back to a sound more like a live experience, then dig deep into affairs of the heart and mind and then let loose as microphones pick up the crashing drums, the angry guitars and the exasperated vocals.\n\nThis, my friends, is all your growing-up angst and all those late-at-night-and-in-the-dark thoughts, thrown onto an audio canvas.\n\nAfter I'd finally given in and gave up my prejudices on how Weezer music should sound, I got heavily emotionally invested in the record. Bitter disappointment on the love front? Sure, I can relate. A general feeling of isolation and loneliness? Heck, who doesn't feel that from time to time? Feeling like you're a million miles away from someone who could make everything feel better? Oh, sure, if you've got a romantic stripe in you, you've had to have felt that sometime in your life.\n\n\"This is beginning to hurt,\" indeed. But thanks for hanging in there, Weezer. The pain led to a masterpiece.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1996\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (1996 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\n\"Weird Al\" Yankovic's \"Bad Hair Day.\"\n\nThe Beatles' \"Anthology 2.\"\n\nSuperdrag's \"Regretfully Yours.\"\n\nThe Wallflowers' \"Bringing Down the Horse.\"\n\nSquirrel Nut Zippers' \"Hot.\"\n\nTom Petty and The Heartbreakers' \"Songs and Music from 'She's the One.'\"\n\nVarious artists, the soundtrack for \"That Thing You Do!\"\n\nThe Beatles' \"Anthology 3.\"\n\nWilco's \"Being There.\"\n\nJohnny Cash's \"Unchained.\"\n\nI came to Radiohead's \"OK Computer\" in an unusual way.\n\nI was a sophomore in college and I was playing an online game, and one of my friends on the game was a fella from Australia. We were talking about music, and I was undoubtedly gushing about Pink Floyd (my musical obsession at the time). He asked me about what I liked about Pink Floyd's music. I undoubtedly went into long rhapsodies about the song constructions, how some of the music has an organic buildup, that I could get washed away in blankets of sound, that the lyrics had an odd way of peering into neglected nooks and crannies that other music never penetrated.\n\n\"I think I know what you mean,\" he said. \"You've got to give Radiohead's 'OK Computer' a try.\"\n\nI'd heard, and even liked, other Radiohead material before this recommendation. But \"OK Computer\" was virgin territory for me.\n\nCurious, I eventually wandered out to a store and picked up a copy.\n\nAnd I really wasn't sure how I felt about it, even after a handful of listens. How did my love of Pink Floyd music lead me here?\n\n\"OK Computer\" and its lyrics weren't necessarily personal, they were more abstract. But there was this probing quality to them.\n\nThe music was, well, layered and atmospheric, collages of sounds that would flow together and then there'd be a tension that'd give way to something in a lyric or a vocal.\n\nI wasn't really quite sure how much of \"OK Computer\" was deliberately produced, or how much of it was a product of chance, of pure serendipity.\n\nAnd maybe that was the real hook for me. The music kept me guessing, it kept me involved. The song titles were a mix of standard fare and peculiar (the former including \"Let Down,\" \"No Surprises,\" \"Lucky\" and the latter featuring \"Paranoid Android,\" \"Subterranean Homesick Alien\" and \"Exit Music (For a Film).\"\n\nThe lyrics, the sounds, the song titles, they all appealed to different parts of my head.\n\nI tend to think that music is a very personal experience in life. Sure, you have massive hits that everyone buys and become global anthems. But what we hear in the music, what we feel from the music, what we respond to in the music are very personal. And when you move away from the big hits, the chart toppers, and you're listening to music that is more soundscape than guitar-hero hijinx, it's all about what you find and what you feel and what you take away from it.\n\nI guess I can see the Pink Floyd connection, after all. The material gets into all those nooks and crannies, organic buildups and all.\n\nI may need to track down my Aussie friend and thank him. It's long overdue.\n\nWhat about Paul McCartney?\n\nMy actual favorite album for 1997 is Paul McCartney's \"Flaming Pie.\" But I've already written about that album, and I didn't want to repurpose copy for this project. I figure if you good folks are taking the time to read my words, I could at least give you fresh material.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1997\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nElliott Smith's \"Either/Or.\"\n\nSupergrass' \"In It for the Money.\"\n\nJohn Fogerty's \"Blue Moon Swamp.\"\n\nOasis' \"Be Here Now.\"\n\nBob Dylan's \"Time Out of Mind.\"\n\nThe more things change, the more things stay the same.\n\nAn online pal got me into \"OK Computer,\" and another online pal got me into \"Head Trip in Every Key.\"\n\nI think it was around 2013 that a Facebook friend (hi Becknar!) asked me what I thought about Superdrag.\n\nOddly enough, the Superdrag albums I had been exposed to were not their biggest records. Go figure.\n\nA guy I roomed with in college had gotten me into the band a little, and I had copies of \"In the Valley of Dying Stars\" (which I really liked), \"Greetings from Tennessee\" (which was OK) and \"Last Call for Vitriol\" (another excellent record).\n\nBut I had never heard \"Regretfully Yours\" or \"Head Trip in Every Key.\"\n\nBecknar, the passionate gent that he is about music, found copies of both albums at basement prices on eBay and sent me the links. Days later, I had these albums in my hands. Headphones ready, I dug in.\n\nBefore I start talking \"Head Trip,\" let me just say this: If you love 1990s power pop and alt rock, you owe it to yourself to get these two records. Part of me wants to say that Superdrag is almost the Cheap Trick of the 1990s (and in case you have mixed feelings on what that could mean, take it as a compliment).\n\nAs for the music? Oh, man. Think about the 1967 era of The Beatles, like \"Sgt. Pepper\" and \"Magical Mystery Tour,\" with sitars and orchestrated hooks and lush backing tracks. The vocals are crisp, there are tasty hooks and everything sounds so punchy and vibrant. Getting the Cheap Trick angle, yet?\n\nBut Superdrag's members aren't just copying a sound or replicating a style. The best music can pay homage to a sound while also creating something distinctive and refreshing.\n\nLooking for hits or key cuts? You won't find any. The album is a triumph of studio use, but it isn't a collection of radio hits or chart toppers. If you've heard any of the songs on the record, it's likely it was \"Do the Vampire.\" But don't be dismissing the album because you don't recognize the song titles or haven't heard the tracks. \"I'm Expanding My Mind\" has to be one of the great leadoff tracks on a 1990s album, and the group's purpose for the album is right there in the title. Imagine you're outside on a hot day, and you step into an air-conditioned sanctuary. That woosh of refreshment, that sudden relief, an immediate comfort. That's the opening track. Comfortable, engaging, getting you ready for more.\n\nHats off to you, Becknar. How'd I miss this back in the day? It only took me 15 years, but now I'm in love with one of the late 1990s great lost albums. No drag in that.\n\nWhat about Madonna?\n\nMy actual favorite album for 1998 is Madonna's \"Ray of Light.\" But I've already written about that album, and I didn't want to repurpose copy for this project. I figure if you good folks are taking the time to read my words, I could at least give you fresh material.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1998\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nJulian Lennon's \"Photograph Smile.\"\n\nLucinda Williams' \"Car Wheels on a Gravel Road.\"\n\nBarenaked Ladies' \"Stunt.\"\n\nThe Beach Boys' \"Endless Harmony Soundtrack.\"\n\nElliott Smith's \"XO.\"\n\nWhen I first moved to St. Cloud in late 2004, I made a number of new friends. With new friendships came exposure to music I hadn't tried. I knew some Nine Inch Nails material, but it took a copy editor friend to get me into \"The Fragile.\"\n\nIt goes something like this. The copy desk was talking about key albums and artists that meant a lot to them for whatever reason. I talked about Brian Wilson and his recently released \"Brian Wilson Presents SMiLE,\" and others were contributing their favorites. The copy editor, a good dude named Ryan, spoke of \"The Fragile.\" Excited discussions were had, and this led to people burning CDs of albums to introduce everyone else to the music.\n\nAnd folks, the proper etiquette when sharing favorites with each other always is to at least try the favorites given by others in the conversation. That give-and-take is part of the fun.\n\nSo I popped in \"The Fragile,\" sat in a comfy chair and started to listen.\n\nSome music, you're just going to dislike for whatever reason. If you hate rap, you hate rap. If you hate country, you hate country. If you hate industrial music, you hate industrial music. And Nine Inch Nails is heavily rooted in industrial music, but it has a heavy rock vibe to it. If you like pop or lighter fare, this is probably not for you.\n\nBut oh, seriously, just listen. This isn't the usual NIN (if NIN can ever be described to be \"usual\"). It's avant garde, artsy, multifaceted, complex, almost symphonic, a truly layered work. Is this prog rock? Maybe?\n\nWhat I know for sure is that it is experimental and pushes the envelope of what Trent Reznor had done on previous albums. It can alternate from airy to suffocating, chillingly isolated and then overheated and claustrophobic. I mean, how do you zigzag like that, sometimes just one moment to the next on the same track? It's like capturing wind and trying to shape something from it, powerful and frightening and then gone. And it's angry. It is so angry.\n\nBut let you think this is some atmosphere album, no, it has songs. It has lyrics. While all the pieces fit together as a disjointed and compelling whole, you can pull out individual tunes. But it almost feels a disservice to talk about individual songs when the impact of the album is from its totality. You can thrash and wail, or you can hug yourself and chant. You feel eerily alienated and disturbingly understood.\n\nSound frightening? It is. But the best art grabs you and doesn't let you go. And \"The Fragile\" refuses to let you go, it lingers, and it draws strength over the years. It isn't that it is lyrically inventive or sonically original, but there's this cumulative effect that blows you away. It isn't for the faint of heart, but it is an album worth experiencing.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1999\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (1999 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nEminem's \"The Slim Shady LP.\"\n\nTom Petty and The Heartbreakers' \"Echo.\"\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers' \"Californication.\"\n\nThe Flaming Lips' \"The Soft Bulletin.\"\n\nThe Rentals' \"Seven More Minutes.\"\n\nThe Dixie Chicks' \"Fly.\"\n\nThe Magnetic Fields' \"69 Love Songs.\"\n\nPaul McCartney's \"Run Devil Run.\"\n\nCrosby, Stills, Nash & Young's \"Looking Forward.\"\n\nBeck's \"Midnite Vultures.\"\n\nMy first impressions of Eminem's \"The Marshall Mathers LP\" came from selling it.\n\nIn the summer of 2000, I was working at a store that sold music, movies and books. I really enjoyed that job and the people I worked with, and we had our regulars as customers — the folks who'd come in every day and would chat about their favorite music, concerts they'd gone to, celebrities they'd met, that kind of thing.\n\nOne day, one of our regulars (a guy in his early 40s) came in wearing a Led Zeppelin T-shirt, and he headed right over to the music section. I figured there'd be some classic rock or maybe some metal coming up to the register with him. Nope.\n\nHe had a copy of Eminem's latest release, \"The Marshall Mathers LP.\"\n\nI asked him about it. Was he a fan? What got him interested in buying the album? Had he heard much Eminem before?\n\nIt turns out that he'd never heard an Eminem song before, but he was buying it for his son and had heard and read that it was a very strong album, with adult themes and language, but that it also was very artistic and intriguing. Fair enough. He bought it, and that was that.\n\nI hadn't actually heard the record. In fact, it would take another year before I'd hear more than a few tracks (you couldn't really get away from \"Stan\" or \"The Real Slim Shady,\" as they were on TV and everyone was listening to them). I had friends who listened to hip-hop regularly, and they talked about how revolutionary the record was, and they played me select tracks.\n\nAs a narrative piece, the album hangs together really well. Eminem's conflicts with authority, with fame and with his wife and mother, as well as his anger, his drug use and his violent outlook, didn't come across as gimmicks or stereotypes. Sincerity is a quality that can add quite a bit to art, and you'll find quite a bit of sincerity throughout this record — some of it quite scary.\n\nBut there's a lot of humor (sometimes dark, but humor nonetheless) on this album. The themes jump from the kind of material that could make horror movie fodder or content for a \"CSI\" episode, then jump to songs that deflate the situation and basically ask the listener, \"Are you actually taking this seriously?\" I find him refreshing, provocative, intelligent, surreal.\n\nIf you have a preconceived notion of Eminem as a violent, foul-mouthed thug, \"Stan\" still stands as one of the best challenges to that image. It gives you a glimpse behind the public face, demonstrating the fan expectations, the pressures of fame and the downsides of adulation brilliantly. Eminem knows who he is, and what he is.\n\nHe's the real Slim Shady, sometimes. He's Marshall Mathers, sometimes. He's who he needs to be, what he has to be, and this album is just an early part of an important musical and cultural legacy.\n\nHe's released some great albums since, too. And if you've never seen his film \"8 Mile,\" give it a shot. Give all his records a shot. Maybe you'll glean some understanding from all the material. Or maybe you'll be entertained. Or maybe you'll find it disturbing, or vulgar, or obscene.\n\nI'm sure Eminem would welcome any of those views. He's heard it all, been called it all. That's just the way he is.\n\nHonorable mentions, 2000\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nThe White Stripes' \"De Stijl.\"\n\nColdplay's \"Parachutes.\"\n\nVarious artists, the soundtrack for \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\"\n\nRadiohead's \"Kid A.\"\n\nPaul Simon's \"You're the One.\"\n\nAfter being introduced to Weezer's \"Blue Album\" and taking a while to really embrace sophomore effort \"Pinkerton,\" I was finally primed for a new Weezer release when it was announced that a third album was on the way.\n\n\"Would it be as dark and personal as 'Pinkerton?' \" I asked myself. \"Oooh, or maybe it'll be some new rock opera, some artful new expression of frustration!\"\n\nWhat we got was quite the opposite of that.\n\nPower pop, huge bursts of guitar riffs and catchy hooks, an album seemingly created to be a summer masterpiece. This was what Weezer gave us for album No. 3.\n\nAnother self-titled effort, like the group's debut, this one has taken to being called the \"Green Album\" because of the vivid green background on it. Also like the debut, the group members are lined up on the cover (though the band's personnel had changed, with a new bassist in the group).\n\nBut that's about where the similarities end. Whereas \"Blue\" had an alt-rock feel with some pop sensibilities, \"Green\" is pure pop sweetness with a tendency to rock.\n\nAnd \"Green\" is short; it runs less than 30 minutes. \"Blue\" has \"Only in Dreams,\" which is more than eight minutes by itself.\n\nIn the end, though, the length didn't matter, nor did the style. I didn't find myself disappointed by \"Green.\" In fact, I was pretty happy with it. It came out in the middle of May 2001, and I bought my first copy after finishing a couple of my more-challenging college finals of the school year. The relief I felt at being done with those classes was nicely boosted by the mostly happy feeling to the majority of the songs. Even the sadder sounds felt upbeat.\n\n\"Photograph\" was so much fun ... \"If you want it, you can have it / but you're gonna have to reach out there and grab it.\" So simple, but so true. Nothing wrong with simplicity, folks. And then there's the Sumo wrestlers in \"Hash Pipe\" (and that song has a wicked groove, I still get grabbed by it). \"Island in the Sun\" definitely grabbed a lot of ears (hip hip), and \"Crab\" is some singalong fun.\n\nMy favorite from the album then, as now, is \"Smile.\" A little different production or a little different approach and the track could have easily slipped on to \"Blue\" or \"Pinkerton.\" An off-kilter love song, I'll grant you, but I love it. \"The way you wanna wrap me up inside your smile,\" a wonderful idea.\n\n\"Green\" is probably the easiest of Weezer albums to play for new listeners, as it is fun, catchy and not terribly challenging. Beyond the drug references in \"Hash Pipe\" or the word \"knickers\" in the song \"Crab,\" it is the kind of music that 8-year-olds and 80-year-olds would find pleasing to the ear.\n\nSound awful? Sound like a sellout? Sound like commercial fluff? Bah. Get over it. Pop it in a player, crank it up and have some fun. You might just find that you like it. Maybe you'll find that it makes you feel better. Heck, maybe it will even make you feel happy. Who knows? Maybe it'll make you feel so fine, you can't control your brain. (Hip hip.)\n\nWhat about Bob Dylan?\n\nMy actual favorite album for 2001 is Bob Dylan's \"Love and Theft.\" But I've already written about that album, and I didn't want to repurpose copy for this project. I figure if you good folks are taking the time to read my words, I could at least give you fresh material.\n\nHonorable mentions, 2001\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nThe White Stripes' \"White Blood Cells.\"\n\nSuper Furry Animals' \"Rings Around the World.\"\n\nSlipknot's \"Iowa.\"\n\nElton John's \"Songs from the West Coast.\"\n\nThe Strokes' \"Is This It.\"\n\nThe Dixie Chicks get a lot of crap thrown at them. Too pop to be country. Too country to be pop. The George Bush and \"Shut Up and Sing\" stuff. Their brashness, their fierce \"we don't care what you think or what you want, we'll be us and you can take it or leave it\" stance on things (which would likely be celebrated if they were men instead of women ... but that's a topic for another time).\n\nBut damn, do they have a sound. Whether it is Natalie Maines' vocals or the combined instrumental and harmony sounds with bandmates Emily Robison and Martie Maguire, there's a powerful combination of sweetness, determination, mischief and joie de vivre that is as compelling as the guitar strums and fiddle flourishes.\n\nI was walking between two dorms on the University of Missouri campus in autumn 2002 when I first heard them. It was this bouncy (and laid back, at the same time) track, it almost reminded me of Civil War music but was way, way too modern. What the heck was it?\n\nI was talking to a friend about songs we liked, and out of the blue she played \"Travelin' Soldier.\"\n\nThat was IT. That was THE SONG.\n\nWell, forget the Civil War. A bus, Army greens, this was definitely a more modern setting (Vietnam). But the sound and sentiment leaps generations, and the words ring true no matter the age. \"Our love will never end, waitin' for the soldier to come back again / never more to be alone when the letter said, 'A soldier's coming home.' \"\n\nOK, so I knew the song. I knew the artist. Now to add the album to my collection. I hit a music store, and there it was: \"Home.\" That was the album. Picked up, purchased, mine. Mission accomplished (I trust you'll forgive the situational humor). And it was love from first listen.\n\nIt sounded so natural. It had more of a folk and bluegrass leaning, heavy on acoustic instrumentation and sounding fantastic. Honestly, it sounded like a classic album that had been around for decades but was freshly discovered somehow. It was warm and comfortable and exciting, something I hadn't really thought possible for a country music album at that time.\n\nCollege is a good time for getting over biases. With \"Home\" and my exposure to Johnny Cash's \"American Recordings,\" I started to set aside biases of songs about pickup trucks, drinking and \"she done me wrong\" stereotypes and started to acknowledge the depth and artistry within the genre. And \"Home\" by itself was quite an education.\n\nThe Dixie Chicks even took on Fleetwood Mac's \"Landslide\" and covered it admirably, standing tall right up there against Stevie Nicks' own definitive performance.\n\nAnd the instrumental \"Lil' Jack Slade,\" wow, really, that's a headphones track. I enjoy every listen.\n\nSure, on \"Home\" you still get some traditional country music references (song titles like \"White Trash Wedding\" and \"Tortured, Tangled Hearts\" sound tailor-made for jukeboxes at honky tonks), but I like that. It's history, it's part of the genre, it's part of the tradition. It's fun, it pulls on nostalgic heartstrings that you may not even know you had until the sounds pluck them.\n\n\"Home\" is damn good music. Setting aside the politics and the situation, this is a great American album, an important entry in country music and is my favorite Dixie Chicks album by a wide margin (and I've since picked up and enjoyed all the Maines-era Chicks records).\n\nTurn it on, let it play. See if you'll shed a tear with the pretty little girl with a bow in her hair.\n\nHonorable mentions, 2002\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (2002 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nThe Streets' \"Original Pirate Material.\"\n\nWilco's \"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.\"\n\nEminem's \"The Eminem Show.\"\n\nThe Flaming Lips' \"Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots.\"\n\nMy Chemical Romance's \"I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love.\"\n\nBruce Springsteen's \"The Rising.\"\n\nInterpol's \"Turn on the Bright Lights.\"\n\nTom Petty and The Heartbreakers' \"The Last DJ.\"\n\nJohnny Cash's \"American IV: The Man Comes Around.\"\n\nGeorge Harrison's \"Brainwashed.\"\n\nGosh, is there anyone older than 18 who hasn't heard \"Seven Nation Army?\" I'd be inclined to guess not.\n\nFor quite a stretch there, it seemed to be everywhere. It's one of The White Stripes' signature songs, and it kicks off their 2003 album \"Elephant\" with insistent, undeniable, unavoidable energy. And it is one of those earworms that you just cannot get out of your head. I know. I've tried.\n\nIt isn't a bad song. In fact, it's a pretty cool song. But like all cool songs that have been overplayed, one may find oneself skipping the track to get to other goodies. The blessing of \"Elephant\" is that there are many goodies worth skipping to.\n\nMy personal favorite is their cover of \"I Just Don't Know What to Do With Myself,\" the Burt Bacharach / Hal David song that has been recorded by such greats as Dusty Springfield and Dionne Warwick. And with all respect to those versions, The Stripes' rendition is my favorite. It has a snarling, carnal quality that is both seductive and bombastic. And the video, well, it didn't hurt things either.\n\nOne of the cool touches on \"Elephant\" is the use of antiquated equipment during the recording and production of the album. No computers, no modern processes. What does this mean to the casual listener? Maybe not a whole lot (though I suspect you'll sense some undefinable something that you can't articulate). For dedicated students of sound and those who spend some time with headphones, the old equipment adds a dimension and sonic quality that conjures the live energy and excitement of earlier recordings. There's a spark, a crackle, a fuzz, not an imperfection but an enhancement, a \"you are here\" buzz that can suck you right into the music.\n\nAt least, that's how it feels to me.\n\nEarlier White Stripes albums had several good songs, and the garage rock sound was well established. But \"Elephant\" was where Jack and Meg White really kicked things up a notch, cranked the volume to 11 and blew the doors off garages near and far. And it set the stage for \"Get Behind Me Satan,\" my favorite Stripes album.\n\nIf you like you rock a bit loud and bluesy, if you like some slashing guitars and your drums to feel like thunder, \"Elephant\" has those qualities in spades. You want things a bit more toned down, intimate, you want to be coaxes through songs? \"Elephant\" has that too. There's such a variety of styles, I never get bored with \"Elephant.\" No one-trick pony, The White Stripes.\n\nAnd if all else fails, there's always \"Seven Nation Army.\" It's one of the 14 great songs on the album, and every single one's got a story to tell.\n\nHonorable mentions, 2003\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nRingo Starr's \"Ringo Rama.\"\n\nAvenged Sevenfold's \"Waking the Fallen.\"\n\nWarren Zevon's \"The Wind.\"\n\nThe Beatles' \"Let It Be ... Naked.\"\n\nAlicia Keys' \"The Diary of Alicia Keys.\"\n\nIn 2004, My Chemical Romance was nowhere near my radar. I had college graduation, my first newspaper job in North Carolina, my first car that was all mine and then the move to St. Cloud. And Brian Wilson released two albums that year, so I was pretty preoccupied.\n\nAnd to be honest, I don't know if I'd have paid any attention to My Chem even if the rest of the variables weren't in play. The band looked like the goth guys you maybe avoided in class. And songs about vampires and zombies and ghosts and ... well, there you go.\n\nBut then I discovered \"The Black Parade,\" and everything changed. I learned the ever-popular (and generally true) creed of not judging books by their covers.\n\nAfter I got hooked on \"The Black Parade,\" I started filling in the past releases. The excellent 2002 debut \"I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love\" is a much rawer effort than \"The Black Parade,\" and makes one wonder if the 2004 sophomore effort \"Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge\" would bridge the harder punk sounds and the smoother rock opera touches.\n\nNope. \"Three Cheers\" is a polished effort, too. And that's OK, because it's a great polished effort at that.\n\nWhen I started listening to \"Three Cheers,\" I got swept away by the variety of textures and by the operatic sweep of the sound. My first thought was, \"This band has to have been inspired by Queen.\" My second thought was, \"This is really freaking good.\"\n\nAnd it is. It is really freaking good. \"Helena,\" \"You Know What They Do to Guys Like Us in Prison,\" \"I'm Not Okay (I Promise),\" \"The Ghost of You,\" \"Thank You for the Venom,\" \"Cemetery Drive\" and \"I Never Told You What I Do for a Living\" ... all great! Yes, this is a band influenced by horror movies, by comic books, by classic rock albums and punk rock albums and by old movies ... and dang it, that's great! If you enjoy that kind of stuff, if you have similar tastes and influences, isn't it great to see (or hear) a band that combines it all so well and makes music you can relate to?\n\nAnswer: Yes, it is.\n\nCall me a sucker for liking soaring vocals and catchy guitar riffs, but there is some dimension to this music. Chiming guitars, propulsive drum fills, bass notes that bubble up, all combining into a layered sound and complexity that tickles the ears.\n\nOh, and all the videos released to promote the singles are pretty sweet too. \"I'm Not Okay\" is like a trailer to a film, \"Helena\" is a funeral (with some epic dancing), but my favorite is the retro \"The Ghost of You,\" with its World War II era vibe. Good stuff.\n\nSet aside the goth clothing, ignore the hairstyles, pay attention to the situations, the stories, the performances. Once you've jettisoned your prejudices (just as I had to do), there's something altogether human, quirky and enjoyable to this music. Allow yourself to bask in the outsider mentality a bit (it may be no stranger to you, anyway). An open mind can take you places, from the Old West to Omaha Beach.\n\nIf you like your music dramatic, My Chemical Romance and \"Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge\" may be right up your alley.\n\nWhat about Brian Wilson?\n\nMy actual favorite album for 2004 is Brian Wilson's \"Brian Wilson Presents SMiLE.\" But I've already written about that album, and I didn't want to repurpose copy for this project. I figure if you good folks are taking the time to read my words, I could at least give you fresh material.\n\nHonorable mentions, 2004\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nThe Killers' \"Hot Fuss.\"\n\nMatt Sharp's \"Matt Sharp.\"\n\nArcade Fire's \"Funeral.\"\n\nIf \"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\" doesn't come up in a conversation about Paul McCartney's best solo work, then the people in that conversation need to give it another try (and use their ears this time). Simply put, it isn't just one of McCartney's finest solo albums, it is one of his finest albums. Period.\n\nThe guy who really flowered on The Beatles' \"Revolver\" and gave us \"Eleanor Rigby,\" \"Here, There and Everywhere\" and \"For No One\" is right here. That's no hyperbole, my friends. Emotional music, introverted, personal. For folks who think Sir Paul is only good for catchy melodies and grandma music (and shame on you if you're one of them), \"Chaos and Creation\" will put you in your place.\n\nThat isn't to say the music isn't tuneful. Of course it is. But it tends to be more intimate, with Paul singing of topics in a first-person narrative that transcends the \"silly love songs\" for which he tends to be known. A more reflective, from-the-heart bend is found in these songs.\n\nWhen I bought the album, I didn't have a lot of high expectations. Obviously, I'd dearly loved \"Flaming Pie\" when it came out, and I enjoyed \"Run Devil Run\" quite a bit when it was released. But I find the bulk of 2001's \"Driving Rain\" lackluster, abysmal, tedious. The album was littered with good song ideas, but mostly the performances lacked any kind of spark or energy that would lift the songs from middle-of-the-road compositions to lively or engaging favorites.\n\n\"Chaos and Creation\" was the first release after \"Driving Rain,\" so I was curious (and more than a little worried) to hear what Paul would give us next. Would there be a new direction, or would he be settling into a \"well, this is good enough\" mindset and give us a \"Driving Rain II?\"\n\nRelief, friends. Sheer relief. From the strident piano of opening track \"Fine Line\" to the looped sounds on \"How Kind of You\" to the playful whimsy of \"English Tea\" and the aching beauty of \"Too Much Rain,\" there were many standout tracks. Many? Try all. ALL. No lie. Sure, some songs bear stylistic similarities to past glories (you'll no doubt note that \"Blackbird\" and \"Jenny Wren\" sound like the cousins they are), but there's a maturity and emotional fullness to the new pieces that lifts them from being recreations or homages. Some songs start out in one style and then deftly transition to a different style entirely, in completely unexpected ways (\"Promise to You Girl,\" for example).\n\nThe album is one reward after another, an artistic achievement followed by another artistic achievement, and all while staying accessible, melodious, friendly to the ear.\n\nAnd some credit must be given to producer Nigel Godrich, who has coaxed sounds and feelings out of Radiohead's best works as almost an auxiliary band member, using the studio to bring out textures in the music beyond those created with instruments and computers. Godrich would challenge McCartney, he'd set goals, he'd discuss the emotional qualities and anthemic possibilities, he'd slow down songs, he'd add sounds, all while keeping Paul very much Paul. In fact, most of the instrumentation on the album is played by McCartney himself (shades of \"McCartney\" and \"McCartney II\" in the mix).\n\nIn the final assessment of the album, it is one of the most well-rounded, sincere and inclusive McCartney records released, to date. You'll still get pieces of good-time Paul, and balladeer Paul, and romantic Paul ... and you SHOULD. I've said it before, and I'll say it again: I think the best music is music with sincerity, and Paul is sincerely that kind of musician. But he's also a human, a man who has had losses, has suffered setbacks, has fought for what he has, and knows that not everything is wine and roses. And nowhere is Paul more reflective (while also being colorful and stirring and inventive) than he is on \"Chaos and Creation.\"\n\nPost Beatles, post Wings, McCartney has some great albums. And with \"Tug of War,\" \"Flaming Pie\" and 2013's \"New,\" \"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\" is at the top of the heap. It is a genuine classic, and I hope it grows in stature as more and more people give it a try. It took emotional and creative courage to put this material out there, to buck some of the expectations McCartney has just for being Paul McCartney, and it is a rewarding listen time after time. If you don't feel a tug within you, a recognition of yourself in the music of \"Too Much Rain,\" well, do some living.\n\nHonorable mentions, 2005\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nThe Fiery Furnaces' \"EP.\"\n\nWeezer's \"Make Believe.\"\n\nOasis' \"Don't Believe the Truth.\"\n\nThe White Stripes' \"Get Behind Me Satan.\"\n\nNeil Diamond's \"12 Songs.\"\n\nOver the course of my time as a music columnist, one of the genuine delights I've encountered has been email conversations with folks out in the real world about music. One of the most regular and insightful has been area columnist Dennis Dalman. His love for Bob Dylan, his deep interest in Dylan trivia and his pool of anecdotes have been interesting and enjoyable over the last year.\n\nWe've talked about Dylan's evolution, his different styles and personas, and we've discussed the merits of many of the albums about which I've written. From \"Love and Theft\" to \"Blood on the Tracks\" and discussions about Dylan's speed-induced electric years, it's been fun to trade notes.\n\nOne album we haven't talked much about has been \"Modern Times,\" the 2006 album that picks up where \"Love and Theft\" left off.\n\nIf you enjoyed the bluesy tones and rockabilly charms of \"Love and Theft,\" then \"Modern Times\" will be right up your alley. You can look up the controversy about lyrical and musical influences and uncredited contributions, but Dylan has long been a man who has made use of old folk songs, old blues songs and standards in his music. To me, what matters is the performance, the personal investment in the material.\n\nAnd with \"Modern Times,\" Dylan is in fine performance form. There are some excellent later-period vocals, jauntiness on more upbeat songs and a reservedness to the ballads (of which there are a few). When an album features such fine pieces as \"Thunder on the Mountain,\" \"Rollin' and Tumblin',\" \"Someday Baby,\" \"Workingman's Blues #2,\" \"Nettie Moore\" and \"Ain't Talkin',\" it is going to be worth your while. (Truth be told, I prefer the version of \"Someday Baby\" on \"The Bootleg Series Vol. 8: Tell Tale Signs: Rare and Unreleased 1989–2006,\" but that's a conversation for another time.)\n\n\"Modern Times\" was the first Dylan album released after I'd moved to St. Cloud, and my first impression was that it is a very long record. Though only 10 songs, the album lasts more than an hour. Brevity apparently wasn't on Dylan's mind. But rather than feeling bored or distracted by the longer songs, I enjoyed that you had time to absorb and digest the songs. Like with blues and jazz albums, the journey is at least half of the experience; it isn't about the instant payoff or the standard verse-chorus-verse construction.\n\nTake \"Ain't Talkin',\" for instance. That's a journey song if ever there is one. We're with the narrator as he wanders, as he tries to do good, and we see when the narrator falters and how he is distracted into darkness. That's not the kind of song you sum up in three minutes with the chorus repeated four times.\n\nOver the years, I've grown to enjoy \"Modern Times\" as a worthy successor to \"Love and Theft.\" \"Love and Theft\" may be my favorite of the two, but in a world where you can have both, why not indulge in the greatness of the pair of albums?\n\nConsidering the streak that started with at least \"Time Out of Mind\" and led to \"Love and Theft\" and then \"Modern Times,\" it is hard to deny that Dylan was on one heck of a hot streak. If only we could all be so lucky at age 65. Here's hoping ...\n\nWhat about My Chemical Romance?\n\nMy actual favorite album for 2006 is My Chemical Romance's \"The Black Parade.\" But I've already written about that album, and I didn't want to repurpose copy for this project. I figure if you good folks are taking the time to read my words, I could at least give you fresh material.\n\nHonorable mentions, 2006\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (2006 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nYeah Yeah Yeahs' \"Show Your Bones.\"\n\nEagles of Death Metal's \"Death by Sexy.\"\n\nBruce Springsteen's \"We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions.\"\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers' \"Stadium Arcadium.\"\n\nDavid Gilmour's \"On an Island.\"\n\nThe Dixie Chicks' \"Taking the Long Way.\"\n\nThe Decemberists' \"The Crane Wife.\"\n\nThe Killers' \"Sam's Town.\"\n\nFoo Fighters' \"Skin and Bones.\"\n\nTom Waits' \"Orphans: Brawlers, Bawlers & Bastards.\"\n\nStart with a little R.E.M.

Because Britain elects a party, not a specific leader, she will be replaced by another lawmaker from her ruling Conservative Party. The process to replace Truss will take place within the next week.\n\nTruss will remain as prime minister until then.\n\n\"I came into office at a time of great economic and international instability,\" Truss said in in a brief statement outside No. 10 Downing Street in London. \"I recognize, given the situation, I cannot deliver the mandate to which I was elected by the Conservative Party.\"\n\nThe previous shortest tenure for a British leader was held by Sir Alec Douglas-Home, who served for one year and one day, from 1963 to 1964.\n\nWhy did Liz Truss resign? The move follows weeks of turmoil\n\nTruss's resignation comes after several weeks of political chaos during which she abandoned most of her economic policies.\n\nTruss fired Kwasi Kwarteng, her close ally and finance minister, on Oct. 14, even though he was implementing the pro-growth agenda she campaigned on.\n\nKwarteng was replaced by Jeremy Hunt, a former foreign minister who was beaten to the prime minister job by Boris Johnson in 2019. Hunt also failed to make a runoff in the Conservative Party process that selected Truss.\n\nWHAT TO KNOW ABOUT LIZ TRUSS: She models herself on Margaret Thatcher\n\nSince she took over, multiple polls have shown that the opposition Labor Party would likely win a landslide victory in a general election. Under British political rules, the Conservative Party must call an election before January 2025.\n\nWho could be the next prime minister?\n\nFives names have already bubbled up:\n\nRishi Sunak\n\nSunak is the front-runner, according to betting markets and news reports. Sunak, 42, lost out to Truss when she became prime minister on Sept. 6. Sunak was Johnson's finance minister. Before embarking on a career in politics, Sunak worked for Goldman Sachs and at a hedge fund. He met his wife, the daughter of the co-founder of Infosys, one of India's largest technology companies, while studying for an MBA at Stanford University. The couple have an estimated wealth of $1 billion, according to The Sunday Times Rich List, an annual gauge of the 1,000 wealthiest people and families in the U.K. Sunak served in Johnson's Cabinet as finance minister.\n\nPenny Mordaunt\n\nMordaunt, 49, leader of the House of Commons, was once regarded as the most likely lawmaker to succeed Johnson. She has been a member of Parliament since 2010 and served as trade minister. She also had a stint as minister for local government and was the first woman named armed forces minister. Mordaunt was one of the leaders behind the “Brexit” referendum approved by voters in 2016, which led to Britain's separation from the EU. She is a reservist in the Royal Navy.\n\nJeremy Hunt\n\nHunt, 55, is another longtime Cabinet minister with leadership ambitions. He appears to have already ruled himself out for prime minister, but a week has become a long time in British politics lately, so he could find a way to reassert himself in the contest. Tim Bale, politics professor at Queen Mary University of London, described Hunt as the \"Mitt Romney of British politics\" in 2019, a reference to the Utah senator known for his professionalism and lack of political charisma.\n\nBen Wallace\n\nWallace, 52, is Britain's defense secretary and has won plaudits at home and abroad for his strong support for Ukraine as it fights off a Russian invasion. Wallace supported Truss when she ran for prime minister, which could work against him.\n\nBoris Johnson\n\nJohnson, 58, left office himself only on Sept. 6, but his name has never been far from the headlines as a possible candidate for a comeback. Johnson is still well liked by Conservative Party members even though he resigned after a series of scandals connected to coronavirus lockdowns. Johnson has been silent on whether he'd take the job again. The Times (of London) is reporting Johnson is considering running in the contest.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nSir Graham Brady , leader of the 1922 committee, a group of influential Conservative Party lawmakers who determine party rules, said he expects a new prime minister to be announced by Oct. 28. Truss was selected by ordinary Conservative Party grassroots members, about 81,000 of them. Brady announced late Thursday that to enter the race to be the next party leader and thus prime minister, candidates need to secure the backing of 100 lawmakers by Monday.\n\nleader of the 1922 committee, a group of influential Conservative Party lawmakers who determine party rules, said he expects a new prime minister to be announced by Oct. 28. Truss was selected by ordinary Conservative Party grassroots members, about 81,000 of them. Brady announced late Thursday that to enter the race to be the next party leader and thus prime minister, candidates need to secure the backing of 100 lawmakers by Monday. Because there are 357 Conservative parliamentarians, this means a maximum of three lawmakers will be on the short list. If three make the list, lawmakers will vote on those, and the candidate with the least support will be eliminated. If a second vote is needed, lawmakers will then be able to signal whom they prefer in what is called an \"indicative vote.\" If both candidates choose to stay in the contest after this second round, then the final decision will be made again by the 81,000 grassroots members of the party who elected Truss.\n\nOpposition Labor Party leader Sir Keir Starmer has called for an immediate general election, a scenario that seems unlikely give that the ruling Conservative Party, according to polls, would almost certainly lose any such vote.\n\nWhat are they saying?", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/21/uk/liz-truss-resignation-allowance-intl-gbr/index.html", "title": "Prime minister's allowance: Truss is entitled to $129,000 a year as ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nLiz Truss quit her post as Britain’s prime minister just 45 days into the job, but she will be able to claim expenses of up to £115,000 ($129,000) a year for the rest of her life.\n\nTruss, who presided over failed fiscal plans and a deeply polarized ruling party during her disastrous six-week term in office, is set to become the shortest-serving prime minister in British history after announcing her resignation on Thursday.\n\nHer speech triggered a leadership race that will see the appointment of the UK’s fifth Conservative prime minister in just over six years.\n\nTruss is eligible for an annual allowance to cover the cost of public duties after leaving office. Carl Court/Getty Images\n\nDespite the shortness of her tenure, she is entitled to receive payments under the Public Duty Costs Allowance (PDCA), a government-regulated program introduced in 1990 to “assist former Prime Ministers still active in public life.”\n\nThe allowance reimburses former prime ministers for office and secretarial costs arising from their public duties.\n\n“Payments are made only to meet the actual cost of continuing to fulfil public duties,” according to the UK government website.\n\n“All former Prime Ministers are eligible to draw on the PDCA.”\n\nThe PDCA has been capped at £115,000 a year since 2011 and is reviewed annually by the sitting prime minister.\n\nFormer leaders are also entitled to claim an allowance toward their staff pension costs, which is limited to 10% of the PDCA.\n\nFrom 2020 to 2021, former prime ministers Theresa May, David Cameron, Gordon Brown, Tony Blair and John Major were all reimbursed by varying amounts, according to the Cabinet Office’s Annual Report and Accounts 2020-21.\n\nHowever, opposition politicians and trade unions are urging Truss to decline the publicly funded annual allowance, as Britons grapple with a cost-of-living crisis resulting from soaring energy prices and inflation at a 40-year high.\n\n‘She should turn it down’\n\nWhen asked about Truss’ entitlement to the allowance, Keir Starmer, leader of the opposition Labour Party, said “she should turn it down.”\n\n“She’s done 44 days in office,” he told ITV’s “Good Morning Britain” on Friday.\n\n“She’s not really entitled to it, she should turn it down and not take it.”\n\nOn Twitter, one user wrote: “While people are struggling to pay the bills and keep the lights on, Liz Truss will receive a cushy £115,000 yearly allowance – for the rest of her life, and funded by the taxpayer – for 6 weeks of disaster as PM.”\n\nDowning Street has not yet responded to CNN’s request for comment on whether Truss will accept the allowance.", "authors": ["Sana Noor Haq"], "publish_date": "2022/10/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/20/uk/liz-truss-government-crisis-thursday-gbr-intl/index.html", "title": "Liz Truss resigns as Britain's Prime Minister after disastrous six ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nLiz Truss will become the shortest-serving prime minister in British history, after announcing her intention to resign just six weeks into a disastrous term that pitched Britain deep into political and economic turmoil.\n\nTruss said Thursday that she would step aside for a new leader to be chosen within the next week, after a growing number of her own Conservative Party’s lawmakers said they could not support her any longer.\n\n“Given the situation, I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party. I have therefore spoken to His Majesty The King to notify him that I am resigning as Leader of the Conservative Party,” Truss said while standing outside the famous black door of 10 Downing Street, the same spot in which she had promised to put the UK back onto the path to economic growth and stability just six weeks earlier.\n\nThe announcement brings to an ignominious end a catastrophic tenure in Downing Street, which appeared doomed ever since the announcement of Truss’s flagship economic agenda sent markets into panic. A record rise in UK government bond prices sent borrowing costs surging and forced the Bank of England to make three successive interventions to rescue overstretched pension funds. The pound at one point hit an all-time low against the US dollar.\n\nTruss said she would stay in Downing Street until her successor is named.\n\nGraham Brady, who chairs the 1922 Committee which represents rank-and-file Conservative Members of Parliament, said Thursday that the new party leader – and therefore prime minister – should be in place before the end of October.\n\nCandidates to replace Truss will need at least 100 nominations from British Conservative lawmakers, Brady said later on Thursday, a move that effectively narrows the field of potential candidates.\n\nThe threshold allows for the possibility of three candidates, maximum, he said. There would be an online vote for Conservative Party members if two candidates make it through the parliamentary stages, party chairman Jake Berry added.\n\nIf only one candidate emerges, there could be a new party leader and Prime Minister by Monday, Brady said.\n\nTruss had tried to save her position by admitting her plan was a mistake and replacing her chancellor and long-time ally Kwasi Kwarteng with Jeremy Hunt, a staunch supporter of former Chancellor Rishi Sunak in the leadership contest over the summer.\n\nIn the end, even that was not enough.\n\nOn Wednesday, Truss lost another top official when Home Secretary Suella Braverman dramatically quit just a few weeks into the job, using her letter of resignation to launch a blistering attack on the prime minister’s leadership.\n\n“The business of government relies upon people accepting responsibility for their mistakes. Pretending we haven’t made mistakes, carrying on as if everyone can’t see that we have made them, and hoping that things will magically come right is not serious politics,” Braverman wrote in a critique of Truss’s numerous U-turns on taxes and public spending.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Liz Truss announces her resignation outside Number 10 Downing Street on October 20, 2022. Henry Nicholls/Reuters\n\nMaking a bad day even worse, chaotic scenes unfolded in the UK Parliament on Wednesday evening during a vote on whether to ban controversial fracking for shale gas.\n\nLawmakers reported that aides for Truss had manhandled MPs into the voting lobby to force them to vote against the ban proposed by the opposition Labour Party. Politicians in the lobby tweeted eyewitness accounts alleging that MPs were being physically dragged to vote in the government lobby, amid angry scenes of shouting and altercation.\n\nHouse of Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle announced Thursday that he had ordered an investigation into the allegations.\n\nShortest tenure ever\n\nThe names of potential successors began floating around even before Truss announced she was going to resign.\n\nLeader of the House of Commons Penny Mordaunt, who stepped in for Truss during a difficult parliamentary debate earlier this week and also stood in the leadership contest over the summer, will likely be in the running. Sunak, who was Truss’ biggest rival in that contest, is another possible candidate.\n\nMeanwhile, allies of Boris Johnson, Truss’s predecessor in Number 10, made it clear on Thursday that they think the former prime minister will stand in the leadership contest, according to two sources who worked on Johnson’s 2019 leadership campaign.\n\nNewly appointed Home Secretary Grant Shapps and Kemi Badenoch, who came fourth in the last leadership contest, could also stand.\n\nTruss announced her decision to leave on day 45 of her tenure. George Canning previously held the record for the shortest term in Downing Street, having served for 119 days until his death in 1827.\n\nHer move ensures a fresh power struggle within the ruling Conservative Party, which has hemorrhaged public support for the past year and has now overthrown Boris Johnson and Truss in the space of a few months. The new prime minister will be the third since the last general election in December 2019 and the fifth since the Conservatives came into power in 2010.\n\nEarlier this year, Truss’s predecessor Johnson narrowly survived a confidence vote in his leadership. But he resigned weeks later when dozens of ministers and members of the government quit, citing a lack of confidence in his government.\n\nTruss was elected the Conservative Party leader in early September. The September 6 audience during which Queen Elizabeth II officially appointed Truss as the new prime minister, the 15th of her reign, was one of the last duties carried out by the monarch before her death on September 8.\n\nThe new prime minister, whoever that may be, will become the first to be appointed by King Charles III.\n\nKeir Starmer, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, which is enjoying a huge lead in opinion polls, on Thursday repeated his calls for an early general election.\n\n“After 12 years of Tory failure, the British people deserve so much better than this revolving door of chaos,” the opposition leader said in a statement posted on Twitter.\n\n“The Tories cannot respond to their latest shambles by yet again simply clicking their fingers and shuffling the people at the top without the consent of the British people,” he added.\n\nScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also called for an early vote.\n\n“The interests of the Tory party should concern no-one right now. A General Election is now a democratic imperative,” Sturgeon said on Twitter.\n\nThe next general election is due to take place no later than January 2025, but the prospect of Britain seeing its third prime minister since the last poll in 2019 would heap pressure on Truss’ successor to ask the public for a new mandate.\n\nThe British pound was trading 0.5% higher against the dollar after Truss announced her resignation, indicating that investors welcomed the decision.", "authors": ["Ivana Kottasová Rob Picheta", "Ivana Kottasová", "Rob Picheta"], "publish_date": "2022/10/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2022/10/20/liz-truss-resignation-things-lasted-longer-prime-minister/10551356002/", "title": "Liz Truss resigns as British Prime Minister.

The Conservative Party leader, 47, lasted 45 days in office.\n\nTruss, now officially the shortest-serving prime minister in the history of the British government, announced her resignation after running a campaign on ill-advised tax cuts that she didn't have the funding to provide, and which financial markets immediately picked up on. Her ratings plummeted as she fired the finance minister she hired to do her bidding against warnings from colleagues and replaced him with a new minister who backtracked on everything she has promised to do with cuts.\n\nIt's a lesson for politicians everywhere that you can't just run entirely on a platform you will absolutely never be able to deliver on and, in fact, if you try to deliver you could upend your country's economy and walk away a quitter just a few weeks into the job.\n\nSix weeks is a record-short amount of time to be British prime minister. So, inspired by a YouTube live feed of a head of lettuce that outlived Truss' reign, I put together a list of things that lasted longer than on-the-out Truss' leadership of the Tories.\n\nThings that lasted longer than Truss did in office:\n\n►The intro to this list.\n\n►According to the Mayo Clinic, chronic hives, or urticaria, last longer than six weeks.

Otherwise, an online ballot of party members will close on Friday October 28.\n\nThe winner of the contest will be the fifth Conservative prime minister in just over six years – and the third within this parliamentary term. But who might the next leader be? Here are some of the main runners and riders:\n\nRishi Sunak\n\nThough he has yet to formally declare his candidacy, Sunak has already reached the 100-nomination threshold, Britain’s PA Media news agency reported on Friday.\n\nThe former Chancellor of the Exchequer (finance minister) has proved to be something of a prophet of the government’s demise, as many of the predictions he made during this summer’s leadership about Truss’s economic plan came to pass.\n\nConservative leadership candidate Rishi Sunak Peter Nicholls/Reuters\n\nSunak warned that Truss’s unfunded tax cuts would lead to a run on sterling, a panic in the bond market and concern from the International Monetary Fund. Perhaps even he would have been surprised by the pace with which he was proved right.\n\nSunak has experience of economic crisis-fighting, having guided the UK through the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nHe also secured the most votes from MPs in the last leadership election – comfortably clearing the new threshold with 137 endorsements. Although Truss eventually won the decisive members’ vote, Sunak only lost narrowly – with 43% of the vote.\n\nThe trust he has among MPs – and the vindication his predictions have gained – may make him the most likely next set of hands to steer the ship.\n\nPenny Mordaunt\n\nThe Leader of the House of Commons may have had a dress rehearsal for being prime minister this week, after stepping in for an absent Liz Truss at a debate.\n\n“The prime minister is not under a desk,” Mordaunt confirmed Tuesday – in a performance that seemed as much about pitching herself as it did about helping the PM.\n\nMordaunt confirmed in a tweet Friday afternoon that she was running to replace Truss – the first MP to do so.\n\nShe promised a “fresh start” for the country, aiming “to unite our country, deliver our pledges and win the next general election.”\n\nPenny Mordaunt HENRY NICHOLLS/REUTERS\n\nMordaunt came third in the last leadership election, narrowly missing out on being put before the members. With 105 votes from MPs in the last election, she too is expected to clear the newt threshold. She is expected to perform well among the party membership, in part due to her military credentials. Mordaunt is a reservist of the Royal Navy and served a short spell as Secretary of State for Defense.\n\nLike Sunak, she is from the more moderate wing of the party. There was even talk among MPs of the two forming a “dream team” ticket, although this is yet to materialize – and it is unclear if either would accept being chancellor over taking the top job.\n\nKemi Badenoch\n\nBadenoch came fourth in this summer’s leadership election – securing only 59 votes from MPs – but was consistently rated by pollsters as a favorite among Conservative grassroots members.\n\nOne of the younger MPs in the running, Badenoch quickly won the endorsement of long-serving Tory grandee Michael Gove, who praised her as the “outstanding talent” in the party.\n\nBadenoch is from the right of the Tory party – and in her previous leadership bid suggested that the government’s climate targets might prove too costly.\n\nWith Truss’s votes from MPs now up for grabs, Badenoch may have an outside chance of clearing the threshold and making it to the members’ vote.\n\nBoris Johnson\n\nBoris Johnson is flying back to the UK from his Caribbean holiday and plans to join the race to replace Truss, Britain’s PA Media news agency reported Friday.\n\nUK Trade Minister Sir James Duddridge, a close Johnson ally, told PA Media that he had been in contact with Johnson via Whatsapp, saying that Johnson had sent him: “‘I’m flying back, Dudders. We are going to do this. I’m up for it’.”\n\nThe minister also said via Twitter “I hope you enjoyed your holiday boss. Time to come back. Few issues at the office that need addressing. #bringbackboris.”\n\nSky News said one of its reporters, who boarded the flight Johnson took, snapped a picture of the former prime minister and his wife Carrie Johnson on board, adding that the couple received several boos from fellow passengers.\n\nMultiple allies have made the case that Johnson could be a unity candidate who could bring stability to the country, despite the fact he resigned in disgrace only a few months ago after a series of scandals came together, making his position untenable.\n\nWhen asked by CNN how they could justify Johnson standing to be PM again, one MP who campaigned for Johnson in the 2019 leadership campaign, said: “Socialists will destroy our economy and if you don’t understand that then I genuinely fear for our future.”\n\nAnother MP who supported Johnson in 2019 said he was the only candidate who could comfortably win over both Conservative MPs and members of the Conservative Party.\n\nJohnson’s closest allies said they were aware he was being actively lobbied in the hours after Truss’ resignation speech, making the case to him that he represented the party’s best shot at stability in the medium term.\n\nIn his final speech as prime minister outside 10 Downing Street, Johnson made one of his characteristic allusions to ancient history. He said he would “return to his plough” like the Roman statesman Cincinnatus – suggesting a quieter life on the backbenches. But that’s not how Cincinnatus saw out his days. He was called back from his plough to return to Rome for a second term – this time as a dictator.\n\nSome suspect that the new 100-vote threshold is an attempt by the Conservative Party to render another Johnson term impossible. But Johnson’s campaign has already started to gather momentum. A number of prominent Conservative MPs announced Friday that they will back him – even though Johnson has yet to confirm he will stand.\n\nAs Conservative MPs are currently facing electoral oblivion, their desire for self-preservation should not be underestimated. Less than three years ago Johnson delivered an 80-seat majority, and the right of the Tory party may think he is the only candidate capable of saving their jobs.\n\nIf Johnson was to secure the required 100 votes from MPs, he would be expected to perform extremely well in a vote by the party membership.\n\nGrant Shapps\n\nIt is a sign of the disorder of the last days of Truss’s government that she elevated Grant Shapps to home secretary – despite not offering him a ministerial role of any sort when she first took office.\n\nGrant Shapps Phil Noble/Reuters\n\nShapps served as transport secretary under Boris Johnson. He put himself forward to succeed him in the previous leadership election – only to withdraw from the race three days later, after failing to secure the requisite 20 MPs’ votes to proceed to the next round.\n\nThe new threshold will likely prove too high for Shapps – but his criticism of Truss’ government from the outset may have won him the support of more MPs than last time.\n\nOther names in the hat\n\nSuella Braverman’s resignation as home secretary on Wednesday night may have been a precursor to a possible leadership bid. The former attorney-general has not run before – but with her hard-line stance on immigration, might look set to drag the party further to the right.\n\nTom Tugendhat emerged as a surprise favorite among Tory members and the wider public, despite only coming fifth in the last leadership election. Having not served as a cabinet member before that contest, Tugendhat distanced himself from the moral mess of Johnson’s government and promised a “clean start” for Britain. After serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, Tugendhat was made security minister by Truss.\n\nBen Wallace, defense secretary and another ex-military man, was tipped to succeed Johnson in the last leadership contest – polling extremely well among Conservative members. However, he never ran in that election, and he has now ruled himself out of this race.\n\nFormer prime minister Theresa May has also been floated as a possible “unity” candidate to succeed Truss. May tried to bring together the warring wings of the Conservative party over Brexit, in move that ultimately saw her replaced by Boris Johnson. As the party has proven unable to resolve its disputes this time round, another attempt at compromise may soon be in order.", "authors": ["Christian Edwards"], "publish_date": "2022/10/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2022/10/20/british-prime-minister-liz-truss-lettuce/10550743002/", "title": "Lettuce outlasts British Prime Minister Liz Truss in Daily Star stream", "text": "A head of lettuce has outlasted British Prime Minister Liz Truss, who on Thursday became the shortest-serving leader in the U.K.’s history when she resigned.\n\nOn Oct. 14, U.K. tabloid newspaper the Daily Star began a YouTube livestream displaying a head of lettuce on one side and a portrait of Truss on the other.

View more opinion on CNN.\n\nLondon CNN —\n\nHolding office for only 45 days, Liz Truss has become the shortest-lived prime minister in British history after announcing her departure from Number 10.\n\nRosa Prince Rosa Prince\n\nAnd what a six weeks it was, marked by the death of a monarch and installation of a new king, a fiscal plan that crashed the markets and caused a run on the pound, the abandonment of her entire policy program, sacking of a chancellor and home secretary, loss of confidence of virtually all her MPs, reports of violent bullying in Parliament and opinion polls suggesting an existential wipe-out for her party at the next election.\n\nTruss never had an easy task to unite her troubled party after winning the contest to replace Boris Johnson as prime minister. For the first time in Conservative history, she had not won the support of her own parliamentary party, but was voted leader, thanks to the Tories’ complicated voting system, largely due to the backing of rank-and-file party members.\n\nRather than build bridges by seeking to unite the party and bring rival factions into her government, she created further resentments, triggering immediate plotting. Installing allies into key Cabinet posts left her open to the charge that her team was both inexperienced and maverick.\n\nThis proved explosive when she and her close friend Kwasi Kwarteng, who she appointed Chancellor, drew up plans to put their academic economic theories into practice; the resulting “Trussonomics” plan in mid-September, which proposed tax cuts for the most wealthy to be paid for with borrowing, spooked the financial markets, leading the Bank of England to take emergency measures to shore up the pensions sector.\n\nTruss’s response was ruthless; she dispensed with her comrade-in-arms Kwarteng and, in a desperate bid to soothe the markets, appointed the moderate Jeremy Hunt to lead the Treasury.\n\nIt wasn’t enough. As her detractors continued to seek ways to bring her down, events began to spiral out of Truss’s control.\n\nGetting rid of a prime minister is not a simple task; under Conservative rules, she should have been protected from a leadership challenge for a year.\n\nA dramatic 24 hours in Westminster\n\nBut on Wednesday, the Home Secretary, former rival Suella Braverman, quit, ostensibly over a minor breach of the ministerial rules, but with a barbed resignation letter which suggested she had ambitions to replace her.\n\nThat evening, Downing Street unwisely turned a vote on the controversial issue of fracking into a show of confidence in the prime minister; amid chaos in the Commons’ voting lobbies, and allegations of manhandling of reluctant MPs, the Chief Whip Wendy Morton was said to have resigned in exasperation, only for No 10 to message journalists in the early hours of the morning to announce she had stayed after all.\n\nBy now, the game was up. MP after MP called for Truss to quit both in public and private.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Liz Truss announces her resignation, outside Number 10 Downing Street, on October 20. Henry Nicholls/Reuters\n\nOn Thursday morning, Sir Graham Brady, who as chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench MPs acts as high executioner for moribund Conservative leaders, came to pay a house call on Truss at Number 10.\n\nAn hour later, she was gone, saying she could not “deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party.”\n\nShe went on: “I have therefore spoken to His Majesty the King to notify him that I am resigning as leader of the Conservative Party.\n\nWhat happens next\n\nThere remains the complication that, unless the rules are changed, the contest to select a new Tory leader and prime minister will again involve those party members who elected the unpopular Truss in the first place.\n\nTo avoid that, the parliamentary party needed to agree on a unity candidate – most likely the man who had been the MPs’ first choice to replace Johnson, former chancellor Rishi Sunak.\n\nIt seems that proved impossible; Sir Graham has instead won the agreement of party chiefs to truncate the timetable for the leadership contest and so avoid a repeat of last summer’s nine-week affair.

Johnson resigned in July after senior members of his government turned against him amid a series of scandals connected to breaking his own coronavirus lockdown rules and waning appetite for his brand of populist politics.\n\nMeet Britain's new prime minister:Liz Truss, a Thatcher-lite, is Britain's new PM\n\nBecause Britain elects a party, not a specific leader, the party in power has some scope to swap in a new prime minister. Truss was selected by about 172,000 grassroots members of the Conservative Party. That figure represents less than 1% of the U.K.'s 67 million population.\n\nThe new prime minister takes office Tuesday and assumes power as household energy bills in the U.K. soar to unaffordable levels for millions of people.\n\nIn a brief speech, Truss thanked Johnson.\n\n\"Boris, you got Brexit done. You crushed Jeremy Corbyn, you rolled out the vaccine. And you stood up to Vladimir Putin. You were admired from Kyiv to Carlisle.\"\n\nTruss won 81,326 votes to Sunak's 60,399, or 57% to 43%.\n\nTruss, 47, has sought to portray herself as the political heir to Margaret Thatcher, Britain's \"Iron Lady\" and first female leader who advocated with zeal for free markets, lower taxes and the privatization of large state enterprises from telecoms to energy. Truss served in Johnson's government, first as a trade minister and then as foreign secretary. She has taken a hardline stance on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\"The thread that runs through Truss’s career is a belief in small government,\" Daniel Hannan, a former Conservative party politician, wrote in an opinion piece published on his website. Hannan is now known as Lord Hannan of Kingsclere in the House of Lords, the unelected upper House of Parliament to which he was appointed by Johnson.\n\nFrom Parliament to mayor to PM:A timeline of Boris Johnson's political career\n\nSunak, 42, served in Johnson's government as finance minister, where he oversaw a multi-billion dollar coronavirus support package for businesses and workers. His campaign struggled to shake off the perception, anathema to Conservative political ideology, that he presided over a big state intervention during the coronavirus pandemic. It was aimed at warding off mass unemployment and an economic depression.\n\nPolitical experts say Britain's new leader is unlikely to usher in major changes to the U.K.'s foreign policy that would upend its close relationship with the White House. But one possible flashpoint that Truss inherits from Johnson is what to do with the border between Northern Ireland, part of the U.K., and Ireland, part of the European Union, as a result of the U.K.'s departure from the European Union, known as Brexit.\n\nThis previously open border is now subject to checks on some goods and services and Conservatives want to change the customs and immigrations rules at the risk, say U.S. and European officials, of damaging the fragile peace that's existed in Northern Ireland since the U.S.-brokered Good Friday Agreement took effect in1998.\n\n\"Truss is a full-throated Atlanticist, as is Sunak, who thinks that the U.K. is the keystone NATO partner,\" said Matt Beech, director of the Center for British Politics, University of Hull, England, referring to close U.S.-U.K. security cooperation.\n\nThe first order of business for Truss will be to reassure the British public that she has a plan to deal with rapidly increasing energy costs and an inflationary spiral caused by the lingering coronavirus pandemic, Russia's unprovoked war in Ukraine and Britain's almost two-year-old exit from the EU bloc. All three events have disrupted supply chains and led to higher consumer costs.\n\nThe U.K. uses little oil and gas supplied by Russia, but by next month the typical British household is expected to pay around $4,200 a year to heat and power a home, according to Ofgem, Britain's energy regulator. That's an 80% annual rise and reflects the way the British government has engineered its energy market to be reliant on wholesale prices, which have skyrocketed amid the war in Ukraine.\n\nForecasts suggest U.K. energy bills could reach more than $7,700 early next year, more than many U.K. residents pay for rent or a mortgage and threatening to trigger so-called fuel poverty for millions and force many small businesses to close.\n\n\"Unless the government steps in there will be a social catastrophe,\" independent personal finance expert Martin Lewis told a BBC radio program recently.\n\n\"How (Truss) reacts to the energy crisis will not only have a direct impact on the lives of U.K. citizens and the survival of many businesses, but also affect perception of the competence of the administration,\" said Antony Froggatt, an environmental policy expert at Chatham House, a London-based think tank.\n\n\"It is a baptism by fire.\"\n\nAs part of the hand over of power, Queen Elizabeth will receive Johnson and Truss at Balmoral, her estate in Scotland, on Tuesday, Buckingham Palace said.\n\nIt is a break from tradition. Normally the queen would host the departing and new British leaders at her London residence, which she has done 15 times before during her 70-year reign.

Without offering details, Truss promised a “bold plan” to cut taxes and build economic growth, and “deliver on the energy crisis, dealing with people’s energy bills but also dealing with the long-term issues we have on energy supply.”\n\nMonday’s announcement ends weeks of bitter campaigning during which Sunak, the former Chancellor of the Exchequer (finance minister), accused the Foreign Secretary of risking a prolonged recession if she goes ahead with her promised tax cuts.\n\nOnce Johnson formally resigns his post to the Queen on Tuesday, Truss will also visit the monarch at her Scottish residence Balmoral, where, as leader of the largest party in parliament, she will be invited to form a government.\n\nTruss had been the frontrunner for weeks, and the 47-year-old will now follow Margaret Thatcher and Theresa May to become Britain’s third female premier. Despite voting to remain in the European Union back in 2016, she has found herself to be the preferred candidate of the vast majority of Brexiteers in her party.\n\nHer victory was smaller than expected, Conservatives who supported both candidates are privately admitting. It had been predicted by many that her margin of victory would be larger than the 18 percentage points announced on Monday afternoon.\n\nIn terms of her premiership, this could mean that she cannot run roughshod over her MPs, who voted in greater numbers for Sunak than Truss in the parliamentary part of this leadership contest.\n\nAnd Truss could find that she has to accommodate a wider range of views from her party, which could mean embracing Sunak’s ideas for helping Britons with the cost-of-living crisis and a less aggressive approach to tax cuts – especially corporation tax.\n\nMany Conservative MPs are privately worried that Truss’s modern-day Thatcherism could cost them the next election and will be leaping on the surprisingly low margin of victory to encourage the next PM to soften her economic stance.\n\nThe opposition Labour Party immediately dismissed her arguments, saying in a statement, “after years serving in Tory cabinets, nodding through the decisions that got us into this mess, Liz Truss simply doesn’t have the answers to this crisis.”\n\nLong political journey\n\nIn the leadership campaign, Truss’s platform had featured plenty of red meat for the Conservative membership, from a hard line against the EU on Brexit to tax cuts as her main solution to the cost-of-living crisis. This tactic clearly proved decisive in winning over ordinary members, who had the final say in electing the leader of the ruling party, who consequently becomes prime minister.\n\nBut critics have accused her new-found hardline Brexit stance of being a cynical ploy. They have pointed to the fact that throughout her adult life Truss has evolved, from being an anti-monarchist Liberal Democrat in favor of legalizing drugs in her youth to the embodiment of the Conservative right today.\n\nThroughout her political career, especially during the leadership contest, Truss has been compared to Thatcher, who, for many on the right, remains the benchmark for Conservative leaders. She was a tax-cutting, hard-nosed leader who took on the unions and played a large role in ending the Cold War. Like Thatcher, Truss has come from relatively humble beginnings to dominate a world inhabited largely by men.\n\nSince becoming an MP, Truss has gone from being the darling of the liberal Conservative leader David Cameron, who took a personal interest in her career, to the Euroskeptic right’s figurehead.\n\nBefore the Brexit referendum, Truss said that she was “backing remain as I believe it is in Britain’s economic interest and means we can focus on vital economic and social reform at home.”\n\nCabinet colleagues at the time say that she never voiced any issue about supporting staying in the EU, despite having ample opportunities to express her own Euroskepticism.\n\nThese days, Truss is more than happy to pick fights with Brussels and to claim that it was the EU all along that held the British economy back.\n\nA country in turmoil\n\nTruss will take over a Conservative government that is facing multiple crises in the country. With steep rises in energy and food prices, long waiting lists for hospital treatment, and public sector workers, dock workers and even lawyers going on strike, making the case that the party deserves to win a historic fifth term at the next general election – due to be called by December 2024 at the latest – will be an uphill battle.\n\nInflation rose above 10% in July for the first time in 40 years, driven largely by the rising cost of energy, food and fuel. According to a forecast by the Bank of England, inflation will soar to 13% by the end of the year. The central bank also predicted that the UK would enter into recession before the end of the year. And on Monday, in a signal of these serious challenges ahead, the British pound dropped 0.3% to its lowest level against the US dollar since 1985.\n\nAnalysts are skeptical that Truss’s tax-cutting policies will do much help citizens, especially after a decade of austerity policies. The Institute for Fiscal studies, an independent research group focusing on public finances, said last month that the leadership contestants, who were both promising tax cuts and smaller government spending, “need to recognise this even greater-than-usual uncertainty in the public finances.”\n\nThe specter of Johnson\n\nLooming over Truss’s new government will be the long shadow of Johnson, whose time in office saw approval ratings and voter intentions plummet for the Conservative Party. He leaves office a deeply unpopular prime minister less than three years after romping home to an enormous landslide election victory in 2019.\n\nJohnson was forced to resign from office on July 7 after a string of scandals made his position untenable. His downfall followed months of revelations over parties held in 10 Downing Street while the country was under Covid lockdown restrictions. Johnson himself was fined by the police, making him the first prime minister in history found to have broken the law in office.\n\nHowever, Johnson rode out the “Partygate” scandal. It was only when Chris Pincher, his deputy chief whip responsible for party discipline, was accused of sexually assaulting two men at a party, and Johnson delayed in acting over the matter, that his own party finally turned on him.\n\nIt is not yet known whether Johnson will remain in politics. He may still be forced to resign as a Member of Parliament after a House of Commons committee gives its verdict on whether or not Johnson knowingly misled Parliament when he claimed no rules were broken in Downing Street.\n\nRegardless, Johnson is likely to remain a high-profile figure. There is a good chance he will return to his former media career as a columnist and broadcaster, though the damage to his reputation in office might mean his appeal is limited compared to where it stood before he entered Downing Street.\n\nThroughout the campaign, Truss has been seen by most as the Johnson continuity candidate and enjoyed the backing of many of his loyalists.\n\nWhile this support has helped Truss during the leadership contest with Conservative members who saw her rival Sunak as a traitor, and who value tribal loyalty, it means she will be forever tied to the Johnson legacy.\n\nThat could ultimately become a weight around her neck, as the specter of Johnson risks overshadowing anything Truss might do to tackle the misery that many Britons are set to face this winter.", "authors": ["Luke Mcgee Peter Wilkinson", "Luke Mcgee", "Peter Wilkinson"], "publish_date": "2022/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2022/09/05/liz-truss-uk-leader-margaret-thatcher-devotee/7957970001/", "title": "What to know about Liz Truss, the outgoing UK prime minister", "text": "Liz Truss is Britain's third prime minister in three years\n\nTruss won 57% of votes from 172,000 Conservative Party activists - less than 1% of UK population\n\nTruss replaces Boris Johnson, who leaves office Tuesday\n\nLONDON – Liz Truss always portrayed herself as the next Margaret Thatcher.\n\nBut that effort fell far short when Truss, 47, resigned Thursday, becoming the shortest-serving leader in British political history after less than two months into the job.\n\nTruss, 47, aimed to be the political heir to Thatcher, Britain's formidable cheerleader for free markets and low taxes, a strong supporter of the Anglo-American alliance and a dynamo who played a key role in ending the Cold War.

PepsiCo is also pulling some products from the country.\n\nThe decisions followed pressure from critics and similar moves by other Western companies. On Twitter, people used boycott hashtags to target companies like McDonald’s and PepsiCo that until Tuesday were quiet about their plans for Russia.\n\nMcDonald’s, PepsiCo and other companies were called out by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli.\n\nBefore McDonald’s and PepsiCo made their announcements, DiNapoli emailed a number of companies represented in the New York State Common Retirement Fund, including those two companies, urging them to stop doing business with Russia.\n\n“Companies like McDonald’s and PepsiCo, which have a large footprint in Russia, need to consider whether doing business in Russia is worth the risk during this extraordinarily volatile time,” DiNaPoli said in a statement.\n\nOn Tuesday, McDonald’s spoke out, and other major food sellers followed.\n\nMcDonald’s\n\nMcDonald's said Tuesday that it is closing its Russian locations. Pelagiya Tihonova/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\n“McDonald’s has decided to temporarily close all our restaurants in Russia and pause all operations in the market,” CEO Chris Kempczinski said in a statement on that day.\n\nThere were 847 locations of McDonald’s in Russia at the close of last year, according to an investor document.\n\nGlobally, most McDonald’s (MCD) locations are operated by franchise operators. But that’s not the case in Russia, where 84% of locations are operated by the company, according to the document. Russia’s restaurants, along with another 108 in Ukraine, all operated by McDonald’s (MCD), accounted for 9% of the company’s revenue in 2021, according to the document.\n\n“In Russia, we employ 62,000 people who have poured their heart and soul into our McDonald’s brand to serve their communities. We work with hundreds of local, Russian suppliers and partners who produce the food for our menu and support our brand,” Kempczinski said. “And we serve millions of Russian customers each day who count on McDonald’s. In the thirty-plus years that McDonald’s has operated in Russia, we’ve become an essential part of the 850 communities in which we operate.”\n\nBut, he added, “at the same time, our values mean we cannot ignore the needless human suffering unfolding in Ukraine.”\n\nStarbucks\n\nIn a Tuesday message to employees, Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson said that “today, we have decided to suspend all business activity in Russia.”\n\nHe added that “our licensed partner has agreed to immediately pause store operations and will provide support to the nearly 2,000 [employees] in Russia who depend on Starbucks for their livelihood.”\n\nJohnson added that Starbucks is halting shipment of all Starbucks products to Russia. “We condemn the horrific attacks on Ukraine by Russia and our hearts go out to all those affected,” he said.\n\nCoke\n\nCoca-Cola also said Tuesday that it is “suspending its business in Russia.”\n\nThe company stated that “our hearts are with the people who are enduring unconscionable effects from these tragic events in Ukraine,” adding that it will monitor the situation as things change.\n\nPepsiCo, Danone and Unilever\n\nOn Tuesday, PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta laid out how PepsiCo is approaching the situation.\n\n“Given the horrific events occurring in Ukraine we are announcing the suspension of the sale of Pepsi-Cola, and our global beverage brands in Russia, including 7Up and Mirinda.” Laguarta added that Pepsi is suspending capital investments, ads and promotional activity in Russia.\n\nBut PepsiCo will continue to sell some of its products, including baby formula, baby food, milk and other dairy options.\n\n“We have a responsibility to continue to offer our other products in Russia, including daily essentials,” Laguarta said. “By continuing to operate, we will also continue to support the livelihoods of our 20,000 Russian associates and the 40,000 Russian agricultural workers in our supply chain as they face significant challenges and uncertainty ahead,” he added.\n\nFarryl Bertmann, a registered dietitian and senior lecturer in the nutrition and food sciences department at the University of Vermont, warned that if big food companies leave Russia entirely the citizen population could suffer, even if they have other sources of food.\n\n“I feel very strongly that people should be given the opportunity to purchase a variety of foods at different price points,” she said. “That can only be successfully done if access is there.”\n\nShe said that “ultimately, foods need to be made available,” adding, “I would be very concerned if the food environment [were] to dramatically change.”\n\nOther companies have taken a similar approach to Pepsi.\n\nDanone (DANOY), which makes Silk milk alternatives, Activia, Oikos yogurt, baby formula and more, said in a LinkedIn post on Sunday that “we have decided to suspend all investment projects in Russia,” adding that it would “maintain our production and distribution of fresh dairy products and infant nutrition, to still meet the essential food needs of the local population.”\n\nUnilever (UL) made a similar statement this week, saying that “we will continue to supply our everyday essential food and hygiene products made in Russia to people in the country,” adding “we will keep this under close review.”\n\nThe company noted it is has suspended imports of its products to Russia and is stopping all investment in the country, in addition to stopping exports from there. It said it won’t profit from its presence in Russia.\n\nSome restaurant chains have to work with franchisees to make big decisions, like closing operations.\n\nYum and its franchise operators\n\nYum Brands (YUM), which owns KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and the Habit Grill, said in a statement that it is “suspending operations of KFC company-owned restaurants in Russia and finalizing an agreement to suspend all Pizza Hut restaurant operations in Russia, in partnership with its master franchisee.”\n\nThe company added that “this action builds on our decision to suspend all investment and restaurant development in Russia and redirect all profits from operations in Russia to humanitarian efforts.”\n\nYum has about 1,000 KFC restaurants and 50 Pizza Hut locations in Russia. The company said that most of these are operated by independent owners.\n\n— CNN’s Robert North contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/03/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/27/business/mcdonalds-adults-happy-meal/index.html", "title": "McDonald's is selling Happy Meals to adults — with a twist | CNN ...", "text": "1.

But the burgers and fries were warm.\n\nThe bill came to $23.32, including tip — nearly double the cost if a reporter had walked around the corner to the nearest McDonald's to pick up the food.\n\nThe world's biggest burger chain said Monday that it was starting the test and teaming up with Postmates, a service that is also working with Chipotle and Starbucks. It's the latest sign that fast-food chains are eager to figure out ways to feed customer demands for greater convenience.\n\nAlready, Burger King has offered delivery in select regions since 2012. Others are experimenting with quicker takeout: Taco Bell lets customers order and pay in advance on its mobile app, and Starbucks said it plans to offer mobile pay-ahead later this year.\n\nFor fast-food chains, working with Postmates is a way to move into delivery by tapping into an existing network. Postmates compares itself to the car service Uber, and says it has a \"fleet\" of 10,000 delivery people who work as independent contractors.\n\nIts partnership with fast-food companies is a bit odd, since Postmates offers delivery from a wide array of restaurants. That means people could already get some McDonald's, Starbucks and other food delivered in the two dozen major metropolitan areas where Postmates operates.\n\nBy officially linking up with Postmates, however, companies can exert greater control over the process, said Holger Luedorf, head of business development at Postmates.\n\nWith Chipotle, for instance, the delivery fee is capped at $7.99 and the chain's menu is optimized for the Postmates app. Chipotle says delivery is available wherever Postmates operates. And Starbucks is integrating Postmates into its app as part of its delivery rollout in Seattle later this year. The coffee chain said there will be a flat delivery fee, which hasn't yet been disclosed.\n\nWithout providing details, Luedorf said Postmates is in talks with other companies as well.\n\nStill, a big part of the attraction of fast-food is that it's cheap, so the demand for it will hinge on whether people think the added cost is worth the indulgence.\n\nPostmates' delivery fees range from $5 to $20, depending on the distance, said April Conyers, a Postmates representative. There's also a 9 percent service fee, and the tip.\n\nMcDonald's said the test with Postmates in New York City includes 88 restaurants. The company and Postmates did not provide details on how the pilot differs from regular Postmates deliveries of McDonald's.\n\nHere's how two Postmates deliveries of McDonald's in New York City went:\n\nORDERING\n\nOrders can be placed online or through the Postmates app. The AP placed orders on two separate days — one for breakfast and one for lunch.\n\nAfter searching for McDonald's, the app and website gave locations within several blocks from the AP office, but the one that is closest wasn't on the list.\n\nOnce the orders were accepted, an image of the delivery person appeared on the screen along with their customer rating and phone number.\n\nConfirmation emails for each order said the deliveries would take up to an hour, but both arrived in about a half-hour.\n\nAfterward, Postmates sent prompts to select tip amounts and rate the delivery person.\n\n(And they offered to reimburse the cost of the missing apples.)\n\nFEES\n\nTiming seems to play a role for delivery fees. For a McDonald's roughly three blocks away in New York City, the delivery fee for the order of burgers, fries and a shake in the late afternoon came to $5.50.\n\nHowever, an attempt to order an Egg McMuffin at 7 a.m. resulted in an $11 delivery fee.\n\nThere was no explanation for the doubled fee on the website, but a notification on the app said \"blitz pricing\" was in effect. About 20 minutes later, the delivery fee came back down to $5.50\n\nThe 9 percent service fee is fixed. The tip options of 10, 15 or 20 percent are calculated based on the total cost of the order, including the delivery fee.\n\nAdd it up, and a $12.79 order ended up costing $23.32, including a 20 percent tip. Another order that would have cost $3.80 in the store ended up costing $11.57, including tip.\n\nDELIVERY\n\nDelivery people are paid with 80 percent of the delivery fee and tips. In New York, they can choose to walk, bike or drive to make their deliveries.\n\nThey don't wear special uniforms, but are given delivery bags that help retain heat.\n\nMichael Rothberg, a 27-year-old delivery person, said Postmates ran a background check on him and that he attended a 1-hour orientation before starting work.\n\nRothberg, who is graduating from medical school in three weeks, said he signed up for Postmates to get some extra spending money. He said he can check the \"hot spots\" for deliveries on his phone, and gets alerts on deliveries, which he can choose to accept.\n\nBased on his cut of the delivery fee and a 20 percent tip, his pay to deliver an Egg McMuffin was $6.33.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/05/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/22/business/restaurant-franchises-russia/index.html", "title": "Burger King and Papa Johns are struggling to close all their Russian ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nA few weeks after Russian President Vladimir Putin began his assault on Ukraine, American restaurants said they would pull out of Russia. But many of them remain open.\n\nMcDonald’s, Starbucks, Papa Johns and the owner of Burger King, among others, have said that they would either shut down operations in the country or pull support from restaurants there. Making good on those promises, however, is proving easier said than done.\n\nTake, for example, Burger King. Restaurant Brands International says it has pulled corporate support from the roughly 800 Burger King locations in Russia. But it can’t force those locations to close. That’s because they aren’t operated by the company — instead, they’re controlled by an operator who, according to RBI, has “refused” to close the restaurants.\n\nSome Russian McDonald’s restaurants are reportedly still open, too, even after the company said it was closing its Russian locations. McDonald’s did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story.\n\nBurger King said its Russian franchise partners are refusing to close restaurants. Sergey Pyatakov/Sputnik/AP\n\nAnd a Papa Johns franchisee who operates locations in Russia recently told the New York Times that he has no plans of shutting his restaurants down, even after Papa Johns said that it would pull corporate support from Russia.\n\n“We do not own any assets or have any employees in Russia,” a Papa Johns spokesperson said in a statement, adding that Papa Johns is not currently earning any income from Russia. “That being said, we cannot unilaterally cause the independent franchisees that operate there to stop operations.” The franchise operator did not immediately respond to an inquiry for this story.\n\nSo why is it so hard for these companies to shut down in Russia?\n\nWhen big corporations decide to expand internationally, they usually set up franchise agreements. Generally, the franchisor, the brand’s corporate owner, has the same goal as the franchisee, the operator on the ground: Both want to sell food and make money.\n\nBut the Russian assault on Ukraine has shifted those priorities. Now, US companies have decided — whether because of public pressure, reputational risk or for ethical reasons — that closing restaurants is more important than selling food. But franchise operators may not agree.\n\nThat’s where things fall apart.\n\nWhy companies franchise\n\nA closed McDonald's restaurant in St. Petersburg, Russia, on March 15. AP\n\nWhen American restaurants decide to expand into other countries, they typically rely on a local franchise operator to run their business on the ground.\n\n“It’s very difficult for a US-based franchise company to be able to understand the local market dynamics of dozens and dozens of different countries around the world, and to try to translate an American brand into a European or an Asian market effectively,” said Chris Cynkar, a franchise consultant and adjunct professor of entrepreneurship at Carnegie Mellon University. “And so almost all international growth is based on a franchising model.”\n\nHere’s how it works, according to Cynkar: The franchisor lends its brand, strategy and operating model to the franchisee. In exchange, the franchisee contributes capital and that essential local knowledge.\n\nContracts between franchisors and franchisees detail the terms of these agreements. And “every franchise agreement is going to be very unique,” Cynkar said.\n\nWithout direct knowledge of the agreements, it’s impossible to know what obligations restaurants have to their franchisees, and vice versa. But David Shear, president of the international unit at Restaurant Brands International (QSR), gave some insight into Burger King’s agreement in his open letter.\n\n“There are no legal clauses that allow us to unilaterally change the contract or allow any one of the partners to simply walk away or overturn the entire agreement,” he wrote. “No serious investor in any industry in the world would agree to a long-term business relationship with flimsy termination clauses. This is exactly why we say it’s a complicated legal process when we are asked why we can’t just unilaterally shut down the business.”\n\nWhat companies can do is try to force franchise operators’ hands by halting support, as RBI and Papa Johns (PZZA) say they’ve done.\n\n“The franchisor can, in certain circumstances, pull their support on marketing, pull their support on supply chain … in order to influence how the franchisee is going to respond,” Cynkar said.\n\nBut that can only go so far.\n\nIt may be harder for a franchise operator to run its business without the marketing support or secure supply chain offered by the franchisor. But if the franchisee can still rely on local vendors for ingredients, it can keep the doors open.\n\nThe consequences of closing\n\nA closed Starbucks cafe in a shopping center in Moscow on March 18. Picture Alliance/Getty Images\n\nOnce a company creates a partnership with a franchisee in another country, that franchisee can create its own contracts with other independent operators. Those contracts are struck within the region of operation, and are subject to local laws and politics.\n\nA local operator in Russia, for example, has to weigh “what are the ramifications … under Russian law, if he orders all of his locations closed,” said Michael Seid, managing director of MSA Worldwide, a global franchise advisory firm.\n\nPlus, those franchise operators have obligations outside of what they owe the franchisor.\n\n“The local franchisee has built out a location. To do that they have acquired debt,” Seid said. “They also have lease payments. The landlord there is not going to be happy not to be paid their rent.”\n\nPlus, in the current situation, there’s likely nobody from the company to enforce the corporate decision.\n\n“They can’t go remove the signage from the outside of the store,” said Cynkar. “They can’t tell the local suppliers — the meat suppliers and the produce suppliers — to stop delivering, because those companies are … trying to make a living as well.”\n\nThe current situation is exposing the cracks in the franchise model. But experts don’t expect it to change, at least not much.\n\nThe future of franchising\n\nOne way to assert more control over stores is to avoid franchising altogether, instead opening corporate-owned locations.

And, well, it’s McDonald’s — not every company can do what McDonald’s can do.\n\nFor most companies, that’s not likely to be an appealing option, said Ben Litalien, founder and principal of the consultng firm FranchiseWell. “Yeah, you have more control, but it comes with a lot of implications,” he said. “You’ve got to have local counsel, you’ve got to have local management teams, you’ve got to put all the capital out yourself.”\n\nWhat could happen, he said, is that some operators may explore new types of contracts.\n\n“I suspect that there’s going to be some changes by some franchisors to at least try to have more power in this type of situation,” he said. That could mean “requiring operators to close, even if it’s just for a limited time.”\n\nBut, he added, it’ll be hard to come up with a contract like that.\n\n“I don’t see it as an easy challenge to overcome,” he said, “given the complexity of the agreements and the rights of the owners.”", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/03/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2022/05/09/mcdonalds-mercury-retrograde-2022-deal/9678590002/", "title": "Mercury retrograde 2022 brings McDonald's deal on McChicken ...", "text": "McDonald’s is preparing for this week’s celestial and astrological change of Mercury retrograde with both a deal and tarot card readings.\n\nThe fast-food chain will have a two-day deal — Tuesday and Wednesday — in time for the start of retrograde.

Because Britain elects a party, not a specific leader, she will be replaced by another lawmaker from her ruling Conservative Party. The process to replace Truss will take place within the next week.\n\nTruss will remain as prime minister until then.\n\n\"I came into office at a time of great economic and international instability,\" Truss said in in a brief statement outside No. 10 Downing Street in London. \"I recognize, given the situation, I cannot deliver the mandate to which I was elected by the Conservative Party.\"\n\nThe previous shortest tenure for a British leader was held by Sir Alec Douglas-Home, who served for one year and one day, from 1963 to 1964.\n\nWhy did Liz Truss resign? The move follows weeks of turmoil\n\nTruss's resignation comes after several weeks of political chaos during which she abandoned most of her economic policies.\n\nTruss fired Kwasi Kwarteng, her close ally and finance minister, on Oct. 14, even though he was implementing the pro-growth agenda she campaigned on.\n\nKwarteng was replaced by Jeremy Hunt, a former foreign minister who was beaten to the prime minister job by Boris Johnson in 2019. Hunt also failed to make a runoff in the Conservative Party process that selected Truss.\n\nWHAT TO KNOW ABOUT LIZ TRUSS: She models herself on Margaret Thatcher\n\nSince she took over, multiple polls have shown that the opposition Labor Party would likely win a landslide victory in a general election. Under British political rules, the Conservative Party must call an election before January 2025.\n\nWho could be the next prime minister?\n\nFives names have already bubbled up:\n\nRishi Sunak\n\nSunak is the front-runner, according to betting markets and news reports. Sunak, 42, lost out to Truss when she became prime minister on Sept. 6. Sunak was Johnson's finance minister. Before embarking on a career in politics, Sunak worked for Goldman Sachs and at a hedge fund. He met his wife, the daughter of the co-founder of Infosys, one of India's largest technology companies, while studying for an MBA at Stanford University. The couple have an estimated wealth of $1 billion, according to The Sunday Times Rich List, an annual gauge of the 1,000 wealthiest people and families in the U.K. Sunak served in Johnson's Cabinet as finance minister.\n\nPenny Mordaunt\n\nMordaunt, 49, leader of the House of Commons, was once regarded as the most likely lawmaker to succeed Johnson. She has been a member of Parliament since 2010 and served as trade minister. She also had a stint as minister for local government and was the first woman named armed forces minister. Mordaunt was one of the leaders behind the “Brexit” referendum approved by voters in 2016, which led to Britain's separation from the EU. She is a reservist in the Royal Navy.\n\nJeremy Hunt\n\nHunt, 55, is another longtime Cabinet minister with leadership ambitions. He appears to have already ruled himself out for prime minister, but a week has become a long time in British politics lately, so he could find a way to reassert himself in the contest. Tim Bale, politics professor at Queen Mary University of London, described Hunt as the \"Mitt Romney of British politics\" in 2019, a reference to the Utah senator known for his professionalism and lack of political charisma.\n\nBen Wallace\n\nWallace, 52, is Britain's defense secretary and has won plaudits at home and abroad for his strong support for Ukraine as it fights off a Russian invasion. Wallace supported Truss when she ran for prime minister, which could work against him.\n\nBoris Johnson\n\nJohnson, 58, left office himself only on Sept. 6, but his name has never been far from the headlines as a possible candidate for a comeback. Johnson is still well liked by Conservative Party members even though he resigned after a series of scandals connected to coronavirus lockdowns. Johnson has been silent on whether he'd take the job again. The Times (of London) is reporting Johnson is considering running in the contest.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nSir Graham Brady , leader of the 1922 committee, a group of influential Conservative Party lawmakers who determine party rules, said he expects a new prime minister to be announced by Oct. 28. Truss was selected by ordinary Conservative Party grassroots members, about 81,000 of them. Brady announced late Thursday that to enter the race to be the next party leader and thus prime minister, candidates need to secure the backing of 100 lawmakers by Monday.\n\nleader of the 1922 committee, a group of influential Conservative Party lawmakers who determine party rules, said he expects a new prime minister to be announced by Oct. 28. Truss was selected by ordinary Conservative Party grassroots members, about 81,000 of them. Brady announced late Thursday that to enter the race to be the next party leader and thus prime minister, candidates need to secure the backing of 100 lawmakers by Monday. Because there are 357 Conservative parliamentarians, this means a maximum of three lawmakers will be on the short list. If three make the list, lawmakers will vote on those, and the candidate with the least support will be eliminated. If a second vote is needed, lawmakers will then be able to signal whom they prefer in what is called an \"indicative vote.\" If both candidates choose to stay in the contest after this second round, then the final decision will be made again by the 81,000 grassroots members of the party who elected Truss.\n\nOpposition Labor Party leader Sir Keir Starmer has called for an immediate general election, a scenario that seems unlikely give that the ruling Conservative Party, according to polls, would almost certainly lose any such vote.\n\nWhat are they saying?", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/21/uk/liz-truss-resignation-allowance-intl-gbr/index.html", "title": "Prime minister's allowance: Truss is entitled to $129,000 a year as ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nLiz Truss quit her post as Britain’s prime minister just 45 days into the job, but she will be able to claim expenses of up to £115,000 ($129,000) a year for the rest of her life.\n\nTruss, who presided over failed fiscal plans and a deeply polarized ruling party during her disastrous six-week term in office, is set to become the shortest-serving prime minister in British history after announcing her resignation on Thursday.\n\nHer speech triggered a leadership race that will see the appointment of the UK’s fifth Conservative prime minister in just over six years.\n\nTruss is eligible for an annual allowance to cover the cost of public duties after leaving office.

View more opinion on CNN.\n\nLondon CNN —\n\nHolding office for only 45 days, Liz Truss has become the shortest-lived prime minister in British history after announcing her departure from Number 10.\n\nRosa Prince Rosa Prince\n\nAnd what a six weeks it was, marked by the death of a monarch and installation of a new king, a fiscal plan that crashed the markets and caused a run on the pound, the abandonment of her entire policy program, sacking of a chancellor and home secretary, loss of confidence of virtually all her MPs, reports of violent bullying in Parliament and opinion polls suggesting an existential wipe-out for her party at the next election.\n\nTruss never had an easy task to unite her troubled party after winning the contest to replace Boris Johnson as prime minister. For the first time in Conservative history, she had not won the support of her own parliamentary party, but was voted leader, thanks to the Tories’ complicated voting system, largely due to the backing of rank-and-file party members.\n\nRather than build bridges by seeking to unite the party and bring rival factions into her government, she created further resentments, triggering immediate plotting. Installing allies into key Cabinet posts left her open to the charge that her team was both inexperienced and maverick.\n\nThis proved explosive when she and her close friend Kwasi Kwarteng, who she appointed Chancellor, drew up plans to put their academic economic theories into practice; the resulting “Trussonomics” plan in mid-September, which proposed tax cuts for the most wealthy to be paid for with borrowing, spooked the financial markets, leading the Bank of England to take emergency measures to shore up the pensions sector.\n\nTruss’s response was ruthless; she dispensed with her comrade-in-arms Kwarteng and, in a desperate bid to soothe the markets, appointed the moderate Jeremy Hunt to lead the Treasury.\n\nIt wasn’t enough. As her detractors continued to seek ways to bring her down, events began to spiral out of Truss’s control.\n\nGetting rid of a prime minister is not a simple task; under Conservative rules, she should have been protected from a leadership challenge for a year.\n\nA dramatic 24 hours in Westminster\n\nBut on Wednesday, the Home Secretary, former rival Suella Braverman, quit, ostensibly over a minor breach of the ministerial rules, but with a barbed resignation letter which suggested she had ambitions to replace her.\n\nThat evening, Downing Street unwisely turned a vote on the controversial issue of fracking into a show of confidence in the prime minister; amid chaos in the Commons’ voting lobbies, and allegations of manhandling of reluctant MPs, the Chief Whip Wendy Morton was said to have resigned in exasperation, only for No 10 to message journalists in the early hours of the morning to announce she had stayed after all.\n\nBy now, the game was up. MP after MP called for Truss to quit both in public and private.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Liz Truss announces her resignation, outside Number 10 Downing Street, on October 20. Henry Nicholls/Reuters\n\nOn Thursday morning, Sir Graham Brady, who as chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench MPs acts as high executioner for moribund Conservative leaders, came to pay a house call on Truss at Number 10.\n\nAn hour later, she was gone, saying she could not “deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party.”\n\nShe went on: “I have therefore spoken to His Majesty the King to notify him that I am resigning as leader of the Conservative Party.\n\nWhat happens next\n\nThere remains the complication that, unless the rules are changed, the contest to select a new Tory leader and prime minister will again involve those party members who elected the unpopular Truss in the first place.\n\nTo avoid that, the parliamentary party needed to agree on a unity candidate – most likely the man who had been the MPs’ first choice to replace Johnson, former chancellor Rishi Sunak.\n\nIt seems that proved impossible; Sir Graham has instead won the agreement of party chiefs to truncate the timetable for the leadership contest and so avoid a repeat of last summer’s nine-week affair.

Otherwise, an online ballot of party members will close on Friday October 28.\n\nThe winner of the contest will be the fifth Conservative prime minister in just over six years – and the third within this parliamentary term. But who might the next leader be? Here are some of the main runners and riders:\n\nRishi Sunak\n\nThough he has yet to formally declare his candidacy, Sunak has already reached the 100-nomination threshold, Britain’s PA Media news agency reported on Friday.\n\nThe former Chancellor of the Exchequer (finance minister) has proved to be something of a prophet of the government’s demise, as many of the predictions he made during this summer’s leadership about Truss’s economic plan came to pass.\n\nConservative leadership candidate Rishi Sunak Peter Nicholls/Reuters\n\nSunak warned that Truss’s unfunded tax cuts would lead to a run on sterling, a panic in the bond market and concern from the International Monetary Fund. Perhaps even he would have been surprised by the pace with which he was proved right.\n\nSunak has experience of economic crisis-fighting, having guided the UK through the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nHe also secured the most votes from MPs in the last leadership election – comfortably clearing the new threshold with 137 endorsements. Although Truss eventually won the decisive members’ vote, Sunak only lost narrowly – with 43% of the vote.\n\nThe trust he has among MPs – and the vindication his predictions have gained – may make him the most likely next set of hands to steer the ship.\n\nPenny Mordaunt\n\nThe Leader of the House of Commons may have had a dress rehearsal for being prime minister this week, after stepping in for an absent Liz Truss at a debate.\n\n“The prime minister is not under a desk,” Mordaunt confirmed Tuesday – in a performance that seemed as much about pitching herself as it did about helping the PM.\n\nMordaunt confirmed in a tweet Friday afternoon that she was running to replace Truss – the first MP to do so.\n\nShe promised a “fresh start” for the country, aiming “to unite our country, deliver our pledges and win the next general election.”\n\nPenny Mordaunt HENRY NICHOLLS/REUTERS\n\nMordaunt came third in the last leadership election, narrowly missing out on being put before the members. With 105 votes from MPs in the last election, she too is expected to clear the newt threshold. She is expected to perform well among the party membership, in part due to her military credentials. Mordaunt is a reservist of the Royal Navy and served a short spell as Secretary of State for Defense.\n\nLike Sunak, she is from the more moderate wing of the party. There was even talk among MPs of the two forming a “dream team” ticket, although this is yet to materialize – and it is unclear if either would accept being chancellor over taking the top job.\n\nKemi Badenoch\n\nBadenoch came fourth in this summer’s leadership election – securing only 59 votes from MPs – but was consistently rated by pollsters as a favorite among Conservative grassroots members.\n\nOne of the younger MPs in the running, Badenoch quickly won the endorsement of long-serving Tory grandee Michael Gove, who praised her as the “outstanding talent” in the party.\n\nBadenoch is from the right of the Tory party – and in her previous leadership bid suggested that the government’s climate targets might prove too costly.\n\nWith Truss’s votes from MPs now up for grabs, Badenoch may have an outside chance of clearing the threshold and making it to the members’ vote.\n\nBoris Johnson\n\nBoris Johnson is flying back to the UK from his Caribbean holiday and plans to join the race to replace Truss, Britain’s PA Media news agency reported Friday.\n\nUK Trade Minister Sir James Duddridge, a close Johnson ally, told PA Media that he had been in contact with Johnson via Whatsapp, saying that Johnson had sent him: “‘I’m flying back, Dudders. We are going to do this. I’m up for it’.”\n\nThe minister also said via Twitter “I hope you enjoyed your holiday boss. Time to come back. Few issues at the office that need addressing. #bringbackboris.”\n\nSky News said one of its reporters, who boarded the flight Johnson took, snapped a picture of the former prime minister and his wife Carrie Johnson on board, adding that the couple received several boos from fellow passengers.\n\nMultiple allies have made the case that Johnson could be a unity candidate who could bring stability to the country, despite the fact he resigned in disgrace only a few months ago after a series of scandals came together, making his position untenable.\n\nWhen asked by CNN how they could justify Johnson standing to be PM again, one MP who campaigned for Johnson in the 2019 leadership campaign, said: “Socialists will destroy our economy and if you don’t understand that then I genuinely fear for our future.”\n\nAnother MP who supported Johnson in 2019 said he was the only candidate who could comfortably win over both Conservative MPs and members of the Conservative Party.\n\nJohnson’s closest allies said they were aware he was being actively lobbied in the hours after Truss’ resignation speech, making the case to him that he represented the party’s best shot at stability in the medium term.\n\nIn his final speech as prime minister outside 10 Downing Street, Johnson made one of his characteristic allusions to ancient history. He said he would “return to his plough” like the Roman statesman Cincinnatus – suggesting a quieter life on the backbenches. But that’s not how Cincinnatus saw out his days. He was called back from his plough to return to Rome for a second term – this time as a dictator.\n\nSome suspect that the new 100-vote threshold is an attempt by the Conservative Party to render another Johnson term impossible. But Johnson’s campaign has already started to gather momentum. A number of prominent Conservative MPs announced Friday that they will back him – even though Johnson has yet to confirm he will stand.\n\nAs Conservative MPs are currently facing electoral oblivion, their desire for self-preservation should not be underestimated. Less than three years ago Johnson delivered an 80-seat majority, and the right of the Tory party may think he is the only candidate capable of saving their jobs.\n\nIf Johnson was to secure the required 100 votes from MPs, he would be expected to perform extremely well in a vote by the party membership.\n\nGrant Shapps\n\nIt is a sign of the disorder of the last days of Truss’s government that she elevated Grant Shapps to home secretary – despite not offering him a ministerial role of any sort when she first took office.\n\nGrant Shapps Phil Noble/Reuters\n\nShapps served as transport secretary under Boris Johnson. He put himself forward to succeed him in the previous leadership election – only to withdraw from the race three days later, after failing to secure the requisite 20 MPs’ votes to proceed to the next round.\n\nThe new threshold will likely prove too high for Shapps – but his criticism of Truss’ government from the outset may have won him the support of more MPs than last time.\n\nOther names in the hat\n\nSuella Braverman’s resignation as home secretary on Wednesday night may have been a precursor to a possible leadership bid. The former attorney-general has not run before – but with her hard-line stance on immigration, might look set to drag the party further to the right.\n\nTom Tugendhat emerged as a surprise favorite among Tory members and the wider public, despite only coming fifth in the last leadership election. Having not served as a cabinet member before that contest, Tugendhat distanced himself from the moral mess of Johnson’s government and promised a “clean start” for Britain. After serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, Tugendhat was made security minister by Truss.\n\nBen Wallace, defense secretary and another ex-military man, was tipped to succeed Johnson in the last leadership contest – polling extremely well among Conservative members. However, he never ran in that election, and he has now ruled himself out of this race.\n\nFormer prime minister Theresa May has also been floated as a possible “unity” candidate to succeed Truss. May tried to bring together the warring wings of the Conservative party over Brexit, in move that ultimately saw her replaced by Boris Johnson. As the party has proven unable to resolve its disputes this time round, another attempt at compromise may soon be in order.", "authors": ["Christian Edwards"], "publish_date": "2022/10/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/20/uk/liz-truss-government-crisis-thursday-gbr-intl/index.html", "title": "Liz Truss resigns as Britain's Prime Minister after disastrous six ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nLiz Truss will become the shortest-serving prime minister in British history, after announcing her intention to resign just six weeks into a disastrous term that pitched Britain deep into political and economic turmoil.\n\nTruss said Thursday that she would step aside for a new leader to be chosen within the next week, after a growing number of her own Conservative Party’s lawmakers said they could not support her any longer.\n\n“Given the situation, I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party. I have therefore spoken to His Majesty The King to notify him that I am resigning as Leader of the Conservative Party,” Truss said while standing outside the famous black door of 10 Downing Street, the same spot in which she had promised to put the UK back onto the path to economic growth and stability just six weeks earlier.\n\nThe announcement brings to an ignominious end a catastrophic tenure in Downing Street, which appeared doomed ever since the announcement of Truss’s flagship economic agenda sent markets into panic. A record rise in UK government bond prices sent borrowing costs surging and forced the Bank of England to make three successive interventions to rescue overstretched pension funds. The pound at one point hit an all-time low against the US dollar.\n\nTruss said she would stay in Downing Street until her successor is named.\n\nGraham Brady, who chairs the 1922 Committee which represents rank-and-file Conservative Members of Parliament, said Thursday that the new party leader – and therefore prime minister – should be in place before the end of October.\n\nCandidates to replace Truss will need at least 100 nominations from British Conservative lawmakers, Brady said later on Thursday, a move that effectively narrows the field of potential candidates.\n\nThe threshold allows for the possibility of three candidates, maximum, he said. There would be an online vote for Conservative Party members if two candidates make it through the parliamentary stages, party chairman Jake Berry added.\n\nIf only one candidate emerges, there could be a new party leader and Prime Minister by Monday, Brady said.\n\nTruss had tried to save her position by admitting her plan was a mistake and replacing her chancellor and long-time ally Kwasi Kwarteng with Jeremy Hunt, a staunch supporter of former Chancellor Rishi Sunak in the leadership contest over the summer.\n\nIn the end, even that was not enough.\n\nOn Wednesday, Truss lost another top official when Home Secretary Suella Braverman dramatically quit just a few weeks into the job, using her letter of resignation to launch a blistering attack on the prime minister’s leadership.\n\n“The business of government relies upon people accepting responsibility for their mistakes. Pretending we haven’t made mistakes, carrying on as if everyone can’t see that we have made them, and hoping that things will magically come right is not serious politics,” Braverman wrote in a critique of Truss’s numerous U-turns on taxes and public spending.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Liz Truss announces her resignation outside Number 10 Downing Street on October 20, 2022. Henry Nicholls/Reuters\n\nMaking a bad day even worse, chaotic scenes unfolded in the UK Parliament on Wednesday evening during a vote on whether to ban controversial fracking for shale gas.\n\nLawmakers reported that aides for Truss had manhandled MPs into the voting lobby to force them to vote against the ban proposed by the opposition Labour Party. Politicians in the lobby tweeted eyewitness accounts alleging that MPs were being physically dragged to vote in the government lobby, amid angry scenes of shouting and altercation.\n\nHouse of Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle announced Thursday that he had ordered an investigation into the allegations.\n\nShortest tenure ever\n\nThe names of potential successors began floating around even before Truss announced she was going to resign.\n\nLeader of the House of Commons Penny Mordaunt, who stepped in for Truss during a difficult parliamentary debate earlier this week and also stood in the leadership contest over the summer, will likely be in the running. Sunak, who was Truss’ biggest rival in that contest, is another possible candidate.\n\nMeanwhile, allies of Boris Johnson, Truss’s predecessor in Number 10, made it clear on Thursday that they think the former prime minister will stand in the leadership contest, according to two sources who worked on Johnson’s 2019 leadership campaign.\n\nNewly appointed Home Secretary Grant Shapps and Kemi Badenoch, who came fourth in the last leadership contest, could also stand.\n\nTruss announced her decision to leave on day 45 of her tenure. George Canning previously held the record for the shortest term in Downing Street, having served for 119 days until his death in 1827.\n\nHer move ensures a fresh power struggle within the ruling Conservative Party, which has hemorrhaged public support for the past year and has now overthrown Boris Johnson and Truss in the space of a few months. The new prime minister will be the third since the last general election in December 2019 and the fifth since the Conservatives came into power in 2010.\n\nEarlier this year, Truss’s predecessor Johnson narrowly survived a confidence vote in his leadership. But he resigned weeks later when dozens of ministers and members of the government quit, citing a lack of confidence in his government.\n\nTruss was elected the Conservative Party leader in early September. The September 6 audience during which Queen Elizabeth II officially appointed Truss as the new prime minister, the 15th of her reign, was one of the last duties carried out by the monarch before her death on September 8.\n\nThe new prime minister, whoever that may be, will become the first to be appointed by King Charles III.\n\nKeir Starmer, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, which is enjoying a huge lead in opinion polls, on Thursday repeated his calls for an early general election.\n\n“After 12 years of Tory failure, the British people deserve so much better than this revolving door of chaos,” the opposition leader said in a statement posted on Twitter.\n\n“The Tories cannot respond to their latest shambles by yet again simply clicking their fingers and shuffling the people at the top without the consent of the British people,” he added.\n\nScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also called for an early vote.\n\n“The interests of the Tory party should concern no-one right now. A General Election is now a democratic imperative,” Sturgeon said on Twitter.\n\nThe next general election is due to take place no later than January 2025, but the prospect of Britain seeing its third prime minister since the last poll in 2019 would heap pressure on Truss’ successor to ask the public for a new mandate.\n\nThe British pound was trading 0.5% higher against the dollar after Truss announced her resignation, indicating that investors welcomed the decision.", "authors": ["Ivana Kottasová Rob Picheta", "Ivana Kottasová", "Rob Picheta"], "publish_date": "2022/10/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/10/20/liz-truss-resigns-hbcu-bomb-threats-sports-equinox-orionid-meteor-shower-thursdays-news/10524019002/", "title": "Liz Truss resigns, HBCU bomb threats, sports equinox, Orionid ...", "text": "After just six weeks in office, Britain's prime minister has resigned.

He is Britain's first leader of South Asian descent, its first Hindu prime minister, and the nation's first leader of color. He is the youngest prime minister of modern times.\n\nHe won an internal party contest to be the country's new leader following Truss' Oct. 20 resignation. Her tenure was the shortest ever for a British prime minister and was marked by economic turmoil. British voters elect a party, not a specific leader, meaning the ruling party has latitude to change a prime minister without calling an election. Sunak won the party contest after his main challenger, Penny Mordaunt, dropped out of the race. He automatically becomes prime minister. He takes over Tuesday.\n\nLiz Truss last 45 days in prime minister's office:Here's why she resigned\n\nBritain's economic turmoil\n\nHe takes over as Britain faces exceptionally challenging economic times.\n\nForecasts suggest its economy has already fallen into recession and the country is being hit with some of the highest energy and borrowing costs in Europe, the latter exasperated by Truss' move to aggressively cut taxes, which spooked bond market investors and led to a warning from the International Monetary Fund that it would further push up prices.\n\nAnnual inflation in Britain hit 10.1% in September, a 40-year high.\n\nSunak is a former banker and served as Chancellor of the Exchequer – finance minister – in Boris Johnson's government. He oversaw Johnson's package of economic support for businesses and employees during the coronavirus pandemic but resigned over the summer citing a \"fundamentally different\" economic approach to dealing with Britain's cost of living crisis and government \"standards,\" a reference to Johnson's gaffe-prone, controversial leadership style that has led to several allegations of misbehavior.\n\nJohnson pulled out of the contest to replace Truss late Sunday, after signaling for several days that he was mounting a dramatic return to Downing Street after his own resignation in July. He ended his nearly three-year, scandal-laden premiership amid a wave of resignations from his cabinet over allegations he broke his own coronavirus lockdown rules by holding a series of social events, and amid dissent over his handling of harassment claims made against a Conservative lawmaker.\n\nWho is Rishi Sunak?\n\nSunak's fast rise to the top of politics followed a privileged upbringing and lucrative marriage. Sunak is married to the daughter of the co-founder of Infosys, one of India's largest technology companies. The couple met while studying at Stanford University. They have an estimated wealth of $1 billion, according to The Sunday Times Rich List, an annual gauge of the 1,000 wealthiest people and families resident in the U.K.\n\nSunak was born and raised in southern England. His mother was a pharmacist and his father a doctor. Before getting his MBA at Stanford, he attended Oxford University and Winchester College, one of Britain's most prestigious preparatory schools.\n\nSunak has spoken often about his Indian roots and being a practicing Hindu. He has said lighting Diwali candles outside No. 11 Downing Street – the office and home of the Chancellor of the Exchequer – when finance minister was one of the proudest moments of his career. Sunak was named prime minister during the Hindu religious festival.\n\nTruss was the fourth British prime minister to resign since the country's 2016 vote to leave the European Union. Brexit, an economic and legal divorce, has ushered in unprecedented political division and chaos in a nation that is typically revered for being a model of stable and dependable governance. The Bank of England, Britain's central bank, was forced to buy government bonds known as \"gilts\" after Truss unveiled a series of aggressive tax cuts days after taking office. The pound currency plummeted.\n\nWith Sunak occupying No. 10 Downing Street, there is unlikely to be any major impact on London's economic and diplomatic relationship with Washington. There is broad alignment on all the big national security issues of the day, from support for Ukraine as Russia wages its war there to countering China's global rise.\n\nSunak is a less strident voice compared to Truss on the issue of the Northern Ireland Protocol, legislation agreed with the EU designed to deal with the border between Ireland (part of the EU) and Northern Ireland (part of the U.K.).\n\nU.S. lawmakers have expressed concern that if the protocol is not respected it could threaten fragile peace in Northern Ireland.\n\nMultiple polls show that the majority of Britons, especially younger ones, would prefer to be part of the EU if given the option. However, there is little appetite for a new vote.\n\nSunak will need to make difficult tax and spending decisions during his first days and weeks in office as he seeks to stabilize Britain's beleaguered economy.\n\nSunak fought off a challenge from Penny Mordaunt, a former defense and trade minister under Johnson who Truss appointed leader of the House of Commons. Mordaunt was a prominent backer of Brexit. She pulled out of the contest on Monday.\n\nWhat is Rishi Sunak's plan for the economy?\n\nDuring Sunak's previous attempt to become prime minister he warned that Truss' plan to cut taxes and borrow money during an inflation crisis would lead to financial chaos. That's precisely what Truss did, and what happened.\n\nIn a brief statement Monday given at the Conservative Party's London headquarters, Sunak warned that Britain faced \"profound\" economic challenges.\n\nSunak has said little specific about how he intends to fix Britain's economic woes. But markets view him as a relatively safe pair of hands from his time as finance minster, and restoring Britain's economic credibility and calming rattled markets is in some respects his first priority. Britain's FTSE 100 benchmark stock index gained in value after it was announced Sunak would become prime minister. The pound currency also gained in value against the dollar and euro currencies.\n\nBritain's new leader has not yet said whether current finance minister Jeremy Hunt, appointed by Truss as part of a last-ditch effort to save her premiership, would be retained. However, Hunt is due to unveil a new economic plan for Britain on Oct. 31. Hunt has signaled that it will involve painful cuts to government spending.\n\nWant to know more?

With that simple interaction, Truss became the 56th British prime minister.\n\nDuring the queen's 70-year reign she has done this – \"kissing of the hands\" – 15 times before, although this is the first time her participation in the ceremony took place outside London. The event was moved to Balmoral Castle amid what Buckingham Palace described as the queen's \"mobility issues.\" Johnson also made the 1,000-mile round trip to tender his resignation, which the Palace said the queen was \"pleased to accept.\"\n\nThe latest\n\nTruss was named the new U.K. prime minister on Monday after an internal Conservative Party contest following Johnson's resignation in July. She defeated Rishi Sunak, a former banker who served as Johnson's finance minister.\n\n\n\nIn his Tuesday farewell speech, Johnson compared himself to Roman statesman Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus, a military leader in the early days of the Roman Republic. Cincinnatus was a symbol of civic virtue, especially in times of crisis. \"This is it folks,\" Johnson said as he spoke outside Downing Street, the prime minister's official office and residence. \"Like Cincinnatus, I am returning to my plough and I will be offering this government nothing but the most fervent support.\"\n\n\n\nBut the Cincinnatus namedrop could be a coded reference to Johnson's ambition to one day lead the country again. Cincinnatus resigned from power – he was a dictator – only to return later on. Johnson will for now remain a lawmaker. In his speech, Johnson added that he was proud of what he regarded as his achievements, such as steering Britain out of the European Union, support for Ukraine in Russia's illegitimate war and a fast rollout of the coronavirus vaccine.\n\n\n\n\"On the subject of bouncing around in future careers, let me say that I am now like one of those booster rockets that has fulfilled its function,\" he said. \"And I will now be gently re-entering the atmosphere and splashing down invisibly in some remote and obscure corner of the Pacific.\"\n\n\n\nIn her first major speech as prime minister, which was short and to the point, Truss paid tribute to Johnson for \"delivering Brexit (the U.K.'s exit from the EU), the COVID vaccine (rollout) and standing up to Russian aggression in Ukraine.\" She said \"now is the time to tackle the issues holding Britain back.\" Truss said she would build roads, homes and make sure the country had quicker Internet services. Truss said she wants to turn Britain into “an aspiration nation\" by cutting taxes and boosting growth and investment.\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nA self-described Thatcher acolyte, Truss favors a combination of low taxes, a smaller state and, like Johnson, feels Britain's EU exit will enable the country to prosper in ways that the bloc did not allow.\n\n\n\nOver the coming hours and days, Truss will start appointing a pro-growth Cabinet that shares her right-leaning ideology. Kwasi Kwarteng is widely expected to be Chancellor of the Exchequer, similar to finance minister. If Kwarteng gets the job he would be the first Black person to hold Britain's second most powerful job. Kwarteng has promised a \"lean state\" under Truss.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, Truss will be subject to a political baptism by fire when she takes part in Prime Minister's Questions, or PMQs, a weekly event broadcast live in which the serving prime minister squares off against the leader of the opposition for a series of mostly spontaneous, open-style questions from lawmakers. The sessions tend to get rowdy and shouty; previous prime ministers have said, after leaving office, that they dreaded the PMQs.\n\n\n\nTruss served in Johnson's government as foreign secretary. She is familiar with many world leaders. In her first call to a foreign counterpart, she spoke with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy and accepted an invitation to visit his war-torn country soon, according to Truss's office. Truss has advocated a hardline approach to Russia over the Ukraine war. She also spoke with President Joe Biden on Tuesday.\n\nTruss is under pressure to intervene in Britain's energy markets to relieve spiraling household energy costs, which are some of the highest in Europe. She said in her speech Tuesday that she would \"take action this week.\" Economists have predicted Truss could move to freeze the cost of rising energy bills.\n\nWhat are they saying\n\nBiden congratulated Truss in a tweet. \"I look forward to deepening the special relationship between our countries and working in close cooperation on global challenges, including continued support for Ukraine as it defends itself against Russian aggression,\" he wrote on the social media platform.\n\n\n\n“At the heart of her political identity is a notion which is both a strength and a potentially calamitous weakness – a love of the notion of being a disrupter which injects a deliberate unpredictability into her approach towards a world in extreme flux,\" said Bronwen Maddox, director of the London-based think tank Chatham House, of Truss. “If she indulges this without good judgment, she could do real damage to Britain’s prospects and standing in the world\"\n\nTruss's priority \"should be serious, strengthened relations with the EU, using the language to match,” said Maddox, referring to Britain's departure from the EU and a number of lingering issues that exit has caused, including disagreements over what to do with the border between Northern Ireland (part of the U.K.) and Ireland (part of the EU).\n\n\n\nIn Russia, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Truss would not be good for the U.K. \"I don't think this will help to maintain, or strengthen, the position of the country ... London has for quite a long time been actively trying to compensate for the loss of identity and influence in the EU by taking drastic steps on the world stage, including aggressive actions over the situation that has developed around Ukraine.\"\n\n\n\nZelenskyy, by contrast, said he looked forward to working with Truss. \"I believe that together we will be able to do a lot more to protect our nations and to thwart all Russian destructive efforts.\"\n\nWant to know more?

With an average of more than 2,100 people hospitalized daily over the past week with COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus, the Alabama Board of Medical Examiners and the Medical Licensure Commission decided to let qualified physicians from other states and Canada seek temporary emergency licenses to work in the state. The Alabama Hospital Association has reported staffing shortages caused by an inadequate number of beds in places and a lack of staff to treat patients, partly because medical workers are among the ill. Dr. Mark LeQuire, chairman of the Alabama Board of Medical Examiners, said in a statement that hospitals are dealing with a doctor shortage as the number of COVID-19 patients increases. “This is an all-hands-on-deck moment,” he said.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Lawmakers who each year relocate to a capital city accessible only by plane or boat are facing challenges in getting settled ahead of what is expected to be a difficult legislative session overshadowed by COVID-19. The Baranof Hotel, a 1939 art deco showpiece in downtown Juneau with about 200 guest rooms, laundry service and a restaurant just blocks from the Capitol, is closed through the winter due to the pandemic. Short-term housing rental offerings have been sluggish compared to last year, officials say, though they expect more places to become available as the session approaches and plenty of hotel options, as many events have been waylaid by the virus. Still, with just over a month before session is set to begin, some lawmakers are waiting to lock down digs. One factor is uncertainty about how – and for how long – lawmakers plan to meet. “If I need to, I’ll sleep in my office,” Sen. Scott Kawasaki, a Fairbanks Democrat, said with a laugh. For years, he has shared a place with a fellow lawmaker. But he said the place they had last session is booked, and he was wary about signing a contract on a fallback option if lawmakers end up deciding to take an extended recess, as they did earlier this year.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: With all its sensitive electronic equipment, the cockpit of an airplane is a difficult place to clean with chemicals. A new study released by the University of Arizona suggests heat is an effective way to kill the novel coronavirus on the surfaces of the flight deck. The study is part of several between scientists in Tucson and Seattle-based airplane manufacturer Boeing who are studying whether different cleaning practices are effective against the virus that causes COVID-19. An earlier study showed that the chemical disinfectants airlines are using, including electrostatic foggers and ultraviolet wands, are effective in removing the coronavirus from airplane surfaces. Boeing wanted to study whether thermal disinfection – heating an area at a high enough temperature for a long enough time – would kill the virus in areas where chemical components might damage sensitive equipment. “We’re basically cooking the virus,” Dr. Charles Gerba, a University of Arizona microbiologist who is leading the research, said in a press release. The tests showed more than 99.9% of the virus was destroyed after three hours of exposure to temperatures of about 120 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state’s first person vaccinated against COVID-19 was Sherian Kwanisai, the Arkansas Health Department’s nursing director for local public health. “I’m excited,” said Kelley Garner, program manager with the department’s Healthcare Acquired Infections Program, who was the second to get vaccinated. “I know this is the first step to getting back to normal.” The first doses of vaccine arrived Monday morning as COVID-19 continued to surge. Arkansas’ confirmed and probable virus cases rose by 1,355 to 187,057 on Monday, and 45 more people in the state died from COVID-19, bringing its total fatalities since the pandemic began to 2,990. The state’s COVID-19 hospitalizations dropped by seven to 1,050. Twenty-seven percent of the state’s 8,943 hospital beds were available, and 7% – or 81 – of the state’s 1,160 intensive care unit beds were available, according to the Department of Health. There were 372 COVID-19 patients in ICUs around the state.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: As coronavirus surges out of control across the state with an average of more than 31,000 cases reported a day, Gov. Gavin Newsom applauded Monday as he watched an intensive care unit nurse in Los Angeles receive one of the first doses of vaccine in the state. Newsom noted that the 33,000 first doses to arrive in California roughly matched the number of cases the state was seeing each day. The COVID-19 vaccine couldn’t have come soon enough with hospitals facing an onslaught of patients, ICUs in jeopardy of being overwhelmed in most of the state, and additional hospital beds being set up in an arena, a gym and a convention center, among nearly a dozen overflow sites. “Protect me,” ICU nurse Helen Cordova said as a colleague rolled up the right sleeve of her scrubs and jabbed her in the shoulder to a round of applause from Newsom, Mayor Eric Garcetti and other workers who gathered for the cheerful event. Cordova said she had initially been reluctant to get the vaccine but changed her mind after discussing it with colleagues, reading research and considering the misery she’s witnessed at work, where even some patients who recovered have struggled.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: The American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado has sued a county sheriff, claiming jail inmates went months without access to masks as confirmed COVID-19 cases increased in the facility. The group filed the 36-page complaint in U.S. District Court on Sunday against El Paso County Sheriff Bill Elder alleging widespread failures at the jail and “deliberate indifference” to the dangers of the virus resulting in more than 1,000 inmates contracting COVID-19 in late October, The Gazette reports. The lawsuit alleges the sheriff’s office had “disordered, mismanaged” policies that allowed sick and healthy inmates to intermingle with newly arrived inmates without quarantining. “We have heard from prisoners whose masks get broken or damaged that they can’t get replacement masks,” ACLU Legal Director Mark Silverstein said. “They’re told, ‘We don’t have enough masks to give you a replacement. We don’t have enough masks to give you two to wear one while the other’s being washed.’ ” The lawsuit seeks improvements, including better medical care for the infected inmates and two free cloth masks for each inmate.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: Hospitals in New Haven and Hartford received their first deliveries of Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine Tuesday, the second day of distribution in Connecticut. Yale New Haven Hospital and Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center in Hartford each received about 2,000 doses and planned to begin vaccinating health care staff in the several hospitals run by their parent organizations. “We’re so proud. We’re ready to crush COVID,” said Stacy Vaeth, executive director of pharmacy at Yale New Haven Hospital. “It’s a bright day for us, and we’re very excited to be a part of this movement.” First priority for the vaccine in Connecticut is being given to front-line health workers who treat COVID-19 patients. From mid-January to May, about 1 million people in the state are expected to get vaccinated. They include critical workers, people living in other congregate settings, people over age 65 and those under age 65 who are at high risk. All others are expected to have access to a vaccine in June.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The first COVID-19 vaccination in the First State took place Tuesday morning, marking a significant turning point in the response to a pandemic that has infected more than 45,000 Delawareans and killed more than 800. After receiving the shot, Elisabeth Cote, a progressive care unit nurse at Bayhealth Hospital’s Kent Campus in Dover, took a deep breath, lowered her shirt sleeve, stood up and walked away. “This is a moment of hope for Delaware and for our country,” Gov. John Carney said in a statement. Cote works on a COVID-19 unit at Bayhealth. In an interview posted by the governor, she said her motivation for getting vaccinated is to be able to emerge from isolation to spend time with her grandfather, who is at high risk for the disease, and her parents. “I would love to be able to go and hug my mom and hug my grandfather and spend more time with my family,” she said. “To think we’ve been here since March, it’s exhausting.” The vaccine arrives as Delaware faces the strongest surge of the coronavirus to date. Over the past week, the state has reported 821 new cases per day. As of Sunday evening, 373 people were hospitalized, the most ever.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Howard University Hospital received its first shipment of COVID-19 vaccines Monday, and its CEO said she would be taking the shot to send a message to the Black community, WUSA-TV reports. The hospital planned to begin inoculating health care workers Tuesday, including CEO Anita Jenkins. “It’s been a hard fight, and I want us to win,” Jenkins said. Jenkins took over the helm at Howard University Hospital just one month before the country’s COVID-19 lockdown. Her career in D.C. has been shaped by the stress and price of the pandemic. “Health care disparities, research, all of that has not necessarily been a smooth ride for Black and brown people in the United States,” Jenkins said. “That’s why this COVID vaccine is met with skepticism. But let’s please understand, we are losing the battle with COVID. Black and brown people are dying about three times more from this disease than others, or even our country at large.” Jenkins said people of color simply cannot afford to sit this one out. The CEO wants people to trust the vaccine, so she will be the first in line to receive one of the hospital’s 725 doses.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: Officials in tourism-dependent central Florida are hoping bodybuilders and show dogs help kick-start a rebound for convention business that was laid low this year by the pandemic. The Orlando Sentinel reports Joe Weider’s Olympia Fitness and Performance Weekend, a gathering of muscle men and women, is expected to bring about 3,000 people to the Orange County Convention Center this week. They will follow thousands of dogs and handlers who were at the Orange County Convention Center last week for the AKC National Championship dog show. “There’s still a lot of uncertainty in the marketplace,” Convention Center Executive Director Mark Tester told local tourism officials at a meeting this month. “But we feel that we’re in a really solid place as it relates to a lot of our competitors.” Some of Orlando’s biggest convention competitors have not hosted a gathering since the COVID-19 crisis erupted in early spring. Indeed, the body-building competition was originally scheduled to be held in Las Vegas but was moved to Orlando because Nevada’s more-restrictive attendance rules would have limited crowds to 250 spectators.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: The first coronavirus vaccines in the state were administered Tuesday as new infections continued to soar, and many schools closed in-person classes for the remainder of the last week before Christmas. Gov. Brian Kemp and Public Health Commissioner Kathleen Toomey visited Savannah as the first four shots were administered to representatives of the Chatham County Health Department and Savannah’s three hospitals, who will in turn give the shots to co-workers. The Republican governor warned the state is “not out of the woods.” Georgia’s rolling seven-day average of confirmed and suspected virus cases surpassed its summer peak for the 13th straight day, with the state now averaging nearly 6,000 cases a day. At least 14 Georgia school districts have sent all students home, according to the Georgia Department of Education, canceling in-person classes for the remaining week. Others have sent groups of students, like all those in high schools home, or have closed individual schools. Nearly 3,000 people were hospitalized statewide with confirmed cases of COVID-19 on Tuesday, with more than 20 hospitals saying their intensive care units or entire hospitals were full. The state has recorded more than 10,000 confirmed and suspected deaths.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell agreed to delay the enforcement of a plastic utensils ban on businesses on Oahu by 90 days. Businesses on the island that serve prepared food will now have until March 31 to use up their existing stock of plastic utensils under the mayor’s extension announced Thursday. The Hawaii Restaurant Association and Hawaii Food Industry Association had been asking Caldwell to delay enforcement of the ordinance that was scheduled to begin Jan. 1 because of economic issues throughout the industry caused by the coronavirus pandemic. “The restaurant industry is one of our largest industries here in urban Honolulu,” Caldwell said. “It employed, prior to the pandemic, 55,000 people, generating billions of dollars in revenue, and they’re really hurting. Many of them hang on by their fingernails hoping for that brighter summer that is coming, but they need to get to that summer.” The ban had been approved by the Honolulu City Council in December 2019. The ordinance also includes plans to ban the distribution of plastic plates, bowls and other food items starting in 2022, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports.\n\nIdaho\n\nRexburg: The first COVID-19 vaccine in the state has been administered to an eastern Idaho physician. Gov. Brad Little said on social media Monday that Dr. Russ McUne in Rexburg was the first Idahoan to receive the vaccine. The state Department of Health and Welfare said it is expecting 13,650 doses of the new COVID-19 vaccine to arrive by later in the week. The vaccine advisory committee discussed the state’s needs recently and determined that health care workers would be receiving the first doses, CBS-2 reports. “As an ER physician working front lines, working with a lot of COVID, this is a vaccine that we’ve been waiting for for a long time,” McUne told the Post Register. “So this is definitely something we need people to see, we need people to be able to do, and I want to set an example that this is not something to be afraid of. This is going to help us. We really really need this vaccine in people.” Hospitals in Idaho are near capacity as infections, hospitalizations and deaths linked to COVID-19 continue rising.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Health care workers in Chicago and Peoria received the first COVID-19 vaccinations Tuesday during ceremonial events attended by top elected officials. Five health care workers, including emergency room nurses, rolled up their sleeves and received shots at Loretto Hospital, located in Chicago’s Austin neighborhood, a largely Black enclave that has been hit hard by COVID-19. Applause followed each shot. “You can see and feel the buzz of excitement because of this historic day,” Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said. “This is truly an exciting and important moment in our city’s history.” Later in the morning, four health care workers received shots at OSF Saint Francis Medical Center in Peoria. Gov. J.B. Pritzker called it a beginning for the state. Pritzker has said he expects Illinois to receive about 109,000 doses initially within the next few weeks. Chicago officials expect about 20,000 to 25,000 of those in the city. Lightfoot said that despite the hopeful news, widespread availability of a vaccine is still months away. She cited an uptick in cases following Thanksgiving.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The Indiana Supreme Court issued an order Monday suspending jury trials statewide until March 1 because COVID-19 cases continue to surge. The court said that “in-person jury trials pose an exceptional risk to everyone involved – even if every precaution is taken.” “We must act now,” Chief Justice Loretta Rush said. “Since March, we have been balancing the requirement to keep courts open with the need for public health. The worsening pandemic creates urgency for us to halt jury trials as we maintain all other court operations.” The Supreme Court has given local courts authority to adjust operations since the beginning of the public health emergency, most recently in a Nov. 10 order. This authority has included holding remote proceedings and streaming public hearings online. In addition, a task force released guidance on managing court proceedings as conditions change, guidance on safely resuming court operations, and protocols for mitigating in-court exposures. Indiana’s coronavirus death toll has reached 6,840, including both confirmed and presumed infections.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: Gov. Kim Reynolds’ administration is using $10 million in federal pandemic relief funds to pay the salaries of state police officers, who have played only a small role in Iowa’s virus response. A state report claims the money will support payroll expenses for employees “whose services were diverted to a substantially different use as a result of COVID-19.” Department spokeswoman Debra McClung said the money is mostly for salary costs for its roughly 550 sworn officers, who include road troopers and criminal investigators. They have largely carried on their routine duties during the pandemic, including enforcing traffic laws and helping local police investigate crimes. McClung did not provide examples of how any duties had changed. Instead, she said the spending appears to be allowable under revised guidance from the Treasury Department, which said in October that payroll expenses for public safety employees are presumed to qualify as pandemic-related. The same guidance document, however, says qualifying expenses are intended for employees who “have been diverted to substantially different functions” as a result of the emergency, such as a police officer who has been reassigned to enforce a stay-at-home order.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Health care workers on Monday began receiving the first of the state’s coronavirus vaccines amid a surge in cases that has left hospitals stressed. The Ascension Via Christi health care system gave shots to 115 physicians and employees at its St. Francis hospital, spokeswoman Roz Hutchinson said. The first group of five late Monday morning included a critical care nurse, a housekeeper for a COVID-19 unit and a respiratory therapist. Gov. Laura Kelly said during a Statehouse news conference that Kansas had received its full, initial shipment of the first of two doses of a vaccine made by Pfizer for 23,750 people. “We’ve a seen a rollout of a few vaccinations,” Kelly said. “We expect that we’ll continue to see that ramping up and that Wednesday, you’ll see sort of an across-the-state vaccination program beginning.” At the Wichita hospital, Kristen Garrett, a registered nurse in the intensive care unit, was the first to receive the vaccine. She said she was concerned people would let their guard down as vaccinations become available, The Wichita Eagle reports. “I do worry that with the vaccine coming out, people will think it’s over,” she said. “It’s not.”\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Gov. Andy Beshear explained “the general tenets” Monday for how schools in “red zone” counties with high COVID-19 case rates can get students back in the classroom next month. However, the state Department for Public Health now recommends K-12 schools not resume in-person classes until Jan. 11, instead of Jan. 4, Beshear said. The governor also said he thinks educators could start to receive the new COVID-19 vaccine at the beginning of February, if not sooner. Schools in red zone counties should “aggressively” implement a hybrid model that features a mix of in-person and virtual classes each week if they wish to bring students and staff back to classrooms next month, Beshear said. Every school must also offer “meaningful virtual options that cannot negatively impact students’ GPA, class rank, ability to take advanced placement classes or any other educational opportunity or recognition,” under the state’s updated guidance. Schools “must accommodate all educators who fall into a high-risk category with virtual options,” per the new requirements.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A day after coronavirus vaccinations began, the state’s education superintendent said Tuesday that he’s asked Gov. John Bel Edwards and health leaders to prioritize child care workers and school teachers, staff and bus drivers when divvying up future vaccine shipments. Superintendent of Education Cade Brumley said the estimated 166,000 employees at Louisiana’s day care centers, pre-K programs and K-12 schools are front-line workers who are essential to the functioning of the state. “Keeping schools open with face-to-face instruction is critical not only for students, but also for parents and guardians who are struggling to balance staying at home with their children and meaningful employment,” Brumley wrote in a Dec. 11 letter to Health Secretary Courtney Phillips that was also sent to Edwards. The superintendent discussed the letter at a state education board meeting Tuesday. After health workers, next up for vaccines are people who live and work at nursing homes, state-run veterans homes and long-term care facilities. Those first groups include an estimated 208,000 people, exceeding the number of vaccine doses the state expects to receive this month.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state’s public university system said it plans to use a new task force to assist with distributing the coronavirus vaccine and recommending changes to the system’s immunization requirements. University of Maine System Chancellor Dannel Malloy is charged with appointing the Vaccine Planning and Partnership Task Force, university system officials said in a statement. The task force will also be responsible for “contributing to student and public awareness about the efficacy and safety of FDA-approved vaccines.” The task force will include University of Maine President Joan Ferrini-Mundy as its chair, and it’s scheduled to issue a report Jan. 25. “The most ambitious vaccination campaign in the history of the world is now underway,” Malloy said. “FDA-approved vaccines for COVID-19 will end the pandemic and restore normalcy if enough people choose to be immunized.”\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The state’s first doses of the new COVID-19 vaccine arrived Monday at two Baltimore hospitals as health care workers at one of the facilities began to get inoculated. A shipment of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine arrived at the University of Maryland Medical Center, where two physicians, a nurse, a respiratory therapist and an environmental service worker received their first of two required doses. On Monday evening, Johns Hopkins Medicine announced it had received its initial doses and expected to administer vaccine to front-line workers beginning Wednesday. “I am a nurse on the frontlines of caring for COVID patients and I believe in the science behind the vaccine,” Shawn Hendricks, the University of Maryland center’s nursing director of medicine, cardiac services and tele-sitter program, said in a statement. “I want my family and I to be safe from getting COVID. Unless people start to get vaccinated, I think this pandemic will last longer, and get worse.” Hendricks oversees units with patients sickened with the coronavirus. Her mother, brother and brother-in-law were previously diagnosed with the virus. Her mother’s recovery lasted two months.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A World War II veteran was among the first VA patients in the country to receive a coronavirus vaccine. VA Bedford Healthcare System said on Twitter that 96-year-old Margaret Klessens received the inoculation about noon Monday. The former Somerville resident, who served in the Women’s Army Auxiliary Corps, is currently a resident in the Community Living Center at the Edith Nourse Rogers Memorial Veterans Hospital in Bedford. Klessens enlisted in 1943 when she was 19 years old, according to The Boston Globe. She went through basic training and worked a clerical job at Fort Oglethorpe in Georgia through the war. VA Bedford said a housekeeper was the first of its employees to get the vaccine, shortly after Klessens received her shot. The Bedford facility is one of 37 VA sites selected by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to receive initial doses of the vaccine.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: More than half of households with children in the state reported lost employment income since March, and 15% said they were struggling to put food on the table, according to a report released Monday. The “Kids Count” report, by the Annie E. Casey Foundation, looks at how families with children across the U.S. are dealing with “pain points” like hunger, housing, health insurance and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, and it offers policy recommendations. Data comes from the Census Bureau’s weekly Household Pulse Survey. Last week, 20,000 Michigan residents filed for unemployment benefits. The state’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate is about 5% as of October, down from a historic high of 24% in April, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Still, many families are struggling, the report finds, and will continue to bear the brunt of the crisis, absent further intervention. “We have known since the coronavirus pandemic hit Michigan that it was going to hit families with children particularly hard, but this report gives us concrete data to show how parents are faring and where help is most needed,” said Kelsey Perdue, Michigan Kids Count project director at the Michigan League for Public Policy.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The Legislature voted Monday night to pass a $216 million relief package aimed at businesses and workers who took the biggest hit from a four-week “pause” ordered by Gov. Tim Walz as increasing coronavirus cases threatened to overload hospitals. The Senate voted 62-4 to approve the bill and sent it to the House, which passed it 117-13 late Monday night and sent it to the governor for his signature. Legislative leaders from both parties agreed last week on a key component of the package, a grant program for businesses such as bars and restaurants that the governor shut down last month for all but takeout and delivery service. They agreed Sunday on the other major component of the bill, extending unemployment insurance for affected workers for 13 weeks starting Dec. 27. But negotiations on some details continued into Monday evening. The package does not include some proposals that lawmakers floated earlier in the discussion stages, such as $500 one-time stimulus payments to low-income families sought by Democrats or any easing of liquor laws to let restaurants and bars sell larger containers of beer or cocktails to go.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves sparked a debate Tuesday morning after asking the public whether state leaders should be among the first to receive a vaccination for COVID-19. In a tweet, Reeves said he’s received several messages from skeptics asking him why he hasn’t taken the vaccine himself if he’s adamant that residents across the state take it. The governor said he is ready to receive a vaccination but has not received one because he does not want to “be accused of cutting in line.” Many residents suggested the governor and other elected officials should get the shot to lead by example. State Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs, along with State Epidemiologist Dr. Paul Byers and other health leaders in Mississippi, had their vaccinations livestreamed during a news conference at the Mississippi State Department of Health on Monday. Dobbs said he wanted to be among the first to receive the vaccine to prove its safety and encourage others to take it as well. But other residents felt if those leaders are not part of a group that is at higher risk of complications from the virus, they should wait in line along with their constituents.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: The city is extending its mask requirement until April 9, citing the fast-rising number of hospitalizations and deaths in Missouri’s third-largest city, and leaders are warning that violators will face punishment. “We are quite literally in the middle of the darkest days when it comes to virus exposure, positive cases, hospitalizations and deaths,” Mayor Ken McClure said at a news conference Tuesday, a day after the City Council voted to extend the ordinance originally passed in October. The law also sets occupancy restrictions and social distancing requirements. The decision comes amid worries that that number of people requiring hospitalizations will only get worse as people gather for the holidays. Statistics released Tuesday by the state showed inpatient bed capacity across Missouri was at 24%. Intensive care unit bed space was at 22% statewide and below 20% in the St. Louis and Kansas City areas. Hospital leaders in Springfield told the City Council last week they had so many COVID-19 patients that they were only able to take about two-fifths of the patients seeking transfer from smaller hospitals.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine shipments arrived in the city Tuesday, and local health care entities plan to begin administering them as early as Wednesday. Benefis Health System received a shipment of vaccines Tuesday morning and will distribute them among its health care workers, Great Falls Clinic health care workers, Emergency Medical Services and other community providers, according to the Cascade City-County Health Department. Great Falls Clinic plans to begin administering vaccines Wednesday afternoon. Benefis plans to begin the vaccination process Thursday morning, and the Indian Family Health Clinic will administer vaccines this week as well. Sen. Jon Tester called the arrival of the first vaccines in Montana an “extraordinary moment.” Sen. Steve Daines pledged to “continue working to ensure all Montana communities get access” to the vaccine. Gov. Steve Bullock on Tuesday joined St. Vincent Healthcare employees in Billings at an event to administer some of the first Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines to health care workers.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The number of people hospitalized with the coronavirus in the state has been steadily declining over the past several weeks, but it remains at a high level that worries health experts. Dr. James Lawler with the University of Nebraska Medical Center’s Global Center for Health Security said it appears more Nebraskans are doing things like dining out less often and wearing masks in public. And he said it helps that a number of cities recently passed mask mandates. But he said it’s important for Nebraskans to remain vigilant about maintaining social distancing because virus trends could turn negative before vaccines become widely available to the general public in the spring. “We have a vaccine rolling out, but that doesn’t change the overall picture,” Lawler told the Omaha World-Herald. “Things could still turn south pretty easily.” Nebraska said 693 people were hospitalized with the virus Monday. That number has been generally decreasing since the state set a record of 987 on Nov. 20, but it is still three times higher than it was Oct. 1.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Gov. Steve Sisolak’s decision to extend the state’s coronavirus-related business restrictions until at least Jan. 15 rather than expand them has left some local business leaders mildly optimistic about the future of the industry. Most business leaders said they were grateful the governor did not add restrictions in his announcement, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. “Closing businesses, as they have in other states, would be a death knell,” said Cara Clarke, a spokeswoman for the Vegas Chamber. Sisolak extended orders Sunday to limit capacity for most businesses in the state at 25%, while retail and grocery stores will continue to limit capacity at 50%. The president of the Latin Chamber of Commerce, Peter Guzman, said the fact that the governor did not implement harsher restrictions gives businesses “a fighting chance to keep their doors open.” “People will be able to buy Christmas gifts and have somewhat of a Christmas and a holiday season,” Guzman said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state House of Representatives is tentatively planning to hold a drive-in-style meeting in January at the University of New Hampshire in the wake of its speaker dying of COVID-19. Dick Hinch, who was sworn in Dec. 2 as leader of the state’s newly Republican-led House, died Wednesday. He was 71 and had been starting his seventh two-year term in the House. His death prompted Democrats to call for the Jan. 6 meeting to be held virtually. Lawmakers are expected to elect a new speaker, adopt rules and introduce bills. “The Democratic Party wants to go virtual, and we are having trouble with that. We are just looking at safety and getting everyone together,” Acting Speaker Sherman Packard told the Associated Press. The meeting would be held in one of the UNH parking lots, Packard said. Leaders are trying to work out additional details, including how lawmakers would be vote. “This is a concept to see if we can do it,” Packard said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nWoodland Park: The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled in favor of a North Caldwell Catholic priest and a Lakewood rabbi who sued Gov. Phil Murphy over coronavirus restrictions on worship services, with the court reversing a lower court ruling that was in Murphy’s favor. The move comes less than a month after the high court ruled in favor of houses of worship that challenged New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s pandemic restrictions. Tuesday’s action was not a ruling on the merits of the New Jersey case but an unsigned order remanding it to the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals and ordering judges there to reconsider their decision in light of the Cuomo ruling. Lawyers for the New Jersey priest and rabbi called the decision “a huge victory for religious freedom.” They had argued to the Supreme Court that Murphy’s orders restricting attendance at religious services but allowing larger crowds to gather at casinos, retail locations and outdoor protests are unconstitutional.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Lawyers representing students say the state’s attempts to provide internet access and learning devices to children are “woefully insufficient.” With in-person learning banned by state officials until mid-January and plans for hybrid learning scrapped for the vast majority of students earlier this year, the inability to access remote classes has been a challenge for many rural and low-income students, particularly Native American children living on tribal lands. “We were hopeful children could return to in-person learning in early fall, but that didn’t happen,” said Maria Archuleta with the New Mexico Center on Law and Poverty, which has been involved in the case. “Access to technology was essential before the pandemic and will be when the pandemic is over.” In response to the motion, the Public Education Department highlighted state efforts to support increased internet access during the pandemic. But thousands of children are still offline, and an untold number have limited internet connectivity that doesn’t allow them to upload or download video. Some students have relied on their parent’s cellphone hotspots, which can run out of data or can’t be left at home when the parent goes to work.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Recent COVID-19-related restrictions that shuttered indoor dining in New York City and limited them in other parts of the state may not be enough to slow the coronavirus’ rapid spread, state leaders are warning. Hospitalizations due to the coronavirus continue to grow, hitting 5,700 cases Sunday – the most in New York since mid-May, state data shows. And while the spring surge was largely in New York City, it is now more spread out, hitting parts of upstate, hardest most recently in the Finger Lakes, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Monday. The concern is that hospitals could soon be overwhelmed with little relief from other parts of the state, as had been the case in the spring, he said. The issue comes even as the state got its first batch of vaccines Monday, but it will take months for the vaccine to get to most New Yorkers. So Cuomo warned of broader shutdowns akin to the March lockdowns that shuttered all nonessential businesses for two months that then slowly reopened in late spring. “If we do not change the trajectory, we could very well be headed to shutdown,” Cuomo said at his Monday briefing at the state Capitol.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state’s education department failed to monitor sufficiently whether more than $140 million in federal coronavirus relief money was used properly or met its intended purposes, according to a report from the State Auditor’s office. The performance audit looked at portions of the $316 million in federal pandemic aid that the General Assembly allocated to the Department of Public Instruction through a state law in early May. In an examination of virus-related costs from March through August, State Auditor Beth Wood’s office found that DPI distributed $76 million to local school districts, charter schools and other education units without enacting a method to detect the misuse of money. The department also failed to establish methods to ensure that $31 million for summer learning programs helped improve student ability and to measure results from $37 million spent for nutrition services such as breakfast and lunch for vulnerable students, The News & Observer of Raleigh reports.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State health officials on Tuesday reported 13 additional deaths due to complications from COVID-19 and 340 new cases. The North Dakota Health Department report came a day after the state received its first doses of a coronavirus vaccine and quickly set about giving it to hospital workers on the front lines of the fight against the disease. The deaths confirmed Tuesday bring the statewide death toll from the virus to 1,170 since the pandemic began. The state’s death count is ranked 41st in the country but is the fifth highest per capita at 152 deaths per 100,000 people, according to figures compiled by the COVID Tracking Project. The state said there were 277 people hospitalized with COVID-19 on Tuesday – no change from Monday. The most recent data shows 37 staffed intensive care unit beds and 347 staffed inpatient beds available statewide. North Dakota had been one of the worst-affected states in recent months, registering the highest rate of infection for many weeks, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: Agents in the city seized 6,080 counterfeit 3M masks from Hong Kong earlier this month, according to a release from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. If the masks had been genuine, they would have been worth more than $6,500, the release said. U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers held incoming freight from Hong Kong for inspection Dec. 6, according to the release. During routine operations, officers discovered a shipment of 38 boxes of masks labeled as 3M Disposable Respirators Model 8210. The information provided with the shipment did not meet authentication requirements, and the boxes were labeled as made in the U.S. despite being imported. “With the current health concerns nationwide, our officers have amplified their efforts to find fake medical supplies that can have potentially deadly consequences,” Cincinnati Port Director Richard Gillespie said. “Counterfeit masks like these are not tested using the same quality control standards as the genuine product, and it is unlikely they will perform in the same manner as the genuine product was designed to do.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: An emergency room nurse became the first person in the state to receive Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine. Hannah White, 31, laughed before the vaccination and again afterward as she hugged the person who injected her at Integris Baptist Medical Center on Monday. She showed no reaction as the needle entered her arm. “I don’t have any burning at the site; I have no pain. I didn’t feel it,” White said. She encouraged others to get vaccinated as they become eligible based on the state’s four-phase plan. After front-line health care workers have a chance to get a shot, long-term care providers and residents, paramedics, emergency medical technicians, and pharmacy staff who will administer the vaccine in long-term care facilities are also slated to be among the first inoculated. The first phase of vaccinations does not include public school teachers, who are currently due to be vaccinated in the third phase, but that could change, Gov. Kevin Stitt said, but “we are looking at our K-12 teachers to move them up the list.”\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Gov. Kate Brown is calling lawmakers back to the Capitol for a one-day special session, asking them to approve hundreds of millions of dollars to aid people and communities struggling with the pandemic and the effect of this summer’s devastating wildfires. In a statement Tuesday, Brown said the Legislature would convene Dec. 21 and consider $800 million in relief funding. “Oregon families are struggling with unemployment, housing, food insecurity, and paying their bills – and those most impacted are the same people who are often left behind, including rural, Black, Indigenous, Latino/Latina/Latinx, Asian, Pacific Islander, and Tribal communities,” the Democrat said in a statement. Since the start of the pandemic in Oregon, more than 95,000 COVID-19 cases have been confirmed, and 1,161 people have died. Shutdowns and restrictions imposed because of COVID-19 have also caused widespread job losses and business closures.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state will receive an initial shipment of more than 110,000 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, the Department of Health announced Monday as the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center began giving the shots to its health workers. Nearly 90 hospitals across the state will receive an initial 97,500 doses directly from Pfizer, the health department said. Philadelphia is getting its own allotment of 13,650 doses. The vaccine is going to hospitals that have the ability to store it, with the first shots to be given to health workers, first responders, and residents and staff in nursing homes and other congregate settings, the health department said. The state health secretary, Dr. Rachel Levine, issued an order that requires vaccine providers to report demographic information on people who get the shots, including gender, race and ethnicity. UPMC, which was among the first to get a shipment, said it began administering the shots Monday.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state Department of Health on Tuesday reported 15 coronavirus-related deaths and 1,166 additional cases of COVID-19. That brings the total toll in the state to 1,570 deaths and 75,237 known cases. There were 455 coronavirus-positive patients in Rhode Island hospitals at last count Sunday, up from 433 reported the day prior. Fifty-three were in intensive care; 29 were on ventilators. In addition to the 1,166 new cases, the Health Department reported 11,175 negative tests, for a 9.4% positive rate. If only those testing negative for the first time are counted, the positive rate was 29.0%. Rhode Island has reported an average of 1,167 new coronavirus cases a day over the past seven days, down from 1,309 cases per day a week ago and up from 736 cases per day a month ago.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state’s public school districts are getting more than $84 million in federal aid to help get facilities reopened amid the coronavirus pandemic, officials announced this week, as some of the state’s largest districts shut off in-person learning due to rising case numbers. According to the Department of Education, the funding from the Coronavirus Relief Fund may be used for safety measures and personal protective equipment, hiring of school nurses, hiring of staff to provide one-on-one instruction and support services for struggling students, and technology equipment to support online learning. The funding is beginning to be allocated this week, officials said. “Our teachers, nurses, and school staff have gone above and beyond to support students throughout the COVID-19 pandemic,” Superintendent of Education Molly Spearman said in a statement. “These funds are to be used to maintain and support their efforts to welcome additional students back safely for face to face instruction and meet the needs of those that are struggling both online and in the classroom.” More than $194 million in federal pandemic relief has already been allocated to districts, state Education Department officials said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: The South Dakota Wing of the Civil Air Patrol is assisting the state Department of Health in delivering the first allocation of coronavirus vaccines. The Civil Air Patrol said it’s flying the Pfizer vaccine to smaller communities with its fleet of single-engine Cessna aircraft, flown by its volunteer pilots and crews. Other volunteer members will assist with mission planning and logistical support, the patrol said. “We are proud that the State of South Dakota asked us to help them with this life-saving mission,” said Col. Nick Gengler, SDWG commander. “Since the early days of World War II, the South Dakota Civil Air Patrol has helped the state and nation with missions important to our safety and security.” The South Dakota patrol has more than 400 members in units in Sioux Falls, Tea, Brookings, Mitchell, Miller, Pierre, Rapid City, Spearfish and Custer. The Civil Air Patrol is the official auxiliary of the U.S. Air Force.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: State Rep. David Byrd has been placed on a ventilator while battling COVID-19, a concerning outcome he previously cautioned was looming, barring a “miracle.” The Republican, who in the past week has repeatedly posted on Facebook asking friends for prayers, was hospitalized Dec. 5 with pneumonia. Byrd, 63, was among the nearly 70 House Republicans in attendance at a caucus meeting in the House chamber Nov. 24, a week and a half before he was hospitalized. He could be seen at one point on the House floor not wearing a mask. Days before that, he hosted a dinner for dozens of fellow caucus members at a restaurant to kick off a multinight House Republican retreat. Byrd is at least the second House Republican who has been hospitalized with the virus, along with Rep. Mike Carter. Byrd and Carter in June voted in support of a House resolution stating that “mainstream media has sensationalized the reporting on COVID-19 in the service of political agendas.” Byrd, a former teacher, principal and girls basketball coach, in 2018 was accused by three former students of sexually assaulting them in the 1980s.\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso: Five University Medical Center of El Paso nurses were the first people in the county hard-hit by the coronavirus to receive the COVID-19 vaccine Tuesday, hours after it arrived in El Paso. UMC emergency room nurse Crystal Molina was the first to get the vaccine about 2 p.m. “As a health care worker, I am super excited,” Molina said. “I am hopeful for the vaccine. As a human being, I am not going to lie; I was a little bit nervous but overall excited, and, hopefully, it will do its job and protect us.” Dr. Hector Ocaranza, the El Paso city-county health authority, attended the vaccinations of the nurses and said Tuesday was “a day of hope.” “Even though it is just the beginning, we know that a lot of people in our community will benefit from the vaccine,” Ocaranza said. “More so our health care providers who are taking care all the vulnerable people and our loved ones in the hospital. Now they will be able to continue working tirelessly.” He added that while the vaccine will be distributed to health care workers and later to the community, it still is vital to take safety precautions.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Hospitals in Salt Lake City and Provo received the state’s first shipments of COVID-19 vaccine Monday, with several others also set to get some later this week, including Dixie Regional Medical Center in St. George. Health care workers at Utah Valley Regional Hospital in Provo were expected to get the state’s first set of administered vaccines Wednesday, said Dr. Kristin Dascomb, the medical director of infection prevention for employee health at Intermountain Healthcare. Two boxes of the vaccine arrived Monday, each containing 975 doses of a vaccine developed by Pfizer, Dascomb said. Some 23,400 doses of the Pfizer vaccine are scheduled to arrive in Utah this week, with 154,000 doses total set to arrive by the end of the month, according to the Utah Department of Health, just days after the vaccine received emergency authorization from the federal Food and Drug Administration. “Today, we come to you with optimism and with hope,” Dr. Eddie Stenehjem, an infection disease physician for Intermountain, said during a press conference. “Today marks the beginning of the end of this pandemic.”\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: An emergency department nurse was the first person in the state to receive a vaccine against COVID-19. Cindy Wamsganz of the University of Vermont Medical Center in Burlington gave a thumbs-up Tuesday after receiving the vaccination that was livestreamed by the hospital. “I am humbled and honored to be asked to be the first health care worker in the state to receive this vaccine. I am fearful of the virus, not the vaccine, and believe it is our pathway to protection and living life again,” Wamsganz said in a statement distributed by the hospital. Vermont received its first doses of the vaccine Monday and is expecting to receive 5,850 doses a week for the next several weeks. Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine said if, as expected, a second COVID-19 vaccine is approved for use over the next few days, Vermont could receive a total of about 34,000 doses of the vaccine by the end of the month. Gov. Phil Scott said the good news about the vaccine comes as Vermont has recorded its 100th death from COVID-19 since the pandemic started.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: Health care workers started receiving the state’s first doses of a coronavirus vaccine Tuesday, kicking off what is likely to be a months­long process of inoculating people against the potentially deadly disease. The Ballad Health system broadcast live video of registered nurse Emily Boucher getting her first shot. “I will never stop trying to convince everyone about the reality of COVID-19,” Boucher said before pulling up her left sleeve at Johnston Memorial Hospital in Abingdon, in southwestern Virginia. Boucher works in the hospital’s COVID-19 intensive care unit. She spoke of patients “who are alone and lonely and scared” and the health care workers who sometimes hold up phones to patients’ ears “so they can hear a familiar voice.” Several health care workers at Sentara Norfolk General Hospital in the eastern part of the state also received injections. “My heart really goes out to our front-line health care workers, those that have come in every day,” said Gov. Ralph Northam, who attended the event in Norfolk.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Gov. Jay Inslee has stopped an effort to dissolve the Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department by signing a proclamation Monday that pauses the termination of health departments during the COVID-19 pandemic. “This proclamation puts a pause, in effect, on efforts to terminate a health district or a city-county health department, such as what is currently taking place in Pierce County,” Inslee said at a news conference. Members of the Pierce County Council proposed earlier this month to end the decades­long partnership between the county and the City of Tacoma. That plan was met with concern and requests to reconsider, but the council voted to move forward, KNKX reports. The Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department released a statement Monday, thanking those who have advocated for the agency “remaining an independent, neutral, public health department.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The death toll from the coronavirus pandemic in the state pushed past 1,000 with the announcement Tuesday of a record 34 deaths. Health officials said the deaths broke the one-day mark of 31 deaths reported last Wednesday. At least 1,012 people in West Virginia have died from the virus since the pandemic began. The number of deaths has more than doubled since early November, along with virus-related hospitalizations. The number of virus patients in hospitals reached 774 as of Monday. That’s up 124, or 19%, in the past week alone and includes a record 207 patients in hospital intensive care units, up from 180 a week earlier. There are more than 21,000 active cases of the virus in the state. The state began administering a vaccine for the virus Monday, focusing on health care workers and people in long-term care centers, though the governor also received his first shot.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: State officials hope to have the majority of nursing home residents vaccinated for COVID-19 by the end of January, but the process for most facilities won’t begin for at least two weeks. The state provided the federal government with the two-week notice required to begin vaccinations at most Wisconsin nursing homes Monday, said Julie Willems Van Dijk, deputy secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. The federal government has partnered with Walgreens and CVS to deliver and administer COVID-19 vaccines to most nursing homes and long-term care facilities in the country. While vaccinations at Wisconsin hospitals began Monday, they likely will not start at most nursing homes until Dec. 28 at the earliest. Willems Van Dijk said in order to begin nursing home vaccinations, the state would need to be ready to commit “a significant portion” of its vaccine allocation to nursing homes. There are an estimated 55,000 to 60,000 nursing home residents and staff in Wisconsin, said John Sauer, president and CEO of LeadingAge Wisconsin, a statewide association of long-term care providers.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: A registered nurse who does coronavirus testing and contact tracing got the state’s first COVID-19 vaccination Tuesday. Terry Thayn’s regular job is overseeing maternal and child health matters for the Cheyenne-Laramie County Health Department. This year, she has been busy working to contain the virus. “I was excited for the vaccine,” Thayn said after getting the shot at a health department news conference. Thayn is set to get a follow-up shot of the Pfizer vaccine in three weeks. Her initial dose came from a shipment of 975 in a box that arrived Monday at the health department. Three-quarters of the doses were headed to Cheyenne Regional Medical Center, one of Wyoming’s biggest hospitals where health care workers were set to get their first shots Tuesday. The remaining doses were destined for health department employees, firefighters and other front-line workers in the Cheyenne area.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/12/16"}]}

I have therefore spoken to His Majesty The King to notify him that I am resigning as Leader of the Conservative Party,” Truss said while standing outside the famous black door of 10 Downing Street, the same spot in which she had promised to put the UK back onto the path to economic growth and stability just six weeks earlier.\n\nThe announcement brings to an ignominious end a catastrophic tenure in Downing Street, which appeared doomed ever since the announcement of Truss’s flagship economic agenda sent markets into panic. A record rise in UK government bond prices sent borrowing costs surging and forced the Bank of England to make three successive interventions to rescue overstretched pension funds. The pound at one point hit an all-time low against the US dollar.\n\nTruss said she would stay in Downing Street until her successor is named.\n\nGraham Brady, who chairs the 1922 Committee which represents rank-and-file Conservative Members of Parliament, said Thursday that the new party leader – and therefore prime minister – should be in place before the end of October.\n\nCandidates to replace Truss will need at least 100 nominations from British Conservative lawmakers, Brady said later on Thursday, a move that effectively narrows the field of potential candidates.\n\nThe threshold allows for the possibility of three candidates, maximum, he said. There would be an online vote for Conservative Party members if two candidates make it through the parliamentary stages, party chairman Jake Berry added.\n\nIf only one candidate emerges, there could be a new party leader and Prime Minister by Monday, Brady said.\n\nTruss had tried to save her position by admitting her plan was a mistake and replacing her chancellor and long-time ally Kwasi Kwarteng with Jeremy Hunt, a staunch supporter of former Chancellor Rishi Sunak in the leadership contest over the summer.\n\nIn the end, even that was not enough.\n\nOn Wednesday, Truss lost another top official when Home Secretary Suella Braverman dramatically quit just a few weeks into the job, using her letter of resignation to launch a blistering attack on the prime minister’s leadership.\n\n“The business of government relies upon people accepting responsibility for their mistakes. Pretending we haven’t made mistakes, carrying on as if everyone can’t see that we have made them, and hoping that things will magically come right is not serious politics,” Braverman wrote in a critique of Truss’s numerous U-turns on taxes and public spending.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Liz Truss announces her resignation outside Number 10 Downing Street on October 20, 2022. Henry Nicholls/Reuters\n\nMaking a bad day even worse, chaotic scenes unfolded in the UK Parliament on Wednesday evening during a vote on whether to ban controversial fracking for shale gas.\n\nLawmakers reported that aides for Truss had manhandled MPs into the voting lobby to force them to vote against the ban proposed by the opposition Labour Party. Politicians in the lobby tweeted eyewitness accounts alleging that MPs were being physically dragged to vote in the government lobby, amid angry scenes of shouting and altercation.\n\nHouse of Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle announced Thursday that he had ordered an investigation into the allegations.\n\nShortest tenure ever\n\nThe names of potential successors began floating around even before Truss announced she was going to resign.\n\nLeader of the House of Commons Penny Mordaunt, who stepped in for Truss during a difficult parliamentary debate earlier this week and also stood in the leadership contest over the summer, will likely be in the running. Sunak, who was Truss’ biggest rival in that contest, is another possible candidate.\n\nMeanwhile, allies of Boris Johnson, Truss’s predecessor in Number 10, made it clear on Thursday that they think the former prime minister will stand in the leadership contest, according to two sources who worked on Johnson’s 2019 leadership campaign.\n\nNewly appointed Home Secretary Grant Shapps and Kemi Badenoch, who came fourth in the last leadership contest, could also stand.\n\nTruss announced her decision to leave on day 45 of her tenure. George Canning previously held the record for the shortest term in Downing Street, having served for 119 days until his death in 1827.\n\nHer move ensures a fresh power struggle within the ruling Conservative Party, which has hemorrhaged public support for the past year and has now overthrown Boris Johnson and Truss in the space of a few months. The new prime minister will be the third since the last general election in December 2019 and the fifth since the Conservatives came into power in 2010.\n\nEarlier this year, Truss’s predecessor Johnson narrowly survived a confidence vote in his leadership. But he resigned weeks later when dozens of ministers and members of the government quit, citing a lack of confidence in his government.\n\nTruss was elected the Conservative Party leader in early September. The September 6 audience during which Queen Elizabeth II officially appointed Truss as the new prime minister, the 15th of her reign, was one of the last duties carried out by the monarch before her death on September 8.\n\nThe new prime minister, whoever that may be, will become the first to be appointed by King Charles III.\n\nKeir Starmer, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, which is enjoying a huge lead in opinion polls, on Thursday repeated his calls for an early general election.\n\n“After 12 years of Tory failure, the British people deserve so much better than this revolving door of chaos,” the opposition leader said in a statement posted on Twitter.\n\n“The Tories cannot respond to their latest shambles by yet again simply clicking their fingers and shuffling the people at the top without the consent of the British people,” he added.\n\nScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also called for an early vote.\n\n“The interests of the Tory party should concern no-one right now. A General Election is now a democratic imperative,” Sturgeon said on Twitter.\n\nThe next general election is due to take place no later than January 2025, but the prospect of Britain seeing its third prime minister since the last poll in 2019 would heap pressure on Truss’ successor to ask the public for a new mandate.\n\nThe British pound was trading 0.5% higher against the dollar after Truss announced her resignation, indicating that investors welcomed the decision.", "authors": ["Ivana Kottasová Rob Picheta", "Ivana Kottasová", "Rob Picheta"], "publish_date": "2022/10/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/21/uk/uk-no-election-explained-intl-gbr/index.html", "title": "Why crisis-wracked UK won't be having a general election", "text": "London CNN —\n\nThe United Kingdom is – once again – in the market for a new leader following the resignation of Prime Minister Liz Truss only six weeks into her disastrous premiership.\n\nTruss’ successor will be the fifth PM to lead the country since it voted for Brexit in 2016 – a decision that set into motion the turmoil that ultimately led to the current political chaos.\n\nAnd while a general election might seem to be the obvious way forward, Brits (and their dogs) are unlikely to be lining up in front of the ballot box any time soon. Here’s why.\n\nWhy won’t there be a new election?\n\nIn the UK, general elections must be held at least every five years.\n\nLuckily for the Conservative Party, which is currently in power but trailing the opposition in opinion polls, the next vote doesn’t need to be held until January 2025.\n\nThat’s because in the UK, prime ministers are not elected directly by the people. In fact, four of the last five British prime ministers came into the role without a general election.\n\nTruss is in Downing Street because she is the leader of the largest party in the House of Commons. She was picked by the roughly 172,000 members of the Conservative Party after the departure of Boris Johnson, who himself became prime minister without a general election after winning the party leadership contest in 2019 – although he did call a new vote in December that year and won.\n\nTheresa May, who served as prime minister before Johnson, also first became PM without an election, as did Labour’s Gordon Brown when he replaced Tony Blair in 2007.\n\nSo how will the new PM be picked?\n\nThe Conservative Party is still the largest one in Parliament, so its new leader will automatically become prime minister.\n\nWhile the last leadership election took almost two months – longer than Truss will spend as prime minister – the next one will be swift.\n\nGraham Brady, leader of the 1922 Committee, which represents rank-and-file Conservative members of parliament, said Thursday the new PM will be chosen by next Friday.\n\nTo narrow the field of those in the running, the candidates to replace Truss will need at least 100 nominations from Conservative MPs, which means there will be a maximum of three people in the running.\n\nMust the new prime minister call a general election?\n\nNo. The next general election is due to take place no later than January 2025.\n\nHowever, the prospect of Britain seeing its third prime minister since the last poll in 2019 and the second to come into power without a public vote will put pressure on Truss’ successor to ask the public for a new mandate.\n\nThe last time three successive prime ministers entered Downing Street without standing in a general election was before and during the World War II.\n\nThe opposition, sensing an opportunity, is pushing for a new vote. Keir Starmer, the leader of the Labour Party, which is enjoying a huge lead in opinion polls, repeated his calls on Thursday for an early general election. “After 12 years of Tory failure, the British people deserve so much better than this revolving door of chaos,” he said in a statement posted on Twitter. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also called for an early vote, saying a new “general election is now a democratic imperative.”\n\nWhat do British people think about all this?\n\nJudging by the numerous protests, jokes and memes, many are far from impressed. A public petition calling for a new election was launched in September. It gathered more than 715,000 signatures and was debated in parliament earlier this week.\n\nHowever, there is little the public can do if the Conservative Party, which is firmly in control of parliament, decides not to call an election now.

Without offering details, Truss promised a “bold plan” to cut taxes and build economic growth, and “deliver on the energy crisis, dealing with people’s energy bills but also dealing with the long-term issues we have on energy supply.”\n\nMonday’s announcement ends weeks of bitter campaigning during which Sunak, the former Chancellor of the Exchequer (finance minister), accused the Foreign Secretary of risking a prolonged recession if she goes ahead with her promised tax cuts.\n\nOnce Johnson formally resigns his post to the Queen on Tuesday, Truss will also visit the monarch at her Scottish residence Balmoral, where, as leader of the largest party in parliament, she will be invited to form a government.\n\nTruss had been the frontrunner for weeks, and the 47-year-old will now follow Margaret Thatcher and Theresa May to become Britain’s third female premier. Despite voting to remain in the European Union back in 2016, she has found herself to be the preferred candidate of the vast majority of Brexiteers in her party.\n\nHer victory was smaller than expected, Conservatives who supported both candidates are privately admitting. It had been predicted by many that her margin of victory would be larger than the 18 percentage points announced on Monday afternoon.\n\nIn terms of her premiership, this could mean that she cannot run roughshod over her MPs, who voted in greater numbers for Sunak than Truss in the parliamentary part of this leadership contest.\n\nAnd Truss could find that she has to accommodate a wider range of views from her party, which could mean embracing Sunak’s ideas for helping Britons with the cost-of-living crisis and a less aggressive approach to tax cuts – especially corporation tax.\n\nMany Conservative MPs are privately worried that Truss’s modern-day Thatcherism could cost them the next election and will be leaping on the surprisingly low margin of victory to encourage the next PM to soften her economic stance.\n\nThe opposition Labour Party immediately dismissed her arguments, saying in a statement, “after years serving in Tory cabinets, nodding through the decisions that got us into this mess, Liz Truss simply doesn’t have the answers to this crisis.”\n\nLong political journey\n\nIn the leadership campaign, Truss’s platform had featured plenty of red meat for the Conservative membership, from a hard line against the EU on Brexit to tax cuts as her main solution to the cost-of-living crisis. This tactic clearly proved decisive in winning over ordinary members, who had the final say in electing the leader of the ruling party, who consequently becomes prime minister.\n\nBut critics have accused her new-found hardline Brexit stance of being a cynical ploy. They have pointed to the fact that throughout her adult life Truss has evolved, from being an anti-monarchist Liberal Democrat in favor of legalizing drugs in her youth to the embodiment of the Conservative right today.\n\nThroughout her political career, especially during the leadership contest, Truss has been compared to Thatcher, who, for many on the right, remains the benchmark for Conservative leaders. She was a tax-cutting, hard-nosed leader who took on the unions and played a large role in ending the Cold War. Like Thatcher, Truss has come from relatively humble beginnings to dominate a world inhabited largely by men.\n\nSince becoming an MP, Truss has gone from being the darling of the liberal Conservative leader David Cameron, who took a personal interest in her career, to the Euroskeptic right’s figurehead.\n\nBefore the Brexit referendum, Truss said that she was “backing remain as I believe it is in Britain’s economic interest and means we can focus on vital economic and social reform at home.”\n\nCabinet colleagues at the time say that she never voiced any issue about supporting staying in the EU, despite having ample opportunities to express her own Euroskepticism.\n\nThese days, Truss is more than happy to pick fights with Brussels and to claim that it was the EU all along that held the British economy back.\n\nA country in turmoil\n\nTruss will take over a Conservative government that is facing multiple crises in the country. With steep rises in energy and food prices, long waiting lists for hospital treatment, and public sector workers, dock workers and even lawyers going on strike, making the case that the party deserves to win a historic fifth term at the next general election – due to be called by December 2024 at the latest – will be an uphill battle.\n\nInflation rose above 10% in July for the first time in 40 years, driven largely by the rising cost of energy, food and fuel. According to a forecast by the Bank of England, inflation will soar to 13% by the end of the year. The central bank also predicted that the UK would enter into recession before the end of the year. And on Monday, in a signal of these serious challenges ahead, the British pound dropped 0.3% to its lowest level against the US dollar since 1985.\n\nAnalysts are skeptical that Truss’s tax-cutting policies will do much help citizens, especially after a decade of austerity policies. The Institute for Fiscal studies, an independent research group focusing on public finances, said last month that the leadership contestants, who were both promising tax cuts and smaller government spending, “need to recognise this even greater-than-usual uncertainty in the public finances.”\n\nThe specter of Johnson\n\nLooming over Truss’s new government will be the long shadow of Johnson, whose time in office saw approval ratings and voter intentions plummet for the Conservative Party. He leaves office a deeply unpopular prime minister less than three years after romping home to an enormous landslide election victory in 2019.\n\nJohnson was forced to resign from office on July 7 after a string of scandals made his position untenable. His downfall followed months of revelations over parties held in 10 Downing Street while the country was under Covid lockdown restrictions. Johnson himself was fined by the police, making him the first prime minister in history found to have broken the law in office.\n\nHowever, Johnson rode out the “Partygate” scandal. It was only when Chris Pincher, his deputy chief whip responsible for party discipline, was accused of sexually assaulting two men at a party, and Johnson delayed in acting over the matter, that his own party finally turned on him.\n\nIt is not yet known whether Johnson will remain in politics. He may still be forced to resign as a Member of Parliament after a House of Commons committee gives its verdict on whether or not Johnson knowingly misled Parliament when he claimed no rules were broken in Downing Street.\n\nRegardless, Johnson is likely to remain a high-profile figure. There is a good chance he will return to his former media career as a columnist and broadcaster, though the damage to his reputation in office might mean his appeal is limited compared to where it stood before he entered Downing Street.\n\nThroughout the campaign, Truss has been seen by most as the Johnson continuity candidate and enjoyed the backing of many of his loyalists.\n\nWhile this support has helped Truss during the leadership contest with Conservative members who saw her rival Sunak as a traitor, and who value tribal loyalty, it means she will be forever tied to the Johnson legacy.\n\nThat could ultimately become a weight around her neck, as the specter of Johnson risks overshadowing anything Truss might do to tackle the misery that many Britons are set to face this winter.", "authors": ["Luke Mcgee Peter Wilkinson", "Luke Mcgee", "Peter Wilkinson"], "publish_date": "2022/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/05/uk/new-british-prime-minister-announcement-gbr-intl/index.html", "title": "UK Tory leadership race: What time will Britain's new prime minister ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nBritons will find out later Monday who will be their next prime minister as the country faces a looming economic and humanitarian crisis, almost two months after Boris Johnson quit in the wake of a series of scandals.\n\nAt approximately 12:30 p.m. local time (7:30 a.m. ET) the ruling Conservative Party will announce the results of its leadership election, in which the two contenders in the final round, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and former finance minister Rishi Sunak, sharply criticized each other’s plans.\n\nTruss, a low-tax evangelist and the poster-child for the British Conservative right, is the strong favorite to beat Sunak, the former chancellor of the exchequer, who voted for Brexit but has now taken a softer tone on how the UK should deal with the EU.\n\nThe winner of the contest will, as leader of the largest party in the House of Commons, take over as prime minister until the next general election, which must be held by December 2024.\n\nWhoever triumphs will likely travel Tuesday to meet Queen Elizabeth II to receive an invitation to form a government. The reception is typically held at Buckingham Palace, but the 96-year-old monarch is at her Scottish residence in Balmoral and, for the first time in her reign, she will receive Johnson and his successor there.\n\nBut the next PM’s celebrations are likely to be brief, with a spiraling cost-of-living crisis – average annual energy bills alone are set to rise 80% to £3,549 (approximately $4,180) from October – threatening to overwhelm much of the country. On Sunday, speaking on a BBC political show, Truss refused to discuss her plans to tackle rising bills, but added, “what I want to reassure people is, I will act if elected as prime minister within one week.”\n\nTruss is the clear frontrunner to win most votes among ordinary Conservative Party members in the leadership election. Despite voting to remain in the European Union back in 2016, Truss has found herself to be the preferred candidate of the vast majority of Brexiteers in her party.\n\nCritics have accused her of playing politics with Brexit, adopting a hardline stance in a cynical attempt to win votes. They pointed to the fact that throughout her adult life, Truss’s politics have evolved from being in her youth an anti-monarchist in favor of legalizing drugs, to the embodiment of the right-wing of the Conservative Party. Truss’s campaign platform has featured plenty of red meat for the Conservative membership, from a hardline against the EU on Brexit, to tax cuts as her main solution to the cost-of-living crisis.\n\nUnlike Truss, Sunak did vote to leave the EU in 2016 and has made repeated promises to get rid of EU regulation. He spent the early days of his campaign criticizing Truss’s plans for tax cuts, though he has to some extent followed her lead.\n\nSunak won plaudits early in the coronavirus pandemic for using government money to assist people who lost their jobs or couldn’t run their businesses. He was later hit with a fine for attending a party with Johnson during lockdown, and came under scrutiny over the tax arrangements of his wife, Akshata Murty, the daughter of an Indian billionaire.\n\nRough road ahead\n\nWhatever the outcome, Sunak or Truss will take over a Conservative government facing multiple crises after 12 years in power. As well as the cost-of-living crisis, the next prime minister must address crumbling public services and a looming winter of strikes, all while making the case that the Conservatives deserve to win a historic fifth term at the next general election.\n\nInflation rose above 10% in July for the first time in 40 years, driven largely by the soaring cost of energy, food and fuel amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. According to the Bank of England, inflation will soar to 13% by the end of the year. The central bank also predicted that the UK will enter recession before the end of the year.\n\nAs far as this affects the leadership contest, analysts are skeptical that either candidate’s policies will help.

Johnson himself was fined by the police, making him the first prime minister in history found to have broken the law in office.\n\nHowever, he rode out the so-called “Partygate” scandal for months, and it was only when his deputy chief whip was accused of sexually assaulting two men at a party and Johnson delayed in acting that his own party finally turned on him.\n\nWhether or not Johnson will remain in politics is unknown. He may be forced to resign as a member of Parliament after a House of Commons committee gives its verdict on an investigation into the Partygate scandal and whether Johnson knowingly misled Parliament.

There is a good chance he will return to his media career as a columnist and broadcaster, though the damage to his reputation in office might mean his appeal is limited compared to how it was before he entered Downing Street.\n\nAnd his legacy will be difficult for either Truss or Sunak to distance themselves from.

Just over six weeks later, she was engulfed by a hurricane of her own making.\n\nIt was a humiliating end to a calamitous premiership marked by failed economic policies and a deeply divided ruling party.\n\nHow did it come to this? Here are the lowlights – and lowerlights – of Truss’ term as Britain’s shortest-serving prime minister.\n\nSeptember 5: Truss takes over\n\nLiz Truss delivers a speech outside 10 Downing Street on her first day in office Henry Nicholls/Reuters\n\nTruss is declared the winner of the Conservative Party leadership contest on September 5 after her predecessor, Boris Johnson, is forced to step down following a series of ethics scandals.\n\nThe omens aren’t good. The country is facing a bruised economy, a spiraling cost of living crisis and a crumbling healthcare service. Truss, who served as foreign secretary in Johnson’s government, also faces huge diplomatic challenges in the face of Russia’s war on Ukraine.\n\nIn her first speech as prime minister, in Downing Street on September 6, she tells the country that “together we can ride out the storm.”\n\nShe says her priorities included tackling soaring energy prices, improving the UK’s energy security and fixing the National Health Service.\n\nSeptember 8: Queen Elizabeth II dies\n\nJust two days into Truss’ premiership Queen Elizabeth II dies at the age of 96, sending the country into a period of national mourning.\n\nTruss pays tribute to the Queen as a symbol of stability who ruled through crises, tragedies, political scandals, pandemic and recessions.\n\n“Queen Elizabeth II was the rock on which modern Britain was built,” the new prime minister says. “Our country has grown and flourished under her reign.”\n\nLiz Truss speaks at the state funeral of Queen Elizabeth II at Westminster Abbey in London. Phil Noble/Pool/Reuters\n\nThe period of mourning gives Truss a breathing space, the chance to take a break from a marathon leadership campaign that lasted most of the summer.\n\nThere is also a hope that the moment will inspire a new, unifying approach to political debate, whatever people’s personal politics.\n\nThat doesn’t last.\n\nSeptember 23: A disastrous ‘mini-budget’\n\nIt’s Truss’ first big move as prime minister. Her finance minister and closest friend in politics, Kwasi Kwarteng, unveils a sweeping plan to extricate the country from recession, which includes a swath of tax cuts that will be funded by higher government borrowing.\n\nThe plan’s a huge gamble – the biggest tax cuts in 50 years, without a clear plan on how to pay for them. Usually, big fiscal statements in the UK are audited independently by the Office for Budget Responsibility. But Kwarteng says there was no time for such an audit – a move that stuns financial markets and sends the pound plunging.\n\nChancellor Kwasi Kwarteng unveils a \"growth plan\" in the House of Commons on September 23. Jessica Taylor/UK Parliament/Reuters\n\nThe prime minister later defends her government’s controversial tax cuts in an exclusive interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper.\n\nShe says that by cutting taxes, her government is “incentivizing businesses to invest and we’re also helping ordinary people with their taxes.”\n\nBond prices subsequently collapse, sending borrowing costs soaring, sparking mayhem in the mortgage market and pushing pension funds to the brink of insolvency.\n\nOctober 14: Truss fires Kwarteng\n\nThe economic turmoil and the prospect of higher mortgage rates force Truss to walk back key components of her financial plan.\n\nAfter ditching her plan to slash the highest rate of income tax, she fires Kwarteng in October in a desperate attempt to salvage her position.\n\n“It was right, in the face of the issues we had, that I acted decisively to ensure that we had economic stability,” Truss says.\n\nIn a letter posted on Twitter, Kwarteng says he agreed to step down at Truss’ behest.\n\nTruss appoints former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt as Kwarteng’s replacement, making him Britain’s fourth finance minister in just over three months.\n\nOctober 17: Hunt ditches Truss’ fiscal plan\n\nJust three days into the job, Hunt says he will scrap “almost all” tax measures announced by his predecessor, in an effort to calm spooked markets and restore the government’s credibility.\n\nA proposed cut to the basic rate of income tax from April 2023 is postponed “indefinitely.” And while the government says it will still guarantee energy prices for households and businesses through this winter, it won’t commit to capping prices beyond next spring.\n\nThe moves amount to a gutting of Truss’ flagship “growth plan” and leave her in a perilous political position.\n\nWhile investors show support for Hunt’s new plan, the opposition Labour Party is not appeased.\n\n“All the Chancellor’s statement underlines is that the damage has been done,” lawmaker Rachel Reeves tweets.\n\nOctober 19: Key ally quits Cabinet\n\nHome Secretary Suella Braverman announces her departure from Truss’ Cabinet, as claims emerge of chaos and “bullying” during a parliamentary vote the same day.\n\nBraverman says she stepped down as Home Secretary over the use of a personal email address that violated ministerial rules, but also launches a thinly veiled criticism of Truss’ leadership in her resignation letter.\n\nHome Secretary Suella Braverman was forced to resign from Truss' Cabinet.

Pretending we haven’t made mistakes, carrying on as if everyone can’t see that we have made them, and hoping that things will magically come right is not serious politics,” Braverman writes.\n\nAllegations also emerge on Wednesday of some ruling Conservative Party lawmakers being physically dragged to vote with the government against the ban on fracking for shale gas.\n\nPoliticians later share accounts on Twitter of angry scenes of shouting and altercation in parliament.\n\nOctober 20: Truss quits\n\nAfter a chaotic six-week spell in Downing Street, Truss announces her resignation.\n\n“I recognize though given the situation I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party,” she says.\n\nTruss says she has tendered her resignation to the King, and a leadership election will take place within a week. She will remain UK prime minister until her successor is chosen.\n\nHer swift exit as prime minister prompts calls for an early general election in Britain.\n\n“After 12 years of Tory failure, the British people deserve so much better than this revolving door of chaos,” Labour leader Keir Starmer says after Truss announces she will resign. “We need a general election, now.”\n\nBut a fresh election is no certainty before 2025, even as Britain prepares for its fifth leader in just over six years – and its third since the last ballot.", "authors": ["Sana Noor Haq"], "publish_date": "2022/10/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/23/uk/boris-johnson-successor-mess-intl-gbr-cmd/index.html", "title": "Analysis: Boris Johnson's successor will have a huge mess on their ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nThe next prime minister of the United Kingdom will inherit a mess that some members of the governing Conservative Party believe will be impossible to manage.\n\nWith just six weeks until Boris Johnson’s successor walks through the famous black door of 10 Downing Street, the two remaining candidates are making a bad situation worse by rubbing acid into the wounds of a party so badly divided it could be forced to call an early election and hope for the best.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, CNN spoke with multiple sources across the Conservative Party on the condition of anonymity.\n\nThere are a few reasons for this, starting with how the new prime minister will be chosen.\n\nJohnson’s replacement will not be elected by the 47 million adults registered to vote, but by a much smaller group of around 160,000 grassroots Conservative Party members. The winner will be announced on September 5.\n\nThis is constitutionally quite proper. In the UK, prime ministers are not elected directly. Instead, members of parliament are elected and the leader of the party with the largest number of MPs conventionally forms a government. The Conservatives still enjoy a healthy majority from Johnson’s 2019 election win, so his successor simply inherits that majority and takes over as the head of government.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson makes a statement at Downing Street in London, Britain, on July 7, 2022. Henry Nicholls/Reuters\n\nIt does, however, create a bizarre dynamic in which the two candidates remaining – Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak – must spend the next few weeks traveling the country and appealing to the priorities of an electorate that represents less than 0.5% of the voting public.\n\nThis means running on campaign issues that the candidates believe are most likely to appeal to this very small and hardly diverse group of people.\n\n“The average age of a party member is late 50s. Just under half are of a pensionable age and they are predominately White,” says Tim Bale, who is professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London and has studied the Conservative Party extensively.\n\n“They mostly live in southern England and are (financially) comfortable. They support a strong line on law and order, they approve of low taxes but believe that public services are important and should be funded properly, especially schools, police and, of course, the health service,” Bale adds.\n\nUnsurprisingly, given the cost-of-living crisis, the main issue of debate has been how to handle the economy. Truss is calling for a different approach from Johnson’s tax rises, and claims that cutting taxes immediately would create growth. Sunak argues that he believes this is fantasy economics, given the UK is still recovering from the economic shock of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThis all might sound rather tame until you consider that Sunak was Johnson’s Chancellor of the Exchequer, or finance minister. A narrative has now emerged among Truss supporters that although she was in Johnson’s cabinet as his Foreign Secretary, she was the person most opposed to what are now being painted as Sunak’s tax rises – rather than those of his boss, Johnson.\n\nJohnson and Sunak at a cabinet meeting on June 7, 2022 in London, England. Leon Neal/Getty Images\n\nThis all gets even messier when you consider the past few weeks of British politics and just how personal the battle between Truss and Sunak has become.\n\nMany Johnson allies claim that Sunak’s resignation over a sexual assault scandal involving Johnson’s deputy chief whip was a calculated move to topple Johnson so that he could have a shot at the top job.\n\n“Rishi was clear in his letter the reasons why he resigned. Enough was enough,” a Sunak campaign spokesperson told CNN.\n\nJohnson’s main allies have since piled in to support Truss as the anti-Sunak candidate and are briefing aggressively against Sunak, echoing the line that he was responsible for the government’s economic failures.\n\n“They are trashing our record in government on stuff she voted for in the cabinet,” says an MP who is one of the few Johnson loyalists to support Sunak.\n\n“It’s one thing to say we need a new direction; it’s another to ridicule our record and say anyone who supports Rishi is making a mistake. If they carry on like this, they will really struggle to unite MPs if they win,” the lawmaker adds.\n\nIt’s this issue of whether or not Sunak or Truss can unite MPs in a way that makes it possible to govern that is freaking out many Conservatives.\n\n“The top three candidates each had around a third of the parliamentary party supporting them. They have each offered a very different version of where the party should be going,” Salma Shah, a former Conservative and government adviser, tells CNN. “This will make life difficult for any new whips’ team who will need to bridge the gap. A job made harder by the fact the teams seem to have been tearing chunks out of each other in the press and on TV.”\n\nUK Foreign Minister Liz Truss seen during a joint press conference in Prague, Czech Republic. Tomas Tkacik/SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty Images)\n\nOn top of the brutal fight taking place between the two candidates looms the enormous figure of the outgoing Prime Minister. Lots of MPs continue to believe that Johnson was still the Conservative Party’s best shot of winning the next general election and that his treatment from people like Sunak was unforgivable.\n\nOne veteran MP who joined parliament just after Margaret Thatcher was forced to resign told CNN: “I am worried. Back then the people who stabbed her in the back and the people who remained loyal was such a clear dividing line that defined the party for years. Things are even more complicated now and I am not sure these two (Sunak and Truss) can bridge those gaps.”\n\nSeconds after it was decided the final two were Truss and Sunak, an even less optimistic Conservative MP told CNN: “We’ve just lost the next election.”\n\nIt’s worth noting that some Conservatives, especially those surrounding Truss, are optimistic that MPs will unite when push comes to shove and the party faces the real prospect of losing power. They argue that the opposition Labour party would wreck the UK’s economy and that the next Conservative government would have to fix it. That alone is worth swallowing their pride and fighting for.\n\nBoris Johnson at his final appearance as prime minister in the House of Commons on July 20, 2022. Parliament TV\n\nThat said, it’s an undeniable truth that whoever wins the contest inherits what is currently an unstable parliamentary majority and 12 years of Conservative power in which the country has seen four prime ministers and even more iterations of the Conservative Party.\n\nBoth candidates served in Johnson’s scandal-ridden government – and it’s worth noting that Johnson himself will still be a sitting MP when either takes over, looming large over British politics from the backbenches.\n\nJust as Edward Heath sniped at his successor Margaret Thatcher during her premiership in the 1980s, Thatcher did the same to John Major in the following decade. Theresa May slammed Johnson over the “Partygate” scandal, so the next PM will likely be braced for criticism from Johnson – especially if he resumes his previous career as a newspaper columnist.\n\nThe job of reinventing and uniting the party, which has been struggling in the polls for months and publicly flagellating itself for almost as long, would be tough for anyone. It will be even harder for either of the leadership contenders, both of whom have their hands dirty from previous government jobs and whose supporters have been flinging mud at one another over a long, hot summer.\n\nAnd if the warring factions cannot overcome these differences, they may find that they’ve wrecked their own chances of staying in power and hand the keys over to an opposition party that’s been locked out of Downing Street since 2010. The stakes are that high, but very few in the Conservative Party are behaving like they understand that this is the case.", "authors": ["Luke Mcgee"], "publish_date": "2022/07/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2022/10/20/liz-truss-british-prime-minister-resigns/10494916002/", "title": "Liz Truss resigns as UK prime minister after 45 days in office", "text": "LONDON – Liz Truss became the shortest-serving leader in British political history after she resigned Thursday less than two months into the job.\n\nHer announcement came after her attempt to roll out aggressive tax cuts aimed at spurring economic growth but instead dramatically roiled financial markets, led to unprecedented central bank intervention and drove her poll ratings to the lowest ever recorded for a prime minister.\n\nTruss, 47, lasted 45 days in office. Because Britain elects a party, not a specific leader, she will be replaced by another lawmaker from her ruling Conservative Party. The process to replace Truss will take place within the next week.\n\nTruss will remain as prime minister until then.\n\n\"I came into office at a time of great economic and international instability,\" Truss said in in a brief statement outside No. 10 Downing Street in London. \"I recognize, given the situation, I cannot deliver the mandate to which I was elected by the Conservative Party.\"\n\nThe previous shortest tenure for a British leader was held by Sir Alec Douglas-Home, who served for one year and one day, from 1963 to 1964.\n\nWhy did Liz Truss resign?

Hunt also failed to make a runoff in the Conservative Party process that selected Truss.\n\nWHAT TO KNOW ABOUT LIZ TRUSS: She models herself on Margaret Thatcher\n\nSince she took over, multiple polls have shown that the opposition Labor Party would likely win a landslide victory in a general election. Under British political rules, the Conservative Party must call an election before January 2025.\n\nWho could be the next prime minister?\n\nFives names have already bubbled up:\n\nRishi Sunak\n\nSunak is the front-runner, according to betting markets and news reports. Sunak, 42, lost out to Truss when she became prime minister on Sept. 6. Sunak was Johnson's finance minister. Before embarking on a career in politics, Sunak worked for Goldman Sachs and at a hedge fund. He met his wife, the daughter of the co-founder of Infosys, one of India's largest technology companies, while studying for an MBA at Stanford University. The couple have an estimated wealth of $1 billion, according to The Sunday Times Rich List, an annual gauge of the 1,000 wealthiest people and families in the U.K. Sunak served in Johnson's Cabinet as finance minister.\n\nPenny Mordaunt\n\nMordaunt, 49, leader of the House of Commons, was once regarded as the most likely lawmaker to succeed Johnson. She has been a member of Parliament since 2010 and served as trade minister. She also had a stint as minister for local government and was the first woman named armed forces minister. Mordaunt was one of the leaders behind the “Brexit” referendum approved by voters in 2016, which led to Britain's separation from the EU. She is a reservist in the Royal Navy.\n\nJeremy Hunt\n\nHunt, 55, is another longtime Cabinet minister with leadership ambitions. He appears to have already ruled himself out for prime minister, but a week has become a long time in British politics lately, so he could find a way to reassert himself in the contest. Tim Bale, politics professor at Queen Mary University of London, described Hunt as the \"Mitt Romney of British politics\" in 2019, a reference to the Utah senator known for his professionalism and lack of political charisma.\n\nBen Wallace\n\nWallace, 52, is Britain's defense secretary and has won plaudits at home and abroad for his strong support for Ukraine as it fights off a Russian invasion. Wallace supported Truss when she ran for prime minister, which could work against him.\n\nBoris Johnson\n\nJohnson, 58, left office himself only on Sept. 6, but his name has never been far from the headlines as a possible candidate for a comeback. Johnson is still well liked by Conservative Party members even though he resigned after a series of scandals connected to coronavirus lockdowns. Johnson has been silent on whether he'd take the job again. The Times (of London) is reporting Johnson is considering running in the contest.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nSir Graham Brady , leader of the 1922 committee, a group of influential Conservative Party lawmakers who determine party rules, said he expects a new prime minister to be announced by Oct. 28. Truss was selected by ordinary Conservative Party grassroots members, about 81,000 of them. Brady announced late Thursday that to enter the race to be the next party leader and thus prime minister, candidates need to secure the backing of 100 lawmakers by Monday.\n\nleader of the 1922 committee, a group of influential Conservative Party lawmakers who determine party rules, said he expects a new prime minister to be announced by Oct. 28. Truss was selected by ordinary Conservative Party grassroots members, about 81,000 of them. Brady announced late Thursday that to enter the race to be the next party leader and thus prime minister, candidates need to secure the backing of 100 lawmakers by Monday. Because there are 357 Conservative parliamentarians, this means a maximum of three lawmakers will be on the short list. If three make the list, lawmakers will vote on those, and the candidate with the least support will be eliminated. If a second vote is needed, lawmakers will then be able to signal whom they prefer in what is called an \"indicative vote.\" If both candidates choose to stay in the contest after this second round, then the final decision will be made again by the 81,000 grassroots members of the party who elected Truss.\n\nOpposition Labor Party leader Sir Keir Starmer has called for an immediate general election, a scenario that seems unlikely give that the ruling Conservative Party, according to polls, would almost certainly lose any such vote.\n\nWhat are they saying?", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/05/uk/liz-truss-british-prime-minister-profile-intl-cmd-gbr/index.html", "title": "Britain's new prime minister, Liz Truss, is a political shape-shifter ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nLiz Truss, the next prime minister of the United Kingdom, is a political chameleon who has gone from a radical who called for the abolition of the monarchy to a flag-bearer of the Euroskeptic right wing of the Conservative Party.\n\nTruss, who was only elected to parliament in 2010, has – in a relatively short period of time – established herself as a political force of nature who pursues her agenda with relentless vigor and unequivocal enthusiasm.\n\nBut after a decades-long transformation that has seen her personal views change enormously, many will be asking what exactly Britain’s new leader stands for.\n\nMany who have observed her over the years question whether she has any sincere beliefs at all, or if she simply endorses whatever is the most convenient at the time.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback See the moment Tory Party announced Truss won leadership 06:20 - Source: CNN\n\nTo say that Truss, 47, has been on a political journey would be an understatement. She was born in 1975 into a family that she herself has described as “to the left of Labour,” Britain’s main left-wing party. She grew up in parts of the UK that didn’t traditionally vote Conservative, moving between Scotland and the north of England.\n\nIn contrast with her privately educated cabinet colleagues, Truss went to a state school in the Yorkshire city of Leeds, and later won a place at Oxford University. There she was an active member of the Liberal Democrats, a centrist opposition party that has long been an effective opponent to the Conservatives in large parts of England.\n\nDuring her time as a Liberal Democrat, Truss supported the legalization of cannabis and the abolition of the royal family – positions that are at total odds with what most would consider to be mainstream Conservatism in 2022.\n\nTruss says she joined the Conservatives in 1996, just two years after she gave a speech at a Liberal Democrat conference calling for the end of the monarchy.\n\nEven during her time as a Liberal Democrat, her peers questioned her sincerity and spotted traits that they say they still see in her today.\n\n“I honestly think she was playing to the gallery back then, whether she was talking about decriminalizing drugs or abolishing the monarchy,” Neil Fawcett, a Liberal Democrat councilor who campaigned with Truss in the 1990s, told CNN. “I think she is someone who plays to the gallery with whatever audience she is talking to, and I genuinely don’t know if she ever believes anything she says, then or now.”\n\nTruss has certainly continued to capture the attention of her audience. Since joining the Conservatives and becoming a lawmaker, she has fervently supported almost every conceivable ideology. She served loyally under three prime ministers in several different cabinet jobs, most recently as foreign secretary.\n\nMost notably, she supported remaining in the European Union in the UK’s referendum in 2016. At the time, Truss tweeted that she was backing those who wanted to remain in the bloc because “it is in Britain’s economic interest and means we can focus on vital economic and social reform at home.”\n\nTruss now backs Brexit, saying that her fears before the referendum that it could cause “disruption” were mistaken.\n\nTruss greets US Secretary of State Antony Blinken at a G7 summit in Liverpool last December. Phil Noble/Pool/Getty Images\n\nRecently, the new leader even went so far in burnishing her Brexiteer credentials as to refuse to call French President Emmanuel Macron an ally. When asked if he was friend or foe during a live broadcast, she said the “jury’s out.”\n\nThere is a debate within the Conservative Party as to how real this support of Euroskepticism is. Some think Truss was reluctantly following government orders, which opposed Brexit, in 2016. Others find that argument inconceivable.\n\nAnna Soubry, a former Conservative cabinet minister and anti-Brexit campaigner, told CNN that Truss “had the most cover out of any of us to support Brexit. Her brief at the time included the farming community, who supported Brexit on the whole. I sat around the cabinet table and heard everyone’s reason for doing what they did and find it hard to believe she’s changed her mind quite this much.”\n\nOn the other hand, Gavin Barwell, who served as former Prime Minister Theresa May’s chief-of-staff, said that, after the Brexit vote, “Truss made a decision very quickly that there wasn’t room for a compromise. If you were to do it, it needed to be done fully. And as the stalemate dragged on, she argued that a binary choice was coming between leaving with no deal and Brexit being reversed, and the latter would be catastrophic for the government.”\n\nTruss has been compared to Margaret Thatcher, who also wore a fur hat on an official visit to Moscow. Maxim Shemetov/Reuters\n\nThe closer she has edged to power, the more Britons have wondered what a Truss premiership would look like. She has campaigned to lead on the most conservative of agendas. She has pledged to slash taxes from day one, tear up EU regulations and encourage private sector growth with low corporation tax. She has said she will not impose a windfall tax on energy companies despite their posting huge profits during the current cost-of-living and energy crisis.\n\nTruss faces a challenge of forging a path for the Conservative Party, which has been in power for 12 years and has been bitterly divided over Brexit for half that period. Dan Kitwood/Pool/Getty Images\n\nThese sorts of policies were, of course, red meat to the Conservative members who ultimately voted for her. And while some of those who know her question how much she actually believes in them, there is little doubt she will put her full effort into implementing them and making her impact immediately felt.\n\nIt’s possible that a Truss government will ultimately look a lot like Johnson’s, but with a greater emphasis on cutting taxes, shrinking the state and, potentially, an even harder line on Europe.\n\nCritics have said the tax cuts she’s promised would lead to even greater inflation and rises in interest rates amid a forecast recession. Questions were also raised over a pledge Truss made to cut public sector pay, allegedly saving the public $8.8 billion. Her economics were questioned by her critics, and the uproar over perceived callousness toward public sector workers forced Truss to U-turn.\n\nJulian Glover, a journalist and speech writer to former Prime Minister David Cameron, was a university contemporary of Truss and remembers traits in her that are still recognizable today: determined but unfocused.\n\n“We only passed each other briefly and she was in a different year to me, but despite that, she stands out in my memory as a sort of strange, unfocused force, hugely in favor of action and change,” Glover told CNN. “It was always hard to see the aim of it all, or where it might lead, except that she would be at the center of it.”\n\nRoger Crouch, who succeeded Truss as president of Oxford University Liberal Democrats, told CNN that he remembers a woman who was “determined, single-minded and willing to challenge orthodox and prevailing, often male, wisdom.”\n\nUnlike many of those who knew Truss in her younger years, Crouch, who is now a teacher, thinks her opinions haven’t changed a huge amount since the 90s. “Liz was always more of a privatizing, libertarian liberal so there is a consistent thread of thought there. I remember a student discussion group in which she advocated privatization of lamp posts.”\n\nThose who know Truss say that while her views have changed over the years, she has always been determined and single-minded. Carl Court/Getty Images\n\nPrime Minister Truss will have a hard time uniting her party, which has been in power for 12 years and has been bitterly divided over Brexit for six of them.\n\nShe will also have to lead the country through its worst cost-of-living crisis in decades. Inflation is at a 40-year high, energy bills are set to increase by hundreds, possibly thousands, of pounds a year, and the UK is forecast to enter a recession before the end of the year.\n\nIn July, inflation rose above 10% for the first time in 40 years, driven largely by the rising cost of energy, food and fuel. According to the Bank of England, inflation will soar to 13% by the end of the year. The central bank also predicted that the UK will enter a recession before the end of 2022.\n\nAnalysts are skeptical that Truss’ tax-cutting policies will do much to help citizens. The Institute for Fiscal Studies, an independent research group focusing on public finances, said last month that the leadership contestants, who were both promising tax cuts and lower government spending, “need to recognise this even greater-than-usual uncertainty in the public finances.”\n\nThis winter, many families will have to make a grim choice between heating their homes and eating. And for a party that has been in power for more than a decade, it’s hard to deflect the blame for that onto anyone else.\n\nHer supporters see the chance for a fresh start in Truss. They believe that with Brexit less in the spotlight and the scandals that led to Johnson’s downfall soon to be a distant memory, the party will turn its focus to remaining in power and winning a historic fifth consecutive general election.\n\nAfter a vicious battle between Truss and Rishi Sunak (left), some question whether the new prime minister can keep the party in power at the next election. Dan Kitwood/Getty Images\n\nFor her detractors, it is more complicated. During this leadership contest those who have supported her rivals feel they have been unfairly maligned simply for disputing that Truss should be handed the keys to Downing Street.\n\nWhen it comes to running the country, this could be a problem for Truss. She had the support of fewer MPs than her rival Rishi Sunak during the early stages of the contest and the bad blood between the two camps has worsened over time.\n\nAnd for all Truss’ determination and single-mindedness, she takes over a party torn apart by infighting and suffering in the polls during a domestic crisis. So she may find her key objective – making her party electable at the next general election after so many years in power – too hard a task to achieve.", "authors": ["Luke Mcgee"], "publish_date": "2022/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/politics/955210/next-tory-leader-odds-who-will-replace-liz-truss", "title": "Next Tory leader odds: who will be PM after Liz Truss? | The Week UK", "text": "Rishi Sunak is now the clear favourite to replace Liz Truss as prime minister after his nearest rival Boris Johnson pulled out of the race on Sunday evening.\n\nIn a statement last night, Johnson claimed he had the support needed to stand and there was a “very good chance” he would have been successful and “back in Downing Street on Friday”, but that it would not be “the right thing to do”.\n\nJohnson’s statement was “equal parts bullish” optimism and “pretend modesty”, said The Guardian, while the former PM “bottles it” was the view of John Rentoul in The Independent. However, the Daily Mail thought Johnson had “set his dream aside” in a gesture of “wisdom, honour and statesmanship”.\n\nIn “as clear a repudiation of Johnson as you could expect to see”, according to the Financial Times’ Stephen Bush, Sunak announced his second leadership bid highlighting the importance of “integrity, professionalism and accountability at every level” of the government he leads.\n\nAttention has now turned to Penny Mordaunt, “who may still fancy her chances with the grassroots if she can hoover up enough disgruntled Johnson supporters to get her over the line”, said Politico’s London Playbook. But Mordaunt “only had around two dozen nominations for the leadership last night”, said The Times, and “will need to win the vast majority of former Johnson supporters to make the ballot paper” before nominations close at 2pm.\n\nOne of Mordaunt’s most senior backers, Damian Green, said that she should hit the 100 mark sometime today.\n\n“We’re confident Penny will get above the 100 mark,” Green told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “There were a lot of people who weren’t declaring publicly what they were doing. Penny’s numbers are well above the published figures already, even without any of Boris supporters.”\n\nRishi Sunak - 1/50\n\nRelatively new to the world of politics, Sunak was first elected as the Conservative MP for Richmond in North Yorkshire in 2015 after a career in investment banking. He entered the cabinet in 2019 as chief secretary to the Treasury before being appointed as chancellor a year later.\n\nHe “rose to prominence” during the pandemic, “with bold interventions to try and avert economic havoc”, said Politico. Friends of Sunak’s told The Sun that the former chancellor now wants to become prime minister to “get on with the task of rebuilding the battered economy”.\n\nAfter his resignation in July helped spark Boris Johnson’s downfall, Sunak became the favourite among MPs to become the next Tory leader. Ultimately, he lost to Liz Truss in the membership vote – but “Sunak can only have sat back and watched in glee and horror at what has unfolded since”, said The Independent, as he waited “quietly in the wings”.\n\nPenny Mordaunt - 12/1\n\nMordaunt was described by PoliticsHome as the “dark horse” candidate in the Summer race to replace Johnson. The MP for Portsmouth North has held the post of defence secretary, among other cabinet positions, and was made leader of the House of Commons under Truss.\n\nMordaunt encouraged MPs to “keep calm and carry on” following Truss’s resignation yesterday. It had earlier been reported that Sunak supporters had encouraged him to run with Mordaunt on a joint ticket, but The Telegraph reported yesterday that sources said the Commons leader “does not want to ‘play second fiddle’”.\n\nDespite trailing Johnson and Sunak in the bookies’ odds, Mordaunt “believes she can win the contest on her own terms”, the newspaper said yesterday.\n\n*Odds from bet365 via Oddschecker", "authors": ["The Week Staff"], "publish_date": "2021/12/20"}]}

It’s only the second SUV in the Italian luxury brand’s history and the first that will be available in an all-electric version.

Maserati\n\nThe Grecale is smaller than the Levante SUV, the model that accounted for 59% of Maserati’s worldwide sales last year. Like the Levante and the Ghibli sedan, the Grecale is named after a wind. The Grecale, pronounced gre-CAH-leh, is an easterly Mediterranean wind.\n\nThe electric Grecale Folgore will be part of the Italian luxury brand’s long-term plan to shift toward selling only electric vehicles. (Folgore means “lightning” in Italian.) Maserati follows a number of other luxury auto brands, including Bentley and Jaguar, in announcing a shift toward fully electric line-ups. In Maserati’s case the shift is somewhat more surprising, given the brand’s strong identification with the raspy, metallic sounds of its usually Ferrari-built internal combustion engines.\n\nMaserati has only recently started production of the new MC20 supercar, which has a Maserati-designed and built 630 horsepower V6 engine. The $216,000 MC20 is the only current Maserati model with an engine not made by Ferrari.\n\nThe high-performance Grecale Trofeo will have a 523 horsepower version of the MC20’s engine.

He believes that offering electric vehicles will do little, he said in a recent interview with CNN Business, in the absence of broader moves for more clean energy, widely available charging infrastructure and cheaper batteries. Regardless, he said, Stellantis is going forward with electrification because of the way the industry is going and what government regulations demand.\n\n“That’s a pure competitive story,” Tavares said. “And we are competitors.”", "authors": ["Peter Valdes-Dapena"], "publish_date": "2022/03/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/20/business/bmw-i7/index.html", "title": "BMW i7 electric car revealed | CNN Business", "text": "CNN —\n\nElectric vehicles, with their need for lots of expensive batteries, have often trended towards luxury. Electric cars from Porsche, Mercedes, and Audi have all hit the market in recent years. BMW has come out with its own electric cars like the iX and i4 and now the new i7, a battery-powered take on the brand’s new most expensive sedan.\n\nWhile BMW is probably better known for its smaller 3 Series and 4 Series cars, the 7 Series is the brand’s showpiece for luxury and technology. The i7 is the electric version of a new generation of the BMW 7 Series flagship unveiled on Wednesday.\n\nWith a starting price of $119,300, the all-wheel-drive 536 horsepower i7 xDrive60 will be able to go 300 miles on a full charge, which is less than the competing Mercedes EQS or Lucid Air. It will also offer a V8-powered gasoline version, the 760i X-drive, with the same horsepower output and a starting price that’s $300 less. It will look almost identical. A gas-powered version with a 6-cylinder engine will have a starting price of $93,300.\n\nThis new version also highlights BMW’s flexibility-first electric vehicle strategy, which is different from that of luxury competitors like Mercedes-Benz and Audi. While those other luxury brands’ electric vehicles are based on dedicated EV chassis with little relationship to their gas-powered models, BMW emphasizes adaptable engineering as its edge.\n\nBMW feels that it makes more sense to engineer gasoline- and battery-powered vehicles together. BMW\n\nBMW has engineered all its new models so they can be built with internal combustion engines, fully electric power or as plug-in hybrids that combine both electric and gas power. BMW executives insist this is not just a matter of fitting batteries and electric motors into cars that were intended to have gas engines. Instead, these vehicles have been designed, from the outset, to be built with any of these drive systems.\n\nA major benefit of doing it this way, BMW executives say, is that it gives the company flexibility to easily produce more – or fewer – electric cars or gas-powered cars on the same assembly lines rather than having to commit manufacturing resources just to EVs. With cars and SUVs designed to be built as either, the car maker also doesn’t risk putting millions of dollars of development costs into an electric-only model that might find little demand in some markets.\n\nAnother benefit, BMW chairman Oliver Zipse said, is that customers needn’t choose between two completely different models when deciding whether they want an electric or gas-powered car. They can just decide they want to buy a BMW 7 Series, then choose whether they want the gasoline or electric version, just as they might decide whether they want a V8 or a straight-6 engine. Either way, customers get the same luxury car experience and design.\n\nThe downside of a common engineering platform is that, to enable both electric and gasoline power, designers need compromises. Cars with internal combustion engines need a large amount of free space up front for the engine, a smaller one typically under the trunk for the fuel tank, and often a long tunnel down the middle to connect the engine to the wheels. Electric cars, on the other hand, can have smaller electric motors mounted closer to individual wheels, and while they don’t have a fuel tank or a transmission tunnel, they need a large, relatively flat area, typically on the bottom of the car, for the batteries.\n\nThe Mercedes EQS electric sedan, for example, has only a short hood that houses some electronic components, and it has a nearly flat floor allowing more interior storage space.\n\nZipse insisted the 7 Series represents a superior full-size luxury sedan regardless of its power source. The driving experience will be excellent, he said, as will interior comfort and technology.\n\n“There is no car with a more spacious, luxurious second row,” he said, during a meeting with journalists.\n\nBack seats are a major reason for buying this sort of large car. In full-size sedans, there generally isn’t much more room (if any) in the front seats compared to smaller cars. The extra space usually goes to those in the back.\n\nBMW drivers will hear \"engine sounds\" created in cooperation with Oscar-winning film composer Hans Zimmer BMW\n\nAs in many other high-end large cars, the back seats can recline while leg and foot rests rise from beneath seats. (BMW claims its seats recline more than competitors’, though.) The front passenger seat, if it’s unoccupied, can also move forward and fold down to allow more space.\n\nBMW 7 Series buyers can get an optional 31-inch high-resolution video screen that folds down from the roof to provide entertainment for back seat passengers. Combined with an available high-end stereo system and powered window shades to block out light, the 7 Series can be a better place to watch a movie than someone’s own living room, according to BMW. Front seat occupants can also watch streaming videos on the center screen when the car is parked.\n\nFour-wheel steering will enable the car to turn more tightly on curvy roads and in parking lots and to change lanes more smoothly on the highway. Inside, there are few knobs and buttons. Instead, buttons appear as lighted icons on a strip of what looks like decorative trim that runs across the dashboard.\n\nThe car’s headlights are obscured by dark coverings while, above them, turn signals and daytime running lights are housed in prominent narrow bars. As an option, the turn signals and daytime lights can include Swarovski crystals that sparkle in sunlight. As another option, the 7 Series’ large “kidney” grille can be outlined in lights at night.\n\nFor when the driver would rather not bother, assistance technologies allow the driver to completely let go of the steering wheel for long periods on divided highways. This technology, similar to General Motors’ Super Cruise, requires drives to keep their eyes on the road ahead at all times.\n\nThe 7 Series can automatically drive itself into and out of parking spaces even with the driver outside the vehicle using a smartphone app. It can also drive itself through a pre-programmed course, such as around pylons in a parking garage, on its own, a feature somewhat similar to Tesla’s Summon mode.\n\nA sophisticated “head up display” which displays data in the car’s windscreen can align images and text so they appear as if laid over roads and other features in the real world. The system can also display parking regulations in the area.\n\nPerformance is a core part of BMW’s brand image. For decades, BMW’s marketing tagline was: “The Ultimate Driving Machine.” Executives now say that electric vehicles will take the lead in the carmaker’s performance pantheon with the fastest and most powerful versions of its vehicles being battery-powered. With the new 7 Series, the i7 shares its ranking as the most powerful version with the V8-powered 760i. There are no plans for a V12-powered 7-series model in this generation of the car.\n\nA sophisticated air suspension works automatically to keep the car level even in fast turns.

The 1,600-horsepower, $5 million W16 Mistral is, essentially, an open-topped version of the Bugatti Chiron supercar, though there are major design differences.\n\nIt is also Bugatti’s last gasoline-only car. Future models will be hybrid.\n\nOnly 99 Mistrals will be made and all of them were already sold before the car was even unveiled to the public on Friday in Carmel, California, according to Bugatti.\n\n“There can only be one goal in mind: to become the fastest roadster in the world once more,” the company said in its announcement.\n\nBugatti has not said what the expected top speed of the Mistral might be. The last time Bugatti could claim to have the fastest convertible in the world was in 2013 when a Bugatti Veyron Grand Sport Vitesse cabriolet went 254 miles an hour on Volkswagen’s test track in Germany.\n\nBugatti-Rimac\n\nThe current top speed record for convertibles is claimed by the Hennessey Venom F5 Roadster made by Hennessey Performance Engineering of Texas. That $3 million, 1,800-horsepower car reached a speed of 265.6 miles an hour in 2016.\n\nConvertibles usually have lower top speeds than hard-top cars because of their poorer aerodynamics.\n\nThe Mistral will also be the last model to have Bugatti’s famous W16 16-cylinder engine. Mate Rimac, CEO of Bugatti-Rimac, the company that now owns the Bugatti brand, said future Bugatti models will be hybrids. It is unclear what sort of gas engine those future models will have, but it will not be the same W16 that, with various developments and improvements, has powered every modern Bugatti car since 2005.\n\nThe version of that engine used in the Mistral is the same one that powered the Bugatti Chiron Super Sport that Bugatti claimed in 2019 was able to reach speeds of almost 305 miles an hour.\n\nAir for the Mistral’s big engine is drawn in through air scoops behind each of the car’s two seats. The air scoops are made from carbon fiber and are designed to support the entire weight of the car to protect occupants in the event of a roll-over crash. Air intakes on the side of the car are for the oil coolers. The air that passes through the oil coolers is vented out through the Mistral’s X-shaped taillights.\n\nBugatti-Rimac\n\nThe Mistral’s design was inspired by the classic 1934 Bugatti Type 57 Roadster Grand Raid. Specifically, Bugatti’s designers looked at one Roadster Grand Raid that is currently on display at the Louwman car museum in the Netherlands, according to Bugatti. The car’s sharply angled V-shaped windshield and humps rising behind each of the seats are among the similarities to the modern car.\n\nThe front of the Mistral has its own distinctive design with headlights each made of four light bars. The central horseshoe-shaped grille is also deeper and wider than on the hard-top cars.\n\nThe first cars will be delivered to customers in 2024, according to Bugatti. Bugatti was spun off from the Volkswagen Group in 2021 and is now partnered with the Croatian electric supercar maker Rimac.

His ultimate goal is to one day approach the the 40% to 45% share the company has in computer and smartphone manufacturing, he said.\n\nFoxconn has no plans to sell cars under its own name, just as it doesn’t sell Foxconn smartphones. Instead, it wants to build cars for other companies in much the same way that Europe’s Magna Steyr builds some vehicles for automakers such as Mercedes, BMW and Jaguar. The cars it unveiled are intended to show off Foxconn’s development and manufacturing capabilities.\n\nIn the United States, Foxconn recently started building electric pickups in a Lordstown, Ohio, factory that used to make small cars for General Motors. GM sold the plant to Lordstown Motors, a startup company with plans to make electric pickups, in 2019. Lordstown Motors sold the factory to Foxconn earlier this year while Foxconn, in turn, agreed to build Lordstown’s electric pickup, the Endurance, there. Lordstown Motors announced the start of production on September 29, with customer deliveries expected to start later this year.\n\nTerry Gou, founder of Foxconn Technology Group, left, unveils the Model B crossover at an event in Taipei, Taiwan.

Another California-based startup, Indi EV, has also agreed to have Foxconn build its car, the Indi One, there. Aside from road-going automobiles, Foxconn has also agreed to build an electric farm tractor, the Monarch MK-V, at the factory.\n\nIt’s not clear how much, if any, of Foxconn’s own engineering is, or will be, in any of those cars. A spokesman for Fisker indicated the Pear may have some Foxconn components or software but will be largely CEO Henrik Fisker’s own design. The Lordstown Endurance pickup has no components from Foxconn, a spokesperson said, but the two companies have agreed to work together on future vehicles based on Foxconn engineering.\n\nFoxconn already has one EV ready for production in its home nation. The Model C will be sold as the Luxgen N7 there, with deliveries expected to begin in the second half of next year, according to Foxconn. Luxgen’s parent company, Yulon Group, and Foxconn created a joint venture called Foxtron in 2021 to develop and manufacture electric vehicles.\n\nThe Model C is described as a seven-seat crossover SUV. The newly revealed Model B city car, shown at the Taipei event, is essentially a smaller version of the Model C. The Model B was designed by Pininfarina of Italy, the firm best known for designing Ferrari models for decades but which also works with other EV companies like Vietnam’s VinFast. Pininfarina also designed one of Foxconn’s other electric vehicle prototypes, the Model E sedan, which was unveiled last year.\n\nFoxconn also showed off an electric four-wheel-drive pickup, which it boasts is the “first electric pickup designed and developed in Taiwan.” The Model V is a four-door, five-seat truck that, according to Foxconn, can carry one ton of cargo and tow up to three tons.\n\nVarious Foxconn companies are part of an large industry group called the MIH, or Mobility in Harmony, consortium, which is jointly developing the basic electric vehicle engineering platform that underlies Foxconn’s electric vehicles. Foxconn also boasted of its progress developing solid state batteries for electric cars, a technology that a number of companies are working on and is expected to one day greatly increase the range and decrease the weight of electric cars.", "authors": ["Peter Valdes-Dapena"], "publish_date": "2022/10/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/01/business/aston-martin-dbx707/index.html", "title": "Aston Martin reveals a nearly 700 horsepower luxury SUV - CNN", "text": "(CNN) Aston Martin has unveiled a new version of the British luxury brand's first SUV.

Mercedes just unveiled its latest AMG model, the Mercedes-AMG EQE, a fully electric high-perfomance mid-size sedan.\n\nWith two high-output electric motors engineered specifically for AMG – one motor for the front wheels and one for the back wheels – the Mercedes-AMG will be able to produce up to 677 horsepower when properly equipped.\n\nThe Mercedes-AMG EQE has a more rounded shape than the brand's gas-powered cars. Mercedes-Benz AG\n\nThis performance model is based on the electric Mercedes EQE sedan that was revealed in the fall. Like other Mercedes EQ models, it’s not a modified version of one of Mercedes’ gasoline-powered cars, but is built from a specific electric-only engineering platform. Since there’s no need to hold a gasoline engine under the hood, the EQE has a shorter hood than a gas-powered E-class and an overall more rounded shape.\n\nSince this electric AMG model won’t have the brand’s signature engine burble, dramatic sounds will be produced from speakers inside and outside the car. The interior sounds will vary depending on the mode the car is in and the way it’s being driven, varying from a quiet hum to an aggressive rumble overlaid with jet sounds. There will also be a special “event sound” that plays as the car is locked. At night, the headlights will project animated patterns as the car is opened and closed.\n\nWith electric motors generating large amounts of power with relative ease compared to gasoline engines, and the high price of batteries, the market for electric performance cars is already hot. With the Tesla Model S Plaid rocketing to highway speeds in two seconds, under ideal conditions, and automakers offering quick zero-emissions cars like the Porsche Taycan Turbo and Audi RS e-Tron GT, the Mercedes debuts as the latest battery-powered high-horsepower luxury car. It joins the even more powerful Mercedes-AMG EQS, a larger car capable of producing as much as 751 horsepower in a short burst\n\nWhen equipped with an optional Dynamic Plus package, the AMG EQE’s motors can briefly produce up to 677 horsepower in a Race Start acceleration mode that takes the car from zero to 60 miles an hour in an estimated 3.2 seconds. Otherwise, the motors’ maximum output is 617 horsepower when driving in Sport+ mode. (That’s also the maximum output in versions not equipped with the Dynamic Plus package.) That’s more than double the horsepower of the more mainstream Mercedes EQE 350 electric car.\n\nThe interior featurs Mercedes' full-width Hyperscreen/ Mercedes-Benz AG\n\nMercedes-AMG’s gasoline-powered cars also have all-wheel-drive, but the EQE’s two-motor all-wheel-drive system allows for more precise control of the power going to the front or back wheels, according to Mercedes. Power distrubution will be more even in Comfort mode for greater efficiency but, in Sport modes, more power will be sent to the back wheels.\n\nFour-wheel steering will be standard on the AMG EQE. With this system, the car’s back wheels turn in the opposite direction of the front wheels at low speeds allowing for tighter turns. At speeds above 37 miles an hour, all four wheels turn in the same direction for smoother lane changes. Automatically adjustable suspension will allow for a smoother ride or firmer control depending on the driving mode and situation. The car will also ride lower to the ground in Sport modes or when driving at very high speeds.\n\nA spoiler and air diffusers on at the back of the Mercedes-AMG EQE are designed to keep the back end pinned to the ground at high speeds.

It will be the first GM brand to go all-electric and its first EV model is the Cadillac Lyriq, a crossover SUV that’s one of the best Cadillacs I’ve driven in a long time.\n\nTwo days driving the Lyriq around Utah mountain roads revealed a promising start to what will be major changes for the brand. An industry-wide switch to electric drive, and Cadillac’s commitment to be among the first to go all-in, could provide an opening, if done right, for the American luxury brand to move ahead.\n\nThe Cadillac Lyriq SUV is a promising start to the GM luxury brand's electric future. General Motors\n\nThe electric turnaround starts with the Lyriq, an electric crossover SUV with a starting price around $60,000. It is the best crossover SUV Cadillac has ever made, but that’s not really saying all that much, to be honest. Crossover SUVs, for some reason, have just never been Cadillac’s best thing while they’ve been the industry’s hottest item for almost 20 years. Cadillac’s crossovers have, aside from their sharp exterior designs, seemed largely ordinary compared to luxury rivals. Cadillac has been much better at making compelling cars and, of course, the hulking Escalade, a luxuriously appointed truck-like SUV. Even so, Cadillac’s been going up against well-established German luxury brands like BMW and Mercedes and has, generally, been competitive, at best, when it needs to give buyers reasons to try a Detroit brand, maybe for the very first time.\n\nFrom the outside, the Lyriq looks like a fairly typical crossover SUV but with sharp edges and a low roofline. (Headroom inside is just fine, though.) It’s when the sun goes down that the design really shines, literally. The “grille” is a solid piece through which light shines at night to make patterns that move as the SUV turns on and off. Inside, intricate patterns inside the doors are made from metal so thin that colored light – pretty much any color you choose – can glow through it at night.\n\nBeyond that, the interior is elegantly designed with lots of patterned metal and a large curved screen that houses both the gauges in front of the driver and extends into a touchscreen both front occupants can reach. Cloth and wood surfaces look and mostly feel nice. Unlike a lot of other electric luxury vehicles, there are plenty of knobs and switches so the driver isn’t required to dig through touchscreen menus for basic things like setting the air conditioning. Even the graphics are nicely detailed, like the temperature numbers that scroll and arrows that slightly vibrate when moved.\n\nDuring the day, this grid of triangles inside the door of the Cadillac Lyriq looks like metal over metal. At night, colored light glows through the thin metal backing. Peter Valdes-Dapena/CNN\n\nThe only disappointments lie in the feel of some parts. The door opening pulls allow you to feel the ratcheting gears underneath and air vent knobs look metallic but feeldistinctly plastic when used. The door handles are also annoyingly clever. Instead of a simple handle you can pull, to open the front doors I had to press a chrome handle-shaped button then move my hand to pull on a fin-shaped handle above it. The back doors require a pull on the inside edge of the door where there is, at least, soft plastic.\n\nWith its flat floors and big storage bins, the Lyriq also makes excellent use of the extra space that electric vehicles allow thanks to their small motors and lack of transmission. There’s no front trunk, since GM designers said they wanted to package electrical and mechanical equipment under the hood to make for more room elsewhere.\n\nThe interior of the Cadillac Lyriq is nicely designed and finished, although some parts don't feel up to the competition. General Motors\n\nThe shift to electric vehicles could provide the opportunity Cadillac needs to set itself apart. The Lyriq genuinely looks and drives like a luxury crossover. On the road, it’s smooth, controlled and quiet. Press on the accelerator pedal and there’s more than ample power. It hustles without feeling rushed.\n\nThe Lyriqs GM provided for test drives were among the first built. GM executives hurried the model’s introduction, beating its original deadline by almost a year, but some features won’t go into production until later. All-wheel-drive, for instance, won’t be available for some months because the additional front motor that will provide that feature is still being tested and refined. So the Lyriq I tested was rear-wheel-drive. Similarly, GM’s Super Cruise hands-free highway driving system is still being tested for this model. It will be available later either on new Lyriqs as they’re built on the assembly line or as a software download for vehicles already in customers’ driveways.\n\nEven without all the features and all the power that extra motor will bring — the rear-wheel-drive Lyriq gets 340 horsepower from its one motor vs. 500 from the two-motor version — the Lyriq is very nice to drive. As with most luxury vehicles these days, the driver can select different “modes” that alter the accelerator pedal response and steering quickness, plus, of course, the artificial motor sound. The suspension firmness, however, cannot be changed. GM engineers say it responds automatically, using sophisticated fluid relays, to the needs of the moment, firming up when more body control is needed for turns but softening at other times to absorb bumps.\n\nIn its default Touring Mode the Cadillac Lyriq drives smoothly and handles well.\n\nThe Lyriq feels at its best in Touring Mode with everything set to its most relaxed and languid. I used Sport Mode mostly in my professional capacity — I had to test it — but I wasn’t really enjoying myself. The Lyriq feels faster in Sport Mode and the steering responds more quickly but, driving at high speeds through a curve, the suspension feels like it’s being asked to do too much. The body rolls to the side a good bit and it generally feels like the SUV is steering faster than the rest of the vehicle is ready for. Yes, the Lyriq can go fast on a tight mountain road but there are probably better electric vehicles for it. And, knowing Cadillac’s history, there will surely be future versions of the Lyriq for those interested in carving tight corners.\n\nIn Touring Mode, the Lyriq feels at peace with itself. The steering feels quite nice, the ride is smooth and those winding roads and tight turns, taken at a reasonable pace, make for a lovely afternoon’s drive. The electric motors are quiet and noise cancellation technology, nothing new but very well done here, absorbs things like tire noise.\n\nIf you think the Lyriq looks nice, GM designers say, wait until you see the Cadillac Celestiq that will be revealed next month. That entirely hand-built electric car is expected to put Cadillac back into the running with Rolls-Royce and Bentley, a market Cadillac hasn’t catered to in a long time. This could mark a turnaround that’s far more impressive than just switching from gas tanks to batteries.", "authors": ["Peter Valdes-Dapena"], "publish_date": "2022/06/28"}]}

And now Wasps have been forced into administration will be relegated from the top tier of English club rugby.\n\nThe demise of Worcester had already thrown the Premiership “into turmoil”, said BBC Sport. And with Wasps also departing, the “financial viability of the league has come sharply into focus”.\n\nSweeney believes the current model is “broken” and clubs have been “living beyond their means” for too long.

Players and staff “had not received their full wages” and a lack of funds led to “major operational shortcomings”.\n\nWorcester’s director of rugby Steve Diamond said the club’s winding-up order was the “darkest day for English rugby”. On 5 October Diamond tweeted that “we thought we could turn the tanker around”, but it’s ended up “like the Titanic”. The “ship has sunk” and the captains are “nowhere to be seen”.\n\nAnd what about Wasps?\n\nFour-time Premiership winners and two-time European champions Wasps will follow Worcester into England’s second tier – “provided they can find new owners and continue to exist”, said Michael Cantillon on Sky Sports.

Dozens more members of his government have also quit.\n\nJohnson was ultimately undone by his response to fallout from the resignation last Thursday of deputy chief whip Chris Pincher, amid allegations Pincher had groped two guests at a private dinner the night before. While he did not admit the allegations directly, Pincher said in a letter to Johnson last week that “last night I drank far too much” and “embarrassed myself and other people.” Other historical allegations of misconduct by Pincher emerged in the ensuing days.\n\nJohnson initially denied being aware of some of those allegations, but ultimately the Prime Minister was forced to admit he had been briefed years before and apologize for his decision-making.\n\nIt was the final straw for many political allies who had supported Johnson through crisis after crisis over the years. In recent months the Prime Minister had been facing a barrage of criticism from all sides over his conduct and that of his government, including illegal, lockdown-breaking parties thrown in his Downing Street offices, for which he and others were fined.\n\nJohnson faced numerous other scandals that hit his standing in the polls – despite his 80-seat landslide general election victory just two and a half years ago. These include accusations of using donor money inappropriately to pay for a refurbishment of his Downing Street home and whipping lawmakers to protect a colleague who had breached lobbying rules.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the Conservatives lost two key by-elections – results that were blamed on Johnson personally.\n\nIn early June, he survived a confidence vote, but the final count of his lawmakers who rebelled against him was higher than his supporters expected: 41% of his own parliamentary party refused to back him.\n\nThat vote was triggered after months of speculation over Johnson’s future. The so-called “Partygate” scandal, which saw Johnson found guilty of breaking his own Covid-19 laws by attending a gathering to celebrate his birthday at a time when such events were banned, has dogged Johnson since the news broke late last year.\n\nA controversial rise\n\nWith the possible exception of his hero, Winston Churchill, Johnson was perhaps the most famous politician to enter Downing Street as Prime Minister, having forged a successful career as a journalist, novelist, TV personality and London mayor in the preceding decades.\n\nHe was a populist before populists really existed. His controversial comments – comparing Muslim women who wear face coverings to letterboxes, or calling gay men “bum boys” to name but two – appalled many. But he got away with his Lothario image, the public seemingly happy to accept his alleged affairs and love child. It seemed that Johnson could essentially laugh his way through any problem.\n\nYet, for all his ambition and charisma, the job of Prime Minister seemed out of reach for most of his adult life. Those who know Johnson personally say that he loathed the fact that many in the British Conservative elite saw him as a useful campaigning tool but more of a comedian cheerleader than a serious statesman.\n\nBoris Johnson waves from the steps of No. 10 Downing Street after giving a statement in London in July 2019.

Alberto Pezzali/AP Prev Next\n\nEven during his time as Mayor of London, winning two terms in a city that traditionally doesn’t vote Conservative, the most memorable moments of his time in office are images such as him inelegantly dangling from a zip wire or forcefully rugby tackling a 10-year-old child while on a trade visit to Tokyo. He just wasn’t considered serious enough for the top job.\n\nThen Brexit happened. Johnson led the successful campaign that defied the odds and saw the UK vote by a narrow majority to leave the European Union in 2016.\n\nOvernight, he went from being a man who seemed to have made a fatal political error by backing the wrong horse in the referendum, to the figurehead of a mass rebellion that had just overrun the entire British establishment.\n\nGuerilla journalism\n\nOn paper, Johnson was an unlikely candidate to become the voice of those who felt themselves to be voiceless. Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson was born in New York City in 1964 to an internationalist family. As a boy, Johnson would tell friends and relatives that he wanted to be “world king” when fully grown, his sister wrote in a family biography.\n\nHe was educated at Eton College, the most exclusive private school in the UK, alma mater of 20 Prime Ministers, followed by the University of Oxford. While at Oxford, he was a member of the notorious Bullingdon Club: An elite all-male group for wealthy students, famed for ostentatious (and sometimes rowdy) displays of wealth such as vandalizing restaurants, then paying for the damage on the spot in cash. Johnson was never proven to have been personally involved in any such activity.\n\nJohnson worked as a journalist for establishment newspapers, most notably The Daily Telegraph, which made him its Brussels correspondent in 1989. It was here in Belgium that Johnson began writing what would become the most important chapter of his life story: Brexit.\n\nBoris Johnson speaks at a Brexit press conference in London in November 2019. Chris J Ratcliffe/Getty Images\n\nAlthough the Telegraph was firmly Euroskeptic, the UK’s exit from the EU was not really on the cards at the time, and even English Conservatives seemed to accept this. However, they lapped up Johnson’s guerrilla journalism, which often stretched the truth of what was actually happening in Brussels.\n\nThe most famous example of this was a story by Johnson that claimed the EU was planning to ban the sale of bendy bananas. The EU repeatedly debunked that and many of the stories that Johnson published.\n\nIn 1999, Johnson was offered the editorship of The Spectator, a weekly magazine often jokingly called the “Conservative bible.” He accepted, agreeing with the owner that he would drop his by now well-known political ambitions, according to a biography by the political journalist Andrew Gimson. He kept his word for all of two years and stood to become a member of parliament in 2001.\n\nIn the years that followed, Johnson was swallowed by the conservative establishment. He carried on writing the conservative script as a journalist and building a base of loyalists both inside and outside of politics.\n\nAs Johnson’s confidence grew, he was determined to show the Conservative Party that his appeal went beyond the British right. In 2008, he was elected the Mayor of London – a liberal, cosmopolitan city that did not traditionally vote Conservative. Johnson believed that he was showing his party that he had the chops to drag them into the 21st century. The problem for Johnson was that they already had a new, young leader – his old schoolfriend and future Prime Minister, David Cameron.\n\nIt was Cameron who ultimately made Brexit possible. After winning his second general election as Conservative leader in 2015, he decided to hold the EU referendum on the understanding that Johnson would fall in line and be an asset for the “remain” campaign.\n\nInstead, in February 2016, Johnson shocked the nation by announcing on the front page of his old paper, the Telegraph, that he would defy Cameron and lead the Brexit campaign.\n\nThe rest is history. Johnson turned the establishment on its head and became the most influential politician in the UK. While he didn’t become Prime Minister immediately, he continued to build his power base, undermining then-incumbent Theresa May as she struggled with Brexit for three years.\n\nAs foreign secretary under May, he was blamed for worsening the predicament of the jailed British-Iranian mother Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe after wrongly saying in 2017 that she was in Iran teaching journalists, rather than on holiday, at the time she was detained. But his patchy record in the role did not appear to cost him much support within his party.\n\nA populist who became unpopular\n\nJohnson’s time finally came in July 2019 when he became leader of the Conservative Party, claiming around two-thirds of the membership vote. His brash style was vindicated later that year, when he silenced all of his opponents in a landslide election victory that would finally allow him to, as his own slogan boasted, “Get Brexit Done.”\n\nIt truly seemed that the stars had finally aligned for Johnson, who desperately wanted to be taken seriously. He made Brexit popular and personally dragged it across the line. He had completed his transition to the role of statesman. He had proved everyone wrong.\n\nYet, as the clock ticked down on so-called Brexit Day, January 31, 2020, a deadly virus was already causing alarm in Asia. It would soon start spreading across Europe and kick off the crisis that would remove him from office.\n\nJohnson had a mixed pandemic. He was lauded by the public for the amount of state spending unleashed to mitigate its impacts on those whose jobs and livelihoods were threatened, but panned by the more conservative elements of his party. He was accused of responding too slowly, but also for making lockdown rules so complicated even he and his team in Downing Street couldn’t follow them.\n\nThe breaking of these rules by Johnson and members of his team, the economic fallout of the pandemic leading in part to a cost-of-living crisis, his handling of the Pincher scandal and a general sense of the shine wearing off the Brexit golden boy were ultimately too much for his party. It seems its members couldn’t stand the thought of Johnson staying on and dragging the party into its grave.\n\nHis political career is a story of near-misses, sex scandals, celebrity, controversy and revolution that ended in personal tragedy. The man who only ever wanted to be taken seriously ended up, ultimately, as the joker once again.", "authors": ["Luke Mcgee"], "publish_date": "2022/07/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2022/01/31/super-bowl-odds-los-angeles-rams-cincinnati-bengals-betting-info/9283445002/", "title": "Super Bowl odds: Los Angeles Rams vs. Cincinnati Bengals betting ...", "text": "The Los Angeles Rams and Cincinnati Bengals face off in the Super Bowl on Sunday, Feb. 13.\n\nThe Rams are a 3.5-point favorite in the game, according to Tipico Sportsbook.\n\nLos Angeles is -200 on the money line in the game, which will be played at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles.\n\nCincinnati is +165.\n\nThe over/under for the game is set at 48.5 points.\n\nFollow every game: Live NFL Scores\n\nSuper Bowl 56 preview:\n\nThe Rams went 12-5 in the regular season and beat the Arizona Cardinals (34-11), Tampa Bay Buccaneers (30-27) and San Francisco 49ers (20-17) to advance to the Super Bowl as the NFC champions.\n\nThe Bengals went 10-7 in the regular season and advanced to the Super Bowl as the AFC champions with wins over the Las Vegas Raiders (26-19), Tennessee Titans (19-16) and Kansas City Chiefs (27-24 OT).\n\nMore:Super Bowl picks, predictions: Who wins Los Angeles Rams vs. Cincinnati Bengals game?\n\nMore:Super Bowl TV information: How to watch Los Angeles Rams vs. Cincinnati Bengals game\n\nThe teams did not face off in the regular season.\n\nThe Super Bowl is scheduled to kick off at 4:30 p.m. MST and can be seen on NBC with Al Michaels and Cris Collinsworth in the broadcast booth.\n\nMore:Super Bowl MVP odds: Rams' Matthew Stafford, Bengals' Joe Burrow favored to win award\n\nGannett may earn revenue from Tipico for audience referrals to betting services.

For all their star power, they've now survived two straight playoff wins by the skin of their teeth, and you might say that about the Bengals, too, except the Rams were literally built to win it all. They are the win-now team, assembled with one big-name veteran after another. Cincy feels like the right call, with all their fun-loving, expectation-shattering youth. But Aaron Donald and the Rams' defensive front is a different animal, and we saw in Tennessee what can happen when Joe Burrow's blocking is up against real pressure. If Sean McVay can actually put a game plan together, L.A. should be able to do quite a bit more than it did against the 49ers, and that spells a big-play win at home.\"\n\nMore:Los Angeles Rams vs. Cincinnati Bengals pick, prediction: Who wins Super Bowl 56?\n\nSporting News: Rams 27, Bengals 24\n\nBill Bender writes: \"The recipe for success on both sides is a familiar one, but the result will still come down to the No. 1 picks. It took Stafford 13 years to get to this stage. Burrow is there in his second season. Which quarterback will be more composed on that stage? It is a true toss-up. Burrow has shown the same cool that made him a national champion at LSU. He will make big plays despite the Rams' furious pass rush. Cincinnati will lead at halftime, but Los Angeles will rally behind Stafford, with Kupp and Beckham catching second-half touchdowns. A late TD by the Bengals will cut the lead to three, but Los Angeles will hold on for its first Super Bowl victory in 22 seasons.\"\n\nSporting News: Bengals 30, Rams 27\n\nVinnie Iyer writes: \"Although it would a nice story for Stafford to win a Super Bowl right after his 34th birthday in his first season with the Rams after all those fruitless years with the Lions, the NFL is a league tilting toward the AFC's young guns with the sun setting for the GOAT now in the NFC, Tom Brady. Mahomes has a ring. Josh Allen and Justin Herbert might get into the mix very soon. Burrow, only two years removed from his Heisman and national title turn at LSU, has the old-school cool swagger tied to Super Bowl Joes of the past (Namath, Montana). At 25, he looks like he's been in the league for a long time. The Rams have a solid defense, but they have enough holes to exploit for Burrow to outduel Stafford, setting up McPherson for the game-winner late (again).\"\n\nMore:Super Bowl odds: Los Angeles Rams vs. Cincinnati Bengals point spread, money lines, total\n\nFox Sports: Rams will beat Bengals to win Super Bowl\n\nGeoff Schwartz writes: \"The Bengals have been able to force turnovers this postseason, and we know Stafford has issues with giving the ball away.

Maybe it’s a mistake after picking against the Bengals for weeks now, but my mind will not allow me to pick a team with an offensive line I do not trust in a Super Bowl. The Rams will win this game in the trenches, and Stafford will do just enough to help L.A. claim the Lombardi Trophy.\"\n\nBleacher Report: Rams 20, Bengals 17\n\nMichelle Burton writes: \"Cincinnati's offensive line, meanwhile, was one of the league's worst when it comes to protecting the quarterback. The Bengals gave up 55 sacks in the 2021 season, third-most in the NFL, and Burrow was sacked 51 times.

For instance, just consider the Oakland Raiders' 2019 draft, which featured the promise of three first-round players: DE Clelin Ferrell, RB Josh Jacobs and S Johnathan Abram. At that point in time, it was hoped the trio would spark a franchise revival.\n\nIn the years since, the Raiders got incrementally better, moved to Las Vegas (site of this year's draft) and just made the playoffs for the first time since 2016. Alas, Ferrell and Abram contributed little to that effort. And though Jacobs made the Pro Bowl in 2020 and has been an effective player overall, he's often banged up, and his production has steadily declined – he rushed for a career-low 58.1 yards per game in 2021. Now under new management, the Raiders declined the fifth-year contract options for all three players.\n\nBack in 2019, I graded that draft a \"B\" – fourth-round DE Maxx Crosby and fifth-round WR Hunter Renfrow turned out to be the keepers – giving it a bump because the team used its Round 3 selection to trade for All-Pro WR Antonio Brown.\n\nMore succinctly said, it's a very apt example of the folly of grading a draft in its immediate aftermath.\n\nFollow every game: Live NFL Scores\n\nBut first impressions are what they are – we'll call them grades if we must – and who am I to not give the people what they want? (However, let's strive to pull back for a big-picture look at each club's draft rather than judging them in a vacuum that doesn't include trades and other considerations that more accurately frame each haul.)\n\nSo, with that in mind, here are your ridiculously premature 2022 NFL draft grades, with team classes ranked from best to worst:\n\nBEST UNDRAFTED PLAYERS:Who were top players who didn't hear their names called?\n\nNFL DRAFT WINNERS, LOSERS:Bears, Patriots take puzzling paths on Day 2\n\nMORE:The NFL draft's top QBs endured a steep slide – here's what's next for them\n\nNew York Jets\n\nIt may seem easy or even lazy to praise the team that had three-first round selections, and that's partially attributable to the Jets being a bad club in 2021. But it goes deeper than that. GM Joe Douglas fully reaped the rewards this year of offloading S Jamal Adams and QB Sam Darnold – players he didn't draft – which is really why the Jets had so much draft capital at their disposal. And it sure appeared that Douglas leveraged it wisely. CB Ahmad \"Sauce\" Gardner (No. 4 overall), WR Garrett Wilson (No. 10) and RB Breece Hall (No. 36) were each arguably the best players at their respective positions this year. And by trading back into the first round at No. 26 for Florida State pass rusher Jermaine Johnson II, Douglas might have scored one of the great value selections given Johnson was regarded as a top-10 pick in some circles. If the Jets are ever going to get off the tarmac, Douglas' past two drafts will almost certainly be the primary reasons why. Grade: A+\n\nLos Angeles Rams\n\n(Expletive) them picks. They traded a future one to Cleveland to reacquire Troy Hill, who'd distinguished himself in the slot for the Rams before getting paid by the Browns last year. Wisconsin G Logan Bruss arrived courtesy a compensatory Round 3 slot and could take over the job vacated when Austin Corbett signed with Carolina. But the Rams didn't have their first-, second- or organic third-round pick because they wanted QB Matthew Stafford and since departed OLB Von Miller instead. We'd say winning their first Super Bowl while based in Los Angeles with those guys – and Stafford has since been extended – was worth the price. Grade: A\n\nDetroit Lions\n\nOn the flip side of the Stafford coin, coach Dan Campbell and GM Brad Holmes seem to be putting the draft capital obtained from the Rams to good use as the Motown rebuild rolls on. Probably a gift that Michigan DE Aidan Hutchinson, arguably this year's best incoming player, \"fell\" to Detroit at No. 2 before Holmes and Campbell vaulted up 20 spots from No. 32 in order to get highly touted Alabama WR Jameson Williams. And with two first-rounders at the ready for 2023, probably smart the Lions didn't roll the dice on one of this year's quarterbacks – opting instead on Day 2 for Kentucky DE Joshua Paschal and Illinois S Kerby Joseph, players who can contribute immediately. Grade: A\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles\n\nGM Howie Roseman, as he loves to do, continuously worked the board – really over the last year – and winds up with beaucoup assets for the present and future. The trade for Titans WR A.J. Brown should continue to facilitate the development of QB Jalen Hurts. Talented second-round C Cam Jurgens should take over for Jason Kelce in 2023. And a 10th-ranked defense gets elevated by Georgia Bulldogs stars Jordan Davis (Round 1) and Nakobe Dean (Round 3). And Roseman still has two first-round chips for next year and an extra second in 2024 in case things go awry with Hurts ... or not. Grade: A\n\nBaltimore Ravens\n\nTheir first selection was spent on Notre Dame's multi-talented Kyle Hamilton, who might have been a top-five pick if he didn't play safety. GM Eric DeCosta followed that up with a stunning trade of WR Marquise Brown, one that brought another first-rounder back to Baltimore and was ultimately used on highly regarded C Tyler Linderbaum. Third-round DL Travis Jones could be a steal. Then a team crippled by injuries last season reloaded with scads of quality depth in the middle rounds. But you really had to like the fit of second-round pass rusher David Ojabo, who only fell that far because of an Achilles injury suffered at Michigan's pro day. Prior to that, Ojabo blossomed into a star in 2021 under the tutelage of defensive coordinator Mike Macdonald, who returned to Baltimore this offseason to assume the same job. Who better than Macdonald to optimize a somewhat raw – but Round 1-caliber – talent like Ojabo once he's ready to play again? Grade: A\n\nBuffalo Bills\n\nA team that may enter the 2022 season as the prohibitive AFC favorites didn't necessarily have a lot of needs but came away with really good players who should pay immediate dividends. First-round CB Kaiir Elam has ideal physical traits (size, speed) for the position, and his presence could ease any pressure on Pro Bowler Tre'Davious White to return too quickly amid his recovery from an ACL tear. Second-round RB James Cook will bring needed juice to the ground game and maybe reduce some of that load on QB Josh Allen. Even fifth-round WR Khalil Shakir might soften the departure of slot WR Cole Beasley. The Round 6 choice spent on Matt \"Punt God\" Araiza, whose booming leg will cut through those Lake Erie winds, was the cherry on top. Grade: A\n\nDenver Broncos\n\nThey might've drafted only one impact player, second-round pass rusher Nik Bonitto arriving after giving the Oklahoma Sooners 16 sacks over the past two seasons. You don't need to be Miller, Nik, just do your thing. But this draft (and next year's) was effectively swapped for QB Russell Wilson, who should finally resolve a position that's been a dumpster fire since Peyton Manning retired. Enough said. Grade: A\n\nLas Vegas Raiders\n\nThey needed to improve the blocking in front of QB Derek Carr and obtained Memphis G Dylan Parham in Round 3. Georgia RB Zamir \"Zeus\" White arrived in the following round and might be taking over for Jacobs in a year. And, incidentally, the Silver and Black also got the best receiver in the game – All-Pro Davante Adams – for their first- and second-rounders, and that's really what Carr and Co. care about. Grade: A-\n\nCleveland Browns\n\nMid-round DE Alex Wright (Round 3), WR David Bell (Round 3), DT Perrion Winfrey (Round 4) and K Cade York (Round 4) could all pay off right away. And don't forget they essentially surrendered a fifth-rounder to get WR Amari Cooper. But this draft and future ones will ultimately be defined by what QB Deshaun Watson, and all the baggage he comes with, provides to this franchise. Grade: A-\n\nMiami Dolphins\n\nThey had a draft-low four choices, though did pick up LB Channing Tindall (Round 3) from that championship Georgia defense. But GM Chris Grier spent this year's assets to pry WR Tyreek Hill from the Chiefs after previously ensuring he'd have a pair of first-rounders for a QB-rich 2023 draft ... just in case. Grade: A-\n\nNew York Giants\n\nRookie GM Joe Schoen, the beneficiary of the extra first-rounder obtained in predecessor Dave Gettleman's final draft, appeared to put his first one pretty much in the fairway. No guarantee QB Daniel Jones returns in 2023, but Schoen set him up to succeed in 2022 with the selection of first-round OT Evan Neal, productive second-round WR Wan'Dale Robinson and G Joshua Ezeudu. Defensive holes were also addressed with slot corner Cordale Flott in Round 3, S Dane Belton in Round 4 and LB Micah McFadden in Round 5. But No. 5 overall pick Kayvon Thibodeaux, Oregon's massively talented pass rusher, is on top of the marquee – which is exactly where he wants to be. If he turns out to be a Broadway success story, Big Blue could be back soon. Grade: A-\n\nHouston Texans\n\nLSU CB Derek Stingley Jr. (No. 3 overall pick), Texas A&M OL Kenyon Green (15th overall), Baylor S Jalen Pitre (Round 2), Alabama WR John Metchie III (Round 2), Alabama LB Christian Harris (Round 3) and Florida RB Dameon Pierce (Round 4) could all be opening-day starters for an organization that markedly improved its roster's nucleus. If his injury issues are behind him, Stingley might emerge as this draft's best player. It's all couched by the fact Houston is (and will be in the future) using assets obtained in the trade of Watson, but GM Nick Caserio had no choice but to move on. Grade: B+\n\nWashington Commanders\n\nTheir first draft as the rechristened Commanders didn't start out well given that panicky trade for QB Carson Wentz cost them their third-rounder and probably a future second. But they recovered, recouping some capital before spending that first selection on Penn State WR Jahan Dotson, who should be quite a help to Wentz and maybe the special teams, too. Washington also got its annual complement of Alabama studs (DT Phidarian Mathis, RB Brian Robinson). But fifth-round QB Sam Howell could be the story here. He was taken late enough that he shouldn't pose an immediate threat to Wentz, yet Howell might also provide Day 3 Kirk Cousins-level returns down the road if circumstances force him into the lineup. Grade: B+\n\nLos Angeles Chargers\n\nFirst-round OL Zion Johnson will improve the care of QB Justin Herbert, just as fourth-round RB Isaiah Spiller will help take care of Austin Ekeler. But the big win could be getting OLB Khalil Mack, assuming he's healthy, for a second-rounder. Grade: B\n\nKansas City Chiefs\n\nThey got a heavy return from Miami in the Tyreek Hill blockbuster – and the Cheetah had backed them into a financial corner – but QB Patrick Mahomes no longer has his most dangerous weapon. Yet interestingly, the perennial AFC West champs emphasized the other side of the ball with their acquired selections, five of their first six picks – including Round 1 CB Trent McDuffie and DE George Karlaftis – spent on a defense that will soon be facing far more formidable offenses in the AFC West. Second-round WR Skyy Moore should be a productive player straight away ... but, again, no Tyreek Hill here. Less is more? More is less? If the Chiefs are lucky, more will mean more. Grade: B\n\nNew Orleans Saints\n\nIn a post-Brees, post-Payton world, you have to admire their chutzpah, going all in to stock this depth chart while sacrificing a 2023 first-rounder and 2024 second-rounder to Philly. GM Mickey Loomis targeted two premier positions in Round 1, getting Trevor Penning to replace departed LT Terron Armstead after drafting Ohio State WR Chris Olave – who just might have the goods to take this offense to another level. Maybe this draft doesn't end up aging well ... or maybe it positions the Saints to reclaim the NFC South crown they wore for so long. Grade: B\n\nTennessee Titans\n\nA lot to unpack here. Dealing Pro Bowl WR A.J. Brown and trading up for Liberty QB Malik Willis strongly suggests this is a franchise trying to navigate a transition without descending into a rebuild. (And don't be surprised if fourth-round RB Hassan Haskins inherits Derrick Henry's job one day.) The AFC South champs will still run it back with Henry, QB Ryan Tannehill and Co. in 2022 – their ranks augmented by first-round WR Treylon Burks and second-round CB Roger McCreary – but also definitely the potential things get ... awkward? Grade: B\n\nJacksonville Jaguars\n\nRoll of the dice with the No. 1 pick, and the Jags opted for DE Travon Walker's potential ahead of Hutchinson's production. Time will tell. But you had to like GM Trent Baalke coming back into the bottom of Round 1 to snag LB Devin Lloyd 27th overall. He and QB Trevor Lawrence could/should lead this franchise for the next decade-plus. Third-rounders Luke Fortner and Chad Muma are, at center and linebacker, respectively, both immediate starters. Grade: B\n\nMinnesota Vikings\n\nNew GM Kwesi Adofo-Mensah's first draft was short on sex appeal but arguably just what the Vikes needed. Perfectly content to swing trades with the division rival Packers and Lions, Adofo-Mensah worked the board on the way to adding S Lewis Cine, CB Andrew Booth, G Ed Ingram and LB Brian Asamoah in the first 66 picks. All project as opening-day starters, especially important for a Minnesota defense that consistently betrayed this offense in recent seasons. Grade: B\n\nCincinnati Bengals\n\nThey so thoroughly revamped their offensive line during free agency, the Bengals didn't draft a blocker (Cordell Volson) until Round 4. First-round DB Daxton Hill is a versatile player who should contribute early and might replace FS Jessie Bates III in a year if the franchise-tagged standout doesn't get extended. Yet you wonder if the AFC champs, who admittedly didn't have any needs in their starting lineup, should've spun some of those picks forward into 2023. Grade: B\n\nPittsburgh Steelers\n\nA franchise that knows how to mine receiving diamonds might have found two more gems in second-rounder George Pickens and fourth-rounder Calvin Austin III. Round 3 D-lineman DeMarvin Leal could reach his vast potential amid the Steel City culture. And how about taking All-Pro DL Cam Heyward's brother, Connor (a Michigan State tight end/H-back) in the sixth? However, going back to the domestic angle, this crop will be defined by the selection of Pitt QB Kenny Pickett. The Steelers could have had any passer in this draft – any two as it turned out – as they tried to move on from retired Ben Roethlisberger. But they went with the guy who was already in their building, a football training facility shared with the Pittsburgh Panthers, and coach Mike Tomlin already believes Pickett could be his Week 1 starter despite the presence of newly signed Mitchell Trubisky. Skeptics could say Pickett, who turns 24 in June, is close to maxing out his ability and might not be much more than a lateral move from Trubisky, especially given the tantalizing potential that was available with Liberty's Malik Willis. Clearly Tomlin and retiring GM Kevin Colbert are banking on much more. Grade: B\n\nIndianapolis Colts\n\nGood odds GM Chris Ballard found four starters on Day 2, when he picked WR Alec Pierce in the second round and TE Jelani Woods, LT Bernhard Raimann and S Nick Cross in the third. Of course, any enthusiasm must be somewhat tempered by the loss of Indy's first-round pick amid the failed Wentz experiment. Still, given the path the Titans took this weekend, the Colts may have closed the gap in the AFC South. Grade: B-\n\nSan Francisco 49ers\n\nSecond-round USC edge rusher Drake Jackson is the headline player and should bolster the depth the Niners like to feature on their defensive line. Perhaps the real headline is that Niners brass didn't cave to All-Pro WR Deebo Samuel's trade request – not yet anyway – and it now appears there's time to salvage the relationship with a player who's certainly critical to the development of young QB Trey Lance. But this is one of those drafts that's hard to assess holistically given the first-round pick (along with next year's) was spent on last year's investment for Lance with the No. 3 overall selection. Probably gonna be at least a few seasons before anyone knows if he makes this all worth it. Grade: B-\n\nGreen Bay Packers\n\nThis is an eye of the beholder situation. Hard to spin the loss of Adams as any sort of positive, especially when the Pack weren't in position in Round 1 to get an approximate replacement from a talent perspective. GM Brian Gutekunst got aggressive in Round 2, dealing up for North Dakota State WR Christian Watson – though it remains to be seen how quickly he'll earn QB Aaron Rodgers' trust. Yet it's also fair to posit the Packers had gone as far as they could with the Rodgers-Adams connection, and their Super Bowl aspirations are better served by loading up the defense with stars from Georgia's defense like first-rounders Quay Walker and Devonte Wyatt. Third-round OL Sean Rhyan could also fortify the protection of Rodgers. So maybe Green Bay got better ... but probably not. Grade: C+\n\nSeattle Seahawks\n\nThe trade of Wilson and release of LB Bobby Wagner signaled a new (throwback?) era in the Emerald City. Coach Pete Carroll and GM John Schneider went to work investing in assets Wilson might have liked – a pair of young tackles, Charles Cross (Round 1) and Abraham Lucas (Round 3) – plus potential building blocks for the next iteration of the Legion of Boom in promising pass rusher Boye Mafe (Round 2) and underrated CB Coby Bryant (Round 4). Second-round RB Kenneth Walker III could eventually define this ground attack similar to the way Marshawn Lynch once did. But it's really tough to grade this haul given the loss of Wilson is attached to it, and it will be another year before the Seahawks use the other first- and second-rounder obtained in the package for the best passer in franchise history. ( And how far are Drew Lock and/or Geno Smith taking you?) Then there's the 2020 trade for Jamal Adams, one that cost two first-round picks (including this year's) and his massive extension – a decision that perspective has been unkind to. Seattle fans should be enthused about this year's incoming players, but they'll miss the former ones ... and those they would have welcomed if not for the Adams freight. Grade: C\n\nCarolina Panthers\n\nGetting N.C. State's Ickey Ekwonu at No. 6 could prove larcenous, particularly for a team that desperately needed a left tackle. GM Scott Fitterer and coach Matt Rhule also maneuvered back into Round 3 for Ole Miss QB Matt Corral. But they probably wish they hadn't spent their original second-rounder on Darnold nor their third on CB C.J. Henderson. And though this franchise has desperately pursued solutions under center, Corral is another significant gamble ... one from which Rhule may not recover. Grade: C\n\nAtlanta Falcons\n\nConsidering how important this draft likely is to their anticipated resurrection – including less-than-face-value picks they got for WR Julio Jones (2nd) and QB Matt Ryan (3rd) – the results feel a little ... meh? WR Drake London at No. 8 might be the next Mike Evans, moving the chains and terrorizing the red zone. But he's unlikely to be a game breaker, and those kind of receivers seemed to be on the table. And there simply appear to be a lot of bets on upside here with a one-year wonder like Penn State DE Arnold Ebiketie and mid-rounders lacking Power Five bona fides. One was QB Desmond Ridder. Maybe the Cincinnati star blossoms while marinating behind Marcus Mariota ... or maybe he becomes part of a roster that may still lack the foundational pieces it really needed to add. Grade: C-\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers\n\nSecond-round DL Logan Hall might energize that interior pass rush, and maybe third-round RB Rachaad White offers more than departed Ronald Jones II did behind RB1 Leonard Fournette. But all things considered, it seemed like the Bucs could've been more aggressive given they're clearly in a Super Bowl-or-bust circumstance. Grade: C-\n\nChicago Bears\n\nThe jury should be out for a while on QB Justin Fields, whose arrival in 2021 also came at the expense of this year's first-rounder. But you would've thought rookie GM Ryan Poles would have done more to find players in this draft – specifically weapons and blockers – to accelerate Fields' development. Nope. Make no mistake, second-round DBs Kyler Gordon and Jaquan Brisker are really good players ... but you wonder if that defense will be on the field a lot in 2022 considering the way things have gone for Fields. Grade: C-\n\nNew England Patriots\n\nTime was, you didn't question anything Bill Belichick did in the name of The Patriot Way. Time is ... well, BB hasn't won a playoff game for New England without Tom Brady and, even before TB12's departure, his draft record was spotty at best – especially at receiver and corner. But the Pats took speedy Baylor WR Tyquan Thornton in the second round followed by CBs Marcus Jones (Round 3) and Jack Jones (Round 4), a need clearly existing after Pro Bowler J.C. Jackson left in free agency. Beyond that, the first-round selection of Tennessee-Chattanooga OL Cole Strange – a very good player by most accounts – also seemed, well, strange ... and perhaps quite premature. A fourth-round pick was spent on record-setting Western Kentucky QB Bailey Zappe (5,967 yards and 62 TDs in 2021), whose numbers are far more impressive than his physical attributes. Marcus Jones might bear the most watching since he's an exceptional kick returner and can moonlight as a receiver – so maybe he's an optimal Patriot. Grade: D+\n\nDallas Cowboys\n\nFirst-round LT Tyler Smith was their guy ... but they probably could've gotten him later than No. 24. Second-round DE Sam Williams brings production – and a checkered past. And the middle of the defensive line still looms as a significant problem. Grade: D+\n\nArizona Cardinals\n\nMackey Award-winning TE Trey McBride (Round 2) is a sweet player, but are the Cards suddenly going base double-tight after re-signing Zach Ertz for three more years? But far more head scratching was sacrificing their first-round pick to get \"Hollywood\" Brown, a teammate of QB Kyler Murray at Oklahoma, both former Sooners heading into their fourth seasons. Brown has scary speed and maybe didn't get to showcase it enough on a Baltimore offense that wanted to run the ball. But hard to believe that GM Steve Keim didn't severely overpay – especially since he'll also presumably be on the hook for extensions for Brown and Murray any minute.

But multiple Facebook users, as well as anti-vaccine groups on Telegram, continued to spread the claim using a screenshot of the tweet.\n\nOn June 12, Inter Milan team director Giuseppe Marotta put the rumors to rest when he told Rai Sport, an Italian sports TV channel, that Eriksen \"didn't have COVID and wasn't vaccinated either.\"\n\nVAERS possibly at root of speculation\n\nSpeculation about Eriksen's collapse could be rooted in misconceptions about the Vaccine Adverse Reporting System (VAERS), a government-run database that anti-vaccine advocates regularly use to discourage vaccination.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration run VAERS as an “early warning system” to detect safety problems associated with vaccines.

His evidence: reports from VAERS.\n\n\"Thousands have died from the Covid vaccines, CDC reports.

TE Austin Hooper wasn't cheap (4 years, $44 million), but RT Jack Conklin (3 years, $42 million) was a virtual bargain by comparison given outlandish deals other blockers raked in. Case Keenum provides a capable backup plan behind starting QB Baker Mayfield and can help teach the offense after spending time with Stefanski in Minnesota. Berry added extensive depth to the defense with team-friendly deals for LB B.J. Goodson, S Karl Joseph, S Andrew Sendejo, CB Kevin Johnson and DT Andrew Billings while letting other teams overpay for departed LB Joe Schobert and DB Eric Murray. Berry should be able to solve his left tackle problem in the draft but still has the most available cap space in the league, nearly $50 million, if he wants to pursue other avenues ... say, Washington's Trent Williams.\n\nIndianapolis Colts: Three major moves, all by different means. QB Philip Rivers comes aboard for $25 million and might be closer to the 2018 version of himself while being protected by a first-rate offensive line ... which should remain so after LT Anthony Castonzo re-signed for two years. GM Chris Ballard is generally quite measured when it comes to procuring outside talent, but trading his first-round draft pick (No. 13 overall) for DT DeForest Buckner, who also received a four-year, $84 million extension, should be a tremendous boost on the field and in the locker room.\n\nNew Orleans Saints: They kept QB Drew Brees with a palatable two-year, $50 million arrangement and also re-signed DT David Onyemata and G Andrus Peat. Throw in the addition of WR Emmanuel Sanders and return of S Malcolm Jenkins, and this has to be considered a pretty sweet haul for the three-time defending divisional champs.\n\nA-\n\nArizona Cardinals: Snaring all-pro WR DeAndre Hopkins – while unloading RB David Johnson's contract in the process – goes down as the heist of 2020's free agency period ... especially since RB Kenyan Drake, who bears the transition tag, projected as the better backfield fit. On the flip side, GM Steve Keim rewarded LT D.J. Humphries ($45 million), DT Jordan Phillips ($30 million) and LB Devon Kennard ($20 million) with lucrative three-year contracts, any of which could easily prove overly generous.\n\nMinnesota Vikings: They extended QB Kirk Cousins for two more years, franchised underrated S Anthony Harris, added massive DT Michael Pierce and fleeced the Bills by getting a first-rounder and three additional mid-round picks for malcontent WR Stefon Diggs. Cornerback is suddenly a problem, but it was time to dump Xavier Rhodes ... even if it would've been nice to keep Trae Waynes or Mackensie Alexander, who both opted for Cincinnati.\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers: The stunning import of Brady energizes the previously dormant franchise and a fan base now realistically floating Super Bowl aspirations. A defense that retained DL Ndamukong Suh and pass rushers Jason Pierre-Paul and franchise-tagged sack king Shaq Barrett will benefit greatly simply because TB12 won't compromise it the way his predecessor, turnover machine Jameis Winston, did. And GM Jason Licht still has about $20 million to potentially patch holes at running back, defensive back and offensive tackle.\n\nB+\n\nAtlanta Falcons: Shrewdly aggressive. A nifty swap with Baltimore brought former first-round TE Hayden Hurst, who should capably replace Hooper. Dante Fowler could be the multi-faceted edge presence this defense has desperately sought. And switching out RB Devonta Freeman for Todd Gurley (on a $5 million deal) is a sensible gamble despite questions about Gurley's knee.\n\nBaltimore Ravens: A team that appeared Super Bowl-bound in January before getting trucked by Tennessee in the playoffs added talent, toughness and leadership to a fourth-ranked defense by trading for DL Calais Campbell, who cost a mere fifth-round pick. OLB Matt Judon, who had a career-high 9½ sacks in 2019, remains (for now) on the franchise tag. Did hurt to lose G Marshal Yanda to retirement and to have DL Michael Brockers' deal fall through.\n\nCincinnati Bengals: Let's first give them credit for stepping out of character – which has typically meant sitting on the sidelines during free agency. Cincy won't be moving a ton of jerseys with its additions – that will happen when QB Joe Burrow is drafted – but a defensed ranked 29th last season should be greatly improved with DT D.J. Reader, S Vonn Bell and former Vikes Waynes and Alexander. Reader, who commanded a hefty pact (4 years, $53 million), could be an especially astute pick-up. Franchising WR A.J. Green and cutting OT Cordy Glenn were the right calls.\n\nDallas Cowboys: Despite being active spenders, they still have about $20 million of cap room for the ongoing quest to get franchise-tagged QB Dak Prescott secured to a long-term extension. And if this offseason winds up being especially abbreviated by coronavirus, Dallas can scarcely afford for Prescott to skip any of it. Re-signing WR Amari Cooper checked off one major objective, while keeping CB Anthony Brown for three years helped blunt the loss of Byron Jones. Joe Looney remains, though will likely again struggle to spell C Travis Frederick, who surprisingly retired. The additions of veteran DTs Gerald McCoy and Dontari Poe, along with S Ha Ha Clinton-Dix's arrival, could put the Cowboys back atop the NFC East.\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles: GM Howie Roseman is always good for at least one headlining move, and this year it was the acquisition of Pro Bowl CB Darius Slay, who also netted a three-year, $50 million extension after coming over from Detroit. Throw in the cagey signing of slot man extraordinaire Nickell Robey-Coleman and return of Jalen Mills, and the Eagles look quite healthy at corner after being exposed there in 2019. Safety will be an area to watch after Roseman kept Rodney McLeod rather than Jenkins ... though the back end will generally benefit from quiet arrival of pocket crusher Javon Hargrave in the middle of the D-line. Wideout reinforcements will presumably come in the draft.\n\nSan Francisco 49ers: It's never easy trying to keep a championship-caliber nucleus together. GM John Lynch managed to re-sign breakout DL Arik Armstead and retain versatile DB Jimmie Ward. But San Francisco had to part with Sanders, a key midseason acquisition and – far more painfully – 2019 team MVP Buckner. But the former team captain did return Indianapolis' first-rounder, a key consideration for Lynch given he's not scheduled to pick in Rounds 2, 3 or 4 this year.\n\nB\n\nDenver Broncos: Some nice moves, franchising emergent S Justin Simmons, acquiring DL Jurrell Casey for a seventh-rounder and getting a good deal on RB Melvin Gordon (2 years, $16 million). Trading for CB A.J. Bouye while letting Chris Harris get away to the division-rival Chargers and signing C Graham Glasgow to replace Connor McGovern were essentially lateral moves. Getting unsigned DL Shelby Harris back would boost this grade further. Be interesting to see if GM John Elway brings in a big-name passer to challenge sophomore starter Drew Lock.\n\nLos Angeles Chargers: They've made a series of fascinating decisions. With the fairly expensive additions of veteran RT Bryan Bulaga, CB Chris Harris and DT Linval Joseph on top of the trade for Pro Bowl G Trai Turner, the four-year extension given to RB Austin Ekeler and franchise tag applied to TE Hunter Henry – well, you'd think this team was going Super Bowl or bust for Rivers. Except, of course, he's gone ... and the Chargers appear content to roll with last year's backup, Tyrod Taylor, before likely drafting a new quarterback with the No. 6 pick. Overall, compelling if slightly mystifying ... and Rivers' play with the Colts will certainly influence how this gambit is ultimately judged.\n\nNew York Jets: GM Joe Douglas has been on the job for nearly a year, but this was his first stab at free agency – and he practiced restraint, a trait rarely used by his predecessors. Knowing this team wasn't a player or two away from the AFC East throne, Douglas either re-signed (OLB Jordan Jenkins, G Alex Lewis, CB Brian Poole) or added (CB Pierre Desir, OT George Fant, McGovern, ILB Patrick Onwuasor, WR Breshad Perriman, G Greg Van Roten) mid-tier veterans. He also cut bait on CB Trumaine Johnson, an albatross left over from previous GM Mike Maccagnan. Losing WR Robby Anderson didn't help, but it was telling how slowly his market developed. Oh, and Douglas still has more than $30 million in the bank – in case he opts to pursue a stud like unsigned DE Jadeveon Clowney – and now has the flexibility to focus on quality players rather than filling needs at draft time.\n\nTennessee Titans: They bailed on the Brady sweepstakes, opting to re-up QB Ryan Tannehill before the legal tampering window opened March 16. GM Jon Robinson then franchised RB Derrick Henry, though the 2019 rushing leader surely wants an extension more than a $10.3 million tag. Otherwise? Given Robinson still has about $25 million at his fingertips, hard to figure why he gave OT Dennis Kelly a three-year, $21 million deal after letting Conklin leave for Cleveland (3 years, $42 million) – though the numbers square given Kelly is no more than half the player Conklin is. Casey was offloaded, though OLB Vic Beasley ($9.5 million deal for 2020) might be a worthy gamble if coach Mike Vrabel can harness the ability that once allowed the former Falcons first-round pick, still only 27, to lead the league in sacks.\n\nB-\n\nCarolina Panthers: A quarterback room of Teddy Bridgewater and XFL star P.J. Walker feels more appropriate for a rebuilding team than departed Kyle Allen and former MVP and face of the franchise Cam Newton. Adding deep threat Anderson on a bargain two-year, $20 million deal should expand the offense, though now-traded Turner has been far more reliable than new LT Russell Okung.\n\nKansas City Chiefs: Not much to see here. DT Chris Jones was given the franchise tag, allowing the champs to keep their most important free agent. DB Kendall Fuller went back to Washington while several bottom-of-the-roster players were re-signed. But with virtually no cap room, K.C. will be challenged to lock Patrick Mahomes into an extension – one that will doubtless reset the quarterback market – any time soon.\n\nPittsburgh Steelers: They didn't have a whole lot of flexibility after tagging OLB Bud Dupree, yet still managed to reel in nice pieces in veteran TE Eric Ebron and OL Stefen Wisniewski. Signing FB Derek Watt to play with brother T.J. was a nice touch. Hargrave will be missed.\n\nC+\n\nGreen Bay Packers: They've been as quiet as anybody, giving two-year deals to LB Christian Kirksey and RT Rick Wagner while cutting ties – probably wisely – with Bulaga, TE Jimmy Graham and LBs Blake Martinez and Kyler Fackrell. Sometimes, less is more in the often hazardous free agency game.\n\nC\n\nDetroit Lions: The Motown Pats scooped up former New England defenders Danny Shelton, Duron Harmon and Jamie Collins, the latter two having previously played for coach Matt Patricia in Foxborough. Newly signed CB Desmond Trufant should capably replace Slay, who couldn't wait to ditch Patricia but brought back a third- and fifth-rounder from Philly. Best move – backup QB Chase Daniel's arrival to a team that went 0-8 without Matthew Stafford in 2019. Most questionable move – OT Halapoulivaati Vaitai, who agreed to a five-year, $45 million windfall despite starting just 20 games for the Eagles.\n\nLos Angeles Rams: Constricted by their cap, they were forced to jettison Gurley, Robey-Coleman and LB Clay Matthews, and GM Les Snead couldn't keep defensive mainstays like Fowler or LB Cory Littleton. Frankly, the Rams did well to add DT A'Shawn Robinson and OLB Leonard Floyd while re-signing LT Andrew Whitworth and G Austin Blythe. Another gift materialized when Brockers' deal with Baltimore disintegrated over concerns about his ankle. The veteran is now returning to the Rams, part of what should be a stout front with Aaron Donald and Robinson. Expect more maneuverings from a team suddenly trying to keep pace in the NFC West a year after losing the Super Bowl.\n\nNew York Giants: No major splashes as rookie coach Joe Judge tries to settle in. Martinez and CB James Bradberry agreed to three-year pacts averaging more than eight figures, while DL Leonard Williams was given the franchise tag. Otherwise, it's been a slew of lower-profile veterans, including former Patriots Dion Lewis and Nate Ebner, who should theoretically help Judge implement his program.\n\nWashington Redskins: Led by coach Ron Rivera, the new regime has been thrifty, a contrast for an organization that typically spends freely. The biggest moves were the franchising of G Brandon Scherff, and four-year deal extended to lure Fuller from Kansas City back to the club that drafted him in 2016. Rivera also imported a pair of his former Panthers, LB Thomas Davis and Allen. However getting a fifth-round pick in exchange for quality (if disgruntled) CB Quinton Dunbar seemed insufficient, and there really needs to be a resolution in what feels like an open-ended war with Trent Williams.\n\nC-\n\nLas Vegas Raiders: GM Mike Mayock has been busy, issuing three-year contracts to lesser known defenders Littleton, DE Carl Nassib and LB Nick Kwiatkoski. Mayock also took fliers on former first-rounders he studied closely while at NFL Network, including QB Marcus Mariota, WR Nelson Agholor and CB Eli Apple. Two past-their-prime Cowboys – TE Jason Witten and S Jeff Heath – will join former Dallas DT Maliek Collins as part of the Sin City reboot. Feels \"meh\" at best as the linebacker corps gets new bodies but the receiving group does not. Mayock may be trending toward being much better at evaluating college players than guys who have been in the league for a while.\n\nMiami Dolphins: Entering free agency with nearly $90 million available to burn, the Fins were aggressive ... but it remains to be seen if they were wise. GM Chris Grier and coach Brian Flores earmarked a lot of dollars in a bid to apparently become Patriots South (Beach), recruiting LBs Kyle Van Noy and Elandon Roberts and C Ted Karras from New England. Former Cowboy Byron Jones landed a five-year, $82.5 million contract, making him the game's highest-paid cornerback and giving Miami a very expensive secondary after Xavien Howard was paid handsomely a year ago. RB Jordan Howard should greatly help the league's worst run game in 2019. However did Grier overcompensate OL Ereck Flowers (3 years, $30 million), DL Shaq Lawson (3 years, $30 million), and DE Emmanuel Ogbah (2 years, $15 million)? Stay tuned.\n\nD+\n\nBuffalo Bills: They made some moves in line with their disciplined approach from recent offseasons, extending underrated S Jordan Poyer through 2022, adding LB A.J. Klein, signing fading veteran CB Josh Norman to a reasonable deal ($6 million in 2020) and loading the D-line with depth (Mario Addison, Vernon Butler and Quinton Jefferson). But why did a club that owned the No. 22 pick in a receiver-rich draft surrender it and three mid-rounders for Diggs, a moody player who's never been to the Pro Bowl and could disrupt a locker room that boasts carefully crafted chemistry? Seems like a highly questionable risk.\n\nD\n\nJacksonville Jaguars: They were nicely compensated by getting fourth-round picks back for QB Nick Foles and Bouye while offloading two massive contracts. But why give up Campbell for a song (fifth-rounder) and then invest a double album into Schobert (5 years, $53.75 million). Also headed to Duval County are DL Rodney Gunter and oft-injured TE Tyler Eifert, neither likely to make a huge difference ... but more so than CB Darqueze Dennard, whose agreement to sign fell through Thursday. Yannick Ngakoue got nailed with the franchise tag, but the unhappy pass rusher could still be dealt.\n\nD-\n\nChicago Bears: After watching QB Mitchell Trubisky regress in 2019, they could have reasonably gotten Newton, Winston or Andy Dalton to push their incumbent. Instead, GM Ryan Pace overpaid for Foles ... after giving pass rusher Robert Quinn, who will be 30 in May, a five-year, $70 million payday and inexplicably presenting the fading Graham a two-year pact for $16 million. Seemed like quite a Hail Mary from Pace, who doesn't own a Round 1 selection as he continues paying off the Khalil Mack trade.\n\nF\n\nHouston Texans: Sigh. Newly anointed GM Bill O'Brien's decision to trade Hopkins wouldn't have been unconscionable if he'd gotten (far) more than Johnson and a second-rounder from Arizona. Alas. Elsewhere, O'Brien probably forked over too much to DBs Murray (3 years, $20.25 million), who has one interception and 15 starts in four seasons, and Bradley Roby (3 years, $36 million). Ka'imi Fairbairn also became the league's third-highest paid kicker in terms of average annual salary ($4.4 million). Reader, 25, a rising player, was lost to Cincinnati of all teams. Adding WR Randall Cobb hardly compensates.\n\nNew England Patriots: Even after inexplicably divorcing themselves from the greatest player in NFL history, they're essentially out of cap space – Brady's exodus a major reason the team is carrying $26 million in dead money – and are apparently hoping QB Jarrett Stidham (or Brian Hoyer) can take over. Even the decision to franchise G Joe Thuney, now poised to make left tackle money in 2020, was a head scratcher. Nice to keep pillars like Devin McCourty and Matthew Slater, but the league's No. 1 defense in 2019 lost quite a few key performers, notably Van Noy, Collins and Harmon. Maybe this will serve as the prime example of Bill Belichick displaying he's smarter than the rest of the league – he'll doubtless be making subsequent transactios – otherwise, the charted course is tantamount to dynasty-demolishing hubris.\n\nI (incomplete)\n\nSeattle Seahawks: Until the Clowney situation resolves – he's expressed a desire to remain in the Pacific Northwest – too hard to pin down this grade. The trade for Dunbar, additions of TE Greg Olsen and WR Phillip Dorsett, re-signing of DT Jarran Reed and return of LB Bruce Irvin feel \"B\"-worthy in a vacuum. But the Clowney verdict could range this anywhere from A- to C-.\n\n***\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.

He’s going to deal with some personal things.\n\n“This is something we talked about before training camp started. We allotted this time because he wanted to get in and get chemistry with the guys and go through two weeks of training camp.\n\n“Knowing he wasn’t going to play the first two games, he didn’t want to take away reps from Blaine (Gabbert) and Kyle (Trask), as well as (Ryan Griffin), as far as going into these next two games.”\n\nBrady talks with coach Clyde Christensen. Chris O'Meara/AP\n\nBowles didn’t elaborate on the reason for Brady’s absence, but said it was a plan that had been in place from before training camp began and remained confident that Brady would be back for the team’s season-opening Week 1 clash against the Dallas Cowboys.\n\n“Obviously, there’s always going to be doubt,” Bowles said, “but I have a pretty high level of confidence, yes.”\n\nBucs linebacker Devin White said Brady had his team’s full support and understanding.\n\n“He’s a grown man – (more grown) than most of us in the locker room, and he’s a human at the end of the day,” White said. “He’s got personal problems going on, but he’s a guy that’s been doing this so long, he (doesn’t) need to be here.\n\n“If he’s not here, we know that he’s still working. He has a great supporting cast around him and he’s going to get his work in whether he’s here or not here, so when he comes back, he’ll never miss a beat and that’s the only important thing.\n\n“But more than football, we’re praying for whatever he’s got going on as a human being and we hope everyone else does too and that’s all we ask for him – his well-being. Football comes second, him being a human comes first.”\n\nSince joining the Bucs in 2020 from the New England Patriots, Brady has helped to dramatically improve the team’s success.\n\nBrady during the Bucs training camp.

When they launched the tour that brings them to Coachella in late March, the critic at Miami New Times summed up just how big a deal a pilgrimage to Indio to see them headlining Coachella is for countless music nerds: “Nearly a quarter-century after the release of its debut album and exactly 20 years out from its international breakthrough with ‘OK Computer,’ this is a band with nothing left to prove and no one to impress. Any one of its most lauded albums — ‘OK Computer,’ ‘Kid A,’ ‘In Rainbows’ — could have earned the group a spot on modern music's Mount Rushmore, and Radiohead is widely regarded as one of the best live bands in the world.” And as I wrote when last they made a stop here in the Valley (in 2012), “Veteran acts as ambitious as Radiohead aren't often found selling out venues the size of a Jobing.com Arena. And the fact that they continue to connect on such a massive scale without the slightest hint of compromise just makes it even more impressive.” (10:35 p.m. Coachella stage)\n\nSATURDAY HEADLINER: Lady Gaga\n\nHow do you solve a problem like Beyonce’s doctors realizing a woman having twins should not be headlining a major music festival? This is as good a fix as any, I suppose, although Rihanna may have spoken more to the Beyonce demographic. There aren't many artists alive who do high-concept pop-music spectacle better than Gaga. Among the more successful pop stars of the century, her hits include the multi-platinum smashes \"Just Dance,\" \"Poker Face,\" \"Paparazzi,\" \"Bad Romance,\" \"Born This Way,” “Edge of Glory,” \"You and I” and “Applause.” There’s also “Telephone,” a triple-platinum Top 5 hit that found her joining forces with the woman she’s replacing at Coachella. And she killed it at the Super Bowl in early February. As I noted at the time, the stage design was as extravagant as you'd expect, its futuristic look a perfect fit for the Bowiesque costume she wore at the top of her set before changing into something far more football-centric, with shimmering shoulder pads. The production was brilliantly choreographed, complete with mid-air acrobatics, and it definitely lived up to the promise of a huge pop spectacle, complete with a sky full of drones to create the illusion of a starry night. (11:20 p.m. Coachella Stage)\n\nSUNDAY HEADLINER: Kendrick Lamar\n\nAfter building a buzz on the strength of 2011's \"Section.80,\" the Compton rapper broke through in a big way with the platinum \"good kid, m.A.A.d city.\" The most acclaimed rap album of 2012, it sent \"Swimming Pools (Drank)\" to No. 1 on Billboard's rap chart, following through with two more major hits, \"Poetic Justice\" and \"Bitch, Don't Kill My Vibe.\" He won his first two Grammys for “i,” the lead single from the most acclaimed release of 2015, “To Pimp a Butterfly” (which then went on to win a best rap album Grammy). A collection of demos from “Butterfly,” “untitled, unmastered,” topped the charts in 2016, the same year Lamar made Time magazine’s list of the 100 most influential people in the world, alongside Caitlyn Jenner, Lin-Manuel Miranda and Aziz Ansari. It would be wrong to not include one other point of interest from 2016. Asked who he believe to be the better rapper, Lamar or Drake, no lesser an authority than President Barack Obama chose Lamar. So, how is he live? He was great when he headlined the Pot of Gold Music Festival at Tempe Beach Park two before “To Pimp a Butterfly” hit the streets. More recently, the Guardian responded to a U.K. concert with: “One of the most exciting artists in the world exceeded expectations with a generous and unflagging show.” (10:25 p.m. Coachella)\n\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED STAR ATTRACTIONS\n\nYou don't want to limit yourself to just the names in big type on that poster, but you should consider these for sure.\n\nFRIDAY: Father John Misty\n\nHis darkly comic narratives, often sung in character, have marked Father John Misty as his generation’s Randy Newman – not that I see Pixar work in Misty’s future. Released a week before Coachella, “Pure Comedy” is guaranteed to figure prominently on the shortlist of the year’s most celebrated albums, a third straight triumph for the singer-songwriter. Mojo said this album lifts him “to another level altogether,” while the Skinny raved: “He embraces the role, plays up to it, uses it to bend and manipulate the parameters of modern rock music and has managed to create something bitingly acerbic and cynical, yet achingly sincere. Again.” He topped our playlist of best February singles with a track from “Pure Comedy” called “Ballad of the Dying Man,” on which he turns his darkly comic eye for detail on a self-important know-it-all who wonders on his deathbed if he’s “successfully beaten back the rising tide of idiots, dilettantes and fools on his watch.” (7:20 p.m. Coachella Stage)\n\nFRIDAY: The xx\n\nThe xx are playing Coachella in support of the recently released \"I See You,\" which includes their most successful U.S. singles, \"On Hold\" and \"Say Something Loving.\" The U.S. dates follow a historic European tour, including a record-setting, seven-night run at the O2 Academy Brixton in London, marking the longest-ever run of sold-out shows at the legendary venue, performing to 35,000 people over seven hometown performances. Long before that, they took home the Mercury Prize in 2010 for their acclaimed debut, a self-titled effort that also topped a year-end list at The Guardian. (8:50 p.m. Coachella Stage)\n\nFRIDAY: Travis Scott\n\nBest known in the mainstream for the double-platinum single “Antidote,” this Texas rapper is topping the bill at the Outdoor Stage in support of a chart-topping album, “Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight.” XXL called it “a roller coaster ride of an experience, with an endless amount of highlights, whether it be an indelible hook here or timely guest verse there.” His singles most likely to get a huge reaction include his breakthrough hit “3500” and the platinum “Pick Up the Phone” and “Goosebumps.” (9:35 p.m. Outdoor Theatre)\n\nFRIDAY: Phantogram\n\nJosh Carter and Sarah Barthel set the tone for their forthcoming third album, \"Three,\" with a breathtaking ballad called \"Funeral Pyre\" that Carter says was recorded for \"Voices,\" their previous effort, and later reshaped with new lyrics to serve as the perfect transition into where they are today. And as the album makes its way through such obvious highlights as the hard-grooving heartache of \"You Don't Get Me High Anymore\" and cutting-edge pop classicism of \"Cruel World,\" it's clear that \"Three\" is just the next step in an evolution that's taken Phantogram from \"Eyelid Movies\" to where they are now, offering a slightly different take on who they are at every turn. (8 p.m. Outdoor Theatre)\n\nFRIDAY: Mac DeMarco\n\nThe Canadian singer-songwriter most likely to perform nude (with apologies to Gordon Lightfoot) is playing Coachella a few weeks too early to say it’s in support of “This Old Dog,” his much-anticipated followup to “Another One.” DeMarco is known for two things – songs that reach inside your soul and force you to reflect on what you’ve done and how you plan to make it right, and being a total goof onstage. A bit Paul Westerberg in that respect. And as Smokey Robinson, who may not have been writing specifically about DeMarco, could tell you, “There’s some sad things known to man / But ain't too much sadder than the tears of a clown.” (5:25 p.m. Outdoor Theatre)\n\nFRIDAY: The Avalanches\n\nThese crate-digging Australians earned raves in 2001 for the sample-driven magic of a debut titled “Since I Left You,” which spawned two of the more inspired music videos you're likely to experience. The A.V. Club called it “quite possibly the best sample record ever made.” And it’s easy to see why they would go with that particular distinction. The album feature no fewer than 600 samples of recordings dating from the 1950s to the present day, crediting each sample in the liner notes. Of course that wouldn’t have mattered as much if it hadn’t resulted in such a willfully eccentric masterpiece. And then they went away, returning last year with another classic album titled \"Wildflower.\" As the Independent heard it, \"The wonderful 'Wildflower' is cause for celebration, its Zappa/Beasties-style collage of voices, samples, beats, sounds, and especially laughter offering a joyous affirmation of life.\" (6:45 p.m. Mojave Stage)\n\nFRIDAY: Little Dragon\n\nThese Swedish electro-pop sensations are playing Coachella the very day they're set to hit the streets with \"Seasons High,\" the long-awaited followup to \"Nabuma Rubberband,\" a Grammy-nominated album to which Clash magazine responded, \"Live, Little Dragon are weapons-grade ace. Now they’ve finally got an album to match.\" And when you see them at Coachella, they'll be live, which is \"weapon-grade ace.\" The key to their appeal is, as always, lead singer Yukimi Nagano, who's toured with Gorillaz. (9:45 p.m. Gobi Stage)\n\nFRIDAY: DJ Shadow\n\nLast year marked the 20th anniversary of DJ Shadow's groundbreaking debut, an experimental hip-hop masterstroke called \"Endtroducing.\" It's been cited as one of the decade's best by Q, SPIN, Pitchfork and Rolling Stone, whose critic raved, “The dystopian New Age of 'Endtroducing' sounds like an alien spacecraft touching down on the autobahn late at night, probably to check out Earth's used-vinyl bins,” adding, “This is DJ culture at its boldest: steeped in the past but zooming into the Space Age future.” But rather than rest on those seminal laurels, the DJ added to his legacy with 2016's \"The Mountain Will Fall,\" an album that found him exploring new, less sample-driven territory. \"Overall,\" the AV Club responded, \"this is DJ Shadow’s best work since his early-aughts heyday. Whatever difficult terrain he had to scale to wrangle this mountain was worth the trip, and suggests even greater ascents in the future.\" (9:30 p.m. Mojave Stage)\n\nFRIDAY: Sohn\n\nSohn is Christopher Taylor, whose latest collection of soulful yet haunting electropop, \"Rennen,\" earned raves from Clash Music, Uncut and the 405, whose critic said it found him \"diving into new creative depths, and triumphing.\" The Line of Best Fit also loved it, writing: \"As a soundtrack to a new era where we’re all through the looking glass, old certainties bonfired and every phone alert quickening the pulse, 'Rennen' hits the right tone – its rhythms shivering and uneasy, its melodies veering from melancholy to euphoria in a single stride.\" (3:45 p.m. Gobi Stage)\n\nFRIDAY: Empire of the Sun\n\nThis Australian synth-pop duo features Luke Steele of the Sleepy Jackson and Nick Littlemore of Pnau. They're best known in the States for platinum breakthrough single \"Walking in a Dream.\" The Observer responded to \"Two Vines,\" their latest release, with an amusingly back-handed rave: \"Yes, it’s over-AutoTuned, and the ballads are still rubbish. But this somehow smooshes Cut Copy, ELO and Daft Punk into a honeyed mess that leaves you licking the bowl and twitching for more.\" (10:05 p.m. Sahara)\n\nFRIDAY: Mac Miller\n\nThis Pittsburgh rapper may be best known in the mainstream for his featured rap on Ariana Grande’s hit, “The Way.” But he’s been ready for a mainstream moment for at least six years now, dropping would-be breakthroughs as eager to please as “Frick Park Market,” “Party on Fifth Ave.” and “Smile Back.” And he’s shown what once would have been thought of as “surprising” signs of growth along the way to last year’s model. \"The Divine Feminine\" is Miller at his most ambitious and most soulful. As Pitchfork said, “It’s easily his most intoxicating release yet, an odyssey of soulful compositions paring down his expansive and eclectic soundboard from the last few years into something distinctly cozy and pleasant.” (7:15 p.m. Sahara)\n\nFRIDAY: Banks\n\nThe soulful electropop singer is set to reveal a new live set and visual at Coachella, promising “a very special performance in every sense.” Her latest album, “The Altar,” made good on the promise of a debut titled “Goddess” when it hit the streets last year. There’s a vulnerability she brings to such obvious highlights as “F—k With Myself” and “Mind Games” that really taps into the essence of the lyrics and mines them for all their potential catharsis. And “This is Not About Us” proves that she can also bring the swagger with the best of them. (7:10 p.m. Gobi)\n\nSATURDAY: Bon Iver\n\nJustin Vernon took the blogosphere by storm in 2008 with “For Emma, Forever Ago,” a rustic, acoustic-guitar-driven masterpiece written and recorded in a cabin in the woods, and picked up Best New Artist and Best Alternative Music Album four years later after releasing a self-titled triumph that built on the buzz of “For Emma” while taking his sound in a bold new direction. Last year, a third Bon Iver album, “22, A Million” made the rounds of critics’ year-end lists with good reason. The reviewer at Pretty Much Amazing compared it to what Friday’s headliner achieved on “Kid A,” with its futuristic digital manipulation of Vernon’s lead vocals and general purposeful digital glitchery, writing, “Not since ‘Kid A’ has an album so superb pushed away and pulled closer its audience, simultaneously and with such aplomb.” (9 p.m. Coachella Stage)\n\nSATURDAY: Future\n\nThis Atlanta-based rapper engaged in a full-court blitz in 2015 that resulted in one of hip-hop’s most impressive winning streaks of all time. In under a year, he achieved three back-to-back No. 1 appearances on Billboard’s album chart -- the platinum “DS2,” the platinum “What A Time To Be Alive” with Drake, and “EVOL.” So what has done for us lately? Well, this year, for instance, he's already sent two records -- \"Future\" and \"HNDRXX\" -- to the top of Billboard's album chart. His best-known songs include the double-platinum smashes “Low Life” (featuring the Weeknd) and “Where Ya At” (with Drake), as well as the platinum hits “Stick Talk,” “F--k Up Some Commas,” and “Turn On The Lights.” His biggest hits, of course, is \"Jumpman,\" a quadruple-platinum Drake collaboration. This should definitely be among the weekend's most anticipated sets. (7:30 p.m. Coachella Stage)\n\nSATURDAY: Nicolas Jaar\n\nAn experimental electronic artist whose rep is based in part of a five-hour improvisational concert at MoMA PS1, as presented by Pitchfork, Jaaar earned raves for last year's \"Sirens,\" a second album whose highlights ranged from an 11-minute opener whose ambient textures echoed David Bowie's work with Brian Eno to tracks that rocked the electronic rockabilly swagger like classic Suicide. PopMatters says, \"Like Radiohead’s twin post-Y2K masterpieces — \"Kid A\" and \"Amnesiac\" — or Flying Lotus’s jazz-psych odysseys, it strips elements from pop and experimental music and fuses them into a new holistic world.\" Experimental art is rarely this approachable and daring in the same breath. (10:40 p.m.)\n\nSATURDAY: DJ Snake\n\nThis French producer earned a Grammy nomination for his work on Gaga’s “Born This Way” in 2012 and a second nomination in 2015 for the video to the quadruple-platinum breakthrough that remains his biggest-selling hit, “Turn Down For What,” which featured Lil Jon. And that’s just one of several major hits the man can draw on, others being “You Know You Like It,” “Lean On,” “Middle” and the Justin Bieber team-up “Let Me Love You.” (10 p.m. Outdoor Theatre)\n\nSATURDAY: Schoolboy Q\n\nLast year's \"Blank Face LP,\" the West Coast rapper’s long-awaited followup to “Oxymoron,” features guest appearances by Kanye West (who appears on the hit single, \"That Part\"), Vince Staples, Jadakiss, E-40, Tha Dogg Pound, Anderson Paak, Miguel and Justine Skye. Consequence of Sound said, \"It’s hard and sinister like a gangster rap album, but it’s also sprawling and even psychedelic at times. Nothing else sounds like it, and that’s a joy to behold.\" (8:25 p.m. Outdoor Theatre)\n\nSATURDAY: Gucci Mane\n\nThis Atlanta rapper first made a name for himself in 2005 with an album called “Trap House” and its breakthrough single, “Icy.” He really hit his stride, though, in 2009 with “The State vs. Radric Davis,” which sent three singles to the Top 10 on the rap charts, including his biggest hit, “Wasted.” After serving a two-year prison term, the star returned to active duty last summer with an album titled “Everybody Looking” and released two more before the year was out. (10:35 p.m. Sahara)\n\nSUNDAY: Lorde\n\nI’m still not sure what made her want to dance like that on “Saturday Night Live.” But hopefully the feeling’s passed, because the songs I’ve heard so far from her new album, “Melodrama,” have already made it clear that 2013’s “Pure Heroine,” the singer’s platinum debut, was no fluke (especially “Liability,” a Bowiesque piano ballad that feels like a page being torn from a diary in a really vulnerable moment). Lorde was all of 17 when \"Royals\" spent nine weeks at No. 1 on Billboard's Hot 100, selling 7.5 million copies worldwide. And she scored a second multi-platinum U.S. hit with “Team” from that same debut album. She hasn’t toured since late 2014, so TV show appearances are all we have to go on at the moment as far as what fans can expect from this performance. (8:45 p.m. Coachella Stage)\n\nSUNDAY: Porter Robinson & Madeon\n\nRolling Stone magazine called Robinson one of the 25 DJs that rule the earth. And he won MTVu's Artist of the Year in March, 2015. That same year, he dropped a brilliant album titled \"Worlds,\" on which the Chapel Hill, N.C., EDM producer appeared to have taken the title of a track called \"Sad Machine\" as a statement of purpose, sounding like the saddest machine in the saddest ruins of the saddest post-apocalyptic universe on several of the album's strongest tracks, of which there are many. He shares a stage at Coachella with Madeon, the French DJ with whom he collaborated last summer on a track called \"Shelter.\" (7 p.m. Coachella Stage)\n\nSUNDAY: Justice\n\nThis French duo’s first album was hailed as a “killer party record” by the A.V. Club and ended the year, 2007, on critics’ best-of lists at both Pitchfork and Blender. won a Grammy for their remix of the MGMT song “Electric Feel” in 2009. A second album arrived in 2011, the A.V. Club responding with “What ‘Audio, Video, Disco’ does best is show off what a pair of good producers can really do-namely, simplifying technical musicianship into head-throbbing dance music.” And last year’s “Woman” definitely” kept the party raging with plenty of highlights sure to have the club kids dancing up a dust storm. (9:55 Outdoor Theatre)\n\nSUNDAY: Devendra Banhart\n\nListening to Banhart's latest effort made me think of Donovan – it's all in the trembling vocal. Anyhow, thinking of Donovan got me to thinking about the time I was talking to Donovan and decided to ask if he felt a connection to Banhart. \"Yeah, yeah, yeah,\" he said. \"I went to see him when he came to Ireland. And it was very cool. There's very much a lot of gypsy stuff in Devendra, just like me. I walk out there, the light comes up, and then I play guitar (makes guitar noise), and then when I sing, I'm actually looking at the audience going, 'I'm in town. I've just arrived.' Devendra does it, too.\" Getting back to Banhart's latest album, \"Ape in Pink Marble\" is an excellent addition to the catalog that plays to all the strengths he's shown along the way. As Magnet summed it up, \"The fantasy and the fantastic continue, and his soft sculptural Dadaist lyrical sense of romance will always go with DevBan's trembling, lilting melodies like cheese and chocolate.\" (4:55 p.m. Outdoor Theatre)\n\nSUNDAY: Future Islands\n\nThese Baltimore synth-pop revivalists have one of modern music’s most distinctive vocalists in Samuel T. Herring, who enunciates like David Bowie with a diction coach. And it suits the drama of their music. They’re playing Coachella a week after hitting the streets with “The Far Field,” to which the A.V. Club responded, “The raw passion of Future Island’s past work still dominates, but with more complexity in the arrangements, and more push and pull in the ongoing dialogue between the voice and the instruments behind it.” (6:10 p.m. Outdoor Theatre)\n\nSUNDAY: New Order\n\nThese guys are proper legends, formed in 1980 by three Joy Division members – Bernard Sumner, Stephen Morris and Peter Hook – after the suicide of singer Ian Curtis. Hook is no longer a member, having left in 2007 over personal conflicts. But three members of the current lineup – Sumner, Morris and Gillian Gilbert – have been on board since their first album, “Movement.” Filtering their post-punk through electronic music they discovered on the New York club scene, they became a hugely influential – and popular – presence on the ‘80s music scene. “Blue Monday” holds the distinction of being the biggest-selling 12-inch single of all time. (10:20 p.m. Mojave)\n\nSUNDAY: Kaytranada\n\nBorn in Haiti and raised in Montreal, this Canadian DJ/producer made the rounds of critic's year-end lists last year with \"99.9%.\" And with good reason. The album finds his effortlessly offsetting his more experimental urges with serious pop sensibilities, often in the course of one amazing track, from an R&B jam as contagious as \"Together\" to the hip-hop soul of \"Drive Me Crazy\" with Vic Mensa. As HipHopDX summed it up, \"He seems to have complete control over the proverbial dance floor, switching up tempos to match the crowd’s mood throughout the 15-track album; this prevents 99.9% from feeling bloated and is yet another reason Kaytranada’s debut album is a resounding success.\" (5:45 p.m. Sahara)\n\nSUNDAY: Tove Lo\n\nThis soulful Swedish electro-pop diva is touring an album titled “Lady Wood,” which earned a rave from Entertainment Weekly, whose critic sized it up with “Lo sounds as if she’s in the throes of a quarter-life crisis” while declaring the singer “a fearless outsider in pop music—the Janis Ian in a cafeteria full of Regina Georges.” Lo first grabbed the U.S. spotlight with a five-times-platinum breakthrough called “Habits (Stay High)” in 2014, following through with two more huge hit singles – the double-platinum “Talking Body” and last year’s “Cool Girl.” (7:55 p.m. Mojave)\n\nSUNDAY: Skepta\n\nHis “Konnichiwa” was the U.K. grime scene’s breakthrough moment, winning the Mercury Prize for 2016, the same year Skepta won a BET Award for Best International Act: UK. NME declared “Konnichiwa” a “landmark in British street music, a record good enough to take on the world without having to compromise one inch in the process.\" (3:20 p.m. Sahara)\n\nSUNDAY: Kehlani\n\nThis 21-year-old R&B star made it to the finals on \"America's Got Talent\" with her old group, Poplyfe, in 2014 and was nominated for a Grammy in 2016 (a Best Urban Contemporary Album nod for the mixtape \"You Should Be Here\"). \"SweetSexySavage,\" her first proper studio album, topped the R&B charts earlier this year with Spin declaring it \"a distinctly contemporary album that is in conversation with trendy, critically acclaimed R&B.\" Her best-known tracks are R&B hits \"CRZY\" and \"Gangsta,\" the second of which is from the \"Suicide Squad\" soundtrack. (9:05 p.m. Mojave)\n\nWHY YOU NEED TO ALWAYS READ THE SMALL PRINT\n\nCoachella posters are designed so that the big, high-profile artists get the big type, and the up-and-coming and still-haven’t-gotten-there-yet-after-decades-of-trying artists get the small type at the bottom. People tend to focus on the names in big type. But oftentimes the artists at the bottom of the poster are the more exciting option. Here’s are my picks for each day of the festival.\n\nFRIDAY: Sampha\n\nThis British singer-songwriter has worked with Drake (\"Too Much\"), Solange (\"Don't Touch My Hair\") and Kanye West (\"Saint Pablo\"). But never mind the guest spots: He's playing Coachella on the strength of \"Process,\" a deeply emotional full-length debut whose highlights range from an achingly beautiful opening track called \"Plastic 100º C\" to the trembling vulnerability he displays on the gospel-flavored \"No One Knows Me (Like the Piano),\" a sentence that ends with \"in my mother's home.\" As the Skinny noted, \"Process is an exercise in catharsis, a deep breathe in that lays Sampha’s soul bare through gorgeous vignettes of his life. He worries, he regrets, he aches. He’s human.\" Still on the fence? You should know that the A.V. Club called it \"the best R&B debut since FKA Twigs’ 'LP1.'\" (4:20 p.m.)\n\nFRIDAY: Lemon Twigs\n\nThe Lemon Twigs' \"Do Hollywood\" takes all the oddest, most outrageous elements of '60s pop and throws them in a blender to create its own intoxicating pop confection. There are echoes of the Kinks at their most whimsical. But it's the Kinks of \"She's Bought a Hat Like Princess Marina,\" not \"Waterloo Sunset.\" I would not be shocked to learn that the Twigs view \"Winchester Cathedral\" as some kind of overlooked classic. And I mean that in a good way. Under the Radar writes, \"With one foot in the present and one foot in the past, the Lemon Twigs have produced one of the most striking, individual, and colorful debuts of the year.\" And I'd agree with nearly every point that writer makes, but I'm not hearing one foot in the present, which is fine. There's nothing they could borrow from the present that would make their music any more enjoyable than it already is. (2:30 p.m.)\n\nFRIDAY: D.R.A.M.\n\nLast year, the German-born rapper from Hampton, Virginia, whose stage name is an acronym for Does Real Ass Music, did his best to make the Billboard Hot 100 safe for real ass music with the four-times-platinum triumph that was \"Broccoli.\" That song, with an assist from Lil Yachty, peaked at No. 5. And the album from which it was taken, \"Big Baby D.R.A.M.,\" went well beyond the promise of its greatest hit in the process of making its way through such obvious highlights as the '70s funk vibe of \"Misunderstood,\" the Erykah Badu-assisted \"Wifi\" and the instantly infectious \"Cash Machine.\" The 405 says, \"Unlike countless hip-hop albums that feel slapped together to fit in the artist's favorites alongside the label's, flow unconsidered, each moment of 'Big Baby' feels earned.\" (12:10 a.m.)\n\nFRIDAY: Tacocat\n\nThese Seattle garage-punk revivalists have been building a buzz since the release three years ago of “NVM,” an album produced by the great Conrad Uno (Young Fresh Fellows, Mudhoney, etc), whose title appeared to be a fairly brilliant reference to Nirvana’s “Nevermind.” Last year brought yet another reason not to miss this show, with an album packed with effervescent pop hooks titled “Lost Time.” It opens with a really catchy “X-Files” tribute titled “Dana Katherine Scully” and makes its way through equally contagious songs about hating the weekend, menstruation and creepy dudes both on and off the Internet. As the reviewer at Record Collector was right on the money to call it, it’s “a joyful, spirited album that also stands to teach whoever listens to it some vital life lessons.” (4:55 p.m.)\n\nFRIDAY: Stormzy\n\nThe U.K. grime sensation is touring the States in support of a full-length debut titled \"Gang Signs & Prayer,\" which topped the U.K. album chart in February, the first grime album ever to accomplish that. As DIY Magazine raved, \"If Skepta’s ‘Konnichiwa’ was grime’s breakthrough, 'Gang Signs & Prayer' is its blockbuster — an all-encompassing ride through human experience that’ll stand tall for decades.\" He's been working toward this moment for a few years, having won Best Grime Act at the 2014 and 2015 MOBO Awards as well as being named an artist to look out for in the BBC's influential Sound of 2015 list. He also topped the UK rap and indie charts with the new album's lead single \"Big For Your Boots,\" which made our playlist of best February singles, where I noted, \"It sounds like a hit, from the opening hook, in which the rapper warns that 'You’re getting way too big for your boots' before putting a spin on the words with a defiant 'You’re never too big for the boot / I’ve got the big size 12s on my feet / Your face ain’t big for my boot.'\" (3 p.m.)\n\nFRIDAY: Floorplan\n\nFans of minimalist techno can't afford to miss this set by DJ Robert Hood, who brought home raves in 2016 for \"Victorious,\" the second album he's released as Floorplan, which sounds like a rave breaking out a tent revival meeting at times. As Resident Adviser summed it up: \"The second Floorplan album feels triumphant enough to bear the title Victorious. It's a stellar follow-up to Paradise, an album that brought even more followers to Hood's flock and helped make him a feel-good festival mainstay. The record is also proof that you don't need to constantly reinvent yourself to stay relevant. Though Floorplan's details and production values have changed since the project debuted in 1996, its nuts and bolts haven't. Hood is still the master of the minimalist dance track — whether he's making dark, loopy beats or life-affirming anthems.\" (5 p.m.)\n\nFRIDAY: Tennis\n\nPatrick Riley and Alaina Moore of Tennis first earned a buzz for \"Cape Dory,\" a concept album about the couple's sailing trip (on which you'd swear they listened to nothing but the music of the early '60s). And they managed to update their sound without abandoning their charm by the time a third album, called “Ritual in Repeat,” hit the streets in 2014, with production by Patrick Carney of the Black Keys, Jim Eno of Spoon and Richard Swift. As Magnet noted, “Tennis dances easily into the present with an album that pines for more for modern connection than campy reinventions of someone else's love.” And if this year's \"Yours Conditionally\" feels like classic Tennis, it may have a little to do with the fact that Moore and Riley wrote it on a five-month sailing trip around the Sea of Cortez. As musicOMH responded, \"'Yours Conditionally' is indeed a restoration of the loose-fitting, blissful, summertime tunes that brought Tennis to the attention of internet music sites everywhere. The opening line of the album is 'I’ll wipe your cares away,' and it couldn’t be more apt.\" (3:10 p.m.)\n\nFRIDAY: Preservation Hall Jazz Band\n\nTaking their name from Preservation Hall, the legendary music venue they call home in New Orleans' French Quarter, they're known for performing traditional New Orleans jazz, which they've been doing through various lineup changes since the early '60s. Their mainstream profile got a boost in 2013 when they joined the Black Keys in one of the more exciting Grammy Awards performances in recent memory. Their latest album, \"That's It!,\" was produced by Jim James of My Morning Jacket. Released in 2013, it marked their 50th anniversary with their first collection of all original material. (3:30 p.m.)\n\nFRIDAY: King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard\n\nThey’ve promised no fewer than five full-length albums before the year is out. And if you’re thinking, “What are they, high?” well, the answer is almost undoubtedly “so high you wouldn’t believe it.” If you’re into the psychedelic side of garage-rock at all, you’d do well to check out the first of those five albums, “Flying Microtonal Banana,” on which their trippy fuzz guitars are flavored with touches as unusual as flute and Turkish horns. The end result is, as DIY noted, rich, imaginative, and more than a little strange. (4:10 p.m.)\n\nFRIDAY: Guided By Voices\n\nIs Robert Pollard of Guided by Voices the first artist in the history of rock and roll to have released 100 albums, a feat he recently accomplished by virtue of GBV's \"August By Cake?\" You'd have to think so, right? I mean, Bob Dylan's made a lot of albums. He's at 39 studio albums. If you count the Traveling Wilburys. And Pollard has only been doing this since \"Forever Since Breakfast\" arrived in 1986. As for the new one? It sounds like classic GBV, a mix of scappy pop songs bashed out with the reckless abandon of a Who fan who doesn't see sweating the details as a good thing and odd psychedelic departures. Like Bennie and the Jets before them, oh, but they're weird and they're wonderful. In addition to Pollard, the album features two GBV veterans -- Doug Gillard and Kevin March -- as well as new arrivals Bobby Bare Jr and Mark Shue. And get this, it's a two-record set.\n\nSATURDAY: Car Seat Headrest\n\nAzcentral.com was among the several billion publications that included Car Sear Headrest of their year-end album lists for 2016. As I wrote at the time: The most compelling evidence I heard all year that rock and roll is here to stay? The guitars on Car Seat Headrest’s latest album, an exhilarating ride that gets off to an unassuming start when a female voice sheepishly introduces them with “What’s up, guys? You are now listening to … uh, Car Seat Headrest.” She sounds like she has no idea who they are. And by the time the toms come crashing in to meet that opening guitar riff, it’s already clear that that would be her loss, not theirs. ... If you grew up on Pavement and lived through the turn-of-the-century rock revival before deciding you wanted to write an album that felt like you’d just woken up hungover in the CBGB men’s room after passing out to Television? You’d do well to hope it sounded half as good as this.\" (4:15 p.m.)\n\nSATURDAY: Thundercat\n\nLA bassist Stephen Bruner may be best known for his work with Flying Lotus. In a perfect world, “Drunk” would change all that – which I probably said in 2013, when he released “Apocalypse,” as well. The man’s musical chops are a given, as always. He’s a monster on the bass with few if any equals in that magic place where jazz and funk collide. On “Drunk,” a recently released fourth album boasting guest spots by Kendrick Lamar, Kenny Loggins and Michael McDonald (on the same track!) and Pharrell, he’s created a suitably intoxicating soundtrack to a concept album exploring the common side effects of what Ray Davies once called \"demon alcohol,\" from the dizzying speed bass of the jazz-funk instrumental “Uh Uh” to the yacht-rock gold that is the Loggins-McDonald jam, “Show Me the Way.” And to be clear, as musicOMH was right to note: While his work references styles of music (smooth jazz, soft-rock, prog) that haven’t always been considered fashionable, he’s always stressed that it comes from a place of honesty and love; there’s playfulness and humor, but it’s never tongue-in-cheek. (5:30 p.m.)\n\nSATURDAY: Swet Shop Boys\n\nHeems of Das Racist and British Pakistani actor Riz Ahmed (as seen in HBO’s “The Night Of”) released one of the more intriguing hip-hop albums of 2016, \"Cashmere,\" an intensely political party record that filters western hip-hop through the sounds of Bollywood and qawwali music. On \"T5,\" the opening track, they take aim at the systemic racism people of color are forced to endure as they travel the world, with a taunting chorus hook of “Oh no, we’re in trouble / TSA always wanna burst my bubble / Always get a random check when I rock this stubble.” And the tracks that follow are every bit as thought-provoking, taking aim at heavy issues without feeling heavy-handed. \"To Westerners, cashmere is a luxury textile,\" Pitchfork noted. \"To South Asians, it’s the site of a violent territorial dispute between India and Pakistan that hinges on questions of identity. It’s a perfect title for a project that blurs the lines between all of these perspectives, that stunts as much as it elucidates, and which ties up all of these messy ideas into a refreshingly expansive vision of South Asian identity.\" Also, that's one brilliant band name. (1 p.m.)\n\nSATURDAY: Mitski\n\nThe buzz on this New York-based indie sensation began in 2014 with the release of \"Bury Me at Makeout Creek,\" with Pitchfork rightly noting that her \"broad, tremulous vocals and sly humor recall Angel Olsen while the equal split between unencumbered acoustic pining and pummeling, mid-fi indie rock respectively aligns her with labelmates Frankie Cosmos and LVL UP.\" She really hit her stride, though, on \"Puberty 2.\" Released last year, the album finds her growing as an artist and a singer, expanding the scope or her sound without abandoning the qualities that made her so appealing in the first place. It also featured one of 2016's most beguiling singles, \"Your Best American Girl,\" a delicate whisper of a song that kicks in on the chorus with chugging distorted guitars and feedback like some great lost relic from the golden age of “This is how Nirvana did it.” (2:45 p.m.)\n\nSATURDAY: Downtown Boys\n\nWe all know punk’s not dead, but it can’t hurt to prove it as conclusively as these Rhode Island upstarts (led by Victoria Ruiz on vocals) have done with conviction to spare on “Somos Chula (No Somos Pendejas),” which translates, I am told, as “We are beautiful (We are not stupid).” When they shared the track on Facebook, they called it “a declaration of one's ability to decolonize one's mind, and the importance of fearlessly unlearning the ways white supremacy conditions people to think and exist.” It’s the sort sentiment that was made to be expressed in the universal language of punk. And they express it well, as they did on a 2015 debut hailed in NME as “a joyous surge of drums, guitars, wild brass and potent Spanish-English vocals.” (3:10 p.m.)\n\nSATURDAY: Chicano Batman\n\nThese LA rockers filter old-school funk and soul through elements of psychedelic pop and Tropicalia for an end result that couldn't feel more timeless than it does on their new album \"Freedom is Free.\" It's as though they'd been assigned to write the soundtrack to an LA cop show in the very early '70s. There's even a hint of \"Shaft\" guitar on \"Angel Child.\" And yet, as the reviewer at PopMatters notes, \"The thing is, it’s brand new music. But it sounds like it wasn’t recorded within 100 miles of a laptop.\" The lyrics, on the other hand, are firmly rooted in the harsh realities of American life in the 21st century. The title track, for instance, is their answer song to bumper sticker claiming \"Freedom Isn't Free.\" As Bardo Martinez testifies, \"You got your guns up on display / But you can't control how I feel no way / 'Cause freedom is free.\" (4:30 p.m.)\n\nSATURDAY: Classixx\n\nLast year, the electronic duo of Michael David and Tyler Blake released a second album called “Faraway Reach,” which featured guest appearances from How To Dress Well, Isles, Nonku, Panama, Passion Pit and T-Pain. Clash Music declared it “a happy place full of group hugs and big shiny grooves,” while Mixmag said it “bursts with sun-soaked vibes.” They’re both right, as it turns out. (12 a.m.)\n\nSATURDAY: Blossoms\n\nThese Brits spend the bulk of their self-titled album recalling the pop acts of the '80s who did their best to be filed under New Wave. But not in a bad way. There are dozens of young artists doing their damnedest to channel the edgier post-punk side of that same era. This is for the pop kids. As Clash Music noted, \"Blossoms have produced an album of perfectly structured songs accompanied by strong lyrics that tell many tales to the large cult they seem to have already acquired.\" (1:10 p.m.)\n\nSUNDAY: Whitney\n\nThese guys made my Albums of the Year list for 2016. As I wrote at the time, \"This is a stunning collection of deeply soulful chamber pop, its richly textured soft-rock sensibilities topped by Julien Ehrlich’s aching upper register. The man wears his heart on his sleeve with the vulnerability of Neil Young on a rainy day. And it serves him well, from the opening line of the opening track, where the orchestrated intro dissolves into Ehrlich accompanied only by the strum of acoustic guitar as he sets the tone with “I left drinking on the city train” to the wounded majesty of “Polly,” the album’s emotional core.\" Ehrlich comes to this project, along with guitarist Max Kakacek, from Smith Westerns (who, it should be noted, sounded nothing like this). (3:45 p.m.)\n\nSUNDAY: Hinds\n\nThese young Spanish women are touring the States in continued support of a charming debut titled “Leave Me Alone,” which would be difficult to leave alone because the songs are too contagious to just walk away and move on to the next young hopefuls. Guitar-playing vocalist Ana Perrote and Carlotta Cosials sing with personality to spare, their voices intertwining without any sense that they even tried to match each other’s phrasing. It’s the kind of sloppy that’s too often missing – or forced – when people try to make garage-rock records. This is imperfectly imperfect and blessed with indelible pop hooks. No wonder the Skinny declared it “the peppiest, jauntiest, most charismatic debut you’ll likely find in the next 12 months.” It sounds like people having fun with rock and roll. And what could be more fun than that?

I’m surprised at how often jaws drop when I argue that the Minneapolis wunderkind was more musically and culturally significant than the so-called “King of Pop.”\n\nYes, Jackson does reign with the top-selling album (“Thriller,” 32 million copies sold in America) and ranks seventh among artists for all-times sales (79 million). Prince, meanwhile, languishes far down the list (20.5 million) — below lesser fads such as Meat Loaf, Nelly and Nickelback.\n\n5 ways to celebrate Prince's legacy in Des Moines\n\nI shouldn’t care so much. I’m more of a Bowie guy.\n\nBut I like to make the point that sheer sales and global reach don’t tell the whole story. Here’s what I mean:\n\n1. Musicianship\n\nJackson unleashed the moonwalk and flexed an undeniable gift for a dancer’s rhythm paired with pop melody. But Prince was a multi-instrumentalist tour de force and arguably also the more daring singer.\n\n2. Guitar\n\nWhen Jackson wanted rock guitar for “Beat It” he called Eddie Van Halen. But Prince has been acknowledged by Eric Clapton and others as one of the best guitarists of his generation — perhaps the most versatile since Jimi Hendrix. Pop stars tend to rely on hired guns for guitar firepower, but Prince was a one-man army.\n\n3. Movies\n\nIn hindsight, the main function of the nearly unwatchable “The Wiz” (sorry) was that it introduced Jackson to Quincy Jones, who would go on to produce his landmark albums “Off the Wall” and “Thriller.” But Jackson never managed a film with the cultural or commercial relevance of “Purple Rain.” (And if you throw the “Thriller” music video in my face, I’ll merely say that this argument is a wash when it comes to Prince and Jacko’s MTV presence in the ‘80s.)\n\n4. Ballads\n\nSpeaking of “Purple Rain,” I love the story about how Prince was inspired to write the song by his experience on tour with — of all people — Bob Seger. Prince was stymied by how Seger was filling arenas, particularly in the Midwest. One of Seger’s bandmates chalked it up to the universal appeal of his ballads (“Turn the Page” and so on). So Prince set out to write a landmark ballad, what essentially became his own “Hey Jude.” Jackson’s “Human Nature” may have its merits, but he never came close to “Purple Rain.”\n\n5. Independence\n\nYes, there was plenty of pride and ego wrapped up in Prince’s rebellion against Warner Bros. Records during which he scrawled “slave” on his cheek, changed his name and even rerecorded “1999” to sell on his own label in time for the new millennium. But the underlying strategy to own his master recordings and control his fate — reaping more profit from fewer record sales along the way — was an inspiration to countless other artists. He stood firm in this streaming era, too. (Alas, no memorial Prince playlists on Spotify.)\n\n6. Mentor\n\nMaybe as a symptom of his childhood stardom — too much, too young, and with daddy issues — Jackson never appeared to be comfortable enough in his own skin to serve as a real mentor to other artists. He almost clung to collaborators for moral support. Prince, on the other hand, was more the classic bandleader in developing and promoting talent. And some of his songs became signature hits for other artists (such as Sinead O’Connor's “Nothing Compares 2 U”).\n\n7. Fashion\n\nJackson had that one glove, but no other pop star has commandeered an entire color quite like Prince. (Maybe only Johnny “Man in Black” Cash?) The world’s most erotic Jehovah’s Witness also aged more gracefully, to say the least. (I'm trying to play nice and avoid the icky scandalous side of Jacko.)\n\n8. Vault\n\nHaving made the mistake of watching “This Is It” in a theater, I’m reasonably sure that we’ve long since seen and heard the best of Jackson’s legacy. But if even a fraction of Prince’s rumored vault recordings exist, we’re likely to see a posthumous outpouring of significant work that will put even the Grateful Dead to shame.\n\nStar Tribune reporter watched Prince perform at Paisley Park days before his death\n\n9. Hometown\n\nJackson left behind Gary, Indiana, and went in search of his own bizarre Neverland that he tried to build into a (sur)reality in California. But Minneapolis remained a centerpiece of Prince’s career and identity. Concert venue First Avenue and home studio Paisley Park are woven into the Midwest musical fabric. Bob Dylan remains the most musically significant Minnesotan (did I just start another argument?), but Prince was by far the better neighbor.\n\nLet's Watch Prince's Super Bowl Halftime Show, The Best We've Ever Seen\n\n10. Concerts\n\nPrince dazzled in 2007 with his Super Bowl halftime performance — still the best among what otherwise has been mostly a revue of past-the-prime relics or Bruno Mars cameos. A great video has circulated online in which Prince eclipses both James Brown (admittedly far beyond his peak) and Jackson during a 1983 concert in Los Angeles.\n\nMic drop.

Can Los Angeles be trusted? Probably not. For all their star power, they've now survived two straight playoff wins by the skin of their teeth, and you might say that about the Bengals, too, except the Rams were literally built to win it all. They are the win-now team, assembled with one big-name veteran after another. Cincy feels like the right call, with all their fun-loving, expectation-shattering youth. But Aaron Donald and the Rams' defensive front is a different animal, and we saw in Tennessee what can happen when Joe Burrow's blocking is up against real pressure. If Sean McVay can actually put a game plan together, L.A. should be able to do quite a bit more than it did against the 49ers, and that spells a big-play win at home.\"\n\nMore:Los Angeles Rams vs. Cincinnati Bengals pick, prediction: Who wins Super Bowl 56?\n\nSporting News: Rams 27, Bengals 24\n\nBill Bender writes: \"The recipe for success on both sides is a familiar one, but the result will still come down to the No. 1 picks. It took Stafford 13 years to get to this stage. Burrow is there in his second season. Which quarterback will be more composed on that stage? It is a true toss-up. Burrow has shown the same cool that made him a national champion at LSU. He will make big plays despite the Rams' furious pass rush. Cincinnati will lead at halftime, but Los Angeles will rally behind Stafford, with Kupp and Beckham catching second-half touchdowns. A late TD by the Bengals will cut the lead to three, but Los Angeles will hold on for its first Super Bowl victory in 22 seasons.\"\n\nSporting News: Bengals 30, Rams 27\n\nVinnie Iyer writes: \"Although it would a nice story for Stafford to win a Super Bowl right after his 34th birthday in his first season with the Rams after all those fruitless years with the Lions, the NFL is a league tilting toward the AFC's young guns with the sun setting for the GOAT now in the NFC, Tom Brady. Mahomes has a ring. Josh Allen and Justin Herbert might get into the mix very soon. Burrow, only two years removed from his Heisman and national title turn at LSU, has the old-school cool swagger tied to Super Bowl Joes of the past (Namath, Montana). At 25, he looks like he's been in the league for a long time. The Rams have a solid defense, but they have enough holes to exploit for Burrow to outduel Stafford, setting up McPherson for the game-winner late (again).\"\n\nMore:Super Bowl odds: Los Angeles Rams vs. Cincinnati Bengals point spread, money lines, total\n\nFox Sports: Rams will beat Bengals to win Super Bowl\n\nGeoff Schwartz writes: \"The Bengals have been able to force turnovers this postseason, and we know Stafford has issues with giving the ball away. This is the formula for the Bengals once again: They need to force turnovers, stay patient on defense and make Stafford beat them. I’m taking the Rams to win the Super Bowl on their home field. Maybe it’s a mistake after picking against the Bengals for weeks now, but my mind will not allow me to pick a team with an offensive line I do not trust in a Super Bowl. The Rams will win this game in the trenches, and Stafford will do just enough to help L.A. claim the Lombardi Trophy.\"\n\nBleacher Report: Rams 20, Bengals 17\n\nMichelle Burton writes: \"Cincinnati's offensive line, meanwhile, was one of the league's worst when it comes to protecting the quarterback. The Bengals gave up 55 sacks in the 2021 season, third-most in the NFL, and Burrow was sacked 51 times. This game has the potential to be a shootout, and Burrow has proved capable of compensating for the deficiencies of his line. But the Rams front seven may prove just too stout for Cincinnati to overcome.\"\n\nMore:Super Bowl TV information: How to watch Los Angeles Rams vs. Cincinnati Bengals game\n\nFansided: Take the Bengals money line vs. Rams\n\nPeter Dewey writes: \"Cincinnati has gone 6-1 ATS the spread as a road underdog this season, and it has upset the Tennessee Titans and Kansas City Chiefs on this playoff run. Joe Burrow and the Bengals have plenty of weapons to compete with Matthew Stafford, Cooper Kupp and Odell Beckham Jr., and they came into the AFC title game with the fifth fewest rushing yards allowed this season. The Rams defense is a force to be reckoned with, ranking ninth in the NFL in opponent yards per play, but Burrow and the Bengals have just looked too good the past few weeks for me not to ride with them again.\"\n\nFive Thirty Eight: Rams have a 68% win probability\n\nThe site gives the Bengals a 32% win probability in the NFL playoff game.\n\nESPN: Rams have a 66.3% chance to win\n\nThe site's Football Power Index gives the Bengals a 33.7% chance to win the game.\n\nMore:Super Bowl MVP odds: Rams' Matthew Stafford, Bengals' Joe Burrow favored to win award\n\nReach Jeremy Cluff at jeremy.cluff@arizonarepublic.com.

But it is also the story about the human capacity for forgiveness and a young woman’s struggle to find peace.\n\nStill shrouded in darkness, she sat alone in her car, parked between night and day, between this world and the next.\n\nBehind her, a family of teddy bears sat strapped in by a seat belt. In the front seat next to her was a digital recorder. And a gun.\n\nShe picked up the recorder and clicked it on.\n\n\"This is Paula Cooper.\"\n\nA short introduction, a simple statement. Even though nothing had been simple about being Paula Cooper.\n\n\"I believe today is the 26th; 5:15 will be my death.\"\n\nShe saw it clearly now, even in the pre-dawn gloom. She'd spent so much of her life searching for peace. But early on the morning of May 26, 2015, the end was in sight. She would reach it before sunrise.\n\nShe just had a few things left to say.\n\n—\n\n\"My sister. My queen. My everything.\"\n\nEvery morning she spoke to Rhonda. Why should this morning be different?\n\n—\n\n\"My mother, I felt like you didn't love me. You didn't care about me. You cut me off. You judged me. You didn't want me at your church. You hurt me about the man I loved. But I still love you.\"\n\nOthers had forgiven Paula. Yet she never felt it from the woman who mattered most.\n\n—\n\n\"To Monica, I'm so sorry. This pain that I feel every day. I walk around. I'm so miserable inside. I can't deal with this reality.\"\n\nMonica had been like a godmother in the fairy tales — someone to fill the void in the absence of a mother's love.\n\n—\n\n\"LeShon, I love you. … You showed me how to love.You showed me how to be a woman.\"\n\nLeShon looked beyond Paula's past. As if it had never occurred.\n\n—\n\n\"Michael, I'm so proud of you. And thank you for apologizing.\"\n\nMichael was her first love. She wanted a life with him; he wanted something else.\n\n—\n\n\"Meshia … you helped me when I was down, but I explained to you better than anybody how I feel.\"\n\nMeshia knew Paula's pain; she'd just been unable to stop it.\n\n—\n\nThese were the people Paula loved most. And to each one she had revealed part of herself, but never the whole. It was a select list from a life populated by characters: Her brutal father and her innocent victim; the judge who condemned her and the man who forgave her. There were friars and a bishop and a pope; jailers and journalists; people who were zealous to save her life and people eager to end it. There were too many to consider, really. And the sun would be up soon. She could wait no longer.\n\n\"Forgive me,\" she said in a recording that would soon become part of a police investigation. \"I must go now.\"\n\nHer coda finished, Paula stepped out of the car and into the shadows. She took a seat against a blighted tree. She felt the breeze in her hair. She felt the gun in her hand.\n\nShe was familiar with death. She'd seen it up close. She'd been condemned to it, resigned to it and reprieved from it. She had debated its merits and come to terms with it. Never had she stopped thinking of it.\n\nBut the question that would vex those she was leaving behind was maddeningly simple.\n\nWhy, after all she had endured and all she had survived, after all she had done and seemed capable of doing, had she chosen to die now?\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nThe garden spot in the woods — where her father grew vegetables and beat his daughters — was only an occasional venue of torture.\n\nMore often, for Paula Cooper, it happened at home.\n\nAs a child, Paula went to bed night after night next to her sister, listening to their parents argue, listening to her father make threats to come after them. Sometimes her mother would talk him out of it. Sometimes the man's wrath ebbed and they fell asleep. Sometimes they would be jarred awake at 3 o'clock in the morning, her father standing over them, ready to beat them.\n\nPaula believed there were other kinds of families out there. She watched the people on \"The Cosby Show,\" and they seemed to have such a nice family. But that was television. This was real. This was her family. And it looked as if there was no escaping it.\n\n—\n\nPaula was born in Chicago to Herman and Gloria Cooper on Aug. 25, 1969. Her sister, Rhonda, was three years older. Early on, the family lived in Michigan City, but by the time Paula was old enough for school they had moved to Gary.\n\nThe girls attended Bethune Grade School, a stone's throw from home. They went to nearby New Testament Baptist Church, where Paula sang in the choir and helped with the little children's Bible classes.\n\nBy the late 1970s, Gary's downward spiral from a midcentury boomtown was picking up speed. Manufacturing jobs were disappearing. White families were fleeing to the suburbs. Crime was rising. Like many black families still in the city, the Coopers were left in the wake of all this.\n\nGloria worked as a lab tech at a hospital. She had an assortment of health problems, none of them helped by the drugs and booze she added to the mixture.\n\n\"One day my mother be nice, the next day she be angry,\" Paula would tell Woman's Day, years later, when her story was national news. \"And the next day she be real strange-acting.\"\n\nHerman worked for U.S. Steel and worked construction, but his employment was sporadic. He had a girlfriend on the side and would be gone for long stretches. When he returned, chaos followed. Herman and Gloria were a volatile pair, drinking hard and arguing often, creating an atmosphere that was not just unstable, but dangerous.\n\nThe result, as Paula would say later, was that the girls had to \"fend for themselves.\" Sometimes, on evenings when Herman was gone and Gloria worked late, Paula took meals with the next-door neighbors, who allowed her to stick around and watch TV. Most of the time the girls had food and nice clothing. But, as Rhonda would say later, \"we hardly ever had any love.\"\n\nExcept from each other.\n\nIn the middle of all the darkness, Paula and Rhonda clung tightly to each other. They found moments to giggle together, play pranks together and share secrets.\n\nMore than just a sister, Rhonda became Paula's caregiver. Yet, through their early years, they were unaware of an important family secret: Rhonda was the child of a different father. It was a secret Gloria took great pains to hide, even though she allowed Rhonda's father, Ronald Williams, to visit occasionally. She said he was her uncle.\n\nBefore Herman came along, Ronald and Gloria were engaged. They broke it off, as Williams would later tell a courtroom, because he felt Gloria had a \"split personality.\" In short, he thought she was crazy.\n\nLiving with Herman Cooper didn't help.\n\nHerman beat everyone in the house. He beat Gloria in front of the girls. He beat the girls together. He beat them separately, sometimes in front of their mother. Sometimes Gloria seemed to egg on the violence.\n\n\"We did everything we was supposed to do, but it just wasn't never good enough for her,\" Paula told Woman's Day many years later. \"… She get mad at us and he'd beat us. 'Be a man,' she'd tell him. 'Take care of it,' she'd say. And he'd take care of it.\"\n\nThe girls grew up unable to remember a time before the abuse. When they were little, Paula would later say, Herman beat them \"for the things little kids do.\" When they were older, Rhonda remembered, he beat them for forgetting to take out the trash, for not doing the dishes and for skipping school.\n\nHerman employed an assortment of tools for punishment, whatever he could get his hands on — shoes, straps, sticks, a broom. Sometimes he used an electrical cord from an air conditioner.\n\n\"He'd triple it up and go to work,\" Paula would say later. \"It got to the point I was so used to it I didn't cry anymore.\"\n\nTo heighten the pain, Herman sometimes ordered the girls to remove their clothes before a beating. Questioned later, he denied that he ever abused the girls at all.\n\n—\n\nThis stark picture of Paula Cooper's childhood emerges from several sources; the courtroom testimony from Rhonda and her father; testimony from Dr. Frank Brogno, a clinical psychologist who discussed what he learned from examining Paula. Some of the glimpses into the darkness come from now-yellowed news clippings. Others come from anecdotes Paula shared with friends and loved ones and the few journalists she favored. Finally, there's the freshest source of insight into Paula's world — more than 100 personal letters she wrote to a treasured friend that were reviewed by IndyStar.\n\nTaken together, they amount to a catalog of horrors. Her father's beatings, Paula said, left her \"close to death so many times.\" With no apparent means of escape, she seemed to stop fearing death at all. \"I just cried,\" she wrote, \"until all my tears were gone away.\"\n\n—\n\nIn 1978, when Paula was 9, the tears were still flowing. Her parents separated, but it was often fuzzy as to when they were back together and when they were apart. Once, when Herman returned home to find the doors locked, he forced his way in. According to testimony Rhonda gave in court, Herman entered their home, beat up their mother and raped her in front of the two girls.\n\nThe incident seems to have been a tipping point. Not long after, Gloria began telling her daughters the world had nothing to offer them. Instead, she said, they'd all be better off going to heaven. On this point, Rhonda would say later, Gloria began pressuring her daughters. Eventually, the girls came to believe, like their mother, they had nothing to live for.\n\nGloria phoned Ronald Williams, Rhonda's father and steady friend. It was late. She'd been drinking and taking pills. She was crying. Herman had been giving her problems, she said, and things weren't good at work.\n\nShe was thinking of killing herself.\n\nWilliams had heard this kind of talk from Gloria before. Always, he had been able to console her, to talk her back from the precipice. He reminded her that she had Paula and Rhonda to think about. What would happen to them? His question made Gloria think. But only for an hour.\n\nShe called Williams back. Between her tears and her wailing, Gloria said: \"I finally found out what I'm going to do with the kids.\"\n\nWilliams was alarmed. He demanded to know what she meant.\n\n\"I'm going to take them with me,\" she replied. \"I'm going to let you speak to your daughter and Paula for the last time.\"\n\nThe girls took the phone in turns. They were crying, too. Rhonda said they were going to heaven with their mother.\n\n\"Don't do nothing drastic,\" Williams told them. \"Let me speak to your mother, OK.\"\n\nThe phone went dead.\n\nWilliams panicked. Gloria and the girls had recently moved. She hadn't shared their new address. He didn't know where to find them, how to stop her.\n\nHe called the operator and asked for his last call to be traced; it was no good. He called Gary police. Without an address, they could do nothing.\n\nThere was nothing anyone could do. Williams waited. For three weeks, he waited. He feared what had become of them.\n\nHad Gloria killed them all?\n\n—\n\nAfter she hung up the phone, Gloria decided not to act right away; she'd wait until morning. When she awoke, Gloria took the girls out to the car in the garage. She put them in the back seat and started the engine. The garage door remained closed.\n\nFrom there, accounts differ. Williams testified that a friend told him neighbors noticed something and called the fire department. Rhonda testified that, as the fumes gathered, the girls drifted off to sleep. They thought they were going to heaven; instead, they woke up in bed. How they got there isn't clear. Rhonda said Gloria had changed her mind. When the girls awoke, she said, their mother was coughing on the lawn.\n\nFrom then on, Williams tried to coax Gloria into letting him have the girls. Rhonda was his daughter, and he was fond of Paula, too. Gloria would have none of it.\n\n\"I'd rather see them both dead,\" she said.\n\n—\n\nThe girls survived their first brush with death. But Paula and her sister were being shaped in a world without hope. And now their mother had planted a seed: The ultimate escape was death.\n\nRhonda looked around at this nihilist world and began seeking a way out. Several times she tried to run. Soon, she began taking Paula with her. \"I couldn't take it no more in that house,\" she would say, \"and I didn't want her to, either.\"\n\nBy 1982, when both girls were teenagers, they made an unsuccessful attempt to run and were sent — together — to the Thelma Marshall Children's Home in Gary. Within a short time, they were returned to the Coopers. For Paula, it was the beginning of a cycle — of running and being returned home. For Rhonda, that cycle ended only when she learned Ronald Williams was her biological father. At her first opportunity, she left the Coopers to live with him.\n\nIf the move helped Rhonda, it had grievous consequences for Paula, then 13. Her sister had been the most stable person in her home. Now she was gone. Paula came to believe her parents blamed her for Rhonda's departure. Now that her father's anger had one less target, Paula's beatings grew more frequent and more brutal. Even as her parents divorced, Herman never quite left the picture. And his handiwork began to show.\n\nAt school, Paula revealed to an administrator a rash of injuries — a bruise on her thigh, a welt on her arm, a rug burn on her elbow.\n\nWhen a welfare caseworker visited the Cooper home, Herman and Gloria cursed at her. They blamed Paula's problems on interference from the courts, from the school psychologist and from the welfare department itself. When the caseworker recommended family counseling, Gloria said she'd rather go to jail.\n\nAt various times, Gloria and Herman seemed to vacillate between wanting Paula and considering her a curse. Paula began running away on her own. After one attempt, welfare officials wanted to send Paula home, but her mother objected. If Paula returned, Gloria vowed to leave.\n\nOn another occasion, when Rhonda made a rare visit to spend a weekend with Paula and her mother, arguments ensued and Williams returned for Rhonda. He couldn't find her there, but he found Paula. She was crying so loudly he heard her without going in. Gloria, who stood in front of the house fuming about Paula, simply said: \"I'm going to kill that bitch.\"\n\nPaula emerged and, seeing Williams, ran to him and jumped into his arms. He asked her if her mother would really hurt her.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nWilliams told her to get in the car. Gloria charged out toward them and began to threaten Paula. \"I'm going to kill you and if I don't (Herman) will.\"\n\nWilliams considered it serious business to take Paula. He lived in Illinois and assumed it would be a crime to take a child across the state line without permission of the parents. He took her anyway. Gloria and other family members threatened to phone the police.\n\nAt his home, Williams asked Paula what she wanted to do. They talked about the logistics of her staying with him without her mother's permission. It would be impossible for her to go to school. Then there was the trouble Williams might face. With tears, Paula looked at Williams and said, \"It's best for me to go home … I don't want to get you in no trouble.\" Paula's respite lasted only a few hours.\n\nEven though he wasn't keeping Paula, Williams couldn't fathom returning her home. Instead, he just let her walk away. She was young, no more than 13, but Williams believed she was safer on the streets of Chicago than at home. Under scrutiny for making such a choice, Williams later told a courtroom he thought Paula was in danger there. \"I would rather see her in the street as a slut than for her mother to blow her brains out.\"\n\nFor several days, Paula survived on her own. Inevitably, she wound up back home.\n\n—\n\nBy 1983, when Paula turned 14, she stayed away from home as much as possible. She was smoking cigarettes and drinking. She smoked marijuana almost daily. Tall, but heavy, she took speed to lose weight. She tried cocaine. She skipped school routinely. She was sexually active. Years later, she would warn others against making similar choices. But for the moment, it was her life.\n\nAnd it was a rootless life. She spent six months at a children's home in Mishawaka and three months in a juvenile detention center. She was removed from one home after only six days after she threatened a staff member and another resident — with a knife.\n\nWith each new address, Paula changed schools. She attended four high schools without ever finishing the 10th grade. Her schoolwork, decent at first, nosedived. She called a teacher \"crazy,\" resulting in a suspension. She struggled to keep friends. She developed a reputation as a bully. All the while, Paula struggled to wake up in the mornings. When she was evaluated for the problem, a doctor at a local hospital asked if she ever thought of killing herself.\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied.\n\nFor that answer, she was sent to a mental hospital. Released four days later, she returned home.\n\n\"I told people I needed help and to talk, but all they did was move me from home to home,\" Paula would write a few years later. \"I didn't care about life or trouble or consequences at all.\"\n\n—\n\nPerhaps the pinnacle of Paula's abuse came, ironically, after her father visited Gary police seeking advice on how to deal with a wayward child. Paula was 14, and Herman Cooper couldn't keep her reined in. Frustrated, he asked the police what he should do with her. It was a family matter, they said; he should do what he thought was right.\n\nFor Herman Cooper, that meant one thing: another beating. But for what he had in mind this time, he'd need some privacy. He took Paula to a woody patch near a spot where he kept a garden. Paula had been there before; so had Rhonda.\n\n\"If you scream where I take you,\" he told Paula, \"no one will hear you.\"\n\nSeveral times in her life, Paula thought her father was going to beat her to death. This was one of them. \"He just kept beating me and beating me,\" she would tell the clinical psychologist, for what seemed like half an hour. Instead of the cord or a broom or a stick, this time Herman beat her with his bare hands.\n\nWhen he was done, Herman put Paula in the car to take her home. But as they drove through the darkening streets of Gary, Paula knew she couldn't go back there. Not when the possibility of more punishment lay ahead in the Cooper house of horrors.\n\nAs Herman pulled the car up to the house, Paula jumped out and took off running into the night. Running and screaming. Herman gave chase, but porch lights began to click on. Up and down the street, neighbors stepped out to investigate the commotion. The neighbors had seen this show before; it never seemed to end. This time, though, Herman retreated.\n\nPaula ran until she wound up where the night had begun — at the police station. She told officers there about the beating, told them she couldn't go home. At least not while Herman was around. The state pulled her away from the Coopers. It isn't clear from the record where she was placed. But soon, she was sent back home.\n\n—\n\nIn the summer of 1984, when Paula turned 15, she felt as lonely as ever.\n\nAdrift, Paula briefly took up with a guy she hoped might offer her a haven. Later, she would tell others he was a rough character who dealt drugs and treated her poorly. The one thing he did for Paula was leave her pregnant.\n\nMany teenage girls would consider pregnancy a tragedy; Paula saw it as a blessing. She had almost forgotten how to care about anyone. She wanted a family, wanted someone to belong to. The child growing inside her represented someone she could love, someone who would love her in return.\n\nAnd then it was gone.\n\nGloria had been dead set against the pregnancy; she wanted Paula to end it. Paula refused and ran off — perhaps to seek help from a woman she knew in Chicago. Her mother tracked her down and, as Paula would write years later in a letter and tell friends, forced her to have an abortion.\n\nPaula was several months into the pregnancy; the procedure nearly killed her. \"She took something that would have completed my life,\" Paula would write later, \"and after that I felt I had no one.\"\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nRuth Pelke was gentle, an old woman with silvery hair and horn-rimmed glasses. As her stepson Robert and his wife pleaded for her to leave Gary, she listened.\n\nRobert pledged to do everything necessary to make her house ready for sale — the legal stuff, the touch-up jobs, whatever. She listened as they talked to her about how dangerous her neighborhood had become.\n\nBut Ruth didn't really need reminding. Her Glen Park neighborhood was still one of the better places to live in Gary, although that wasn't saying much, given the city's downward lurch. There were abandoned houses now. There were burglaries. Her own home had been hit five times in recent years, including when her husband, Oscar, was still alive. Now, at 78, she was widowed and alone, and things were only getting worse. But Ruth had been in Glen Park for 41 years; it was home. She still had some good neighbors. Just as important, she had a mission.\n\nFor decades, she'd opened her home and heart to the neighborhood children. She'd taught them the Bible using felt cutouts of Bible characters that she stuck to a flannel board. She'd given the kids candy when they memorized Scripture. She'd driven them to church. She believed these were children who needed hope, and they could find it in Jesus. No, she finally said that night after her stepson's plea — she wouldn't be leaving the home in her neighborhood.\n\n\"I'll stay here until I go there,\" she said.\n\nRuth Pelke was pointing a finger to heaven.\n\n—\n\nThe next day, Tuesday, May 14, 1985, Ruth's doorbell rang.\n\nShe answered it and found three teenage girls standing on her porch. She didn't recognize them, but she opened her door. One of the girls said, \"My auntie would like to know about Bible classes. When do y'all hold them?\"\n\nRuth wasn't up to teaching anymore, but she wanted to help the girls. \"Come back on Saturday,\" she said. And closed the door.\n\n—\n\nThe girls — Karen Corder, Denise Thomas and Paula Cooper — walked back across the alley. Sitting on a porch, April Beverly was waiting.\n\nThe foursome — all ninth- and 10th-graders at Lew Wallace High School — left school at lunchtime that afternoon with no intention of going back. The girls walked the 10 blocks or so to an arcade near 45th and Broadway where they spent what little money they had on games and candy. When their money was gone, they headed back to the house where April was staying with her sister.\n\nThey were a ragtag bunch.\n\nAt 16, Karen Corder — known to her friends as \"Pooky\" — was the oldest. More than two years earlier, she'd given birth to a baby boy whom she'd delivered in a toilet. She'd managed to keep the pregnancy secret from her parents until the child was born, according to court records.\n\nAt 15, April Beverly was seven months pregnant. She was part of a divided family with 11 children, and she bounced between two homes, her father's and her sister's. Her mother was dead, her father had remarried. On occasion, April benefited from the kindness of the old lady across the alley. She'd listened to Ruth Pelke's Bible lessons. And the old woman had brought food over to April and her siblings when she was concerned they might be hungry.\n\nAt 14, Denise Thomas was the youngest of the four and the smallest. The others were mature young women — at different places on the spectrum of teen motherhood. Denise still looked very much like a little girl. In the context of this group, some would later describe her as a tag-along.\n\nAnd, of course, there was Paula Cooper. At 15, she was only months removed from an unwanted abortion that had nearly killed her. She was tall, somewhat heavy and had the bearing of a girl beyond her years. She would be described as the \"prime mover\" of the quartet — the ringleader. But it was a label she'd never cop to.\n\n—\n\nTo date, the sum total of their illicit behavior was strictly small-time. Karen had tried her hand at shoplifting. Paula, Karen and April had pulled off a burglary a few days before that netted them $90. Mostly, the girls were truants. And on this Tuesday afternoon away from school, their immediate priority was to raise some money so they could go back to the arcade.\n\nTheir first attempt was a harebrained scheme April cooked up to get some cash from a woman up the street. All four girls had gone to the woman's door. April introduced Denise, the small one, as her daughter. April claimed the woman's husband had taken $20 from Denise and they'd come to collect it. For added zest, April threw in this detail: The woman's husband had been naked when he stepped into the street to take Denise's money.\n\nThe woman didn't go for it.\n\nAfter that failure, April turned her focus to Ruth Pelke. She seemed to recall the lady keeping a jar of $2 bills. She thought the woman might even have some jewelry. The question was how to get to it all.\n\nAs they sat on the porch at her sister's house, April asked Paula to come inside — she might know where there was a gun. For the girls, a gun crime would be a considerable step up the criminal ladder. But the gun wasn't where April thought it was; she couldn't find it. Then it occurred to April: Something else might do.\n\n\"I have a knife you could scare the lady with,\" she said.\n\nSoon, April produced a 12-inch butcher knife. It was sharp and had a curving blade that graduated to a fine point. It was a cooking tool, but also a potentially lethal instrument. Paula took the knife and hid it in her light jacket. Out on the porch, she and April explained to the other girls: This was their new weapon of choice. And Karen came up with another approach to getting inside the old lady's home: They would ask her to write down the time and place where the Bible classes would be.\n\nIn all this planning, Paula and the other girls would forever swear, the subject of killing the old woman never came up. The most they would admit, according to Corder, was that they'd knock out the woman and rob her. Still, the reality of what they were planning — to con their way into her house, pull a knife and take the old woman's valuables — was fraught with danger.\n\nAs their scheme unfolded, April stayed back again, resting on her sister's porch; she didn't want the old woman to recognize her. Karen, Paula and Denise crossed the alley.\n\nThey rang the bell, and soon Ruth Pelke appeared at the door. This time, when she answered, Karen said: \"My auntie wants to know where the Bible classes are held at. Could you write it down for me?\"\n\nRuth said she no longer taught the classes, but she knew of a lady. \"I'll look up her telephone number for you.\" She invited the girls to come in. And she turned to walk to the desk on the far side of the room.\n\n—\n\nRuth Pelke looked for all the world like the kindly grandmother drawn up in children's books. She was also a woman whose Christian faith was essential to who she was. She went to church on Wednesday nights and twice on Sundays. She visited church members who were too old or too sick to get out. She sang in the choir. She hosted missionaries in her home on their trips back from foreign lands. She took her own missionary journeys, going deeper into the heart of Gary to share her faith with children.\n\nWhat followed — recorded in statements to police, testified to in court, reported in newspaper accounts and, in brief instances, described in letters Paula would write years later — was a scene that would shock Northwest Indiana and the rest of the state.\n\nAs Ruth Pelke crossed her living room to the desk where she kept phone numbers, she felt a pair of arms wrap around her neck.\n\nPaula had put her jacket on the couch and run up on Ruth, grabbing her from behind. For a moment, the teenager and the old woman struggled. Ruth still tended a garden and did a little work outside the house to keep fit, but she was in no shape for a chunky 15-year-old girl who now had her in a headlock.\n\nPaula threw Ruth to the floor.\n\nOn a table nearby sat an item some would describe as a vase but others likened more to a triangular snow globe. One of the girls picked it up and hit Ruth Pelke over the head. Prosecutors would allege it was Denise Thomas; Paula took the blame.\n\nPaula demanded to know where Ruth kept her valuables. She threatened to cut her with the knife. \"Give me the money, bitch,\" she said.\n\nRuth looked up and said simply: \"You aren't going to kill me.\" She began hollering for help. Paula's anger rose now. Then she looked at Ruth's head. Blood was streaming from the place where she'd been hit with the vase. Paula saw the blood and reacted in a way she would struggle to explain for the rest of her life.\n\nTo police investigators, she would say she entered \"a blackout stage.\"\n\nTo a judge, she would say, \"Something clicked in on me.\"\n\nTo a psychologist, she said the sight of the blood altered her perception of whom she was attacking: \"I saw somebody else inside of that body.\"\n\nSeveral friends and supporters who heard similar explanations from Paula concluded that, in this moment, Paula no longer saw the meek and mild Bible teacher in front of her. They believed Paula saw the woman who watched her suffer so many beatings and did nothing to stop them, the woman who took away the baby she'd wanted to love. They were convinced that, in the defenseless woman pinned to the floor, Paula saw her mother.\n\nWhatever she saw, Paula reached for the knife. She grabbed it by the handle and began slashing. She sliced open the old woman's cheek. She stabbed at her head, without deep penetration. Ruth fell back, flat on the floor. And Paula went to work, cutting her arms and legs.\n\nThe other girls stood by in disbelief.\n\nKaren Corder, the oldest, told Paula to stop.\n\nDenise Thomas, the youngest, cried and screamed for Paula to quit. Later, she would claim she yelled, \"I'm getting out of here,\" only to be met with a withering threat from Paula: \"Leave and you're dead.\"\n\nPaula's barrage was relentless. She stabbed the old woman in the belly and, finally, thrust the blade deep into the side of Ruth's chest. With that, Paula stopped; she pulled back from the carnage.\n\n\"I can't take it no more,\" she said.\n\nPaula looked at Denise; she told her to come hold the knife. But Denise refused. She looked at Karen, communicating the same message. Karen knelt beside the wounded woman. The blade remained lodged in her chest. And Karen held it in place.\n\nApril Beverly, who concocted the robbery scheme, initially held back. After the others went inside, she had come up to Ruth's porch and acted as lookout. Now she entered the house. The old woman was lying on her back, her dress covered in blood, her arms and legs still moving. Karen, she noticed, held the knife as it protruded from the woman's side. To April, it appeared that Karen wasn't just holding it: She was wiggling the knife back and forth. Out of some morbid curiosity, she would tell police later, Karen pushed the blade farther into the hole to see how deep it would go. At one point, she concluded, \"The bitch won't die.\"\n\nKaren estimated she held the knife in Ruth Pelke's side for upwards of 15 minutes; Paula thought it closer to 30.\n\nRuth Pelke moaned through most of this. The old woman's torn and tortured face was too much for the girls to bear. One of them went to the bathroom and got a towel to cover Ruth's face — and try to smother the last breaths of life from her. Paula and Denise said it was Karen; Karen said it was Paula.\n\nIn her dying moments, Ruth Pelke managed to share a few last words. Denise heard her saying the Lord's Prayer.\n\n\"Our Father, which art in heaven …\"\n\nPaula had stalked in and out of the room, and the last words she heard from Ruth were something else. Words that would haunt her the rest of her life.\n\n\"If you kill me,\" she heard Ruth say, \"you will be sorry.\"\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nPaula and Denise began tearing the house apart, rifling through drawers, ripping items off shelves and upending furniture.\n\nFor Paula, it was a mad search for some reward for the awful business she'd just concluded. There had to be some money somewhere. Maybe some jewelry. But as she continued her desperate search, a nervousness began to grow inside her. Whether it was regret for the killing or the chilling final words of her victim, she felt uneasy. And she didn't like it. As they were going through the upstairs rooms, Paula tried to pull herself away. But the only place to go was back downstairs, where the source of her angst lay dead on the floor. She resumed the treasure hunt and soon managed to turn up some cash — all of $10. She came across a key and thought it might start the old woman's Plymouth in the garage. She ran out to give it a try. Nothing.\n\nApril joined in the search and quickly turned up another key. This time when Paula tried it, the engine stirred to life. April went inside to fetch the other girls.\n\nBy then, Karen and Denise were alone with Ruth Pelke's body. Karen had watched the rise and fall of the old woman's chest until it grew shallower. Finally, it stopped. Maybe April sensed some new panic; she sternly warned the other girls: \"If you tell anyone, I'll kill you.\"\n\nThe girls had spent roughly an hour in the old woman's house. They hadn't found a jar of $2 bills. They hadn't found a trove of jewelry. But it was time to go. Someone might come looking. Before they could leave, Karen grabbed one last item.\n\nShe knelt down again beside Ruth. The butcher knife was planted firmly in the left side of her chest, just below her breast. Karen grabbed the handle. She pulled it out. As they headed out to the car, Karen carried the knife at her side. She climbed into the back of the car and dropped it to the floor. The blade was still coated in blood.\n\n—\n\nPaula Cooper was 15. She was too young to drive. But with her three accomplices as passengers, she managed to steer Ruth's car out of the neighborhood and onto 45th Avenue. They were just down the street from Lew Wallace High School. School was out now and, almost immediately, they saw a classmate walking along the street. Almost reflexively, they waved to Beverly Byndum. And Beverly waved back.\n\nThis was the paradox they now faced. They were teenagers in possession of a car, the apex of adolescence. Yet they had acquired it in the most horrific way imaginable. Years later, Paula would say things just \"got out of control.\" But here she was — a killer. Now that the deed was done, now that they had a few bucks, Paula and the others seemed in no mood to enjoy it.\n\nBefore they arrived at the video arcade, Karen asked Paula to let her out of the car; she wanted to go back to April's house. Paula let her go, but not before asking her to perform a little task: Go back to the old lady's house and get the jacket Paula had left inside.\n\nNext, Denise said she wanted to go home. She asked Paula to let her out at a convenience store and she would make her way from there.\n\nWhen Paula and April pulled up to Candyland Arcade, they were alone. For a few minutes, they just sat there, talking about what they'd done. April hadn't witnessed everything that went on inside the house. It's not clear how many of the missing details Paula shared.\n\nPaula said she needed to use the restroom, and she ventured into the arcade. When she returned, five girls from school were standing around the car. One of them was Beverly Byndum, whom they had passed on the street. Her sister, Latesha, asked where they had come by the car. Paula said it was her sister's.\n\nWithin minutes, Karen walked up to the arcade out of breath, as if she had been running to catch up with the crew. Wherever she had been, she hadn't stayed long. Paula pulled her aside and asked if she'd gone back to the house, if she'd picked up the jacket. No, Karen replied. It was probably the last place on Earth she wanted to go. And she didn't hang around long enough to talk further about it. In a few minutes, she caught a bus for home.\n\nWhether Paula remembered it or not, she had left more than her jacket in the house. Inside one of its pockets was a newly filled prescription for birth control pills — her pills. She had picked them up earlier that morning before school. It was just one of the clues she had left for investigators to find.\n\nPaula and April looked around at the girls and asked if anyone wanted a ride home. Eagerly, their friends piled into the Plymouth. Latesha Byndum was among those who jumped into the back. As she did, she felt her foot brush across something on the floor. She reached down to pick it up. It was a knife. And there was blood on it. There was also blood on her shoe. Latesha looked at Paula and April in the front seat and asked, \"What you all do? Just kill somebody?\"\n\nThe girls looked back at Latesha.\n\nNo, they replied.\n\nAnd, in a response that would reverberate across the community, Paula and April laughed.\n\n—\n\nPaula and April dropped off their passengers at various addresses around Gary. But details about where and how they spent their next two days are choppy and imprecise.\n\nProsecutors would characterize their time in the car as a joy ride. But from this point on, Paula and April seemed to have a different sense of what to do next.\n\nApril wanted to go to a park in Hammond; she wanted to see her brother Tony; she wanted to see her boyfriend. When she found $40 in Ruth Pelke's glove box, she wanted to spend it. When they picked up April's boyfriend and he brought some alcohol, she drank it.\n\nPaula wanted to go to a girl's home where she had lived for a time; she wanted to pick up some friends there. But she quickly decided she and April needed some time to focus on what to do next. When April found the money, Paula thought they should save it for gas. While April got drunk, Paula wanted nothing to drink. She was too nervous.\n\nMost symbolic of their division, perhaps, is what happened to the money from Ruth's glove box. The girls wrestled over it, and one of the $20 bills was torn. Paula gave up the fight. April could keep the money and do with it what she wanted.\n\n—\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the day after the crime, Robert Pelke phoned Ruth's house to check up on her. She didn't pick up the phone, and he decided to check on her in person. Just three days before, he and a large portion of the extended Pelke family had taken Ruth out for a Mother's Day dinner. Just two days earlier, Robert and his wife had pushed Ruth to think about selling her house and leaving Gary. Robert rang the doorbell, with no idea how prescient that conversation had been.\n\nThere was no answer, so Robert opened the mail slot on the door and called inside. There was only silence. But through the mail slot, something caught Robert's eye: The dining room was torn apart. He went to fetch a spare key Ruth kept hidden outside. Looking around the place, he noticed Ruth's car was missing from the garage, and he assumed Ruth must be gone, too.\n\nHe found the key, unlocked the door and stepped into the house. The place appeared to have been ransacked. Pictures that had adorned the walls were now scattered about the floor. Cushions from the couch had been pulled up and cast about. And then his eyes turned to the dining room floor.\n\nThe cloaked figure of a woman lay there motionless. Her dress was caked in blood. Her arms were slashed. A towel masked her face.\n\nRobert knelt down next to her. He pulled the towel away and called her name. Still, there was no movement. He touched her, and the body was cold. He knew she was dead.\n\nRobert got up and went for the phone. In an age when every phone was a landline, Ruth's had been ripped from its place on the wall. He stepped outside and began going door to door, looking for someone who would let him use their phone. But at house after house, he found nobody. Finally, Robert looked farther up the street and saw a man and a woman getting out of a car. He approached them and asked them to call the police.\n\nHis stepmother had been murdered.\n\n—\n\nRobert's son, Bill Pelke, arrived home just after 3 o'clock from his shift at Bethlehem Steel and soon received a phone call. It was one of his uncles. Nana, he said, was dead.\n\nNana was the term of endearment everyone in the family used for Ruth. Bill had grown up listening to her Bible stories. He'd loved her flannel board tales of the three men in the fiery furnace, of Noah and the ark and his favorite — Joseph and the coat of many colors.\n\nEven as a 37-year-old man, he still loved to go to Nana's house for the holidays, to warm himself beside her fireplace and congregate there with the rest of the family. His grandfather had passed almost two years before, but Nana was still a magnet. She could still bring the family together. And now, suddenly, she was gone.\n\nAt such moments of shock, the brain's processor goes into hyperdrive. And some key facts rushed through Bill's head: Nana had been 78; she was the oldest Pelke; she'd had a good life; it must have been her time. But that instant of comfort evaporated quickly. He sensed something else in his uncle's voice that was borne out in his next words: There'd been a break-in at Nana's house. He didn't know if there was a connection.\n\nBill hung up and turned on the television, wondering if there might be some news about it. Sure enough, his father appeared on camera. He was saying something about it being a terrible murder. For Bill, everything else was a blur; he had to go. He had to be with his family.\n\nAs it turned out, Ruth Pelke had been dead for a full day.\n\n—\n\nBy that spring of 1985, crime was a painful reality in Gary. Its murder rate was among the highest in the country. It was on its way to becoming the murder capital of the United States.\n\nGary was a city in decline; poverty was growing like a cancer. But the violence was being spread through an influx of gangs with names such as The Family and the Black Gangster Disciples.\n\nYet as accustomed to crime as the city had become, the murder of Ruth Pelke shocked and angered people in a whole new way. There was the innocence of Ruth herself — the elderly Bible teacher. As one observer put it, she was a grandma to the neighborhood. The killing's effect also might have been amplified because it happened in Glen Park, which a prosecutor later described as a \"last bastion\" of the white population in a city from which white residents had disappeared.\n\nOn the day after the discovery of Ruth's body, The Post-Tribune in Gary devoted two front-page columns to the story: \"Bible teacher, 77, murdered in her home.\" It had her age wrong, but the dominant image on the page was a picture of Ruth — silver-haired and smiling behind her horn-rimmed glasses from another era.\n\nThe newspaper reported that neighborhood children \"were visibly upset and shaken by the murder.\" They spoke of Pelke as \"meek and mild,\" serving cookies during summer Bible classes and giving out boxes of candy to the children who memorized Scripture.\n\nAs for who might be responsible, the initial story carried some important nuggets: Police were searching for a 15-year-old girl who'd been seen driving Pelke's blue Plymouth. They weren't releasing her name, but the girl was a student at Lew Wallace High and lived in Gary's Marshalltown neighborhood.\n\n—\n\nPaula Cooper lived in Marshalltown.\n\nAs they combed through Ruth's house, police found the jacket with the prescription in the pocket. Eyewitnesses had seen Paula and the other girls in a car that matched the description of Ruth's missing Plymouth. And on the day Ruth's body was discovered, Gloria Cooper phoned police to report her 15-year-old daughter missing; she'd been missing since the day before.\n\nThe ink was barely dry on the newspaper stories when Karen Corder, walking around school on Thursday, two days after the crime, began looking for someone on whom she could unload her conscience. She had opted out of the joy ride and gone home and had a couple of restless nights' sleep. She found a gym teacher who'd been nice to her and said they needed to talk; she'd witnessed a murder. Soon, police were at the school. They took Karen and Denise into custody. And Karen was telling her story about the crime.\n\nIn the two days since the killing, Paula and April — with April's brother, Tony — had driven aimlessly from Gary to Hammond and to various parts of Chicago's South Side. They'd had no real sense of direction.\n\nTony pressed on in Ruth's Plymouth until the gas needle dropped well below empty. Then he pushed it some more. Finally, the car died. Their money gone, they found a phone and called April's sister. Thursday night, with the police dragnet closing around them, she took the girls to see the Gary police.\n\n—\n\nDetective William Kennedy Jr. had been looking for Paula Cooper and April Beverly for the better part of two days. When his phone rang around midnight, the news was good: They'd turned themselves in.\n\nIn addition to being a cop, Kennedy worked security at Lew Wallace High School. He'd seen Paula Cooper walking the halls. He never knew her name, but they'd exchanged hellos. Now, he was tidying up the loose ends of a case for murder against her.\n\nWhen he arrived at the station, Paula's parents were waiting. Kennedy asked Herman and Gloria Cooper if Paula could make a formal statement about the crime. Herman, speaking for everyone, declined. They were interested in talking to a lawyer, and he seemed annoyed at the article in the morning paper, which he felt pointed a finger at Paula even if it didn't name her.\n\nThe Coopers met briefly with Paula, then returned to the waiting room. Soon, Rhonda arrived at the station. She'd read the papers. She knew Paula was in jail. And she was upset. She wanted to see her sister.\n\nGloria was OK with that but urged her to persuade Paula to talk about what she'd done. When the police wouldn't let Rhonda see her sister without a parent, Gloria agreed to go with Rhonda.\n\nAfter so many years of turmoil and strife, Gloria and her two daughters were together again — for a moment alone in a police interrogation room. What they said isn't clear. But when Kennedy, the detective, rejoined them, Gloria gave Paula a nudge.\n\n\"Say something,\" she said.\n\nPaula hesitated. She said she didn't want anyone looking at her. So Kennedy turned 45 degrees and looked at a wall. Paula began to speak. She kept speaking for 15 minutes. She laid out the essential elements of Ruth Pelke's murder, described the girls' desire for money and a car, described how they came up with the Bible class as their way in. She described how she got the knife and stabbed the old woman more times than she could remember. She talked about the aftermath, when they took the car and gave rides to their friends. At one point, according to the account the detective would later make from his \"mental notes,\" Gloria Cooper asked Paula in front of the detective: Were you and Karen basically responsible for the lady's death?\n\nPaula's answer: \"Yeah, you could say that.\"\n\nWhen Paula was done, Kennedy left the room. Her mother and her sister left, too. As Paula stood alone in the interrogation room, April Beverly was giving a statement in a room nearby. When Kennedy returned to Paula, she was newly animated. She began unloading a rapid-fire addendum to her confession to the detective.\n\n\"April is lying. She's lying on me, so I'm going to tell you where the murder weapon is. It's at the McDonald's in Hammond on Calumet Avenue, next to the police station. Her brother threw it out the car right by the drive-thru window side. It was by a tree right there.\"\n\nFor Paula, this was the start of one of the great grievances of her life — her claim that the other girls lied. A few details aside, their stories largely matched up. But in the discrepancies, Paula saw injustice. And correcting the narrative to fit her exact version of the truth would become an obsession.\n\nThe legal ramifications of what she'd shared, in her two statements, were that Paula had essentially confessed to the key elements of the murder. She had gift-wrapped a case for the authorities. She also had put herself in the cross hairs of a zealous prosecutor. She had no idea just how precarious her own life had become.\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nJack Crawford — with a swooping, blow-dried haircut that gave him an appearance not unlike the televangelists of the era — came before a bank of reporters with material certain to make a splash.\n\nA rising star in Indiana's Democratic Party, Crawford had swept into the Lake County prosecutor's job years before, having pledged to get tough on crime. Since then, he had pursued the death penalty more than any other prosecutor in the state. In the first five months of 1985, he'd already won four death penalty convictions.\n\nNow, flanked by a pair of cops, Crawford came before the gathered media with an announcement sure to make headlines: For the first time in Lake County, his office was charging four girls with murder. He would seek the death penalty against the oldest — 16-year-old Karen Corder — and if the other girls were moved out of juvenile court, he'd likely seek death for them, too.\n\n\"I've been a prosecutor for seven years,\" Crawford told the media, \"and we've never had a case like this before.\"\n\nAs zealous as he was, Crawford privately acknowledged that same day that his chance for death sentences had already taken a big hit. That's because the clerk's office announced that the judge handling the Ruth Pelke cases was Superior Court Judge James C. Kimbrough Jr.\n\nKimbrough was a former public defender and NAACP lawyer who'd grown up in the civil rights heartland of Selma, Ala. More important than all of that, everyone around the courts — from prosecutors and public defenders to reporters and clerks — knew Kimbrough hated the death penalty. Hated it for its unfairness. Hated it for its inability to deter crime. And in a county where other judges had shown themselves willing to brandish the ultimate weapon, Kimbrough hadn't sent anyone to the electric chair during 12 years on the bench. Only once had he come close: Kimbrough sentenced a man to death who had been convicted of a double murder. Soon, though, the judge reversed himself and gave the man a new trial. Eventually, he was set free.\n\nSo, at word of Kimbrough's assignment, Jack Crawford and his team murmured that the path to a death sentence was a steep one. \"We certainly thought we had an uphill climb,\" he would say later.\n\n—\n\nIn the Lake County Juvenile Detention Center, Paula Cooper's life behind bars was getting off to a rough start.\n\nShe was no stranger to jail, having spent three months in the same detention center two years earlier after she ran away from home. She was a bit weepy then, even tender, the guards remembered. But this 15-year-old version of Paula Cooper was angrier, explosive and cocky. She acted as if she owned the place. She was a handful.\n\nTwo weeks after the crime, Paula took a seat next to two of her friends in the jail during \"quiet hour.\" Soon they grew noisy. A guard told them to shut up and disperse; Paula refused. The guard ordered her back to her cell. But as she stepped into the hall, Paula struck the guard across the bridge of the nose. She fought until reinforcements arrived to pull Paula off. As they were dragging her away, Paula issued a warning: They'd better transfer the guard or she would get a knife and come after her.\n\nThe dust-up prompted a transfer for the girls — from the juvenile center to the Lake County Jail. It also made the local papers, which didn't help the cause of saving their lives.\n\nBy the end of July 1985, the cases against all four girls were formally moved to adult court. Crawford, after sifting through the ample evidence, made his purpose clear: He would seek the death penalty against all four.\n\nThe case had pricked the public's consciousness of crime at a new level.\n\nCrawford's decision made news on the Chicago television stations; it made headlines across Indiana. The public defender assigned to represent Paula, Kevin Relphorde, was incredulous. \"They must be the youngest females in the country facing the death penalty,\" he told reporters.\n\nBy then, Paula and Karen, sharing a cell in the Lake County Jail, had been locked up two months. They began telling jail staff they were considering suicide. On cards they were given to report health problems, they wrote things such as \"Give me the electric chair\" and \"Give me that shock. I want to die.\"\n\nAs a precaution, jail officers took their personal belongings and stripped them to their underwear; they were on suicide watch.\n\nPaula and Karen responded by banging on the bars and making noise. To calm them, a nurse broke out the oral sedatives. Karen took hers; Paula refused. The guards teamed up to hold down Paula so the nurse could give her a shot. But as they tried to restrain her, Paula jumped up and hit one guard in the shoulder.\n\n\"Oh you tough, huh?\" the guard replied. \"You stabbed an old lady.\" It was less than professional, but it was a gut reaction.\n\n\"Yeah, I stabbed an old lady,\" Paula replied. \"And I'd stab that bitch again. I'd stab your fucking grandmother.\"\n\nThe jail incidents were part of a pattern to be repeated in years to come. Paula didn't respond well to restraints; she bucked authority. In such instances, she could be aggressive and hostile. A psychologist noted her tendencies and something else plain to see: Battered and badgered as a girl, she was now mistrustful and suspicious.\n\nSoon, Paula's interaction with the jail staff would grow more complicated. By August 1985, about the time she turned 16, Paula began receiving a series of private visitors. Two were male corrections officers. Another was a male recreational therapist. They weren't visiting just because of their jobs.\n\nThey were coming for sex.\n\n—\n\nOutside the jail, the stories about the angry young prisoners seemed only to add to the public's contempt. And as the details of their crime emerged, they were already easy to hate. Especially the girl who had wielded the knife — Paula Cooper.\n\nPaula had not just killed Ruth Pelke; she had stabbed her 33 times, according to the coroner. Some of the cuts on her arms looked like saw marks, as if the knife had been pulled back and forth. In other instances, the 12-inch knife had been wielded with such ferocity that the tip of the blade went through Ruth's body, pierced the carpet on which she lay and chipped the wood flooring beneath. Worst of all, it appeared Ruth Pelke survived the torturous assault for more than 30 minutes. The Post-Tribune called it \"possibly the most brutal killing in Gary history.\"\n\nIf all that wasn't bad enough, two of the girls had bragged about the killing at school. As defendants go, they were about as unsympathetic as they come. With guilt hardly in doubt, letters began appearing in the Gary newspaper debating the punishment. Some asked for mercy; others wanted severe justice. One letter directed at Paula appeared under the headline, \"She should pay.\"\n\nAll of it left Kevin Relphorde, Paula's lawyer, searching for a viable strategy to save Paula's life. The evidence was overwhelming, and the prosecutor was determined, which made a plea deal unimaginable. Paula's childhood had been bad, but it didn't seem to add up to an insanity plea. Her youth and relatively clean prior record were assets, but they looked meager compared to the brutality of the crime. Then there was the jury. Any panel drawn from across Lake County would be mostly white. And Paula was a black teenager who had killed an old white woman. All of it added up to a grim outlook.\n\nAs best as Relphorde could figure, the only thing Paula had going for her was the judge. Relphorde knew of Kimbrough's opposition to the death penalty. Ultimately, he suggested to Paula a stomach-churning strategy: Plead guilty.\n\nRelphorde was a part-time public defender who'd never handled a death penalty case. But he figured Paula's chances were better in the hands of a liberal judge than with 12 angry jurors.\n\nAs risky as it sounded, Relphorde wasn't the only person who sized things up the same way. David Olson, who was Karen Corder's attorney, came to a similar conclusion. He'd had a nightmare about Karen, he told the Post-Tribune in March 1986, and awoke fearful of \"losing her.\" His fears were amplified when he attended the trial of Denise Thomas, the first suspect to answer for the death of Ruth Pelke.\n\nJust before the case against Thomas went to trial, in November 1985, prosecutors withdrew the death penalty charge, concluding she'd been more of a bystander to the crime.\n\nBut that didn't stop the jurors from reacting strongly to the horrific details of Pelke's death. They quickly found Denise guilty. Olson didn't want to risk that with death on the line for his client. So in March, 10 months after the crime, Karen went before Kimbrough with a guilty plea. Her sentencing would follow two months later.\n\nHow well Paula understood the risks of her plea — and how much say she had in it — is now a matter of dispute. Relphorde said he met with Paula regularly to talk strategy and that the plea was ultimately her decision. Years later, Paula would recall only three brief meetings with her attorney, who she said assured her the judge opposed the death penalty and would be sympathetic to a black girl. If she pleaded guilty, she said she was told, she wouldn't get a death sentence.\n\nOn April 21, 1986, Paula appeared in court to plead guilty to murder.\n\nHerman Cooper came to the courtroom that day; so did Paula's sister, Rhonda. But Gloria Cooper, Paula's mother, was nowhere to be found. She had moved to Georgia and stopped answering the calls of Paula's attorney.\n\nWhen the hearing began, Kimbrough asked Paula more than once if she knew she could be sentenced to death. Each time, Paula answered yes. To the most important question — How do you plead? — she never hesitated: Guilty.\n\nFor the record, Paula retold the story of the crime — the scheme to get into the house; what she did to Ruth; how the girls took the car.\n\n\"We went to commit a robbery, you know,\" she told the judge.\n\nWas there any discussion in advance about what you'd do with Mrs. Pelke? he asked.\n\n\"No. It wasn't a discussion to go and kill anyone, you know.\"\n\nKimbrough accepted the plea. Paula's life was now in his hands. But she would have to wait months for an answer. Relphorde left convinced Paula had made her best play: \"We were basically throwing ourselves on the mercy of the court.\"\n\nPaula's strategy seemed to appear sound when, in May 1986, Kimbrough spared Karen Corder's life, giving her 60 years in prison. In fact, three of the girls had escaped with their lives. Denise Thomas, found guilty at trial, received a 35-year sentence. April Beverly, who conceived the robbery but waited outside during the killing, pleaded guilty in exchange for a 25-year prison term.\n\nOnly Paula's fate remained unresolved.\n\nLost in the news of Corder's reprieve, perhaps, was some language the judge used in reference to Paula. It seemed ominous. Kimbrough said it had been \"conceded by all that Paula Cooper was the leader of this group of four young ladies. That Paula Cooper was the dominant factor in the crime.\" He said Corder was \"operating under the substantial domination of Paula Cooper.\" Despite such words, the prevailing view in legal circles was that Kimbrough would spare Paula's life.\n\n—\n\nAs her judgment approached, there were hints that Paula Cooper's case was starting to resonate beyond Indiana. Jack Crawford's first clue came when his secretary stepped into his office with an unusual message: \"There's a man outside who says he's from the Vatican. He's dressed like a monk and wants to talk to you about Paula Cooper's case.\"\n\nCrawford took a look. Sure enough, in a brown tunic bound at the waist with a cord, there stood a Franciscan friar. He told Crawford he was from Rome. He offered a letter validating his credentials. And he brought a simple message: Pope John Paul II and the Vatican weren't pleased with Crawford's decision to seek the death penalty.\n\nCrawford was Roman Catholic. He'd gone to Notre Dame. He knew the church's opposition to the death penalty. But, as he explained to the friar, this was a legal decision, not a religious one. The friar left unsatisfied. He would not be the last Franciscan to stand with Paula.\n\nMore surprising than the friar's appearance was the visit Crawford received in June 1986 from Paula's attorney, Kevin Relphorde.\n\nIt was just weeks before Paula's sentencing, and Relphorde had few cards to play in Paula's defense. This time, though, it appeared he might have a game changer.\n\n\"You can't execute Paula Cooper,\" he said.\n\n\"Well, why is that, Kevin?\" Crawford asked.\n\n\"She's pregnant.\"\n\n—\n\nThe sex scandal at the Lake County Jail erupted in June 1986.\n\nFor months, corrections officers Vernard Rouster, 25, and Parmaley Rainge, 27, had been coming to see Paula for sex, officials discovered. So, too, had Michael Dean Lampley, a recreational therapist from a mental health center. Their encounters occurred even as a 40-year-old female corrections officer and a police patrolman were supposed to be maintaining security for the state's highest-profile murder suspect.\n\n—\n\nOne of the guards admitted the sex began when Paula was still a week shy of 16 — the age of consent in Indiana. That people working in the jail were having sex with a captive wasn't illegal in Indiana in 1986. After the revelation, the jail workers resigned their jobs and the therapist was fired, but no one was prosecuted. Supervisors on the jail floor were suspended — for 15 days.\n\nFor all of its tawdriness, the scandal had the potential to affect Paula's case. State law prohibited the execution of a pregnant woman; punishment would have to wait. And while a death penalty appeal was certain to outlast a pregnancy, the strange episode raised the possibility of a sentencing delay.\n\nKimbrough ordered a medical exam for Paula. Quickly, the matter was put to rest: She wasn't pregnant. But, in a sign of the times, public discussion about the scandal seemed to focus less on the culpability of the jailers than on the promiscuity of the 16-year-old girl in jail.\n\nJames McNew, a deputy in Crawford's office who prosecuted the case, told the Post-Tribune he suspected Paula Cooper tried to get pregnant to stir up sympathy and avoid death.\n\nHowever it came about, the sex scandal prompted a change in state law: It became a crime for jailers to have sex with their prisoners. Soon, though, the jailhouse sex scandal would become little more than a footnote before a judgment heard around the world.\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nBill Pelke sat on the wrong side of the courtroom.\n\nHis grandmother was the murder victim. Unwittingly, Bill took a seat on the side of the murderer. He was unfamiliar with the trappings of the courtroom. And unlike some in the community — in his own family — Bill carried no blood lust into the chamber. He thought people who committed murder should die. And Paula Cooper had killed his beloved Nana. But he wasn't fuming about it.\n\nBill had stayed away from the previous court hearings, but decided this was one he shouldn't miss. It was July 11, 1986. And for Paula Cooper, it was judgment day.\n\nCourtroom 3 of Lake Superior Court was a small space. The gallery, oriented outside a circle where the business of the court was conducted, had seats for just 43 onlookers. This day, it was packed to overflowing. People stood, straining to hear, just outside the public entrance. Lawyers and other court personnel did the same just outside the doors normally used by the judge and juries. All wanted to know the fate of a 16-year-old girl who faced a potential death sentence.\n\nInto this cauldron, Paula Cooper entered under the escort of a jail matron. She didn't need to look around to see she had few friends in the room. Her sister and her grandfather were there, but neither of her parents was present. Her mother had moved to Georgia, her father to Tennessee. As Paula entered, the matron said something that made the young defendant smile. The gesture surprised Bill Pelke; it struck him as unbefitting for the moment. When this day is done, he thought to himself, she's not going to be smiling.\n\nDeputy Prosecutor James McNew began the proceedings by calling Bill's father to testify. Robert Pelke hadn't missed a hearing — for Paula or any of the other girls. He had been the family spokesman, and he wanted a death sentence for Paula. He described going to Ruth Pelke's home when she hadn't answered the phone, finding her home in disarray and her body on the floor. He described her bloody dress and the towel wrapped around her head. When the attorneys finished questioning him, Robert asked to read a statement to the court.\n\nThis, Robert Pelke said, was a crime that deserved the maximum sentence the law would allow. He quoted the Bible about submitting to authorities and God's vengeance and punishing evildoers. He said Paula gave Ruth no second chance, and he saw no reason to give Paula one.\n\n\"Paula reveled in her doings and enjoyed it,\" he said. He spoke of ridding society of those who would prey upon the innocent. \"This is a tragedy that should never have happened,\" he said, \"and a tragedy that family and friends will never forget.\"\n\nNext, one of the girls from Lew Wallace High School testified about seeing Paula and the others on their joy ride and about finding the bloody knife on the floor of the car.\n\nA crime lab technician discussed grisly photos from the scene — pictures of Ruth Pelke, of the knife-torn carpet and the gouge marks in the hardwood floor.\n\nThe prosecution introduced into evidence the autopsy report, which expressed the damage done by the 33 stab wounds. There was also an anatomical diagram noting the points where Ruth had been wounded — so many it looked like a star chart.\n\nJailers who had been attacked and threatened by Paula detailed her bad behavior; they recounted her admission about stabbing \"an old lady.\"\n\nEntering into evidence the grisly details of the crime and the accounts of Paula's callous behavior was part of the prosecution's effort to build a case that the only just punishment was death.\n\nIn Paula's defense, only three witnesses spoke.\n\nRhonda Cooper gave a picture of how she and Paula grew up terrorized in the home of Herman Cooper. She testified to the beatings, to their father's raping their mother in front of them, to their mother's suicide attempt and to their attempts to run away.\n\nRonald Williams, Rhonda's biological father, testified that he wanted to take Paula away from the misery, but her mother refused. He spoke of Gloria's threats against Paula and of the suicide attempt.\n\nDr. Frank Brogno, a Gary psychologist who examined Paula, described how Paula's abuse left her angry and confused, depressed and hostile. He said she was prone to confusion and bizarre thinking, even drifting into fantasies. Still, he said, Paula knew right from wrong. There was still hope for her, but also a real danger she could become a sociopath.\n\nMcNew, on cross-examination, ripped into the doctor. He pointed out how Brogno had testified in Karen Corder's case that Paula was the \"prime mover\" in the crime.\n\n—\n\nRelphorde made a plea for Paula's life, saying she had gone to Ruth Pelke's home to rob, not kill. He said the other girls were intensely involved in the crime and their lives had been spared. The death penalty, he said, was applied at the whim of prosecutors. He said Ruth Pelke, a woman of faith, wouldn't want Paula to die. In the end, he said, Paula was the handiwork of an abusive home and a system that failed her.\n\n\"I don't think Paula was born violent,\" he said. \"I think Paula was a product of what was done to her.\"\n\nMcNew, closing the prosecution's case, checked all the boxes needed for a death sentence: Paula wasn't crazy. She wasn't doing someone else's bidding. She'd struck the death blows. She had a criminal record, as far as a juvenile goes, for skipping school and running away from home. And Paula's abusive childhood? To use that for an excuse, McNew said, was to insult everyone who has endured similar treatment and found a way to overcome the horrors. Giving Paula the death penalty, McNew said, would have a sobering effect on others who might be considering crime. But McNew said there was one reason, above all, for a death sentence.\n\n\"I am not seeking a deterrence to crime when I ask the death penalty on Paula Cooper. I seek justice for the family of Ruth Pelke.\"\n\n—\n\nWith the attorneys done, Kimbrough asked Paula if she had anything to say. And Paula did not shrink from the moment.\n\nShe hadn't wanted a trial, Paula began; she only wanted to tell the truth. \"Now my family life, it hasn't really been good. … Nobody understand how I feel.\"\n\n\"This man,\" she said, pointing to the prosecutor, \"sit here and say he want to take my life. Is that right? I didn't go to Mrs. Pelke's house to kill her. It wasn't planned. I didn't go there to take somebody's life. It happened. It just happened. Something. It wasn't planned. We didn't sit up and say we was going to go and kill this innocent old lady. I didn't even know the lady. But everybody put the blame on me.\"\n\nShe said Jack Crawford had described her in the newspaper as the ringleader. \"I wasn't the ringleader. I didn't make those girls go,\" she said. \"They went on their own.\"\n\nLooking around at the people in the courtroom, Paula seemed disgusted. \"Well, where was all these people at right here when I needed somebody? Where was they at? They turned their backs on me and took me through all this. All I can say is now, look where I am now, facing a possible death sentence.\"\n\nShe pointed at the Pelke family and repeated her plea that killing wasn't her intention. \"I hope you all could find some happiness in your hearts to forgive me. And I know your mother was a Christian lady, and she is in heaven right now. I read my Bible. How do you think I feel? I can't sit here and tell you I understand how you feel because I don't.\"\n\nShe acknowledged that \"sorry\" would never be good enough.\n\nPaula looked to Judge Kimbrough. But, as Bill Dolan would report in the Post-Tribune the next day, the judge \"didn't return her gaze.\" \"I don't know what the decision is going to be today, or whenever you make your decision. I know justice must be done. And whatever the circumstances, or whatever your decision is, I will accept it, even if it is death.\" She acknowledged she couldn't change what happened: She hoped to get out one day and start life over, maybe even finish school.\n\n\"Will I have a chance?\" she asked. \"Will I get a chance?\"\n\nFor a couple of minutes, Paula rambled. She repeated that she hadn't forced the other girls to act; she felt it important everyone know she wasn't a gang member. Then she reined it back in for one final thought: \"I am sorry for what I did. And I know my involvement in this case is very deep. But all I can ask you is not to take my life. That is all I can ask you. That is all I can ask is to spare my life.\"\n\nSuddenly, a commotion broke out in the courtroom. There was shouting in the gallery. \"My grandbaby, my grandbaby.\"\n\nBill Pelke looked at the wailing man near him and saw the tears run down his cheeks; the visage burned into Bill's memory. He watched the man as the bailiff escorted him out of the courtroom.\n\nIt was Paula's grandfather, making one final plea on Paula's behalf.\n\nNow it was up to the judge.\n\n—\n\nJudge James C. Kimbrough had been wading through the sordid details of Ruth Pelke's murder for more than a year. He'd parsed the depressing narrative, and people had speculated whether he had a death penalty in him, especially for a girl. Now they were about to get their answer.\n\nThere was no doubt about Paula Cooper's guilt. Kimbrough dispatched that with his first breath. The murder had been disturbing: Paula had inflicted the 33 stab wounds in the body of 78-year-old Ruth Pelke.\n\nThose were the strikes against her.\n\nBut the defendant had no prior criminal history, and she was 15 at the time of the crime.\n\nThose were factors to consider on her behalf.\n\nThe other requirements for the death penalty, Kimbrough said, didn't work in the defendant's favor. She acted of her own free will. She wasn't under the influence of drugs. Her mental problems didn't rise to the level of incompetence. But all those things, Kimbrough said, were legalities. Ultimately, he said, death penalty cases boil down to a \"political utterance.\"\n\n\"This case has received an unusual amount of publicity,\" Kimbrough said. \"There is worldwide interest in the outcome of these proceedings today. And the court is certainly aware of that interest.\"\n\nWhen he left law school in 1959, Kimbrough said, he had been \"totally against\" the death penalty — and most of the country shared the view.\n\nNearly 30 years later, he said, public sentiment had changed, perhaps because of the violent activities of people such as Paula Cooper. Now, the vast majority of the public favors the death penalty, Kimbrough said, Normally, he wrote out his sentences in advance. But this case had challenged him to the point he'd been unable to do so.\n\nKimbrough praised the deputy prosecutor for speaking \"eloquently\" — he said McNew brought the matters into focus \"better than all of the turmoil that I have been through in the last several months.\"\n\nHe criticized state law for being too general when it came to giving minors the death penalty. It left him unsure what to do on that fundamental question. \"I don't know what the right political answer to that question is.\"\n\nThen Kimbrough, in a moment of vulnerability judges don't always reveal, showed some insight into his restless mind. \"I don't believe I am ever going to be quite the same after these four cases. They have had a very profound effect on me. They have made me come to grips with the question of whether or not a judge can hold personal beliefs which are inconsistent at all with the law as they were sworn to uphold. And for those of you who have no appreciation of it, it is not a simple question. It is not a simple question for me.\"\n\nKimbrough interrupted his confessional to take issue with something Robert Pelke said: \"I do not believe the failure to impose the death penalty today would be unbiblical. … I don't profess to be an expert in religion. But I know the Bible has passages which are merciful, and do not demand or mandate an eye for an eye.\"\n\nReturning to his inner turmoil, Kimbrough said he'd concluded that a judge must decide a case based on facts, regardless of whether it satisfies him. \"I will tell you, very frankly now, on the record, that I do not believe in the death penalty.\"\n\nThis seemed to launch Kimbrough on a rant. \"Maybe in 20 years, after we have had our fill of executions, we will swing back the other way and think they are unconstitutional. Maybe.\"\n\nAt about this point, Jack Crawford, sitting at the prosecutor's table, was ready to give up hope for a death penalty. He turned to McNew, he remembered later, and whispered into his ear.\n\n\"He's not going to give it.\"\n\nThen Kimbrough directed his eyes to the girl awaiting his judgment.\n\n\"Stand up, Paula.\"\n\nShe had stabbed Ruth Pelke 33 times, he said. He was concerned about her background. She had been \"born into a household where your father abused you, and your mother either participated or allowed it to happen. And those seem to be explanations or some indication of why you may be this type of personality that you are.\"\n\n\"They are not excuses, however.\"\n\nHowever.\n\nThat word caught Crawford's attention. So did the fact that Kimbrough's shoulders seemed to slump, as if the weight of the moment was getting to the judge. Crawford leaned in and whispered again to McNew.\n\n\"I think he's going to give it. I think he's going to give it.\"\n\nKimbrough continued.\n\n\"You committed the act, and you must pay the penalty,\" Kimbrough said. Briefly, he trailed into some legalese about the charge. Then he gathered himself for the final judgment.\n\n\"The law requires me, and I do now impose, the death penalty.\"\n\n—\n\nThe courtroom erupted.\n\n\"What did he say?\"\n\nPaula Cooper looked at Kevin Relphorde for help; amid the chaos, she wasn't sure what had just happened. She looked back for the judge; he had already left the bench. She asked Relphorde what had happened. He delivered the verdict again: He gave you the death penalty.\n\nThe smile Paula wore into the courtroom was gone, indeed. Bill Pelke took note of that. Instead, he saw a river of tears streaming down her cheeks. As she was led from the courtroom, the tears soaked the top of her blouse.\n\nJust like that, Paula Cooper — at 16 years, 10 months and 16 days — became the youngest person ever sentenced to death in Indiana; she was now the youngest female on death row anywhere in the United States. In this age before the cellphone, news reporters from national outlets raced out of the courtroom to the nearest bank of pay telephones. It took a few hours, but the verdict soon circled the globe.\n\nIn the hallway outside the courtroom, Rhonda Cooper yelled in anguish at members of the Pelke family and the prosecutors nearby.\n\n\"Are you satisfied now?\"\n\nThey seemed satisfied.\n\nStrangely, one of the most unsatisfied people in the building was the source of the commotion: Judge Kimbrough.\n\nAfter delivering the verdict, he darted out of the courtroom and into the hallway leading to his chambers. There, between the two rooms, he spotted William Touchette, a public defender who handled appeals. Kimbrough told Touchette to follow him.\n\nTouchette (pronounced TOO-shay) had been among those outside the courtroom straining to hear the proceedings. Like so many local lawyers, he was friendly with the judge; they'd socialized outside of work. He followed Kimbrough into his chambers.\n\nThe judge was angry. As angry as Touchette had ever seen him. Angry that the defense hadn't given him enough to spare Paula Cooper's life. Then Kimbrough uttered seven words Touchette would never again hear from a judge.\n\n\"I want you to get me reversed.\"\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nPaula Cooper's death sentence was one of Indiana's biggest news stories in 1986. It garnered network television news coverage. Once it hit the international news wires, it was picked up by newspapers in Europe, where it inspired protests.\n\nBut Monica Foster, working for a nonprofit death penalty defense group in Downtown Indianapolis, somehow missed all that. To her, it was as if the Paula Cooper case had never happened.\n\nIt wasn't that Foster was uninterested in current events or that she was dull. In fact, Foster was a wunderkind. She'd graduated from high school at 16, college at 19 and law school at 22. She'd come to work for the Indiana Public Defender Council, researching and offering advice to lawyers with death penalty cases, even before finishing her law degree. But at 27, she had a tendency to get absorbed in her work. And when that happened, the outside world ceased to exist.\n\nSo when William Touchette, the Lake County attorney preparing Paula Cooper's appeal, called the council looking for some help, Foster knew nothing of the case. Without hesitation, Foster agreed to be Touchette's local connection to Paula, who was being held at the Indiana Women's Prison on the city's east side. Foster even said she'd donate her time, seeing the client on evenings and weekends, as a sideline.\n\nFoster didn't realize she'd just signed on to the case that would become the most noteworthy of her career.\n\nWhen the case file arrived in her office, Foster began reading about Paula Cooper. Right away, she was puzzled.\n\nHere was a black girl from Gary who had been sentenced to death by a black judge whom even Foster knew to be one of the most liberal, anti-death penalty jurists in the state. The girl had brutally murdered an elderly woman during a robbery, but Foster told the people in her office that to get a death sentence from this judge Paula Cooper had to be some kind of rabid animal.\n\n\"She must be frothing at the mouth.\"\n\nFoster decided to go to the prison and see Paula Cooper for herself.\n\n—\n\nPaula had arrived at the Indiana Women's Prison — America's oldest women's prison — five days after her sentencing.\n\nEstablished shortly after the Civil War, it was originally in the countryside east of Indianapolis. Over time, brick storefronts and wood-frame houses sprang up around the prison's series of boxy brick buildings — situated around a grassy courtyard — and now the prison was landlocked in the middle of an urban neighborhood.\n\nAwaiting Paula was a cell tucked away on the second floor of the segregation unit. It was stark: block walls and tile floor; aluminum sink and toilet; a desk and a chair; all of it packaged in a space slightly bigger than a walk-in closet.\n\nShe had one window to the outside world. Depending on which side of the hallway she was assigned at the time, it featured either a view of the courtyard or, just beyond a fence topped by razor wire, the backside of a row of decaying houses.\n\nPaula's cell had two metal doors. One was made of bars, the other was solid. Most of the time, the solid door remained open, allowing her to talk through the bars to passing guards and nearby prisoners. But when the solid door was closed, it was as if she was locked in a vault. Worse, the prison had no air conditioning. As summer temperatures outside climbed into the 90s, the only air moving through the wing was pushed by a floor fan at the end of the hall. Most of the time, the place felt like the inside of a cook stove.\n\nHere, Paula Cooper spent 23 hours a day. In the remaining hour, she had 30 minutes to shower and 30 minutes for recreation, which meant a short walk to a larger room where she could play Ping-Pong or cards with other prisoners. Meals were delivered to her cell.\n\nShe was 16 years old and, in the grand scheme of things, set apart from the rest of the human race.\n\nThe treatment was harsher than what Paula's three co-defendants in the murder of Ruth Pelke faced. They were housed elsewhere in the prison, with the general population. They had greater freedom of movement, time outdoors and an ongoing interaction with other people. Paula was allotted 10 hours of visits per month, but she wasn't sure who would fill the time. Her sister had moved to Minnesota. Her mother had moved to Georgia. Her father had moved to Tennessee. Paula was as alone as she could be.\n\nYet she faced a struggle greater than isolation and heat. She lived in fear that the executioner was coming for her any minute. Whatever she'd been told about the appeals process hadn't registered. She thought she was about to be taken away and killed. She existed moment to moment, in dread the guards were about to drag her away to the electric chair. In letters, she would describe her situation in the bleakest of terms — \"a mental hell.\" Paula needed hope. She needed a friend. But who?\n\n—\n\nMonica Foster entered the security checkpoint at the Indiana Women's Prison and was shown to the glass-walled consultation room. In short order, she watched as a guard escorted her client in to meet her.\n\nPaula Cooper was nothing like she expected. Monica came looking for the heartless killer who had murdered an old woman in cold blood, fought the guards at the county jail and been given a ticket to the chair by the most liberal judge in Lake County.\n\nInstead, Foster found a girl, sobbing uncontrollably, who had been on suicide watch. Foster tried to calm her. After some questioning, she gathered the reason for the emotional meltdown: Paula thought they were coming any time now. To kill her.\n\nFoster's blood boiled. She realized that, since the sentencing, no one had explained to Paula the years of appeals; the good chance for a reprieve; and, should all else fail, the notice she would receive well ahead of an execution. Foster felt sorry for Paula. She explained the process. Above all, she told Paula she'd never be ambushed by the executioner.\n\nPaula went back to her cell in a little better shape, but Foster left the prison rattled. She couldn't believe how she had misjudged her client. She realized that her role in this case was about more than legal counsel. She would need to offer her client a shoulder to cry on, an ear to listen.\n\nFoster began going to the prison on weekends, sitting and talking with Paula for hours. She listened to Paula talk about being depressed, and she tried to buck her up. She listened to Paula's troubles with the prison administration and offered advice on ways to get along. She listened to Paula describe the abuses of her childhood, and Foster shared some of the tougher aspects of her own. The conversation wasn't always heavy. Sometimes they talked about places they dreamed of going and about men Foster was dating. Paula, in particular, was quick with a jab about Foster's romantic failures. Even in a maximum security prison, with one of them facing death, they spent a good deal of time laughing. And Foster found Paula's laugh to be infectious. That she could laugh at all impressed Foster. The girl seemed to have some kind of resiliency. After a while, Foster could deny it no longer: She liked Paula Cooper.\n\n—\n\nBill Pelke felt no such affection.\n\nIn the 18 months since Paula Cooper killed his grandmother, Bill had lost the ability to think of Ruth Pelke as the sweet person she'd been; he could only see the murder victim. He couldn't remember the warmth of Ruth's home; he could only think of it as a crime scene. When Paula Cooper received her sentence, Pelke felt justice had been served. His father, Robert Pelke, warned him that the justice wouldn't last. On a trip to Florida they took to get away from it all, Robert Pelke said Paula would probably never see the electric chair. \"Some do-gooder will probably come along and help get her off death row,\" he'd said. Bill struggled to imagine it; he just tried to get on with his life.\n\nBut moving on wasn't easy. And at 39, Bill already had other things on his mind that bothered him. He'd dropped out of college and wound up in Vietnam during the height of the war. As a radio operator, he was supposed to take cover during the fighting and call in air support. But he still carried shrapnel in his side from the wounds he suffered. Worse than that, he carried memories of the Army buddies who'd never come back. The experience left him sick of death. When he returned home, he'd married and started a family, but his marriage failed. So many things in his life hadn't gone as he'd planned. One afternoon in November 1986, all of this seemed to coalesce in Bill's mind.\n\nBill worked in a steel mill as a crane operator. He sat 50 feet above the manufacturing floor in the cab of his crane, moving heavy loads as the need arose. But on this Sunday night shift, things were slow; his mind began to drift. He wondered why life was so hard, why God had allowed Ruth to suffer such a horrendous death. He wondered why his family — his good family — was made to suffer in the wake of the crime. It was an unlikely perch for prayer, but Bill closed his eyes and began seeing images in his mind. He saw the courtroom where Paula had been sentenced to death. He remembered the outburst of her grandfather and the tears streaming down the man's face. He remembered Paula's reaction and the tears streaming down hers, how they soaked her blouse.\n\nA hard realization hit Bill: Ruth wouldn't have wanted these things. She had invited Paula and the girls into her home to help them find faith. It occurred to Bill that Ruth would be more interested in Paula's salvation than her execution. He was certain, too, that Ruth would have hated seeing Paula's grandfather in anguish.\n\nBill thought of the Bible stories Ruth had taught and the lessons he'd learned from a lifetime in church. He remembered Jesus taught that you shouldn't forgive someone just seven times, but 70 times seven — in other words, forgiveness should be a habit. He remembered being taught that the measure of forgiveness we show others is the measure by which we shall be judged. He remembered hearing about Jesus on the cross, offering salvation to the man dying next to him, offering grace to those who sought his death. \"Forgive them,\" Jesus had said, \"for they know not what they do.\"\n\nAnd then Bill realized something: Paula hadn't known what she was doing. Nobody in their right mind would take a 12-inch butcher knife and stab someone 33 times. It was crazy. Senseless.\n\nIn his mind, Bill began to see a new image: It was the picture of Ruth, the one published countless times since her death — silver hair, horn-rimmed glasses, sweet smile. Except now, he saw her face in the picture with tears running down her cheeks. Bill felt certain Ruth wanted someone from her family to show love to Paula and hers. Bill wasn't capable of it right then, but he thought he should try. He was a blue collar guy — a steelworker — and now he was at work crying a river of his own tears. From his seat in the cab of the crane, Bill prayed: \"God, give me love and compassion for Paula Cooper and her family.\" In return, he promised God two things. First, Bill would give credit to God for giving him the ability to forgive Paula whenever success came his way. Second, he'd walk through whatever door opened as a result of forgiving Paula.\n\nEventually, the sweet memories of Ruth would come back to Bill. He would be able to put aside the horror story. First, though, he felt he had to take a greater leap of faith. He had to get in touch with his grandmother's killer. He had to reach out to Paula Cooper.\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nThe next day, Bill phoned Paula's attorney. He wanted her prison address, and he was willing to do whatever it took to help save Paula's life. Kevin Relphorde's response wasn't encouraging: \"It's kind of late for that.\"\n\nUndeterred, Bill took the address and sat down at a desk in his Portage home to write perhaps the most intense letter of his life. He told Paula he had forgiven her; he wanted to visit her; there were Bible verses his grandmother would want him to share. He also wanted to meet her grandfather, he of the tearful courtroom outburst.\n\nBill dropped the letter in his mailbox and, at some level, thought that would be the end of it. But in the days following, he found himself checking his mailbox almost daily. Ten days after he sent his letter, an envelope showed up. The return address said: \"Ms. Paula Cooper.\"\n\nThe envelope was thick. Inside, he found a letter dated Nov. 10, 1986, six pages of a teenage girl's loopy cursive, written in pencil, on pink stationery. The contents were far from a schoolgirl's bubble gum dreams. It was a snapshot of Paula's mind on death row. Her thoughts darted back and forth — between apologies and self-pity, between empathy for those who hated her and preachiness about why they should forgive her. Much of the letter was frenetic. Sentences ran on and on like the transcriptions of a nervous talker. Her misspellings and limited punctuation seemed to reflect the erratic schooling of someone who'd been on the run since eighth grade. But it also bore the hallmarks of a mind in overdrive, overloaded with conflicting emotions. Here are some excerpts. Periods have been added for clarity.\n\nBill 11/10/86\n\nHello how are you? fine I truly hope. me I'll survive, I received your letter today & it was nice of you to write me. one of Ms Pelkes friends wrote me also, I answered it back also. Im not the mean type of person your family thinks I am but I can except that. I really do. your cousin Robert was something else & what he said about not knowing if Ms Pelke would forgiving me. Ive read my bible & I know it says the way you judge others the Lord will judge you the same way. Ive prayed for your family. a lady in a wheel chair use to visit me at the jail. she said God would be pleased if I prayed for all of you, I am doing fine. They treat me ok & I am always isolated 23 hrs a day. thats how it is on death row, it is a mental hell because no one cares except for themselves. I am thankful to the Lord for them letting the others have a little time, because I've had hell all my life. so it really doesnt matter if I live or die because Im ready any time they come …\n\nIn his initial letter, Bill expressed a desire to save Paula from her death sentence. But in her reply, Paula told Bill he need not write, travel or speak on her behalf; she just wanted his forgiveness. She seemed proud of her performance in court — how she looked his family in the face and apologized. She seemed to excuse her parents for missing her sentencing. Although they had beaten and neglected her, Paula said, her actions affected them, too.\n\nAt various times, her words ranged from fatalistic to self-pitying:\n\nI cant stay here like this & I don't want to be here, I deserve a chance one that Ive never had before. but one day Ill be free even if its when Im dead…\n\nI cry every time I think of your grand mom. the others think it's a joke because you all let them be free. Im not an evil person, or what ever you think of me to be, Im just some one who is real angry, angry with life & all the people around me …\n\nIve never done anything wrong before except ask for help, I was turned away & introduced into a life of drugs, sex & crime, but now its too late for help. Im dying inside because of this but I only hope for the best for others.\n\nIn closing, she made it clear she wanted more interaction with Bill, even if she was passive about it. She would put him on her list of allowable prison visitors; she would write him whenever he wrote her; she offered her grandfather's phone number and address. In a dark world, it was as if she had seen a flicker of light.\n\nWell, Ill go now, Ill continue to pray for all of you.\n\nTake care\n\nPaula\n\nTheir first exchange was the start of a surprising correspondence that would span years and delve into the core themes of Paula's life — searching for forgiveness; grappling with remorse; her closeness with death; her search for peace.\n\nThe letters also chart the course of a relationship that many people would struggle to understand, especially Bill Pelke's father.\n\n—\n\nAfter a second exchange of letters with Paula, Bill felt compelled to share with his parents the news of his surprising correspondence: His father had once warned of a do-gooder who would get Paula off death row. Now it appeared Bill wanted to be that do-gooder.\n\nAt first, his parents were speechless. \"We don't understand why you are doing this,\" his mother, Lola, said. Surprisingly, his father acquiesced.\n\n\"Do what you got to do,\" Robert said.\n\nBill wrote Clarence Trigg, the superintendent of the Indiana Women's Prison, a letter that spent most of a page describing Ruth Pelke's faith and her commitment to sharing it. He concluded with a request:\n\nClarence, if Ruth Pelke could speak with you right now, I am sure she would say, \"Please let Billy see Paula.\"\n\nThank you for your consideration\n\nIn the name of Jesus and His Love\n\nWilliam R. Pelke\n\nBut the prison doors weren't about to open to Bill anytime soon. Corrections officials didn't know what to make of his request — a murder victim's grandson seeking an audience with her killer. They suspected he had another motive, such as revenge.\n\n—\n\nThe aftermath of Paula's case was confounding in other ways. Since giving Paula a death sentence, Judge James C. Kimbrough had been very public about his discomfort with his own ruling. Based on the law and the case in court, he said Paula qualified for the death penalty. But he hadn't been able to square it with his own opposition to capital punishment. The decision was costing him sleep. In an interview with the (Gary) Post-Tribune, published Aug. 4, 1986, a reporter noted the judge's nervous appearance.\n\nHe fidgeted in his chair. His gaze varied — at times less steady and slanted toward the desktop. He removed his glasses, toying with them.\n\nFriends who knew Kimbrough said the judge was different than he'd been before the Paula Cooper sentencing. The man they knew as friendly and jovial, even gregarious, was more reclusive, less outgoing. \"It weighed heavily on his mind,\" said Earline Rogers, a state legislator and a friend. \"That was something he felt legally he had to do but, personally, he would not have taken that path.\"\n\nSome in the legal community began to think there was a good chance Paula's death sentence would be overturned. But Kimbrough wouldn't live to find out.\n\nOn April 30, 1987, less than a year after his judgment of Paula, Kimbrough drove his car into the back of a semi and was killed. He had been drinking. The tragedy cast a pall over the Lake County courts, but it also landed hard at the Indiana Women's Prison. When Monica Foster told Paula her judge was dead, Paula was inconsolable. Days later, in a letter to Bill Pelke, she shared her thoughts about the judge.\n\n\"all I could do was cry, even though Kimbrough sentenced me to die. I felt a closeness to him as if he were my father. I have been sentenced to die many times by a lot of people and it's only words. We are all on Death Row and the last day of April his death sentence was completed & it should teach a lot of people we all have a date that is already planned & the way it will happen.\"\n\nPaula's own father had been cruel; at least Kimbrough had agonized over the punishment he gave.\n\nThe letter about Kimbrough was the 20th she'd written to Bill Pelke in less than six months. She was surprising herself at her output: \"I didn't even know I had a good handwriting or a great vocabulary until I was locked up.\"\n\nBy then, she was 17 and a condemned killer with hours to contemplate her past, present and future. Several themes recurred in her writing.\n\nLife on death row. She struggled to sleep, to breathe, to deal with the noise. \"To be on death row is worst than when I was in a mental hospital. At least it was quiet.\" She had ailments from toothaches to a bad back. Mostly, she was confused and on edge. Life on the row made her feel like \"a walking time bomb.\"\n\nMemories of the murder. Her thoughts were plagued by it. She described what she did to Ruth Pelke as \"awful.\" She wished she could erase it. \"Every day,\" she said, \"I see my nightmare.\"\n\nDeath. It was constantly on her mind, whether by execution or by her own hand. She alternated between dread of the electric chair — \"I hope it never happens to me\" ­— and anticipation of it — \"sometimes I wish they would just go ahead & do it. They continue to put this death threat on my life and I'm tired of it.\"\n\nSuicide. She seemed to ponder the merits of killing herself. She wasn't sure what it would solve but, in words that seemed to echo from her mother, she said, \"there isn't anything here for me.\" She talked about hanging herself but acknowledged she couldn't follow through. \"I know that if I do that I might go to hell (and) I don't want that to happen.\"\n\nMeanwhile, people from across the country wrote her. Some, including a death row inmate in North Carolina, wanted a romantic relationship. Some wanted answers to the plague of juvenile crime. Others sent her Bibles and tried to save her soul. Yet her faith — another frequent topic — had grown cold. As a child, she read her Bible often, she said, but \"my faith started to shatter because of a lot of feelings, hopes and unanswered prayers.

They are the win-now team, assembled with one big-name veteran after another. Cincy feels like the right call, with all their fun-loving, expectation-shattering youth. But Aaron Donald and the Rams' defensive front is a different animal, and we saw in Tennessee what can happen when Joe Burrow's blocking is up against real pressure.

It took Stafford 13 years to get to this stage. Burrow is there in his second season. Which quarterback will be more composed on that stage? It is a true toss-up. Burrow has shown the same cool that made him a national champion at LSU. He will make big plays despite the Rams' furious pass rush. Cincinnati will lead at halftime, but Los Angeles will rally behind Stafford, with Kupp and Beckham catching second-half touchdowns. A late TD by the Bengals will cut the lead to three, but Los Angeles will hold on for its first Super Bowl victory in 22 seasons.\"\n\nSporting News: Bengals 30, Rams 27\n\nVinnie Iyer writes: \"Although it would a nice story for Stafford to win a Super Bowl right after his 34th birthday in his first season with the Rams after all those fruitless years with the Lions, the NFL is a league tilting toward the AFC's young guns with the sun setting for the GOAT now in the NFC, Tom Brady. Mahomes has a ring. Josh Allen and Justin Herbert might get into the mix very soon. Burrow, only two years removed from his Heisman and national title turn at LSU, has the old-school cool swagger tied to Super Bowl Joes of the past (Namath, Montana). At 25, he looks like he's been in the league for a long time.

Maybe it’s a mistake after picking against the Bengals for weeks now, but my mind will not allow me to pick a team with an offensive line I do not trust in a Super Bowl.

A civil complaint he filed in federal court against a group of Pinal County deputies and Dixon's ex-wife says he argued that the disagreement with his wife was a civil matter and that deputies \"did knowingly and willingly criminally extort property\" by threatening arrest if he did not give up the dog. His lawsuit accused Pinal County officials of conspiracy.\n\nIn a court motion, Dixon asserted that his ex-wife, who then worked for a credit union, had assisted Pinal County Superior Court Judge William J. \"Bill\" O'Neil in obtaining a $300,000 loan prior to the canine-custody dispute.\n\nDixon, who represented himself during most of the case, speculated that O'Neil, who was not named as a defendant, returned the favor by influencing deputies to seize the dog.\n\nDeputies denied any conspiracy, court records show, and O'Neil also denied any impropriety in an interview with The Arizona Republic. Defense attorneys successfully argued that the lawsuit, which sought $5 million in damages, was legally flawed and failed to show proof.\n\nThus began a four-year saga of intrigue involving O'Neil, who presides over discipline in the Arizona court system, and Dixon, a 49-year-old construction contractor who acknowledges a 1997 federal fraud conviction.\n\nDixon and at least two lawyers subjected to discipline by the State Bar of Arizona question the integrity of O'Neil, a key figure responsible for maintaining ethical standards within Arizona's justice system.\n\nIn a court motion filed last month, suspended Phoenix attorney Jane O. Ross asked that O'Neil be removed from Bar disciplinary proceedings against her because of \"a pattern of corruption, failure to uphold the due-process rights of disciplinary respondents, failure to acknowledge conflicts of interest, abuses of discretion and power, dereliction of judicial duties and knowingly making false statements.\"\n\nThe motion to remove O'Neil contains allegations of criminal and unethical behavior. It relies heavily on information gathered by Dixon and includes an affidavit from him sworn under penalty of perjury.\n\nA motion is made\n\n\"O'Neil is accused of illegal conduct in his personal affairs and ethical misconduct from the bench,\" Ross wrote. \"It is patently unfair for a judge, so accused, to continue to sit in judgment of others similarly accused until such accusations are either confirmed or dispelled.\"\n\nO'Neil did not respond to a Republic request for comment on Ross' motion, though he previously spoke to the newspaper and rejected challenges to his integrity. He has not withdrawn from the case, but he did assign another judge to conduct an April 17 hearing on Ross' motion.\n\nHeather Murphy, director of communications for the Arizona Supreme Court, said she does not know what actions or investigations into the allegations the Supreme Court might launch, if any.\n\nDixon and O'Neil, both Casa Grande residents, have known one another since Dixon's daughter began boarding and riding her horse at O'Neil's stables years ago. In a sworn affidavit and formal complaints, Dixon said a friendship evolved. O'Neil characterizes Dixon as an acquaintance.\n\nEither way, the two men agree that Dixon worked on O'Neil's property occasionally and that they talked often. The judge presided over Dixon's wedding. Dixon says they often discussed legal matters; O'Neil says that Dixon sometimes asked for legal advice but that he tried to brush off the queries.\n\nAfter the dog incident, however, Dixon filed complaints or claims against O'Neil with the Arizona Supreme Court, the Commission on Judicial Conduct, the Attorney General's Office and the State Bar of Arizona.\n\nDixon shared copies with The Arizona Republic. The Commission on Judicial Conduct usually posts complaints online after its investigation, but it opted not to publish the complaint against O'Neil, a spokesman said.\n\nInvestigations and litigation proceeded at the same time the Supreme Court was setting up a new ethics system to deal with attorney misconduct — and appointing O'Neil as the state's first and only \"presiding disciplinary judge.\"\n\nFor the past three years, O'Neil has overseen proceedings against scores of lawyers, including the disbarment of former Maricopa County Attorney Andrew Thomas, while fending off Dixon's accusations of unethical conduct. He is now considering approval of a proposed Bar reprimand against former U.S. Attorney Dennis Burke for ethics violations during a national political scandal involving the Operation Fast and Furious firearms investigation.\n\nIn an August 2012 complaint to the Commission on Judicial Conduct, Dixon told the story of Shiloh.\n\nAccording to a copy of the complaint provided to The Republic, Dixon also asserted that O'Neil was his \"ghost writer\" in a Pinal County Superior Court motion and secretly authored an ethics complaint Dixon lodged against another judge.\n\nFinally, he wrote that O'Neil acted improperly — or created an appearance of conflict — in transactions involving a residence owned by the judge's mother-in-law.\n\nAccording to public records, Sarah Holmes, O'Neil's mother-in-law, executed a short sale of her Casa Grande house to a family friend. The friend subsequently sold a half-interest in the dwelling to O'Neil. Holmes continued to reside at the house — as a renter, according to O'Neil.\n\nIn an interviewlate last year, O'Neil told The Republic that he did not author legal papers for Dixon, did not enlist deputies in a scheme against him and did not engage in a fraudulent real-estate scheme. \"I categorically deny the allegations,\" he said.\n\nFormer Arizona Supreme Court Chief Justice Stanley Feldman, who represents O'Neil, said the judge has been smeared by a felon who bears a grudge. \"There's really nothing to it. ... This is just a plain vendetta,\" Feldman said.\n\nThe Commission on Judicial Conduct dismissed Dixon's complaints after an initial review. A federal judge threw out the conspiracy lawsuit. No other government entity has sustained allegations by Dixon, who says each setback reaffirms his belief that Arizona's justice system is corrupt.\n\nThe chain of events\n\nDocuments in the Pinal County Recorder's Office show the chain of events: In August 2006, Sarah Holmes, O'Neil's mother-in-law, secured a $204,000 loan on her house. Within months, Holmes borrowed an additional $203,950 using her home as collateral.\n\nThree years elapsed. In January 2010, records show, Holmes executed a short sale of her property for $72,000 cash to a man named BrienBrenfleck. O'Neil confirmed that Brenfleck is a longtime family friend who once lived at O'Neil's residence.\n\nShort sales usually occur when a property's mortgage debt exceeds its market value. In order to avoid foreclosure, lenders in some cases allow a homeowner to sell the residence and eliminate debt in excess of the proceeds.\n\nSuch transactions typically must be approved by mortgage holders, and the indebted seller generally cannot have close ties with the buyer.\n\nWithin days of the short sale, according to records on file with the Arizona Secretary of State's Office, Brenfleck and \"Bill O'Neal\" (sic) were registered as owners of a new Arizona trade name, BOBB Investments, initials from the principles' names.\n\nTen months later, Brenfleck transferred half-ownership of the Holmes property to Judge O'Neil and his wife, Tammy. O'Neil signed an affidavit listing his purchase price at $25,000.\n\nO'Neil told The Republic he had \"nothing to do with the refinancing\" of his mother-in-law's home or her decision to do a short sale. O'Neil said it was sheer coincidence that Brenfleck was looking to invest in a house and happened to see a real-estate ad about the short sale.\n\n\"We did not give him a check (to purchase the residence as a straw buyer),\" O'Neil said. \"We did not set a bag of money on the doorstep. We were not involved.\"\n\nAbout the same time as the home was advertised, O'Neil said, he and Brenfleck contemplated a business buying depressed real estate and reselling it. He said that BOBB Investments was created for that purpose but that they were unable to borrow funds to get the enterprise started.\n\nO'Neil said Brenfleck called him months later saying that he had lost his job and that the house he had purchased from Holmes needed major repairs. Brenfleck asked if the judge would acquire a half-interest in the residence, then share refurbishment costs. O'Neil said he agreed to do so.\n\nBrenfleck could not be reached for comment.\n\nShort sale detailed\n\nRoss' recent motion to remove O'Neil describes the short sale and alleges that evidence implicates Arizona's presiding disciplinary judge in \"illegal conduct.\"\n\nThe motion says an attorney who played a key role as trustee in the transactions, Christopher Perry, later was convicted of negligent homicide and fleeing the scene of a 2011 drunken-driving accident.\n\nRecords show that Perry was sentenced to 18 months of incarceration but that he did not get disbarred until March 2013, a month before his release, although the disbarment was retroactive. Ross' motion alleges Perry received favorable treatment from O'Neil in disciplinary proceedings because the suspension of his license was stayed. She alleges that the entire matter creates a \"shocking appearance of impropriety.\"\n\nRecords show that Perry litigated a number of cases before O'Neil when the judge worked in Pinal County Superior Court. Most were perfunctory evictions where the Phoenix attorney appeared by telephone.\n\nO'Neil told The Republic he has no acquaintanceship with Perry: \"Never talked to him. Maybe he was in my court at some time. ... But I don't know Christopher Perry.\"\n\nPerry could not be reached to discuss the matter.\n\nRoss is a prominent attorney in Arizona's gay and lesbian community. Her law license was suspended in March 2013 for four years after a hearing before O'Neil. In that case, she was accused of pressuring a client to pay an additional $10,500 shortly before trial, then withdrawing as counsel when the client refused. She also was charged with signing a false document, making misleading statements and publicly accusing a judge of prejudice because he \"just doesn't like lesbians.\"\n\nThe current case against Ross is based on Bar allegations that, while her license was inactive, she continued to practice law and failed to notify a client of her suspension.\n\nIn a court filing, Ross answered that she had not acted as a lawyer, but utilized a power of attorney available to anyone. She asserted she was unable to locate her client to advise him that she'd been suspended.\n\nIn seeking O'Neil's removal, Ross also alleges that the late Robert Gallo of Casa Grande repeatedly served as an independent \"public\" member on attorney-discipline panels with O'Neil. Ross contends the judge unethically failed to notify defendants that Gallo was his close friend, neighbor and business associate.\n\nO'Neil previously confirmed to The Republic that he and Gallo were friends. He said that he does not believe the friendship constituted a conflict, but understands that others might disagree.\n\nRoss' motion also says O'Neil repeatedly violated her legal rights in disciplinary proceedings and discriminated against her based on his religious beliefs regarding homosexuality.\n\nRoss concluded that O'Neil should not merely be disqualified from her case, but should no longer serve as Arizona's presiding disciplinary judge.\n\nCode requirements\n\nThe Arizona Code of Judicial Conduct requires jurists to \"avoid both impropriety and the appearance of impropriety\" that occurs when a reasonable person believes a judge's conduct is unethical.\n\nO'Neil obtained half-ownership of a house for $25,000. The judge conceded that the residence was purchased from his mother-in-law by a family friend. The mother-in-law remained in the home. The friend and the judge contemplated becoming partners in real-estate ventures.\n\nAsked if that scenario was inappropriate, O'Neil responded, \"I don't believe so, no. I ran it by an attorney during the commission (inquiry) ... and he said there was no fraud.\"\n\nWhat about the appearance of impropriety? \"In hindsight, would I have done this?\" O'Neil said. \"The answer is 'No.' \"\n\nUpon learning of O'Neil's remark, former Justice Feldman said, \"I hate to contradict the good judge, but ... there isn't any appearance of impropriety.\"\n\nBrenfleck and Holmes, who declined to be interviewed, wrote letters to Feldman declaringthat the transactions were proper. An affidavit of \"arm's length transaction,\" signed by Brenfleck, says that no family member or business associate participated in the short sale and that there were \"no hidden terms or special understandings.\"\n\nArizona judicial canons say a jurist must conduct private affairs \"so as to minimize the risk of conflict. ... A judge shall not abuse the prestige of judicial office to advance the personal or economic interests of the judge or others. ... Public confidence in the judiciary is eroded by improper conduct and conduct that creates the appearance of impropriety.\"\n\nDixon provided The Republic a copy of his judicial-conduct complaint against O'Neil. It alleged that the judge \"did in fact commit mortgage fraud in using Brien Brenfleck as a straw buyer.\"\n\nGeorge Riemer, executive director of the Commission on Judicial Conduct, recused himself from the case because he serves on lawyer-discipline panels with O'Neil.\n\nThe Dixon complaint was referred for screening to Michael O. Miller, a commission member and then-Pima County Superior Court judge.\n\nMiller recommended dismissal of the complaint. On Nov. 12, 2012, the full commission ruled there was \"no evidence of ethical misconduct.\"\n\nComplaints surface\n\nDixon's complaints against O'Neil surfaced in the disbarment proceedings against County Attorney Andrew Thomas and his deputy, Lisa Aubuchon, accused of unethically filing criminal charges against political foes.\n\nBefore he became presiding disciplinary judge, O'Neil had been assigned briefly to a key case in the scandal, in which he ruled against the prosecutors. When Bar complaints were lodged against Thomas and Aubuchon, O'Neil was placed in charge of the disciplinary hearings. Aubuchon asked that he withdraw due to a conflict of interest. O'Neil declined.\n\nThomas and Aubuchon were stripped of their law licenses in April 2012, and O'Neil authored the 232-page decision.\n\nTwo weeks later, Mark Dixon signed an affidavit alleging that O'Neil had privately discussed the Maricopa County attorney controversy with him in spring 2009 and had expressed bias against Thomas and Aubuchon. Aubuchon included his statement in an appeal of her disbarment to the Arizona Supreme Court.\n\nO'Neil denied such a conversation occurred and said he had no conflict in overseeing the disbarment case.\n\nThe Supreme Court rejected all of Aubuchon's appellate arguments, including claims of bias by O'Neil, which the court said \"lacked merit.\" In its September decision, justices saidshe failed to \"prove bias or prejudice by a preponderance of the evidence\" and \"did not demonstrate that Judge O'Neil's impartiality might reasonably be questioned or that he was biased or prejudiced as a result of his limited roles in the related criminal matters.\"\n\nEven if Dixon's allegations were true, the court said, his affidavit \"does not overcome the presumption that Judge O'Neil acted without bias or prejudice.\"\n\nO'Neil said Dixon's unceasing accusations had created safety concerns. He noted that Dixon's judicial complaint described an incident in which a horse at the judge's stable was euthanized with a gun while the O'Neils were at church. O'Neil said he had not even been aware that a horse was shot on his property until he read Dixon's account.\n\n\"It terrified us, absolutely terrified us,\" he said. \"I'm horribly concerned. I lock my doors at night. ... We keep our dogs in the house.\"\n\nDixon said the suffering animal was put down by an off-duty police officer, who corroborated that account to The Republic. Dixon said he mentioned the incident in his complaint because he was told of an alleged plan to discredit him by charging him with a weapons violation as a result of the mercy killing.\n\nDixon, meanwhile, says he is in hiding outside Arizona, fearful of being framed by officials in the justice system as he continues to investigate.\n\n\"I just want this (expletive) straightened out,\" he said. \"I mean, this is so far beyond a man and his dog that it's not even funny.\"\n\nReach the reporter at dennis.wagner@arizonarepublic.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/04/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/01/31/trump-impeachment-trial-senate-could-acquit-president-friday/2856596001/", "title": "Trump Impeachment Trial: Senate could acquit president Friday", "text": "The impeachment trial has ended for Friday. The trial resumes Monday at 11 a.m. EST. Refresh this page for updates.\n\nWASHINGTON – The Senate will hold a final vote on whether to acquit or convict and remove President Donald Trump from office on Wednesday.\n\nThe final vote will occur at 4 p.m. EST and will cap a months-long saga over Trump's dealings with Ukraine.\n\nDemocrats allege Trump pursued a pressure campaign to get Ukraine to open investigations that would benefit him politically. He was also accused of withholding aid and a White House meeting from the ally nation in exchange for the investigations.\n\nOn Dec. 18, after a two-month inquiry in the Democratic-led House, the House approved two articles of impeachment against Trump – abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.\n\nThe Wednesday vote will be on whether to convict or acquit Trump on those charges. It's expected Trump will be acquitted because a conviction requires 67 votes in the 100-member Senate. That would mean all Democrats and at least 20 Republican senators would need to vote for conviction.\n\nThe Senate will hold closing arguments on Monday. There will be a total of four hours of arguments, equally divided among the parties. Senators can explain their votes in speeches Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nTrump is scheduled to give the annual State of the Union address on Tuesday.\n\nTrial won't cloud Trump's address, White House says\n\nEric Ueland, the White House legislative affairs director, said while the president has advocated for a swift acquittal in his impeachment trial, the delayed vote on Wednesday won't cloud his State of the Union address scheduled the day before.\n\n\"It's a strong one-two punch to have the State of the Union with a clear vision, clear agenda and clear focus for 2020 followed immediately by an acquittal on these fake articles of impeachment,\" Ueland said.\n\nUeland argued having the president's address on Tuesday will help divert attention from impeachment. The timing of the final vote a day later is a \"happy coincidence,\" he said.\n\n\"There will be a significant public focus on the successes of the president and the invalidation of these fake charges,\" he added.\n\nUeland wouldn't say whether the president might discuss impeachment in his address.\n\n- Christal Hayes\n\nMarie Yovanovitch retires, report says\n\nNPR and CBS News are reporting that former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, has retired from the U.S. Foreign Service. She played a high-profile role in the House impeachment inquiry – testifying about her ouster amid a smear campaign by President Donald Trump’s allies even as the president denounced her via Twitter.\n\nThe State Department press office did not respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nWhile the top U.S. diplomat in Kyiv, Yovanovitch worked with Ukrainian officials to help them implement good-government reforms.\n\nTrump removed Yovanovitch – a career diplomat who also served as an ambassador to Armenia and Kyrgyzstan – last year as part of his pressure campaign aimed at getting Ukraine to announce two investigations that would have benefited him in his 2020 re-election campaign.\n\nIn her House testimony, Yovanovitch told lawmakers she had been ousted from her job over \"unfounded and false claims.\" She also warned that the State Department was being \"hollowed out from within,\" posing risks for the country's national security interests.\n\n- Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nModerate Democrats won’t give decisions on final vote\n\nMultiple Democrats who are unknown votes on acquitting or convicting Trump were tight-lipped leaving the Capitol Friday night.\n\nSen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., wouldn’t answer any questions on how she is voting next week, or what she thought of today’s failed attempt to call for witnesses and documents, which she voted for.\n\nDoug Jones, D-Ala., said that he will announce his decision in “due course next week” to ensure that he gets it “right,\" but expressed that he was “disappointed” by the unsuccessful resolution for witnesses.\n\n“The American people deserve to hear from players,” he elaborated. When pressed on whether the lack of witnesses would influence his vote one way or the other, he said, “I can make a decision. I’ll put it that way.”\n\nSen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V., declared that he wouldn’t know how he was voting “until walking in\" to the chamber. \"I swear to God. I know it’s hard to believe.”\n\nHe elaborated that he is going to “dissect” all the notes he and his staff have been taking and “then make a decision based on what we see.”\n\nManchin also said he would be speaking on the Senate floor “Monday or Tuesday” but doesn’t know yet what he will be saying.\n\nHe continued that he was concerned that his GOP colleagues \"didn’t want a fair trial” but that he “loves them all, we just disagree.”\n\n- Savannah Behrmann\n\nMurkowski: possibility of tie vote on witnesses had 'heavy' influence on decision\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, who has been tight-lipped on her final vote, told reporters on her way out of the Capitol she has made her mind but wouldn’t tell anyone her decision.\n\n“Will I share it with you tonight? I’ve had so much much drama today. I’m just going to chill,” she said.\n\nAsked if the possibility of a 50-50 tie on witnesses had affected her vote not to include them, she said it had a “heavy” influence.\n\nAll eyes were on Murkowski early Friday as she was one of the few swing senators who had not disclosed how she would vote on whether or not to allow witnesses. Her ultimate decision against witnesses led to a decisive 51-49 vote not to subpoena them.\n\nHad she gone the other way, it could have resulted in a 50-50 tie that would have raised the difficult question of whether Chief Justice John Roberts, who is presiding over the trial, could or would break the tie.\n\nRoberts later said he would not break a tie.\n\n- Nicholas Wu\n\nSenate impeachment verdict scheduled for 4 p.m. Wednesday\n\nThe Senate approved final rules Friday for the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump.\n\nThe rules call for a total of four hours of closing arguments Monday from House Democrats prosecuting the case and Trump’s defense team, beginning at 11 a.m.\n\nThe vote on the verdict is scheduled Wednesday at 4 p.m.\n\nApproval of the final arguments came after the Senate rejected four proposals to call witnesses in the trial. The Senate had voted 51 to 49 to reject all witnesses. Two Republicans – Susan Collins of Maine and Mitt Romney of Utah – joined Democrats in seeking witnesses generally and former national security adviser John Bolton in particular.\n\nBut the Senate also voted 53 to 47 along straight party lines to reject a group of four Democratic witnesses and again to reject having Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts issue subpoenas, to resolve claims of executive privilege.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nSenate trial to spill into Iowa caucuses, complicating things for 4 candidates\n\nThe four members of the Senate running for president may need to watch Iowa caucuses results from Washington, D.C., and not Iowa, as the impeachment trial spills into Monday, the day of the first nominating contest in the 2020 election.\n\nMembers of the Senate are required to remain in the Capitol for the duration of the impeachment trial, where closing arguments will take place Monday. That poses an issue for for Sens. Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Michael Bennet, all candidates with a lot riding on the Iowa caucuses.\n\nAsked about the possibility of missing the caucuses, Klobuchar told reporters, “bring it on!”\n\n“My view is the people of Iowa and beyond will understand I’m in the area. I have a job to do,” she said.\n\n- Nicholas Wu and Savannah Behrmann\n\nSenate rejects having Roberts issue subpoenas in trial\n\nSen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., proposed Friday to have Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, who is presiding at the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, to issue subpoenas for witnesses and documents.\n\nBut the Senate voted 53 to 47 along party lines to reject the proposal. Roberts already refused to break potential ties in the trial, saying it would be inappropriate because he was an official from another branch of government.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nSchumer tries to subpoena Bolton again and again. Efforts fail\n\nThe Senate rejected two more proposals Friday from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to subpoena former national security director John Bolton, following earlier rejections of witnesses in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Senate had already voted 51 to 49 to reject all witnesses in the trial. But Schumer, D-N.Y., negotiated to propose four amendments to the final resolution setting rules for the trial.\n\nSchumer’s proposal to subpoena Bolton alone was rejected by a vote of 51 to 49. Two Republican senators – Susan Collins of Maine and Mitt Romney of Utah – joined Democrats in seeking his testimony.\n\nSchumer’s third proposal added more details to how Bolton would testify. Schumer proposed to depose Bolton within one day, which Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, who is presiding over the Senate trial, would preside over the deposition, too.\n\nHouse Democrats had argued that Roberts could determine whether any of Bolton’s testimony should be protected by executive privilege, to keep advice to the president confidential. The testimony in the Senate would have had to occur within five days.\n\nBut Schumer’s proposal was rejected on the same 51 to 49 vote, with Collins and Romney joining Democrats.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nSenate rejects Democrat proposal to subpoena witnesses\n\nThe Senate rejected a proposal from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to subpoena four witnesses and documents in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Senate had already voted 51 to 49 to reject all witnesses in the trial. But Schumer, D-N.Y., negotiated to propose four amendments to the final resolution setting rules for the trial.\n\nThe first proposal was to call four witnesses including former national security adviser John Bolton and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. But the proposal with specific names was rejected by a straight party-line vote of 53 to 47.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nRoberts refuses to break Senate ties\n\nSupreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts refused Friday to break a potential tie Senate vote in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., had asked whether Roberts was familiar with the 1868 trial of President Andrew Johnson, when the chief justice voted twice to break ties.\n\nRoberts said he was familiar with the votes, but said he would not break a tie in order for a motion to succeed. Roberts said the two votes dealt with a motion to adjourn and a motion to close deliberations.\n\n“I do not regard those isolated episodes 150 years ago as sufficient to support the legal authoritiy to break ties,” Roberts said. “I think it would be inappropriate for me, an unelected official from a different branch of government, to change the result so that the motion would succeed.”\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nSenate rejects witnesses at Trump trial\n\nThe Senate voted Friday to reject subpoenas for witnesses or documents in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, clearing the way for a vote on the verdict.\n\nThe largely party-line vote of 51-49 was expected. The 47 Democrats needed at least four Republicans to join them to call witnesses. Only two Republicans – Susan Collins of Maine and Mitt Romney of Utah – had announced they would support calling witnesses.\n\nDemocrats sought testimony from four officials, including former national security adviser John Bolton and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who each declined invitations to testify during the House inquiry.\n\nThe Senate then went into recess with no clear timetable for when it will return.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., are negotiating the terms for closing the trial. The House Democrats prosecuting the case and President Donald Trump's defense team are expected to deliver closing arguments, but the length is among the issues open to debate. McConnell and Schumer must also decide how much time senators have to debate the verdict, and whether to have that debate in open or closed session.\n\nSchumer denounced the vote as “One of the worst tragedies that the Senate has ever overcome. America will remember this day, unfortunately, where the Senate did not live up to its responsibilities, where the Senate turned away from truth and went along with a sham.”\n\nMcConnell, in a statement after the vote, said there was \"no need\" to \"re-open the investigation.\"\n\n\"Never in Senate history has this body paused an impeachment trial to pursue additional witnesses with unresolved questions of executive privilege that would require protracted litigation,\" McConnell said. \"We have no interest in establishing such a new precedent, particularly for individuals whom the House expressly chose not to pursue.\"\n\nWhite House officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they fully expected the vote and want the Senate to wrap up the trial as soon as possible. They declined to discuss what they might do if the trial is extended into the time for the State of the Union address on Tuesday.\n\nThe chamber grew quiet as the clerk took the much-anticipated roll call-vote.\n\nSen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., who had been previously decided on witnesses, started the vote with an emphatic “no!”\n\nHours before the vote, a New York Times report heightened attention on witnesses because Bolton’s pending book described Trump asking Bolton to pave the way for the president’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to meet with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nBut Trump has denied such a meeting and has suggested he might assert executive privilege to block Bolton’s testimony.\n\nIf witnesses had been allowed, Trump’s defense team said they would call their own and the process could take months longer. But the House managers said they could depose witnesses within a week.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nSenate voting on whether to allow witnesses at Trump trial\n\nThe Senate is voting on whether to subpoena witnesses or documents in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Democratic effort to hear from witnesses and retrieve documents is expected to be rejected, based on how senators have said they will vote.\n\nDemocrats seek testimony from four officials, including former national security adviser John Bolton and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. But because a majority of the Senate sets trial policy, the 47 Democrats need at least four Republicans to join them in calling witnesses.\n\nOnly two Republicans – Susan Collins of Maine and Mitt Romney of Utah – have announced they will support calling witnesses. Two other potential swing votes – GOP Sens. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska – said they would vote against witnesses.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nTrump attorney: Dem. case against president 'defective'\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s defense team argued Friday during his impeachment trial that the Senate doesn’t need to call more witnesses because the case from House Democrats is defective, but that calling witnesses could permanently damage relations between Congress and the presidency.\n\n“These articles of impeachment on their face are defective,” said Patrick Philbin, deputy White House counsel.\n\nHouse Democrats have argued that witnesses such as former national security adviser John Bolton are crucial to the case because they could provide first-hand information about Trump’s dealings with Ukraine.\n\nBut Philbin noted that disputes about witnesses are typically settled before trials, not in the midst of them. He argued that no witnesses were necessary because the accusation that Trump abused the power of his office by pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rival was too vague to enforce.\n\n“The theory of abuse of power that they have framed in the first article of impeachment would do grave damage to the separation of powers under our Constitution because it would become so malleable, they can pour into it anything they want to find illicit motives for some perfectly permissible action,” Philbin said.\n\n'The Russians are coming'::And other moments from a busy day in Congress and the impeachment trial\n\nPhilbin argued that the accusation of obstruction was illegitimate because Trump was simply exercising his constitutional rights to protect the release of information in defying congressional subpoenas.\n\nPhilbin noted that House Democrats already provided transcripts from depositions with 17 witnesses, including 12 who testified at hearings. The House managers played 192 video clips from 13 witnesses, he said. And Democrats provided the Senate with 28,000 pages of documents to support their case.\n\nBut Philbin said it would be dangerous for the Senate to call witnesses in the midst of a trial because it would expose future presidents to weak accusations.\n\n“Here, to show up not having done the work, and to expect that work to be done in the Senate, by this body, has grave consequences for the institutional interests of this body,” Philbin said.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nSenators still taking notes on the floor\n\nDemocratic House impeachment managers mainly argued for the necessity of witnesses during their closing arguments as more Republicans came out Friday morning with statements saying they will not vote to hear from witnesses.\n\nSens. Joe Manchin, D-W.V., and Doug Jones, D-Ala., who are undecided Democratic votes on the final vote to acquit, paid close attention to House manager Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, scribbling lots of notes.\n\nAt one point when House manager Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., was speaking, there were at least 19 open GOP seats.\n\nSen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., another unknown vote on acquittal, was gazing intensely at lead manager Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., as he wrapped up the closing arguments with an impassioned speech.\n\nA McConnell aide handed Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, a note. Collins, who last night in a statement said she wanted to witnesses, then passed the note to her desk-neighbor, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, who said this morning she did not want witnesses. The two then whispered back-and-forth.\n\nThe chamber was completely silent as Schiff declared, “Because whether you have a fair trial or no trial at all depends on whether you're a person of power and influence like Donald J. Trump. The body will die, the clock will run down and our government becomes arbitrary. The importance of a fair trial here is not less than every courtroom in America, it is greater than any courtroom in America, because we set the example for America.”\n\n- Savannah Behrmann\n\nSchumer: There is no deal to end trial\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said he has no agreement with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., about how the Senate trial of President Donald Trump will be concluded.\n\n“We do not want this rushed through,” Schumer said. “We do not want it in the dark of night.”\n\nHouse managers and Trump’s defense team are arguing Friday over whether to call witnesses. But other debate might follow.\n\n“We are going to use whatever power we have to prevent it from being rushed through,” Schumer said. “But right now there is no agreement.”\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nTrump aides say his State of the Union has a theme: \"optimism\"\n\nSure, the Senate is holding an impeachment trial and political tensions are high, but White House officials say President Donald Trump will seek to strike an upbeat tone when he delivers his State of the Union speech next week.\n\nPreviewing the address on Friday, Trump administration officials said the working title of the annual address is the \"Great American Comeback\" and the tone will be one of \"relentless optimism.\"\n\nIn general, Trump will focus on five general areas: The economy and trade, working families, health care, immigration and national security. One specific part of the speech will deal with the \"school choice\" issue, aides said.\n\nWill he mention impeachment? Aides wouldn't say, adding that it depends in part on whether or not the trial is over by speech time on Tuesday night.\n\nState of the Union:Trump to make 'school choice' a major topic at State of the Union address\n\nThe aides also discussed the speech on condition of anonymity because it is still being developed and could change depending on the news. \"Events always happen,\" one official said.\n\nThey also would not say whether Trump plans to mention another divisive topic: The upcoming presidential election.\n\n\"No speech is ever final until it is delivered,\" the official said.\n\n- David Jackson\n\nSen. Barrasso lays out what's next\n\nSen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., told reporters the process for the rest of Friday would involve the introduction of a resolution organizing the final part of the trial.\n\nAfter the vote on witnesses, Barrasso said the resolution laying out the end of the trial would be introduced.\n\n“There will be a simple resolution like that organizing resolution,” he explained, referring to the resolution setting up rules for the trial passed in the early hours of Jan. 22.\n\n“And once that is finally gone through all the amendment process and passed then we'll have a much better idea how much time for closing arguments,” he said.\n\nBarrasso said timing tonight “depends on what Sen. Schumer wants to bring forth” in terms of amendments.\n\n- Nicholas Wu\n\nLawyers arrive at Capitol to demand 'impartial justice'\n\nHundreds of lawyers joined together in silence as they marched in a single file line from the U.S. Capitol to the steps of the Supreme Court to demand senators carry out their “duty to do impartial justice\" in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump.\n\nThe lawyers gathered at the Supreme Court to hear remarks from Barbara Arnwine, former executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights under Law.\n\n“We have come here today even though it’s cold outside, but we’ve come here today because burden in our hearts is a desire for justice,” Arnwine told the crowd.\n\nTraci Feit Love, founder of Lawyers for Good Government, said she was proud of the large turnout and those who traveled long distances on short notice to make their voices heard.\n\nRebecca Young was one of the long-distance travelers who came from Massachusetts “to hold senators accountable to the oath they swore.”\n\n“It’s incredibly important to me and to future of this country to do everything we can to try and ensure that the U.S. Senate actually holds a meaningful impeachment trial,” Young said.\n\nFollowing the silent march and press conference, the lawyers delivered signed letters to Senate offices.\n\nThe letters, which were signed by over 2,000 people, calls for senators to determine the purpose and legal standards for impeachable offenses, and hear all relevant evidence.\n\nParticipants of the protest included Lawyers for Good Government, Lawyers Defending American Democracy, Lawyer Moms of America and Demand Justice.\n\n- McKenzie Sadeghi\n\nSchiff: 'no' vote on witnesses will have 'harmful' consequences\n\nThe lead House manager, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said the Senate will nullify the congressional impeachment power if senators choose not to subpoena witnesses in the trial of President Donald Trump.\n\n“A no vote on the question before you will have long-lasting and harmful consequences long after this impeachment trial is over,” Schiff said. “This will set a new precedent. This will be cited in impeachment trials from this point until the end of history.”\n\nSchiff said if presidents are allowed to defy subpoenas and withhold witnesses and document during clashes with Congress, presidents will be able to avoid routine oversight and block impeachment.\n\n“It effectively nullifies the impeachment power,” Schiff said. “I submit that will be a very dangerous and long-lasting precedent that we will all have to live with.”\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nLofgren: White House defiance of subpoenas is a 'coverup'\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., accused President Donald Trump of engaging in a \"coverup\" by not handing over documents Democrats requested in the impeachment trial.\n\nLofgren, a House manager, said the documents go to the heart of who knew what and when in the investigation of Trump pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden. But she said the White House is hiding them.\n\nThe House subpoenaed documents about the July 25, 2019, call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, as well as: National Security Council staffer Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman’s presidential policy memo in preparation for the call; any records about scheduling potential meetings between the leaders; and any notes of concern from public officials, such as handwritten notes from former national security adviser John Bolton.\n\nShe's urging the Senate to subpoena the same documents, which Democrats think would receive more favorable treatment in federal court during an impeachment trial.\n\n“The documents don’t lie,” said Lofgren, who was a congressional staffer during the impeachment inquiry of former President Richard Nixon and a House member during former President Bill Clinton’s impeachment. “They’re at the White House, being hidden by the president. I think it’s a coverup.”\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nGarcia: Trump doesn't get exoneration without witnesses\n\nOne of the House managers, Rep. Sylvia Garcia, D-Texas, said President Donald Trump should want a fair trial because he seeks exoneration.\n\nBut she argued that a fair trial required additional witnesses such as former national security adviser John Bolton and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who Democrats want to call while Trump’s defense team opposes their testimony.\n\n“Whatever you say about this trial, there cannot be an exoneration without hearing from those witnesses,” Garcia said. “An acquittal on an incomplete record after a trial lacking witnesses and evidence will be no exoneration. It will be no vindication, not for the president, not for this chamber and not for the American people.”\n\nTrump’s lawyers have argued the Senate shouldn’t call more witnesses because the House should have made a complete case before sending it to the Senate. Legal fights over witnesses, such as whether Trump could assert executive privilege to block testimony from Bolton, could extend the trial by months, the lawyers argued.\n\nThe defense lawyers also argued that Trump’s defiance of subpoenas wasn’t an admission of guilt because he was simply exercising his rights and protecting confidential advice from top aides for future presidents.\n\nBut Garcia said the defiance suggested he had something to hide.\n\n“If the president is telling the truth, and he did nothing wrong, and the evidence would prove that, then we all know that he would be an enthusiastic supporter of subpoenas,” Garcia said.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nSchiff accuses Trump lawyer Cipollone of hiding evidence\n\nThe lead House prosecutor in the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump accused the president’s lead defender, White House counsel Pat Cipollone, of concealing crucial information from senators after The New York Times reported Cipollone was in a key meeting involving Ukraine.\n\nHouse Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., cited a Times report Friday about former national security adviser John Bolton. Bolton wrote in a pending book that Trump asked him in early May 2019 to pave the way for a meeting between Rudy Giuliani and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, according to the story. Cipollone attended the meeting, according to the Times report.\n\nSchiff noted that Cipollone had accused House Democrats of withholding evidence in the case. Schiff suggested that Cipollone was hiding information as the leader of Trump’s defense and a potential witness in the case.\n\n“He said all the facts should come out. Well, there’s a new fact that indicates that Mr. Cipollone was among those who were in the loop,” Schiff said.\n\nSchiff argued that the revelation was another reason for the Senate to subpoena witnesses such as Bolton and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who was also reportedly in the meeting.\n\nSchiff acknowledged that Trump denied the meeting ever took place. Bolton wrote that he never made the call. And Giuliani said he never made the trip. But Schiff argued it was another reason to hear Bolton testify.\n\n“Let’s find out. Let’s put John Bolton under oath. Let’s find out who’s telling the truth,” Schiff said. “A trial is supposed to be a quest for the truth. Let’s not fear what we will learn. As Mr. Cipollone said, let’s make sure all the facts come out.”\n\nTwo legal ethics experts said Friday that Cipollone appears to have been in an untenable dual role — both lawyer and witness.\n\nIf the report in Bolton's manuscript is true, Cipollone should have been a fact witness at the impeachment trial and not a lawyer, said Stephen Gillers, a professor at New York University School of law and author of \"Regulation of Lawyers: Problems of Law and Ethics.\"\n\nIn a typical trial, Gillers said, a judge would have required Cipollone to reply to the Jan. 21 letter from House impeachment managers calling on him to disclose firsthand information connected to his arguments as Trump's lawyer \"so that the Senate and Chief Justice can be apprised of any potential ethical issues, conflicts, or biases.\"\n\nIf a judge were to decide Cipollone could be called as a witness, \"he could not have been on the trial team,\" Gillers said in an email to USA TODAY.\n\n\"A lawyer who should testify but instead acts as a trial lawyer is in effect a stealth witness,\" Giller said. \"He can use what he knows as a witness to shape his trial advocacy, but he is not under oath or subject to cross-examination.\"\n\nCipollone didn't speak during the hours of debate about whether to call witnesses in the trial, leaving that to Philbin and Jay Sekulow.\n\nEllen Yaroshefsky, executive director of a legal ethics institute at Hofstra University School of Law, said Cipollone should have withdrawn from Trump's trial team.\n\n\"As soon as there's an allegation that there was a (White House) conversation like this, you should recuse yourself. You can't be a lawyer and a witness about a substantial issue\" in the case, Yaroshefsky said in a phone interview.\n\n- Bart Jansen and Kevin McCoy\n\nMurkowski says she’s a ‘no’ vote on calling witnesses at Trump trial\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, announced Friday she will not vote to call witnesses in President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial, virtually assuring that Democrats won’t have the 51 votes needed to hear from former national security adviser John Bolton or others.\n\n“The House chose to send articles of impeachment that are rushed and flawed. I carefully considered the need for additional witnesses and documents, to cure the shortcomings of its process, but ultimately decided that I will vote against considering motions to subpoena,\" Murkowski said in a statement.\n\nMurkowski was the last of a handful of Republicans who had expressed a potential openness to witnesses.\n\nThat likely sets up a 51-49 split in the closely divided chamber against considering additional evidence. Democrats need four Republicans to side with them to continue the trial.\n\nAfter two other pivotal senators – Maine’s Susan Collins and Utah’s Mitt Romney -announced late Thursday they wanted witnesses, swing vote Lamar Alexander of Tennessee said he did not.\n\nThe announcements turned all eyes on Murkowski, who told reporters as she left that Senate chamber around 11 p.m. Thursday that she was still weighing her options.\n\nPointing to her two volumes packed with notes, the Alaska Republican said: “I’m going to go back to my office and put eye drops in so I can keep reading.”\n\nDuring Thursday’s session, Murkowski asked Trump’s defense team why senators should not call Bolton to testify. In an upcoming book, Bolton reportedly contradicts a key defense of Trump’s team: that there are no eyewitnesses to the allegation that Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine to get the country to investigate Democrats.\n\nPatrick Philbin, a deputy White House counsel, warned that agreeing to call additional witnesses would establish new standards for impeachment, if the House can send \"half-baked\" cases and leave the Senate to complete the investigation. Philbin also said Bolton hadn't confirmed the newspaper report about what’s in his manuscript.\n\nTrump has denied telling Bolton that the Ukraine aid was tied to investigations but ordered him not to testify in the House’s investigation.\n\n- Marueen Groppe\n\nMore Bolton book reports drop before trial\n\nAs senators prepare for a pivotal day in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, The New York Times reported new alleged details about the president's involvement in Ukraine.\n\nIn former national security adviser John Bolton’s upcoming book, he wrote that Trump asked him in May to make sure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky would meet with Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani to talk about the investigations Trump wanted, the Times reported.\n\nThat request was made during an Oval Office meeting that included Giuliani, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and Pat Cipollone, the White House counsel leading Trump’s defense team in the Senate impeachment trial.\n\nThe Times was first to report earlier that Bolton describes in the book how Trump said in August that he wanted to continue the suspension of $391 million in military assistance to Ukraine until the country helped investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nJohn Bolton:Bolton alerted top Democrat to 'improper' Yovanovitch's ouster after he left White House\n\nSenators will vote today on whether to hear from Bolton or other witnesses. Bolton could contradict a key defense of Trump’s team: that there are no eyewitnesses to the allegation that Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine to get the country to investigate Democrats.\n\n“No matter what the results of today’s vote, I believe the truth will eventually come out,” warned Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. “We could vote to see the truth in this trial, or it could come out in a few weeks or a few months. And on that day, every Republican who voted to hide the truth in an impeachment trial of the president, will have to answer for it.”\n\nTrump, in a statement, denied Bolton's claim:\n\n\"I never instructed John Bolton to set up a meeting for Rudy Giuliani, one of the greatest corruption fighters in America and by far the greatest mayor in the history of NYC, to meet with President Zelensky. That meeting never happened.\"\n\n- Maureen Groppe and David Jackson\n\nSen. Sherrod Brown: GOP colleagues have ‘fear in their eyes’\n\nFor weeks, Republican senators have presented a largely unified front in public: President Donald Trump did nothing wrong regarding Ukraine and he should never have been impeached.\n\nBut Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown said he senses something different behind closed doors: many are afraid to say anything critical.\n\n“I’ve spoken to lots of Republicans, as my colleagues have, talking to them about this,” the Ohio lawmaker told reporters at a morning news conference. “We know what they say about this president in private. We know the fear in their eyes about voting against this president,”\n\nBrown said he’s talked to his GOP colleagues about his concerns that acquittal will encourage Trump to become “unhinged,” and that he’ll continue engaging in “reckless” foreign policy and try to steal the 2020 election.\n\n“I ask my colleagues and all they do is shrug,” he said. “They know better.”\n\nAt the same news conference, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer called Trump a \"vindictive nasty president'\" who goes after anyone who opposes him.\n\n- Ledyard King\n\nGOP Sen. Mike Enzi was only senator not to submit question\n\nSenators just spent 16 grueling hours over two full days posing dozens of questions to Democratic House managers and President Donald Trump’s defense team during the impeachment trial.\n\nOnly one senator decided not to submit any: Republican Mike Enzi of Wyoming.\n\nThere was no reason to, his spokeswoman Rachel Vliem responded in an email when asked why.\n\n“Senator Enzi didn’t submit any questions because he felt that the questions he had were asked by his colleagues,” she wrote.\n\n- Ledyard King\n\nAll eyes on Murkowski as decisions looms on witnesses\n\nAfter three pivotal Republican senators indicated Thursday night whether they would vote to call witnesses in President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial, all eyes turned to another Republican, Sen. Lisa Murkowski.\n\nAnd the Alaska senator was turning to Visine.\n\n“I’m going to go back to my office and put eye drops in so I can keep reading,” Murkowski told reporters as she left the Senate, pointing to two volumes of notes she’d taken during the trial. “I’ve been forming a lot of thoughts so that’s going to be my job now at almost 11:00.”\n\nSen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., had just announced that he would not join with Democrats in Friday’s vote on whether to extend the trial by issuing subpoenas for witnesses and documents.\n\n“There is no need for more evidence to prove something that has already been proven and that does not meet the United States Constitution’s high bar for an impeachable offense,\" Alexander said.\n\nTwo other key GOP senators – Maine’s Susan Collins and Utah’s Mitt Romney – had said they did want to learn more.\n\n“I believe hearing from certain witnesses would give each side the opportunity to more fully and fairly make their case, resolve any ambiguities, and provide additional clarity,” Collins said.\n\nBecause a majority of the Senate sets policy in the trial, the 47 Senate Democrats need at least four of the 53 Republicans to support subpoenas to summon witnesses or seek documents, as House managers have urged.\n\nIf Murkowski votes for witnesses and no other senator crosses party lines, that would set up a 50-50 tie. It's not clear whether Chief Justice John Roberts, who is presiding over the trial, would break the tie.\n\nIf Murkowski decides she’s heard enough, that likely sets up a 51-49 vote against witnesses.\n\nMurkowski offered a hint about her thinking when she asked Trump's defense team Thursday why the Senate shouldn't call Bolton.\n\n\"This dispute about material facts weighs in favor of calling additional witnesses with direct knowledge,\" Murkowski said in the written question, read by Roberts.\n\nIn an upcoming book, Bolton reportedly contradicts a key aspect of Trump’s defense argued by his lawyers in the Senate trial: that there are no witnesses who have linked Trump’s withholding of military aid to Ukraine to investigations of former Vice President Joe Biden, his son Hunter Biden or a debunked theory about Ukraine meddling in the 2016 U.S. election.\n\nPatrick Philbin, a deputy White House counsel, warned that agreeing to call additional witnesses would establish new standards for impeachment, if the House can send \"half-baked\" cases and leave the Senate to complete the investigation. Philbin also said Bolton hadn't confirmed the newspaper report.\n\n“It will do grave damage to this body as an institution to say that the proceedings in the House don’t have to really be complete,\" Philbin said. “That’s not the way that this chamber should allow impeachments to be presented to it.”\n\nTrump has denied telling Bolton that the Ukraine aid was tied to investigations but ordered him not to testify in the House’s investigation.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nPompeo demurs on White House visit for Ukraine's Zelensky\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky both insisted Friday that the impeachment of President Donald Trump had not soured U.S.-Ukraine relations.\n\n\"It seems to me it’s the other way around. We have excellent relations between our countries,\" Zelensky said during a joint news conference with Pompeo in Ukraine's capital, Kyiv.\n\nPompeo described Ukraine as a \"bulwark between freedom and authoritarianism in Eastern Europe,\" but he demurred when asked if Trump would invite Zelensky to Washington for a coveted White House meeting.\n\n\"We’ll find the right time,\" Pompeo said. \"President Zelensky will be welcome to come to Washington when we have an opportunity to do good things for both the Ukrainian people and the American people. We’ll get it done.\"\n\nAfter his election last year, Zelensky sought a White House meeting as a show of U.S. support as Ukraine battles Russian aggression. Although Trump told Zelensky he would invite him, White House officials never gave Ukrainian officials a date.\n\nIn the article of impeachment charging Trump with abuse of power, House Democrats have accused Trump of using a White House visit and U.S. military assistance as leverage in his effort to coerce Zelensky into opening investigations into a political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nOn Friday, Pompeo denied the Trump administration has set any conditions on Ukraine. And during his impeachment trial in the Senate, Trump's defense lawyers have stressed that Zelensky had a personal meeting with Trump last fall as the Ukraine controversy was dominating headlines; the two leaders met on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York.\n\n– Deirdre Shesgreen and Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nTrump: Trial 'very boring to watch'\n\nThe TV critic in chief has issued his review of his Senate impeachment trial.\n\n“It’s very boring to watch,” President Donald Trump told Fox News Thursday night. “I have to say that it’s very boring.”\n\nTrump, a former reality television star, told Fox News’ Peter Doocy that he has watched “a little bit” of the trial.\n\nAsked if he has any concern about the trial, Trump responded that he has “great confidence in the Republicans and the Republican Senate.\"\n\n“And I know they’re going to be fair,” Trump said.\n\nThe GOP controls the Senate, with a 53-47 advantage over Democrats in the chamber.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nReport: Bolton encourages others to speak their truth\n\nAs the Senate gets ready to decide whether to hear from former national security adviser John Bolton in President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial, Bolton reportedly encouraged others who have served Trump not to be afraid to speak out.\n\nTelevision station KXAN in Austin, Texas., reported that Bolton spoke at a private event there where he defended former diplomatic and state department officials who testified during the House impeachment inquiry.\n\nBolton also said that others should feel free to talk without retribution, the station reported. Testifying to what they think is true is the exact opposite of being destructive to the system of government, he reportedly said.\n\nBolton's soon-to-be-published book reportedly alleges Trump demanded Ukraine investigate Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, in exchange for foreign aid.\n\nWhite House security officials this week threatened to block the book’s publication unless Bolton deletes information they deemed classified.\n\nBolton’s attorney has disputed that anything in the book “could reasonably be considered classified.”\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nJudgment day for Trump?\n\nFriday is shaping up to be judgment day for President Donald Trump.\n\nThe GOP-controlled Senate could wrap up the impeachment trial for Trump and acquit him, or decide to prolong the proceedings – possibly for weeks – by calling witnesses to testify. That would postpone a final vote on whether to remove him from office.\n\nThursday ended with the second round of questions being asked but with no certainty to how senators would vote on adding witnesses.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and other GOP leaders have balked at the idea of more witnesses, notably John Bolton. In his forthcoming book, Trump's former national security adviser writes that the president told him to withhold military aid to Ukraine until Ukraine announced political investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nDefense line:Trump lawyer Dershowitz argues president can't be impeached for an act he thinks will help his reelection\n\nDemocrats, who control 47 of the chamber's 100 seats, have been trying to convince at least four Republican senators to join them in demanding Bolton and other administration witnesses appear to discuss the president's conduct regarding Ukraine.\n\nIf Democrats fail, the third impeachment of a president in U.S. history will end like the previous two.\n\nThe House on Dec. 18 impeached Trump on two articles – abuse of power and obstruction of Congress – after hearings by the House Intelligence and Judiciary Committees into whether he tried to leverage the aid to Ukraine in exchange for digging up dirt on the Bidens.\n\nThe Senate trial began Jan. 21 with House Democratic lawmakers acting as prosecutors laying out the case against Trump over three days. Trump's lawyers then began their defense of the president on Saturday and wrapped up Tuesday. As required by Senate rules, both sides – Republican and Democratic senators – were given a chance to pose follow-up questions to the Democratic House managers and Trump's defense team on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nTrue or false?:Senate impeachment trial: Fact-checking opening arguments of Trump's defense team\n\nTrump has denied any wrongdoing, saying he had a duty to make sure any country receiving aid is meeting its obligations and that impeachment over this issue would weaken any president's ability to carry out policy. His lawyers and political allies also say this impeachment effort lacks merit because no specific crime is being alleged.\n\nDemocrats contend Trump never cared about corruption in Ukraine until he saw Joe Biden emerge as the biggest threat to his 2020 reelection. The withholding of money in order to get Ukraine to announce the investigations and weaken Biden in the process is exactly the kind of \"high crime\" that the nation's founding fathers were referencing when they created the impeachment mechanism.\n\nWhatever the outcome, the process has left raw feelings on both sides of the aisle.\n\n“Like war, impeachment is hell, or at least presidential impeachment is hell,\" Trump lawyer Ken Starr, who led the investigation that led to Bill Clinton's impeachment more than 20 years ago, told senators Monday. \"Those of us who lived through the Clinton impeachment, including members of this body, full well understand that a president impeachment is tantamount to domestic war.\"\n\n– Ledyard King", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/01/24/impeachment-democrats-wrap-up-opening-arguments-trump-trial/4557691002/", "title": "Schiff ends Democrat arguments with warning, Trump's lawyers to ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – House Democrats completed their three days of opening arguments in the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump by itemizing his alleged misconduct, but without clearly recruiting Republicans to support subpoenaing witnesses or convicting the president to remove him from office.\n\nThe lead manager, Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., charged that Trump abused the power of his office by withholding $391 million in vital military aid for Ukraine in a scheme to cheat in the 2020 election by pressuring the country to investigate his rival, former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nBut Schiff warned that the second accusation of obstruction of Congress will echo beyond impeachment – if Trump isn’t convicted and removed from office – because the president defied all subpoenas during the House inquiry.\n\n“In the history of the republic, no president ever ordered the complete defiance of an impeachment inquiry,” Schiff said. “Ukraine will survive and so will we, but that will be an unending injury to this country because the balance of power that our founders set out will never be the same.”\n\nTrump’s defense team will have up to 24 hours spread over three days to make their case starting Saturday. Jay Sekulow, a private lawyer defending Trump, said the team will refute the Democratic arguments and make an argument supporting the president.\n\n“We’re going to put on I believe without question a compelling case,” Sekulow said.\n\nTrump’s conviction has always been unlikely because it would require a two-thirds vote in a chamber with 53 Republicans and 47 Democrats. But Democrats had hoped to win support from at least four Republicans joining them in a 51-vote majority to subpoena witnesses such as former national security adviser John Bolton and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney.\n\nVotes on witnesses are expected after the Trump team’s presentation and then up to 16 hours of written questions posed by senators to both sides. But no Republicans stepped forward to support subpoenas after the arguments from the seven House prosecutors, who are called managers.\n\n“I’m not going to be requesting any additional witnesses, especially when they say the evidence is overwhelming and the facts are undisputed,” said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. “In the world I've grew up in, that means there's no need for additional witnesses.”\n\nRather than take more time in the trial to call witnesses, Republicans turned their attention to acquitting Trump and moving on.\n\n“I personally am in favor of a motion to acquit or convict,\" said Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind. \"I think the former is what’s going to happen because the case has not been made.\"\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nGOP senators slam Schiff speech\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., made an impassioned plea to Republicans to put country over party and to think about their own values rather than politics, but some of his points drew mixed reactions from the senators.\n\nWhen Schiff referenced a CBS report that a Trump confidante had told senators not vote against him or \"your head would be on a pike,\" Republican senators audibly voiced their disapproval, one of the first times in the trial.\n\n\"That's not true,\" Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, could be heard saying, along with several other senators.\n\nShe shook her head in disapproval.\n\nSen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., laughed at the remark, pulled out his fidget spinner, and started twirling it.\n\nSen. James Lankford, R-Okla., denied that Republicans had been told by Trump that their heads would be on a pike.\n\n“That is completely, totally false,” Lankford said. “All of us were shaking our heads.”\n\nLankford said it was an example of Schiff weaving facts and fiction together for his narrative of the case.\n\n“To cap it off that all these Republicans live in fear of the president, that their head will be on a pike,” Lankford said. “Not true.”\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, told reporters that Schiff \"lost me there\" when he brought up the pike comment, according to National Public Radio. But she said she did not mean that Schiff had lost her vote on whether to call witnesses or on the verdict. She said she is waiting to hear Trump's defense team before making her decisions.\n\nSen. Joe Manchin, a moderate Democrat from West Virginia, said Schiff “could have used a different metaphor.” He said all his friends and colleagues across the aisle said it was not true, so “I believe them.\"\n\n– Nicholas Wu and Bart Jansen\n\nSchiff expects to be attacked by defense team\n\nWhen President Trump’s team takes the floor, Rep. Adam Schiff expects the defense to go after Schiff’s dramatic representation of Trump’s July phone call that he gave during a House hearing on the whistleblower complaint.\n\nIn Schiff’s closing remarks Friday, he said the defense team will likely attack the impeachment managers as terrible people, “especially that Schiff guy” who “mocked the president.”\n\nSchiff said he learned something significant by distilling Trump’s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into what he called “the essence of what the president communicates.”\n\n“For a man who loves to mock others, he does not like to be mocked,” Schiff said. “Turns out he has a pretty thin skin. Who would have thought it?”\n\nAfter Schiff’s rendition at that September hearing, Trump suggested that Schiff should be arrested for “treason” and charged with “lying to Congress.”\n\nSchiff told senators that when they hear attacks on him and other managers, they should ask themselves “from what do they want to distract my attention?”\n\nWhat they don’t want you to do, Schiff said, is to “consider the president’s misconduct.”\n\n- Maureen Groppe\n\nThune: 'neither side wants any kind of closed session'\n\nDuring a break in trial proceedings, Republican senators suggested closed sessions would be kept to a minimum next week.\n\nThe resolution setting up rules for the trial allowed for senators to deliberate behind closed doors.\n\nSen. John Thune, R-S.D., the number-two Republican, told reporters, “neither side wants any kind of closed session.”\n\nSen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said he hoped there would be no closed sessions.\n\n“Going into closed session sort of invites suspicion and skepticism,” Cornyn said. “I think one of the advantages of this process compared to what the House did is, everything's transparent and the American people can see everything.”\n\n- Nicholas Wu\n\nLofgren: Nixon allowed witnesses to testify, unlike Trump\n\nHow much has President Trump stonewalled Congress? None of the other presidents who faced impeachment took the “extreme step” of stopping witnesses, argued California Rep. Zoe Lofgren, one of the House impeachment managers.\n\nEven President Richard Nixon let his senior staff testify, she said. She displayed a quote from Nixon saying all members of the White House staff would appear voluntarily, when requested, and will “answer fully” all proper questions.\n\nTrump, by contrast, called the impeachment inquiry invalid and directed executive branch employees to defy subpoenas, she said.\n\n“No president ever used the official power of his office to prevent witnesses from giving testimony to Congress in such a blanked and indiscriminate manner,” Lofgren said. “There is no telling how many government officials would have come forward if the president hadn’t issued this order.”\n\nFor example, Lofgren said, Trump stopped the testimony of officials in the budget office who were at the center of the president’s efforts to block congressionally approved aid to Ukraine.\n\n“If the Senate is prepared to accept that,” Lofgren said, “it will mean that not only President Trump, but all presidents after him will have veto power over Congress’ ability to conduct oversight.”\n\n- Maureen Groppe\n\nAfter interview, Pompeo cursed at NPR reporter, yelled\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo used the \"F-word\" and other expletives after a testy interview with a National Public Radio host on Friday, the news outlet said Friday.\n\nPompeo unloaded on NPR's Mary Louise Kelly after an interview in which she questioned him on Ukraine, Iran, and a host of other hot-button issues. He grew extremely irritated by Kelly's Ukraine questions, according to NPR.\n\n\"'Do you think Americans care about Ukraine?'\" Pompeo apparently shouted at Kelly after the interview.\n\nPompeo is scheduled to travel to Ukraine next week for a meeting with that country's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, a central figure in the impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump. Ukraine is a pivotal U.S. ally in the effort to counter Russian aggression.\n\nThe State Department said Pompeo is going to Kyiv to \"highlight U.S. support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.\" The Eastern European country is at war with Russia.\n\nIn an account released with the interview transcript, Kelly said she was taken to the secretary of State's private living room after the interview, where Pompeo was waiting for her. \"He shouted at me for about same amount of time as the interview itself. He was not happy to have been questioned about Ukraine,\" Kelly said.\n\nShe said he used the F-word and \"many others\" when he asking her if Americans cared about Ukraine. He then asked her if she could find Ukraine on a map.\n\n\"I said yes, and he called out for aides to bring us a map of the world with no writing. I pointed to Ukraine,\" she recounted.\n\nThen he said: \"'People will hear about this.'\"\n\n- Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nYou say FOIA, I say...lawyer?\n\nTexas Democrat Sylvia Garcia, one of the House Impeachment managers, made a point Friday of enunciating each letter of the acronym FOIA, which stands for the \"Freedom of Information Act,\" instead of the much shorter and commonly used \"FOIA\" (pronounced foy-ya).\n\nShe used the acronym in her presentation about attempts to obtain documents from the White House and other federal agencies related to Trump's impeachment investigation.\n\nIt may have been to prevent any confusion with the phrase “lawyer lawsuits,” which became a thing on Tuesday after a rant by White House lawyer Jay Sekulow.\n\n\"And by the way — lawyer lawsuits?\" Sekulow said during Tuesday’s 11-hour debate about trial rules and procedures.\n\n\"Lawyer lawsuits? We're talking about the impeachment of a president of the United States, duly elected, and the members — the managers are complaining about lawyer lawsuits? The Constitution allows lawyer lawsuits. It's disrespecting the Constitution of the United States to even say that in this chamber — lawyer lawsuits.\"\n\nHis comments, which drew blank stares, arched eyebrows and quizzical looks, came in response to a presentation by impeachment manager Val Demings, D-Fla., who mentioned “lawsuits under the Freedom of Information Act, a.k.a. FOIA lawsuits.”\n\nIn his rebuttal to Sekulow, lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), said he had no clue whatsoever about what Sekulow meant.\n\nWhile some observers posited that Sekulow had confused “FOIA lawsuits” with “lawyer lawsuits,” White House legislative affairs director Eric Ueland told reporters that Sekulow did not make a mistake.\n\n- John D’Anna\n\nTrump recording reignites debate on witnesses\n\nThe recording of President Donald Trump appearing to want to get rid of Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, reignited the Senate debate Friday about whether to subpoena witnesses or documents in Trump’s impeachment trial.\n\nHouse Democrats have argued that Trump removed Yovanovitch, who was heavily criticized by the president’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to clear the way for Ukraine to investigate his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden. The recording published Friday by ABC News was of Trump with Lev Parnas, an indicted associate of Giuliani.\n\n“I want to ask about the recording that has been released today because President Trump has said that he didn’t know Parnas and obviously he’s in a conversation with him about taking out one of his ambassadors,” said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y. “We obviously have a right to that information. Hopefully we will have access to it.”\n\nThe recording:Recording shows Trump called for firing of former Ukraine ambassador, report says\n\nGillibrand said two witnesses she wanted most to hear from are former national security adviser John Bolton and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. Other officials have said Bolton opposed the pressure for Ukraine investigations and Mulvaney said such pressure is routine in diplomacy.\n\n“I would like to hear directly from him when he understood that, under what context and how many conversations he had with President Trump about it,” Gillibrand said. “I do think we’re getting closer to witnesses.”\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said Friday it was more likely that witnesses would be called. “Yes,” she said.\n\nRepublicans such as Sen Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., have said more witnesses aren’t necessary. The Senate rejected subpoenas for Bolton and Mulvaney on party-line votes of 53-47, although more votes could called after opening arguments from House Democrats and Trump’s legal term.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nSchiff to senators: 'The next time, it just may be you’\n\nCalifornia Rep. Adam Schiff, the lead manager in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, tried to get senators to put themselves in the shoes of Joe Biden and Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nHow would they feel if the most powerful person in the world were asking a foreign nation to conduct a sham investigation into them? How would they react if, like Yovanovitch, they had devoted their life to public service, served in dangerous places around the world, only to be hounded out of their post? Schiff asked while speaking on the Senate floor Friday.\n\n“Because I will tell you something,” Schiff said. “The next time, it just may be you.”\n\nNo matter how close a senator may be to Trump now, he prodded them, do they have any doubt that Trump would investigate them if he felt it was in his interest?\n\n“If somewhere, deep down below, you realize that he would, you cannot leave a man like that in office,” he said. “It shouldn’t matter it was Joe Biden. It could be any of us. It may be any of us.”\n\n- Maureen Groppe\n\nSchiff: Trump's policy is 'Trump first, not America first'\n\nThe lead House impeachment manager, Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., summarized the accusation that President Donald Trump abused the power of his office by arguing that withholding military aid from Ukraine hurt an ally, emboldened an adversary in Russia and undermined efforts to fight corruption abroad.\n\n“This is Trump first, not America first,” Schiff said.\n\n“The Constitution does not permit it because that conduct is the quintessential abuse of power,” Schiff added. “The use of official power for personal gain, putting personal interest over the national interest and putting personal benefits over our nation’s security.”\n\nSchiff said Americans might not understand why Ukraine, a small country, is important to the U.S. But he argued that Ukraine is hungry for reform after emerging from the former Soviet Union, which collapsed in what Russian President Vladimir Putin called the greatest catastrophe of the 20th Century.\n\nTrump’s willingness to pursue a political investigation of his rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, rather than the U.S. interest in helping an ally maintain its independence from Russia justifies removing the president from office, Schiff argued.\n\n“If someone sacrifices the national interest in favor of his own, and is not removed from office, our democracy is in jeopardy. It’s just that simple,” Schiff said. “The grave consequences of President Trump’s misconduct demand our attention.”\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nSchiff plays John McCain interview on Ukraine\n\nExplaining the importance of Ukraine to national security interests, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., brought in an interesting voice.\n\nSchiff played a clip of a television interview with the late Sen. John McCain, whom he called a war hero and statesman “who is no stranger to this body.”\n\nMcCain, Schiff said, recognized the threat posed when Russia took over parts of Ukrainian Crimea.\n\n“We are all Ukrainians,” McCain said at the time.\n\nIn the TV clip Schiff showed, McCain said that it would make Russia very nervous if Ukraine is able to thrive.\n\nShowcasing McCain may have been an attempt to appeal to Republicans who were close to him.\n\nOne of those Republicans, South Carolina’s Lindsey Graham, has been one of Trump’s most vocal defenders.\n\nDuring the video of McCain, Graham seemed to show some emotion. He looked down at his desk and up at the video, before looking up towards the ceiling and blinking several times.\n\nRepublican senators were mostly stone-faced during the video. Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., told reporters the video strengthened a Democratic point that Republicans didn't need.\n\n“I don’t think they need to convince us that Ukraine is really important,” Cramer said. “I think it’s all to play for TV.\"\n\nSen. Any Klobuchar, D-Minn., also a Democratic presidential candidate, said the video had a “strong” message for her colleagues.\n\n“I kept thinking if John McCain was in the chamber today, or if he had heard the aid had been withdrawn, it might have been a different story,” she told reporters.\n\n- Maureen Groppe and Nicholas Wu\n\nJeffries asks: 'Who ordered the cover-up?'\n\nRep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., raised the specter that someone directed the National Security Council’s top lawyer to put a transcript of President Donald Trump’s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on a secure server.\n\nDid anyone senior to attorney John Eisenberg direct him to hide it? Why did it remain on the server even after this so-called error was discovered? Jeffries asked rhetorically.\n\n“Who ordered the cover-up of the call record?” he asked senators. “The American people deserve to know.”\n\nJeffries, who is helping make the House manager’s argument that Trump obstructed Congress, said there are many outstanding questions because Eisenberg refused to testify. Other officials testified that Eisenberg ordered that access to the transcript be restricted after he was told what it contained, Jeffries said.\n\nThat strongly suggests, Jeffries continued, that senior officials attempted to conceal, rather than address, Trump’s misconduct. The cover-up continued, he said, after a whistleblower filed a complaint about the call. That prompted a two-part strategy to block Congress and the public from learning about the call while trying to convince Trump to lift his hold on military assistance to Ukraine before anyone could find out what was happening, Jeffries argued.\n\nAfter Eisenberg and White House counsel Pat Cipollone reportedly briefed Trump on the whisteblower’s complaint, Jeffries said, the White House’s Office of Legal Council issued a secret opinion concluding that the complaint did not have to be shared with Congress.\n\n- Maureen Groppe\n\nDemocrats stress importance of delaying aid to Ukraine\n\nDemocratic House impeachment manager Jason Crow, D-Colo. said President Donald Trump’s defenders might argue that the suspension in $391 million in military aid wasn’t important because it was short-lived and the money was eventually released.\n\n“This defense would be laughable if this issue wasn’t so serious,” said Crow, a former Army Ranger. “No, the delay wasn’t meaningless. Just ask the Ukrainians sitting in trenches now.”\n\nUkraine needed the funding because it had been invaded by Russia and was fighting for its territorial integrity. Crow played a video of Jennifer Williams, a State Department aide assigned to Vice President Mike Pence’s office, who attended a Sept. 1 meeting between Pence and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\n“President Zelensky explained that equally with the financial and fiscal value, that it was the symbolic nature of that assistance that really was the show of U.S. support for Ukraine and for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Williams said, in her testimony during the House inquiry. “He was stressing that to the vice president, to really underscore the need for the security assistance to be released.”\n\nCrow argued that Trump only released the money to use it as leverage to pressure Ukraine into investigating his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\n“The scheme was unraveling,” Crow said. “He only released it after he got caught.”\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nFinal day of Democrat's opening arguments begins\n\nHouse Democrats prosecuting the Senate impeachment trial against President Donald Trump resumed their arguments Friday.\n\nOn the final day of impeachment managers' opening arguments, they'll focus on the charge of obstruction of Congress, and how rejecting witnesses in the trial would further obstruct Congress.\n\nThe lead manager, Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said if Trump or his legal team claimed executive privilege to block testimony from witnesses such as former national security adviser John Bolton and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, that would add to the obstruction.\n\nThe Senate rejected proposals to subpoena witnesses before the opening arguments on party-line votes of 53 to 47. The rules from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., call for more votes on witnesses after the opening arguments from the House and White House lawyers are over, and after up to 16 hours of questions from senators.\n\nFact-check:Fact-checking the Senate impeachment trial of President Trump\n\nSchiff urged senators not to reject witnesses at that point.\n\nTrump and some congressional Republicans have said he could block testimony from top aides such as Bolton and Mulvaney under executive privilege, to protect confidential advice for future presidents. But Schiff said executive privilege can’t be used to hide misconduct.\n\nThe House managers are expected to finish their argument about abuse of power by early afternoon and then conclude their opening argument on its third day with a discussion of obstruction of Congress, Schiff said.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nTrump team to begin defense Saturday at 10 a.m. EST\n\nRight before the House managers began their final day of arguments, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., announced that the president’s team would begin its defense at 10 a.m. EST on Saturday and the session will run “for several hours.”\n\nLike the House managers, the defense team has up to 24 hours spread over three days to make their case.\n\nJay Sekulow, one of Trump’s private lawyers, later told reporters his team will stop around 1 p.m. EST Saturday, at the request of senators, and resume Monday.\n\n“The Senate asked for an accommodation,” he said. “We were prepared to go as long as they wanted us to go tomorrow.”\n\nSekulow said he hasn’t determined how much overall time they’ll need.\n\n“Trust me,” he added. “There’ll be plenty to cover.”\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, one of eight House lawmakers who are part of Trump's defense team, told reporters Friday that the team is “very confident” because all of the facts are on the president’s side.\n\n“I think this case is open and shut for the president,” Jordan said.\n\n--Maureen Groppe\n\nThe witness question:Senators worry that asking for new impeachment trial witnesses could create lengthy executive privilege debate\n\nGraham: ‘I admire Joe Biden’ but …\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., had some kind words for former Vice President Joe Biden. Sort of.\n\nThe staunch Trump ally questioned his former Senate colleague’s judgment for allowing his son, Hunter, to join the board of Burisma Holdings in 2014 as the Ukraine gas company was under investigation because of its oligarch owner.\n\n“As much as I like Joe Biden — and I do respect him and I do admire him. I’ve traveled the world with him,\" Graham began.\n\n\"I think it’s bad foreign policy, if you’re going to be in charge of dealing with corruption in Ukraine, that your son hook up with the most corrupt company in the Ukraine and turn Ukraine into an ATM machine,” Graham said during a Friday morning news conference on Capitol Hill.\n\nBiden has often cited his role in rooting out corruption in Ukraine during the Obama administration.\n\nWhen you put your family member in that situation, it’s not good folks,” Graham continued. “The vice president said he didn’t know anything about it. That questions how hard he was looking.”\n\nOne of the impeachment managers, Rep. Sylvia Garcia, D-Texas, spent her presentation Thursday trying to poke holes in that Republican argument.\n\nShe argued that Trump urged Ukraine to investigate a debunked theory that Biden was protecting his son from an anti-corruption effort because Biden was leading polls as the Democratic challenger to Trump.\n\n“The entire premise of the investigation that the president wanted Ukraine to pursue was false,” Garcia said. “There is simply no evidence – nothing, nada – in the record to support this baseless allegation.”\n\n- Ledyard King\n\nAlexander says he'll wait to decide on witnesses, documents\n\nSen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., a potential Republican swing vote on subpoenaing witnesses and documents, said Friday that he'll wait to decide on whether additional evidence should be compelled until after the first stage of the trial.\n\nSpeaking after a briefing with health officials on the coronavirus outbreak, Alexander said that once the initial presentations from both sides are over, his question would be “do we need more evidence? Do we need to hear witnesses? Do we need more documents? And I think that question can only be answered then.”\n\n“As the house managers have said many times, they presented us with a mountain of overwhelming evidence so we have a lot to consider,” he said.\n\nRepublicans control the Senate by a 53-47 majority, meaning at least four Republicans would have to join all Democrats to vote to call more witnesses and documents in the trial.\n\nAlexander is one of a handful of GOP senators that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer presumably was appealing to Friday when he made a pitch to allow more witnesses and documents.\n\n“We’re seeking the truth at a momentous time in the American republic,” Schumer said. “It is on the shoulders of four Republican senators to join us in demanding it. We’ve made the argument forcefully. The American people have made the argument forcefully that they want to truth. Will four Republican senators, just four, rise to the occasion, do their duty to the constitution, to their country to seek the truth?”\n\nSchumer did not name names, but the Republican senators seen as potentially open to more witnesses and documents include Alexander, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitt Romney of Utah.\n\n– Nicholas Wu and Ledyard King\n\nTrump not happy with Saturday TV slot for his team's opening arguments\n\nWASHINGTON – President Donald Trump's beef with the impeachment schedule? His lawyers must start presenting his case on a Saturday – a bad day for television ratings.\n\nIn one of a series of Friday morning tweets slamming the Senate impeachment trial, Trump took aim not only at Rep. Adam Schiff, D-CA, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-NY, but the timing of his side's arguments.\n\n\"After having been treated unbelievably unfairly in the House, and then having to endure hour after hour of lies, fraud & deception by Shifty Schiff, Cryin’ Chuck Schumer & their crew, looks like my lawyers will be forced to start on Saturday, which is called Death Valley in T.V.,\" Trump said in an early morning round of tweets Friday.\n\nThe former star of The Apprentice is no novice when it comes to understanding television ratings.\n\n– David Jackson\n\n'Truth matters': Schiff sets up Friday arguments\n\n\"Right matters. And the truth matters. Otherwise, we are lost.\"\n\nWith those words, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff Thursday night tried to drive home the abuse of power charge the House filed against President Donald Trump that's at the center of the Senate impeachment trial. The trial resumes Friday at 1 p.m. with the California Democrat and other House managers laying out their case for the second impeachment article: obstruction of Congress.\n\nUnbiased jury:Can senators who have already voiced opinions do 'impartial justice' at Trump impeachment trial?\n\nClosing words:What was the Senate chamber like while Rep. Adam Schiff made his final Thursday speech?\n\nIn his closing speech Thursday, Schiff drew from U.S. Army Col. Alexander Vindman’s gripping testimony that he delivered to the House in November. In that hearing Vindman, a National Security Council official expressed deep concerns about the president's efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals, including Joe Biden.\n\n“If right doesn’t matter, it doesn’t matter how good the constitution is,” Schiff told the rapt chamber. \"The framers could not protect us from ourselves if right and truth don’t matter. And you know what (Trump) did was not right.\"\n\nFriday's argument: Trump obstructed Congress\n\nHouse Democrats will focus on the accusation that President Donald Trump obstructed Congress when they resume and complete their opening argument Friday in the Senate trial.\n\nThe seven prosecutors, who are called managers, spent Wednesday outlining the two articles against Trump and detailing the evidence they gathered for the accusations of abuse of power and obstruction. They spent Thursday outlining the legal and constitutional reasons that they said the evidence justified the charge of abuse of power.\n\nImpeachment player:The middleman: How Lev Parnas joined Team Trump and became Rudy Giuliani's fixer in Ukraine\n\nOn Friday, the managers will explain how the law and Constitution apply to the evidence for obstruction. Schiff, the lead manager, said Thursday that the arguments condensed hundreds of hours of depositions and testimony, but that there might be repetition in the presentations as more context is provided.\n\n“We will now show you these facts and many others and how they are interwoven,” Schiff said. “You will see some of these facts and videos therefore in a new context, in a new light, in the light of what else we know and why it compels a finding of guilt and conviction. So there is some method to our madness.”\n\nThe third session of up to eight hours will complete the opening argument from House Democrats. Trump’s legal team is expected to begin Saturday up to 24 hours of opening argument spanning three sessions.\n\n“We’re going to respond of course to what the House managers have put forward,” Jay Sekulow, one of Trump’s private lawyers, told reporters Wednesday. “And we’re going to make an affirmative case defending the president.”\n\nRepublican senators eager to hear from Trump’s defense team.\n\n“There’s all kinds of allegations that have been thrown up in the air and so they'll have a chance to lay out their timeline, their version of events,” said Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo.\n\nIn focusing on abuse of power Thursday, another manager, Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., said Trump could have been impeached just for asking Ukraine to investigate his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden. But Nadler said Trump went further, withholding $391 million in vital military aid and a White House meeting.\n\n\"Since President George Washington took office in 1789, no president has abused his power in this way,\" Nadler said. \"No president has ever used his office to compel a foreign nation to help him cheat in our elections.\"\n\nNadler said the accusation of obstruction stems from Trump directing his administration to defy all subpoenas for testimony and documents during the investigation.\n\n“The articles are overwhelmingly supported by the evidence amassed by the House, notwithstanding the president’s complete stonewalling, his attempt to block all witnesses and all documents from the United States Congress,” Nadler said. “It puts even President Nixon to shame.”\n\nContributing: David Jackson", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/24"}]}
