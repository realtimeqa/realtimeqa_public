Most adults who catch it have a mild illness; for those who are elderly or who have chronic heart or lung disease or a weakened immune system, it can be dangerous. But RSV can be especially tricky for infants and kids.\n\nMora, a volunteer medical spokesperson for the American Lung Association, says it’s important for parents, caregivers and daycare workers to know what to watch for with RSV, which stands for respiratory syncytial virus. That way, they know whether a sick child can be treated at home or needs to go to a hospital.\n\n“The emergency department is getting completely flooded with all these sick kids, so we want parents to know they can go to their pediatrician and get tested for RSV, influenza and even Covid-19,” Mora said.\n\nHere’s what else parents need to know amid the surge of respiratory illnesses.\n\nWhat to watch for\n\nFor many, RSV causes a mild illness that can be managed at home.\n\nOn average, an infection lasts five days to a couple of weeks, and it will often go away on its own, the CDC says. Sometimes, the cough can linger for up to four weeks, pediatricians say.\n\nSymptoms may look like a common cold: a runny nose, a decreased appetite, coughing, sneezing, fever and wheezing. Young infants may seem only irritable or lethargic and have trouble breathing.\n\nNot every child will have every potential RSV symptom.\n\n“Fevers are really hit or miss with RSV infections, especially in young infants,” said Dr. Priya Soni, assistant professor of pediatric infectious diseases at Cedars Sinai Medical Center.\n\nParents should watch for any changes in behavior, she said, including taking longer to eat or not being interested in food at all. The child can also develop a severe cough and some wheezing.\n\nIt’s also important to watch for signs that your child is struggling to breathe or breathing with their ribs or belly – “symptoms which may kind of overlap with many of the other viruses that we’re seeing a resurgence of,” Soni added.\n\nSince it’s not easy for parents to tell the difference between respiratory illnesses like, say, RSV and flu, it’s good to take a sick child to a pediatrician, who can run tests to pinpoint the cause.\n\n“You may need to take your baby to be evaluated sooner rather than later,” Soni said.\n\nWhen it comes to RSV, parents should be especially cautious if their children are preemies, newborns, children with weakened immune systems or neuromuscular disorders, and those under age 2 with chronic lung and heart conditions, the CDC says.\n\n“Parents should be really astute to any changes, like in their activity and their appetite, and then pay particular attention to any signs of respiratory distress,” Soni said.\n\nRSV treatment\n\nTesting is important because treatment for things like flu and Covid-19 may differ.\n\nThere’s no antiviral or specific treatment for RSV like there is for the flu, nor is there a vaccine. But if your child is sick, there are things you can do to help.\n\nFever and pain can be managed with non-aspirin pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Also make sure your child drinks enough fluids.\n\n“RSV can make kids very dehydrated, especially when they’re not eating or drinking, especially when we’re talking infants,” Mora said. “Once they stop eating or their urine output has decreased, they’re not having as many wet diapers, this is a sign they may have to go to the pediatrician or emergency department.”\n\nTalk to your pediatrician before giving your child any over-the-counter cold medicines, which can sometimes contain ingredients that aren’t good for kids.\n\nWhen to go to the hospital\n\nYour pediatrician will check the child’s respiratory rate – how fast they’re breathing – and their oxygen levels. If your child is very sick or at high risk of severe illness, the doctor may want them to go to a hospital.\n\n“RSV can be super dangerous for some young infants and younger kids, particularly those that are less than 2 years of age,” Soni said.\n\nMora said labored breathing is a sign that a child is having trouble with this virus. RSV can turn into more serious illnesses such as bronchiolitis or pneumonia, and that can lead to respiratory failure.\n\nIf you see that a child’s chest is moving up and down when they breathe, if their cough won’t let them sleep or if it’s getting worse, “that might be a sign that they need to seek help from their pediatrician or take them to the emergency department, because then they might need a supplemental oxygen, or they may need a nebulization treatment.”\n\nCNN medical analyst Dr. Leana Wen says this respiratory difficulty – including a bobbing head, a flaring nose or grunting – is one of two major trouble signs with any respiratory infection. The other is dehydration. “That particularly applies to babies with stuffy noses. They may not be feeding.”\n\nMuch of the care provided by hospital staff will be to help with breathing.\n\n“We provide supportive measures for RSV and these kids with oxygen, IV fluids and respiratory therapies, including suctioning,” Soni said.\n\nA thin tube may need to be inserted into their lungs to remove mucus. A child can get extra oxygen through a mask or through a tube that attaches to their nose. Some children may need to use an oxygen tent. Those who are struggling a lot may need a ventilator.\n\nSome babies might also need to be fed by tube.\n\nHow to prevent RSV\n\nThe best ways to prevent RSV infections, doctors say, is to teach kids to cough and sneeze into a tissue or into their elbows rather than their hands. Also try to keep frequently touched surfaces clean.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIf a caregiver or older sibling is sick, Mora says, they should wear a mask around other people and wash their hands frequently.\n\nAnd most of all, if anyone is sick – child or adult – they should stay home so they don’t spread the illness.\n\nThere is a monoclonal antibody treatment for children who are at highest risk for severe disease. It’s not available for everyone, but it can protect those who are most vulnerable. It comes in the form of a shot that a child can get every month during the typical RSV season.

He launched an attack that helped to end Boris Johnson’s premiership, put himself forward as his replacement, but ultimately lost to Liz Truss. Admitting defeat, he retreated to the parliamentary back benches.\n\nBut in a sign of just how unpredictable British politics has become, Sunak has returned triumphant from the political wilderness to replace Truss, whose premiership imploded last week.\n\nSunak was the only leadership hopeful to secure the support of 100 Conservative members of parliament, the necessary threshold set by party officials for potential candidates. He will become the first person of color to be British prime minister – and at the age of 42, he is also the youngest person to take the office in more than 200 years.\n\nHe was the last person standing after his rivals – Johnson and the Leader of the House of Commons Penny Mordaunt – fell by the wayside.\n\nSpeaking after being declared the new Conservative leader, Sunak said he was “honored and humbled” to become the next prime minister.\n\n“It is the greatest privilege of my life to be able to serve the party I love, and to be able to give back to the country i owe so much to,” Sunak said.\n\n“The United Kingdom is a great country, but there is no doubt we face a profound economic challenge,” he added. “We need stability and unity, and I will make it my utmost priority to bring our party and our country together.”\n\nSunak first publicly declared on Sunday morning that he would be standing in the contest. Other than that brief statement, he made no big pitch for the leadership this time round.\n\nIn the last contest, over the summer, he was widely seen as the more moderate of the two candidates. Compared to Truss, he took a less ideological line on matters like Brexit and the economy. (Unlike Truss, a remainer-turned hardline Brexiteer, Sunak voted for the UK to leave the European Union in the 2016 referendum.)\n\nLike Truss, Sunak promised a tough approach to illegal immigration and vowed to expand the government’s controversial Rwanda immigration policy.\n\nSunak, whose parents came to the UK from East Africa in the 1960s, is of Indian descent. His father was a local doctor while his mother ran a pharmacy in southern England, something Sunak says gave him his desire to serve the public.\n\n“British Indian is what I tick on the census, we have a category for it. I am thoroughly British, this is my home and my country, but my religious and cultural heritage is Indian, my wife is Indian. I am open about being a Hindu,” Sunak said in an interview with Business Standard in 2015.\n\nHe will be the first Hindu to become British prime minister, securing the position on Diwali, the festival of lights that marks one of the most important days of the Hindu calendar. Sunak himself made history in 2020 when he lit Diwali candles outside 11 Downing Street, the official residence of the UK chancellor.\n\nHe has faced challenges over his elite background, having studied at the exclusive Winchester College, Oxford and Stanford universities. He is known for his expensive taste in fashion and has worked for banks and hedge funds, including Goldman Sachs.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Rishi Sunak makes a statement outside No. 10 Downing Street after taking office on Tuesday, October 25.

Aaron Chown/AP Prev Next\n\nSunak has also been scrutinized over the tax arrangements of his wife Akshata Murty, the daughter of an Indian billionaire.\n\nEarlier this year, Sunak and Murty appeared on the Sunday Times Rich List of the UK’s 250 wealthiest people – the newspaper estimated their joint net worth at £730 million ($826 million).\n\nSunak’s election on Monday marks the pinnacle of what has been a speedy rise to power. He was first elected as an MP in 2015 and spent two years on the back benches before becoming a junior minister in Theresa May’s government. Johnson gave Sunak his first major government role, appointing him as chief secretary to the Treasury in 2019 and promoting him to chancellor in 2020.\n\nSunak has experience of economic crisis-fighting, having guided the UK through the Covid-19 pandemic, and positioned himself as the “sound finance” candidate.\n\nDuring the pandemic, Sunak put in place measures worth £400 billion ($452 billion) aimed at boosting the economy, including a generous furlough scheme, business loans and discounts on eating in restaurants. But that stimulus came at a huge cost and left the government scrambling to find savings.\n\nSunak was an early critic of Truss’ economic plan, which was panned by investors, the International Monetary Fund and credit ratings agencies. While he also advocated for lower taxes, he said tax could only be cut once inflation is brought under control, which could take several years.\n\nHis warning over the summer that Truss’ unfunded tax cuts could spark panic in the financial markets turned out to be true. The British pound crashed to a record low against the US dollar when Truss and her Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng unveiled their plan. Prices of UK government bonds rose at the fastest pace ever, sending borrowing costs skyrocketing.\n\nHe also secured the most votes from MPs in the last leadership election – comfortably clearing the new threshold with 137 endorsements. Although Truss eventually won the decisive vote among grassroots members, Sunak was not far behind, gaining 43% of the vote.\n\nSecond chance\n\nJohnson has made no secret of the fact that he believes Sunak betrayed him by resigning from his government, triggering his resignation on July 7 after a string of scandals made his position untenable.\n\nJohnson’s downfall followed months of revelations of parties held in 10 Downing Street while the rest of the country was under Covid lockdown restrictions. Johnson himself was fined by the police, making him the first prime minister in history found to have broken the law in office.\n\nFor a long time, Sunak stood by Johnson – especially since he too was fined in the so-called Partygate scandal.\n\nBut he turned against him after Johnson was slow to act when his deputy chief whip responsible for party discipline, Chris Pincher, was accused of sexually assaulting two men at a party in early July. (Pincher later said he had “drunk far too much,” although has not directly addressed the allegations.)\n\nSunak’s shock resignation from Johnson’s cabinet over the Pincher scandal set into motion a series of high-profile resignations that led to Johnson’s demise – and ultimately, to his own rise to the Downing Street.\n\nSunak faces an enormous task. The UK is in the midst of a deep cost-of-living crisis and soaring inequality. Financial markets are still spooked after Truss’ disastrous economic policy missteps.\n\nThe Conservative party, already unpopular after 12 years in power, has plunged itself into a state of utter chaos over the past four months and is now well behind the opposition Labour party in opinion polls. The only comfort for Sunak is that he doesn’t have to call an election until January 2025.", "authors": ["Ivana Kottasová Luke Mcgee", "Ivana Kottasová", "Luke Mcgee"], "publish_date": "2022/10/24"}]}

But bots aren’t just a challenge for Twitter.\n\nLinkedIn, often thought of as a tamer social platform, is not immune to inauthentic behavior, which experts say can be hard to detect and is often perpetrated by sophisticated and adaptable bad actors. The professional networking site has in the past year faced criticism over accounts with artificial intelligence-generated profile photos used for marketing or pushing cryptocurrencies, and other fake profiles listing major corporations as their employers or applying for high-profile job openings.\n\nNow, LinkedIn is rolling out new features to help users evaluate the authenticity of other accounts before engaging with them, the company told CNN Business, in an effort to promote trust on a platform that is often key to job searching and making professional connections.\n\n“While we continually invest in our defenses” against inauthentic behavior, LinkedIn product management vice president Oscar Rodriguez said in an interview, “from my perspective, the best defense is empowering our members on decisions about how they want to engage.”\n\nLinkedIn, which is owned by Microsoft (MSFT), says it already removes 96% of fake accounts using automated defenses. In the second half of 2021, the company removed 11.9 million fake accounts at registration and another 4.4 million before they were ever reported by other users, according to its latest transparency report. (LinkedIn does not disclose an estimate for the total number of fake accounts on its platform.)\n\nStarting this week, however, LinkedIn is rolling out to some users the opportunity to verify their profile using a work email address or phone number. That verification will be incorporated into a new, “About this Profile” section that will also show when a profile was created and last updated, to give users additional context about an account they may be considering connecting with. If an account was created very recently and has other potential red flags, such as an unusual work history, it could be a sign that users should proceed with caution when interacting with it.\n\nThe verification option will be available to a limited number of companies at first, but will become more widely available over time, and the “About this Profile” section will roll out globally in the coming weeks, according to the company.\n\nLinkedin's new 'About this Profile' feature will show users when an account was created, when it was last updated and whether it has been verified using a work email or phone number. Courtesy Linkedin\n\nThe platform will also begin alerting users if a message they have received seems suspicious — such as those that invite the recipient to continue the conversation on another platform including WhatsApp (a common move in cryptocurrency-related scams) or those that ask for personal information.\n\n“No single one of these signals by itself constitutes suspicious activity … there are many perfectly good and well-intended accounts that have joined LinkedIn in the past week,” Rodriguez said. “The general idea here is that if a member sees one or two or three flags, I want them to enter into a mindset of, thinking for a moment, ‘Hey, am I seeing something suspicious here?’”\n\nThe approach is somewhat unique among social media platforms. Most, including LinkedIn, allow users to file a report when they suspect inauthentic behavior but don’t necessarily offer clues about how to detect it. Many services also only offer verification options for celebrities and other public figures.\n\nLinkedIn says it has also improved its technology to detect and remove accounts using AI-generated profile photos.\n\nThe technology used to create AI-generated images of fake people has advanced significantly in recent years, but there are still some telltale signs that an image of a person may have been created by a computer. For example, that person may be wearing only one earring, have their eyes centered perfectly on their face or have strangely coiffed hair. Rodriguez said the company’s machine learning model also looks at smaller, harder to perceive signals, sometimes on the pixel level, such as how light is dispersed throughout the image, to detect such images.\n\nEven third-party experts say detecting and removing bot and fake accounts can be a difficult and highly subjective exercise. Bad actors may use a mix of computers and human management to run an account, making it harder to tell if it’s automated; computer systems can rapidly and repeatedly create numerous fake accounts; a single human could simply be using an otherwise real account to perpetuate scams; and the AI used to detect inauthentic accounts is not always a perfect tool.\n\nWith that in mind, LinkedIn’s updates are designed to give users more information as they navigate the platform. Rodriguez said that while LinkedIn is starting with profile and message features, it plans to expand the same kind of contextual information to other key decision-making points for users.\n\n“This journey of authenticity is really significantly bigger than issues around fake accounts or bots,” Rodriguez said. “Fundamentally, we live in a world that is ambiguous and the notion of what is a fake account or real account, what is a good investment opportunity or job opportunity, are all ambiguous decisions.”\n\nThe job hunting process always involves some leaps of faith. With its latest updates, however, LinkedIn hopes to remove a little of the unnecessary uncertainty of not knowing which accounts to trust.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/10/25"}]}

And the drop in value of Ford’s investment in Argo caused it to take a $2.7 billion charge in the just-completed third quarter. That resulted in an $827 million loss in the period.\n\nEven excluding the special charges for Argo and other items, Ford reported adjusted earnings per share of 30 cents, a slide from the 51 cents it earned on that basis a year ago, but a slight improvement over the 27 cents forecast by analysts surveyed by Refinitiv.\n\nFord reported automotive revenue of $37.2 billion, a jump of $4 billion from a year ago and $1 billion more than the analysts’ forecasts. The revenue was helped by a $3.4 billion from higher pricing on vehicles.\n\nFord did have some problems in the quarter beyond the charge it took for closing down Argo. It said supply shortages left it with about 40,000 vehicles in its inventory at the end of the quarter that were built but awaiting needed parts before they can be shipped to dealers.\n\nIt also was hit with $1 billion in higher-than-expected supplier payments, and a $1.5 billion increase in commodity costs.\n\nAnd it had a smaller profit and profit margin in its core North American market due to those higher commodity costs, and a loss in China, due to costs associated with the development of electric vehicles.\n\nWhile higher pricing on vehicles helped its European unit post a narrow profit in the quarter compared to a narrow loss a year ago, CEO Jim Farley did concede, “Our performance in China and Europe is not nearly as healthy as we’d like it to be.”\n\nBut, in good news, Ford raised its goal for full-year cash that will be generated by the business to be between $9.5 billion and $10 billion — up from $5.5 billion to $6.5 billion — on strength in the company’s automotive operations.\n\nShares of Ford (F) were down 1% in after-hours trading following the earnings news.\n\nBut in the end, the big news of the earnings report was a major change in direction on self-driving vehicles.\n\nThe company insists it still expects to offer full self-driving vehicles in the future, just not soon enough to make the investment such technology will require today. It said it decided it is better to invest in driver assistance technology that is closer to being implemented on vehicles today, and that customers want from their new cars, rather than a fleet of robo-taxis with no drivers at all aboard.\n\n“We’re optimistic about a future for L4 ADAS [advanced driver assistance systems], but profitable, fully autonomous vehicles at scale are a long way off and we won’t necessarily have to create that technology ourselves,” said Farley.\n\nFarley said he expects to be able to find jobs for many of the Argo employees at Ford, having them switch gears to develop L3 driver assistance features.\n\n“That’s really the decision, in many ways, that is driving what we’re doing here at Argo… we are deeply passionate about the L3 mission,” said Doug Field, Ford’s chief advanced product development and technology officer.\n\nHe said there is only so much talent available to develop the different driver assistance and self-driving features.\n\n“So this is the way we want to use that talent,” he said.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore Matt Mcfarland Peter Valdes-Dapena", "Chris Isidore", "Matt Mcfarland", "Peter Valdes-Dapena"], "publish_date": "2022/10/26"}]}

He was 68.\n\nCarter, who led the Defense Department from February 2015 to January 2017, suffered a “sudden cardiac event” on Monday night in Boston, his family said in a statement. He is survived by his wife, Stephanie, and his children, Ava and Will.\n\nCarter was a “a man of extraordinary integrity” who was “guided by a strong, steady moral compass and a vision of using his life for public purpose,” President Joe Biden said in a statement Tuesday afternoon.\n\n“I was Vice President at the time, and President Obama and I relied on Ash’s fierce intellect and wise counsel to ensure our military’s readiness, technological edge, and obligation to the women and men of the greatest fighting force in the history of the world,” Biden said.\n\nIn leading the Pentagon, Carter oversaw the final years of US involvement in Afghanistan under Obama’s presidency and US efforts to combat the rise of ISIS in the Middle East, which included the deployment of US troops. His tenure also saw efforts to expand the available roles of women in combat as well as lifting a ban on transgender people being able to serve openly.\n\nTaking over from Chuck Hagel, who was forced out as defense secretary in November 2014, Carter was immediately tasked with addressing the rise of ISIS, which by then had taken significant territory in Iraq. Although Obama had made withdrawing US military forces from Iraq a key priority of his foreign policy, he ultimately recommitted US troops to the country to deal with the terrorist group.\n\n“It’s necessary but not sufficient to destroy ISIL in Iraq and Syria because this is where it began and is what I have called the parent tumor of the cancer,” Carter, using another term for the group, told reporters during a visit to Baghdad in 2016.\n\n“Like cancer, ISIL has spread to … other places and it also threatens our homelands,” he said then.\n\nUnder Carter’s leadership, all US military combat positions were opened up to women, and in 2016, the Pentagon lifted a ban on out transgender people being able to serve.\n\nHaving studied the issue for almost a year, he said at the time that the decision was “a matter of principle.”\n\n“We don’t want barriers unrelated to a person’s qualification to serve preventing us from recruiting or retaining the soldier, sailor, airman or Marine who can best accomplish the mission. We have to have access to 100% of America’s population,” he said. “Although relatively few in number, we’re talking about talented and trained Americans who are serving their country with honor and distinction,” he said. “We want to take the opportunity to retain people whose talent we’ve invested in and who’ve proven themselves.”\n\nRegarded as a “technocrat” in part due to his degrees in theoretical physics and medieval history from Yale and Oxford – he authored or co-authored 11 books and over 100 articles on physics, technology, national security and management, according to his Department of Defense biography – Carter had a long and distinguished career in government. His career began in 1981, working as an analyst in the Office of Technology Assessment, International Security and Commerce Program for Congress. He served at the Pentagon as assistant secretary of defense for international security policy under then-President Bill Clinton from 1993 to 1996 and as under secretary of defense for acquisition, technology and logistics from 2009 to 2011.\n\nIn late 2014, following the Republican takeover of the Senate, Obama was looking for a new defense secretary who would not only better address the rise of ISIS but would be able to be confirmed. In announcing Carter as his selection, Obama said, “having served both Republican and Democratic Secretaries, he’s respected and trusted on both sides of the aisle.”\n\nThe announcement was met with widespread praise. Sen. John McCain, then the incoming Republican chairman of the Armed Services Committee, called him “one of America’s most respected defense professionals, respected by Republicans and Democrats alike.”\n\nCarter was confirmed in the Senate by a vote of 93 to 5.\n\nCarter was also a recipient of the Department of Defense Distinguished Service Medal, which is the highest award given to civilians from the department, on multiple occasions. At the time of his death, he had been a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School as the Belfer professor of technology and global affairs, and director of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details and reaction.", "authors": ["Karl De Vries Shawna Mizelle", "Karl De Vries", "Shawna Mizelle"], "publish_date": "2022/10/25"}]}
