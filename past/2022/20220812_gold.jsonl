Fruits and vegetables got 9.3% more expensive.\n\nGrocery items are still going up. Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n\nA number of factors have contributed to the rise in food costs: A deadly avian flu has meant fewer eggs in the United States, a severe drought in Brazil slashed coffee crops and the war in Ukraine led to a spike in wheat prices in the spring.\n\nWhile commodity prices are falling, it will take time before those lower costs pass through to consumers. Plus, plenty of other costs for producers — such as fuel, labor and packaging — have also been high.\n\nAnd as supply has been disrupted, demand has grown.\n\nDemand for groceries grows\n\nUnlike discretionary items, consumers can’t simply stop buying food when prices rise. They may, however, opt for less expensive options. Producers, grocers and restaurant operators have noted that consumers are indeed trading down — swapping out higher-priced items for more affordable ones.\n\nEarlier this week, Tyson (TSN) said demand for steak is falling while interest in chicken is rising. Wendy’s (WEN) traffic has been hit because some customers are deciding to pack lunches or eat breakfast at home, CEO Todd Penegor said during a post-earnings analyst call Wednesday.\n\nPenegor added that about 82% of meals were eaten at home pre-pandemic, but that figure jumped three percentage points since then and has stayed there.\n\n“The consumer has been a little more strapped, so there’s a few more meals prepared at home,” Penegor said. “Inflation has been high, so net disposable income has been a little bit pinched.”\n\nRestaurants have also been raising prices, but at a slower clip: In the 12-month period through July, menu prices rose 7.6%, less than overall inflation.\n\nPlus, food prices are largely unaffected by current government efforts to curtail spiraling costs.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged as much during a Senate Banking Committee hearing in June, saying that raising interest rates to fight inflation wouldn’t lower food prices.\n\nThe Fed believes that “food and energy are influenced by global commodity prices in a way that tells them, ‘Hey, these items aren’t really directly under your control,’” noted Michael Gapen, head of US economics at Bank of America Global Research.\n\nEssentially, the thinking is this: Because the US can’t control international factors such as the war in Ukraine and higher shipping costs, it can’t fully control domestic food prices.\n\nWhat’s more, the US government doesn’t have a stockpile of food as it does of oil, noted Rob Fox, director of the knowledge exchange division at CoBank, which provides financial services to agribusinesses.\n\n“There’s no ability for the government to release extra stalks of wheat and corn and cheese and so on,” Fox said.\n\nWhat got more expensive in June\n\nThe result has been steadily higher prices in the grocery aisle, with some items seeing larger month over month spikes than others.\n\nIn July, adjusted for seasonal swings, egg prices popped 4.3% compared to June. Coffee and peanut butter each got 3.5% more expensive. Flour rose 3.2% and bread prices went up 2.8%. Cheese jumped 2%, while chicken got 1.4% pricier.\n\nThere was some relief, however. Citrus fell 3.2%, and whole milk dropped 1.4%. Uncooked beef roasts fell 1.3%, and uncooked steaks fell 1.1%. Ham got 1% cheaper.\n\nThe biggest decline was in hot dog prices, which dropped 6.1%.", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/08/10"}]}

Trump is also expected in the coming months to announce he will launch another bid for the White House in 2024.\n\nSecret Service agents stand at the gate of Mar-a-Lago after the FBI executed a search warrant at the Palm Beach, Florida, estate, August 8, 2022. Damon Higgins/AP\n\nThe Justice Department has two known active investigations connected to the former President, one on the effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election and January 6, 2021, and the other involving the handling of classified documents.\n\nThe search began early Monday morning and law enforcement personnel appeared to be focused on the area of the club where Trump’s offices and personal quarters are, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nThe FBI’s search included examining where documents were kept, according to another person familiar with the investigation, and boxes of items were taken. Following the National Archives’ recovering of White House records from Mar-a-Lago in recent months, the FBI on Monday had to verify that nothing was left behind.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Former FBI official shares what struck him about FBI search 02:03 - Source: CNN\n\nTrump’s son, Eric, told Fox host Sean Hannity that “the purpose of the raid, from what they said, was because the National Archives wanted to, you know, corroborate whether or not Donald Trump had any documents in his possession.”\n\nChristina Bobb, Trump’s attorney, said the FBI seized documents. “President Trump and his legal team have been cooperative with FBI and DOJ officials every step of the way. The FBI did conduct an unannounced raid and seized paper,” Bobb said\n\nThere was communication between the FBI and US Secret Service before the search warrant was executed Monday, a person familiar with the matter said, allowing for the FBI to access the estate without any complications. There is only a small Secret Service footprint at Mar-a-Lago when Trump is not there.\n\nCNN has reached out to the FBI for comment. The Justice Department declined to comment to CNN.\n\nA White House official said it was not notified about the search. President Joe Biden, a senior administration official said, was unaware of the search of Mar-a-Lago until after it was reported on the news.\n\nInvestigation into documents\n\nThe National Archives, charged with collecting and sorting presidential material, has previously said at least 15 boxes of White House records were recovered from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort – including some that were classified.\n\nIn early June, a handful of investigators made a rare visit to the property seeking more information about potentially classified material from Trump’s time in the White House that had been taken to Florida. The four investigators, including Jay Bratt, the chief of the counterintelligence and export control section at the Justice Department, sat down with two of Trump’s attorneys, Bobb and Evan Corcoran, according to a source present for the meeting.\n\nAt the beginning of the meeting, Trump stopped by and greeted the investigators near a dining room. After he left, without answering any questions, the investigators asked the attorneys if they could see where Trump was storing the documents. The attorneys took the investigators to the basement room where the boxes of materials were being stored, and the investigators looked around the room before eventually leaving, according to the source.\n\nA second source said that Trump came in to say hi and made small talk but left while the attorneys spoke with investigators. The source said some of the documents shown to investigators had top secret markings.\n\nFive days later, on June 8, Trump’s attorneys received a letter from investigators asking them to further secure the room where the documents were stored. Aides subsequently added a padlock to the room.\n\nIn April and May, aides to Trump at Mar-a-Lago were interviewed by the FBI as part of the probe into the handling of presidential records, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\n“It is a federal crime to remove classified documents wrongly. And so if you are filling out that affidavit and you have to list the crime, you can list that as the crime,” said Elie Honig, a former federal and state prosecutor and a CNN senior legal analyst.\n\nHonig told CNN’s Erin Burnett on “OutFront” that the timing of the search held with the longstanding department rule not to execute politically sensitive moves within 90 days of an election.\n\n“Today is just about 90 days out exactly from the midterms, I think maybe 91 or 92 days out. That policy, that may be a reason why they did it today because they want to stay clear of that if they’re interpreting that as a 90 day rule,” he said.\n\nMembers of GOP back Trump\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel claimed in a statement that Democrats “continually weaponize the bureaucracy against Republicans,” and a number of Republican lawmakers came to the former President’s defense on social media.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, wrote that he had “seen enough.”\n\n“Attorney General (Merrick) Garland: preserve your documents and clear your calendar. I’ve seen enough. The Department of Justice has reached an intolerable state of weaponized politicization,” the Republican leader wrote. “When Republicans take back the House, we will conduct immediate oversight of this department, follow the facts, and leave no stone unturned.”\n\nGOP Sen. Rick Scott of Florida said that “we need answers NOW. The FBI must explain what they were doing today & why.”\n\nBut the chair of the House Oversight Committee, which is investigating Trump’s handling of documents, called on the Justice Department to “fully investigate” the former President’s handling of information.\n\n“Presidents have a solemn duty to protect America’s national security, and allegations that former President Trump put our security at risk by mishandling classified information warrant the utmost scrutiny,” Democratic Rep. Carolyn Maloney of New York said.\n\n“Although details of today’s actions at Mar-a-Lago are still emerging, it is clear that the Department of Justice must fully investigate President Trump’s potentially grave mishandling of classified information.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Kaitlan Collins Kevin Liptak Katelyn Polantz Sara Murray Evan Perez Gaborr Dan Berman", "Kaitlan Collins", "Kevin Liptak", "Katelyn Polantz", "Sara Murray", "Evan Perez", "Dan Berman"], "publish_date": "2022/08/08"}]}

And this governor is not doing that in Texas, but we are going to set the right message, the right tone, of being here for these families.”\n\nOn Monday, Adams called it a “mean and cruel thing.”\n\nAbbott claimed in a statement Monday, though, that the asylum seekers freely chose to go to New York, “having signed a voluntary consent waiver, available in multiple languages, upon boarding that they agreed on the destination.”\n\n“What’s horrific is the thousands of illegal immigrants overrunning and overwhelming our border communities with populations smaller than a New York City borough, and Mayor Adams is hypocritically upset about welcoming a few dozen into his sanctuary city,” Abbott said. “If the mayor wants a solution to this crisis, he should call on President Biden to take immediate action to secure the border—something the President continues failing to do.”\n\nA fierce critic of the Biden administration’s immigration policies, Abbott began sending hundreds of willing migrants on buses to Washington, DC, earlier this year as an affront to the administration. Abbott’s office has said that “to board a bus or flight, a migrant must volunteer to be transported and show documentation from DHS.”\n\nMore than 5,100 migrants have arrived in Washington from Texas on more than 135 buses, according to the governor’s office.\n\n“In addition to Washington, D.C., New York City is the ideal destination for these migrants, who can receive the abundance of city services and housing that Mayor Eric Adams has boasted about within the sanctuary city,” Abbott said Friday.\n\nHis state has been busing people to Washington, DC and New York City “to provide relief to our local partners,” Abbott said in the statement.\n\nManuel Castro, commissioner of the mayor’s immigrant affairs office, told CNN New York is a right-to-shelter city, so anyone who needs shelter may receive it. However, the city has “exhausted” its regular shelter space, so it has leased additional space at hotels, he said.\n\n“These are families, these are people,” Castro said. “They have a right to be here as asylum-seekers and New York is here to welcome them. They frankly need a lot of support. They’ve traveled a long way to get here.”\n\nAdams repeated Monday he hoped to be in touch directly with the White House about federal assistance on the matter.\n\n“Right now, we are at a state where we must get to the assistance from the federal government,” Adams said.\n\nThe Biden administration has “been in regular contact with Mayor Adams,” White House spokesperson Abdullah Hasan said, and the administration is “committed to working with them as we do effectively with other local leaders through FEMA funding and other support.”\n\n“As we have always said, there is a process in place for managing migration flows, and Republicans governors should stop meddling in that process and using desperate migrants as political tools,” Hasan said.\n\nSome migrants did not want to come to New York, mayor says\n\nAround 40 people were expected to arrive Sunday, Adams said, adding that it is not known if others got off the bus before it arrived in New York.\n\nSome of the migrants who did arrive Sunday told the mayor they had relatives in other cities and did not plan to come to New York.\n\nSome families “wanted to go to other locations and they were not allowed to do so,” Adams said Sunday. “They were forced on the bus with the understanding that they were going to other locations that they wanted to go to, and when they tried to explain, they were not allowed to do so.”\n\nFamilies whose desired destination was not New York said it took three days to get to the city from Texas, according to Castro, who also met with them, noting many “were hungry and thirsty, with small children.”\n\nAdams issued an emergency declaration last week to “rapidly procure shelter and other services” for people seeking asylum in the city. Those who want to stay in New York will go to shelters, and volunteer groups will be helping “those who want to go somewhere else” to travel to another location, the mayor said.\n\nNew York Taxi Workers Alliance executive director Bhairavi Desai told CNN they had 19 yellow cabs and Uber cars ready to voluntarily transport refugees arriving from Texas from the bus stop to shelters or to homes of friends or family in the area Sunday morning.\n\n“Everyone we saw looked exhausted by the journey.

She was 73.\n\n“Dame Olivia Newton-John passed away peacefully at her Ranch in Southern California this morning, surrounded by family and friends. We ask that everyone please respect the family’s privacy during this very difficult time,” her husband, John Easterling, wrote in a statement on the singer’s verified Instagram account. “Olivia has been a symbol of triumphs and hope for over 30 years sharing her journey with breast cancer.”\n\nThe singer revealed in September 2018 that she was treating cancer at the base of her spine. It was her third cancer diagnosis, following bouts with breast cancer in the early ’90s and in 2017.\n\nHer rise to fame\n\nThanks to a string of country and soft-rock hits, Newton-John was already a popular singer by the late 1970s. But her co-starring role opposite John Travolta in 1978’s “Grease,” arguably the most popular movie musical of all time, lifted her to a new level of stardom.\n\nOlivia Newton-John and John Travolta in 1978 in 'Grease.' Paramount Pictures/Fotos International/Getty Images\n\nAlthough she had little acting experience (and turned 29 during filming), Newton-John gave an indelible performance as Sandy, a sweet-natured Australian transfer student who romances Travolta’s alpha greaser Danny at a Southern California high school in the 1950s.\n\nTheir onscreen chemistry as mismatched lovebirds who undergo final-act makeovers to win each others’ hearts – she ditches her frilly dresses for heels, leather, spandex and a cigarette – anchored the movie and inspired repeat viewings by legions of fans.\n\n“I don’t think anyone could have imagined a movie would go on almost 40 years and would still be popular and people would still be talking to me about it all the time and loving it,” Newton-John told CNN in 2017. “It’s just one of those movies. I’m very lucky to have been a part of it. It’s given so many people pleasure.”\n\nNewton-John sang on three of the movie’s biggest hits: the duets “You’re The One That I Want” and “Summer Nights” with Travolta, and her swoony solo ballad, “Hopelessly Devoted To You.”\n\nBorn in Cambridge, England in 1948, Newton-John moved with her family to Melbourne, Australia, when she was five. After winning a talent contest on a TV show, “Sing, Sing, Sing,” as a teen she formed an all-girl group and began appearing on weekly pop music programs in Australia.\n\nNewton-John recorded her first single in England in 1966 and scored a few international hits, but she remained largely unknown to US audiences until 1973, when “Let Me Be There” became a top-10 hit on both the adult contemporary and the country charts.\n\nA series of No. 1 easy-listening hits followed, including “I Honestly Love You,” “Have You Never Been Mellow” and “Please Mr. Please.”\n\nThen came “Grease,” which was 1978’s top-grossing movie and became an enduring cultural phenomenon.\n\nThe movie gave Newton-John an opportunity to change her squeaky-clean image. The cover of her next album, “Totally Hot,” featured the singer in black leather, while its songs had an edgier, more contemporary pop sound.\n\nHer singing success\n\nIn 1981, she took her new, sexier persona a step further with “Physical,” a dance number with such suggestive lyrics as, “There’s nothing left to talk about unless it’s horizontally.” Banned by several radio stations, it became her biggest hit, spending 10 weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nOlivia Newton-John performing on the BBC TV music show 'Top Of The Pops' in 1974.

The film bombed, but its soundtrack sold well and spawned “Magic,” a No. 1 hit.\n\nIn 1983 she teamed with Travolta again for “Two of a Kind,” a romantic comedy-fantasy, but it failed to recapture their “Grease” spark.\n\nOver a lengthy career Newton-John won four Grammy Awards and sold more than 100 million albums.\n\nOlivia Newton-John waves goodbye in the 1978 movie \"Grease.\" CBS Photo Archive/Getty Images A young Newton-John is seen in front here with her father, Brin; her brother, Hugh; her mother, Irene; and her sister, Rona.

It might actually be the last place you’ll find some at the moment. France’s most famous condiment is running out, and there is no sign of its return to the shelves.\n\nA luxury condiment?\n\nWhen Marc Désarménien’s “Maison Fallot” mustard boutique in Dijon opens at 10 am every morning, 10 to 15 people are already queuing outside, hoping to get their hands on this now luxurious condiment.\n\n“I don’t think we have ever seen anything like it!” exclaims Désarménien. His family-run business has been producing authentic French mustard for generations.\n\n“My grandfather has lived through two world wars and the post-war period when there were ration tickets in France, but even then there was mustard! Now whether you go to Lille, Marseille, Bordeaux or Strasbourg, nobody has any mustard left. It’s all sold within a few hours.”\n\nFrance is the largest consumer of mustard in the world and its relationship with the condiment stretches back to the Middle Ages. In fact, Désarménien explains that it was the Dukes of Burgundy who first made it so popular by combining it with tough meats because of its digestive qualities. Over the years, it has become an absolute staple in French cuisine and a must-have for the French household.\n\nNowadays, a majority of French mustard is produced by large brands like Amora, owned by Unilever (UL), and sold in supermarkets. But those supermarket shelves are now empty, sparking outrage across the country.\n\nThe impact of climate change\n\nConspiracy theories have filled social media, some suggesting that the mustard’s disappearance is supermarkets’ ploy to inflate prices and that stacks of pots are being hidden in warehouses. But the real reason for France’s mustard shortage stretches far beyond the country’s borders.\n\nDespite French mustard labeled as being from Dijon or Reims, most of the seeds it is made from are actually cultivated in Canada where they cost a lot less. But transatlantic mustard seeds have recently fallen victim to the effects of climate change.\n\nA spokesperson for the Canadian Agriculture Ministry told CNN that “Canada exported 157 tonnes of mustard seed to France in 2021, an 80.0% decrease compared to 2020 and a 94.9% decrease from the five-year average.” The reason for this decrease is that “in 2021, the Prairies — where mustard seed is primarily grown — experienced extreme dry conditions, which led to a significant reduction in yields” said the spokesperson, adding that “farmers are on the front lines of climate change.”\n\nWar in Europe\n\nWith these extreme weather conditions hurting Canadian exports, France has been looking to other exporters for these seeds. Featuring high up on that list are Russia and Ukraine, but with an embargo on Russian exports and the war raging across Ukraine, there is no visible solution in the near future.\n\nMax Matsepliuk works for a Ukrainian export company that liaises with farmers to export Ukrainian grain. Though Ukrainian mustard seed production is minor compared to Canadian exports, prices for mustard seed have shot up significantly in the past year and Max is confident that this is creating incentive for Ukrainian farmers to grow them. Problem is, most of the fields are in southern Ukraine – Mykolaiv or Kherson — currently occupied by the Russians.\n\n“The southern parts of Ukraine were the strongest in terms of cultivation of mustard seeds. In the West it’s quite rare. Some farmers do cultivate” he says, “but that’s not enough for potential buyers from Europe. They want more and they want consistent quality.”\n\nMatsepliuk fears the seeds have been stolen by the Russian occupiers in the south and sold at a low price. So until these areas have been freed, it is unlikely that Ukraine will be able to export any mustard seeds.\n\nSilver linings\n\nNot everyone is suffering from this mustard shortage. In fact, local French producers who don’t rely on foreign exports have been overwhelmed with the current demand, and their businesses are thriving.\n\nGhislain Durand, who produces mustard in the town of Castelnaudary in the south of France, usually takes time off in July to enjoy the summer. But this year’s demand is too good an opportunity to let pass.\n\n“I need to keep working because of this mustard shortage, because I’ve got an order surplus that wasn’t expected, and I need to be able to make the most of this situation,” he says. “It’s very beneficial for my business, I must admit. For the past four months, the increase has been so violent and quick that it’s hard to follow.” So stark in fact, that Durand’s profits have multiplied by four.\n\nIn the tourist shops where Durand sells his mustard, people used to buy one or two pots to take home. “Now, they grab about ten!” Durand says. “They see mustard and they throw themselves at it.”\n\nWith the Canadian agriculture ministry predicting good yields for the coming harvesting season, things may be getting back to normal next year. In the meantime, those who can’t get their hands on local producers’ precious pots are turning to alternatives, from tahini to wasabi to add that sought-after kick to their meals.", "authors": ["Camille Knight"], "publish_date": "2022/08/08"}]}

Now, over a month later, Toyota has not yet identified the issue and is offering to simply buy back the SUVs from customers who no longer want to wait for the problem to be resolved.\n\nBecause the issue became evident soon after the SUVs went on sale, there are only about 260 BZ4X owners in the United States facing this situation. There are more who had ordered the SUV but not yet had it delivered when the “Do not drive” warning was announced. Those customers have never been able to accept delivery of their SUVs.\n\nThe automaker has offered a number of options beyond the buyback while it asks the owners for their patience. Toyota is also offering customers the free use of another Toyota vehicle until the issue is found and corrected. Toyota is also offering owners $5,000 toward their car payments or as a partial refund of the purchase price. Toyota will also extend the vehicles’ factory warranty by the amount of time — whatever it ends up being — that the SUVs have been taken out of service.\n\nFor the customers who simply want to sell their vehicles back, the exact terms of the repurchase may vary depending on various state regulations and specifics of the owner’s situation.\n\nThe BZ4X is nearly identical to the Subaru Solterra electric SUV. The two Japanese automakers developed the vehicles jointly. Subaru did not have to recall any SUVs in the United States, though, because none had been delivered before the problem was discovered.\n\nToyota is not the first automaker to recall electric vehicles in recent years. General Motors offered to buy back Chevrolet Bolt EVs following reports of battery fires. That case involved potentially many more vehicles than the relative of handful of BZ4Xes, but Bolt owners were able to, at least, continue using their vehicles with certain restrictions. GM eventually discovered the source problem and is now able to replace batteries in vehicles that needed them. GM has not said how many customers took advantage of the buy-back offer.", "authors": ["Peter Valdes-Dapena"], "publish_date": "2022/08/08"}]}
{"question_id": "20220812_7", "search_result": [{"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/10/health/monkeypox-vaccine-strategies-effectiveness/index.html", "text": "CNN —\n\nIn an effort to stretch the limited supply of the Jynneos monkeypox vaccine, federal health officials this week authorized giving smaller doses using a different method of injection.\n\nWith more than 10,000 monkeypox cases in the United States and vaccine demand remaining high, Jynneos has been in short supply for weeks. The new injection strategy allows health-care providers to give shallow injections intradermally, in between layers of the skin, with one-fifth the standard dose size instead of subcutaneously, into the fatty layer below the skin, with the larger dose.\n\nYet the specific efficacy data for the vaccine is not clear, and some experts argue that not enough is known about how the low-dose intradermal strategy might affect the protection it provides in the real world.\n\nEven at the original dosage size, “there is no traditional assessment of this vaccine,” Dr. Robert Califf, commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration, said Tuesday. It’s approved for emergency purposes based on studies of immune responses, not clinical outcomes, because there haven’t been smallpox or monkeypox outbreaks large enough to test it.\n\nIn a series of tweets Thursday, Califf said the alternative dosing regimen will allow more people to get vaccinated and protected.\n\n“In authorizing an unapproved use of an already approved product, the FDA is ensuring the vaccine meets high standards for safety, immune response and manufacturing quality,” he wrote.\n\nThe White House cited a clinical study published in 2015 that showed that two doses given intradermally at one-fifth the full amount produced a similar immune response to two full doses given subcutaneously, meaning people in both groups responded to vaccination in a similar way.\n\nThe intradermal route “may increase the number of available doses in an emergency situation,” the study’s findings say. Last week, the United States declared monkeypox to be a national public health emergency.\n\nUS officials said Tuesday that there are plans to collect real-world data on the vaccine and that the National Institutes of Health will launch a clinical trial.\n\nThe new federal strategy still calls for two doses of the vaccine given 28 days apart, and it says people who get their first dose subcutaneously can receive their second dose either intradermally or subcutaneously.\n\n‘Some reservations’\n\nThere are some concerns about the shift to a low-dose intradermal strategy.\n\n“While we appreciate that the federal government is finally willing to look for solutions to help rectify the shortage of vaccines, no effort to protect people’s health should come without proper due diligence and research,” David Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors, said in a statement Tuesday.\n\n“We have grave concerns about the limited amount of research that has been done on this dose and administration method, and we fear it will give people a false sense of confidence that they are protected. This approach raises red flag after red flag, and appears to be rushed ahead without data on efficacy, safety, or alternative dosing strategies.”\n\nThe chief executive officer of Bavarian Nordic, the company that manufactures the vaccine, has told federal officials that the company also has reservations about the White House’s plan.\n\n“Bavarian Nordic (BN) is dedicated to assisting Governments around the globe to control the current monkeypox outbreak and is fully supportive of dose-sparing approaches, such as delaying the second vaccination. However, we do have some reservations on the [intradermal] approach,” CEO Paul Chaplin wrote in a letter Tuesday to Califf and US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra.\n\nThose reservations include “the very limited safety data available” on this vaccination strategy for monkeypox, the higher reactogenicity compared with the standard dose and subcutaneous route, and the fact that a relatively high percentage of people, 20%, did not get their second shot during a controlled clinical study.\n\n“While we have certain reservations, we are trying to find the best way to support the EUA by collecting additional data and aligning on the responses to assist state officials in the rollout,” Chaplin said. “We are also investing in expanding the manufacturing capacity at both BN and external facilities, with likely more announcements soon to come.”\n\nThe Chicago Department of Public Health said Wednesday that it will be going along with the federal plan to stretch out the supply of monkeypox vaccine by changing to smaller doses given in a different way – but it won’t happen overnight.\n\n“I do think it’ll be a couple of weeks until we’re rolled out more broadly,” Chicago Department of Public Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady said.\n\nOther city health departments, like Columbus Public Health in Ohio, are still reviewing the new federal strategy and what it means for their local response.\n\n“Because this guidance is new, we are currently reviewing it to determine the impact on our vaccine effort, staffing and supplies,” Kelli Newman, a spokesperson for Columbus Public Health, wrote in an email to CNN on Wednesday.\n\nA need for ‘formal clinical efficacy data’\n\nThe efficacy of Jynneos for the prevention of monkeypox originally was tested in animals that were exposed to the virus, and it can be inferred from antibody responses seen in people who participated in smallpox clinical studies.\n\nBut the Jynneos vaccine was originally developed to contribute to the nation’s defense against smallpox as a bioterrorism response effort – so there still isn’t much data on exactly how well it protects against monkeypox infection, even with a subcutaneous dose.\n\n“There is no formal clinical efficacy data with the monkeypox vaccine – but that’s not a criticism of the vaccine. In fact, I think it’s a testament to the vaccine development efforts that we actually have a vaccine for monkeypox already, largely before this major outbreak occurred,” said Dr. Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.\n\nThe FDA approved the Jynneos vaccine in 2019 to prevent smallpox and monkeypox disease, but the approval was mostly to offer a smallpox vaccine option that does not contain live virus. Before then, Sanofi Pasteur Biologics’ ACAM2000 was the only FDA-approved vaccine for the prevention of smallpox. Jynneos has been the preferred vaccine in the current outbreak because ACAM2000 has the potential for more side effects and is not recommended for people with severely weakened immune systems.\n\n“Jynneos was a second-generation smallpox vaccine whose use case was to be a backup vaccine for individuals who could not get ACAM2000 in the event of a smallpox biological weapons attack,” said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\n“There was no intention of using ACAM2000 or Jynneos for monkeypox,” he said. “Even though they were effective against it, it wasn’t considered something that they were developing it for.”\n\nWhen Jynneos was approved, FDA officials said its effectiveness for the prevention of smallpox was determined by a clinical study of about 400 healthy adults. Half of them received ACAM2000, and half got Jynneos.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that the Jynneos and ACAM2000 smallpox vaccines are at least 85% effective in preventing monkeypox.\n\n“Although we don’t have clinical efficacy data, it is likely that Jynneos will be highly effective, because of what we know about the smallpox vaccine and because of the efficacy with Jynneos against monkeypox in animals,” Barouch said.\n\nHe added that “in general, vaccines are usually more effective at preventing the severe consequences of the disease than preventing acquisition of infection with the pathogen.”\n\n“We can be confident that this will likely be a highly effective vaccine, but the specifics of it in terms of the exact numerical efficacy – and whether that will be prevention of infection or prevention of severe disease – those details are really not known at this point,” Barouch said. “I do think that high-risk people should be vaccinated, but right now, I don’t think it’s possible to give very precise guidance as to exactly what that protection will look like.”\n\nA chance to ‘greatly improve’ availability\n\nThe uncertainties surrounding the effectiveness of the Jynneos vaccine will be magnified by the change to a lower dose of the vaccine in the real world, outside of a clinical trial, Dr. Philip Krause, former deputy director of the FDA’s Office of Vaccines Research and Review, and infectious disease physician Dr. Luciana Borio wrote in Stat News on Tuesday.\n\n“If the vaccine can be administered at lower doses at no risk to effectiveness, lower-dose intradermal injections make sense,” Krause and Borio wrote. “But this strategy could also backfire. If there is a risk to effectiveness, it may be better to focus the available full doses of vaccine on individuals at highest risk — men who have sex with multiple male partners — to provide the best chance of getting the outbreak under control.”\n\nThroughout the outbreak, the vaccine has been given to health-care workers treating people with monkeypox, to close contacts of patients and to people who have been able to find doses at local clinics. The CDC has estimated that at least 1.5 million people in the US are eligible for monkeypox vaccination.\n\n“We have a line out around the corner,” Dr. Stacy Lane, a clinician at the Central Outreach Wellness Center in Pittsburgh, said Tuesday of the demand for the monkeypox vaccine at her clinic.\n\nHHS has delivered more than 670,000 doses of the Jynneos vaccine from the Strategic National Stockpile to support local monkeypox response efforts on the ground.\n\n“In addition, the SNS is preparing to distribute approximately 400,000 additional vials to states and jurisdictions as part of the next phase of the national vaccine strategy,” according to the White House. “Jurisdictions that administer 90% of their current vaccine supply may request additional doses sooner.”\n\nAnd because of the authorization of intradermal injections, “the 400,000 vials of vaccine in the SNS’s inventory that have been allocated but not yet distributed hold the potential to provide up to 2 million doses using intradermal administration. Additionally, vaccines that have been received by jurisdictions, but not yet administered, are eligible for intradermal administration.”\n\nLane said the shift to an intradermal strategy could “greatly improve” the availability of vaccine. Her clinic has ordered the shorter syringes needed to administer the vaccine intradermally, the same ones used for tuberculosis testing, she said.\n\n“I ordered those this afternoon,” she said Tuesday, before the FDA issued its authorization.\n\nLane said many of her patients are worried about getting monkeypox, and she refers them to the ACAM2000 vaccine data as a reference point for how well the Jynneos vaccine may protect against monkeypox.\n\n“What we’re educating people on is that we know from historical data that the ACAM2000 vaccine that was historically given in Africa was about 85% protective against monkeypox. We know that these orthopox families of viruses tend to be responding to the same treatment, as well as the vaccine being somewhat effective,” Lane said.\n\nShe added that she does not anticipate any concern around the new vaccination strategy.\n\n“We’re not really seeing any vaccine hesitancy, at least at this point,” she said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nDr. Paulette Grey Riveria agreed that the intradermal strategy could be an effective way to stretch the supply.\n\n“Given that less vaccine volume is needed for an intradermal versus a subcutaneous dose, intradermal Jynneos injections could be a reasonable option to maximize supply while not compromising vaccine protection,” Grey Riveria, family medicine physician with the virtual health platform PlushCare and a regional medical director for the state of Louisiana, wrote in an email to CNN.\n\n“Scientists are actively studying to determine if immune cells under the skin can activate an antibody response with equal or greater efficiency compared to the subcutaneous route.”", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/08/10"}]}
