The siblings expanded it into a restaurant, which grew popular among locals in Mexico City.\n\nFor 54 years, the Ortiz family ran its business from the ground floor of a four-story building, located at a busy corner in the increasingly desirable Roma neighborhood.\n\nFor more than 50 years, Ortiz and her four siblings ran a restaurant popular with locals, but as prices climbed, it became unaffordable for the family. CNN\n\nBut in recent years, the family watched as the community around them changed. An influx of foreigners, mostly from the US, inspired Mexican landlords to renovate and remodel their properties to accommodate the wealthier arrivals. Ortiz watched as visitors and tourists suddenly became full-time neighbors.\n\n“Prices are much higher,” she said. “It’s difficult because a lot of these foreigners come, and they have a bunch of money to be able to spend on these apartments and rents.”\n\nThe Ortiz’s landlord followed the business trend. The family tried to push back and keep their space, but after a lengthy legal battle they were ultimately evicted in February. More than a half century of belongings were piled up on the street as they were forced out. The building is now being renovated into high-end apartments.\n\n“A lot of pain … They hurt me a lot,” Ortiz said, washing dishes alongside two of her sisters. They now work at another restaurant — no longer as owners but as employees — in a far less central location than Tortería Colima.\n\nSandra Ortiz, 55, and her siblings couldn't maintain their family-owned restaurant because of the rising cost of living. CNN\n\nOrtiz admitted the crippling impacts of Covid-19 and rising global inflation have compounded the situation, and she does not fault foreigners for wanting to visit Mexico City. But she worries that as more US expats arrive to stay, more locals will be pushed out.\n\nAs renovations are underway in the floors above their now-shuttered restaurant, across the street sits a storefront with a sign appealing to new residents. It reads: “Hello Mexico City!” … in English.\n\n“Please leave, we don’t want you here!”\n\nIt’s not hard for locals to understand the appeal of relocating from the United States to Mexico City.\n\n“It’s pretty, their money is worth more here, they can live in a house or apartment that’s really nice and big, create a better life,” Fernando Bustos Gorozpe said. “But it’s not as though there’s an interest to participate and understand the local culture here.”\n\nBustos Gorozpe is a university professor who was born and raised in Mexico City. He noticed the trend of American expats traveling to Mexico’s capital accelerated with Covid-19, since Mexico had fewer border restrictions than other countries. That coincided with a growing number of US companies allowing their employees to work remotely. Many chose to do that south of the border, in Mexico City.\n\nA view of Mexico City in February. Axel Hid/dpa/picture alliance/Getty Images\n\nThe US State Department says 1.6 million US citizens live in Mexico. But it doesn’t know how many are living and working there on tourist visas. The Mexican government does not track that data either, but it recorded more than 5.3 million American tourists flying into Mexican airports from January to May 2022. That’s nearly a million more compared with that same period in 2019.\n\nReal estate agent Edyta Norejko said she gets dozens of calls weekly from Americans inquiring about relocating to Mexico City.\n\n“It is very often from Los Angeles or New York City,” she said, adding that most are looking to avoid the rising costs of living in the United States and cash in on a strong exchange rate.\n\nIn 2014, Norejko, who’s originally from Poland, and her husband, Eduardo Alvarez, a Mexico City native, created their real estate firm with foreigners in mind. The say about 70% of their business comes from clients outside of Mexico who aspire to live in the country’s capital city.\n\n“There is a lot of benefit about the foreigners living in Mexico City,” Norejko said, referring to the tourism revenue generated by Americans traveling to Mexico. “We need them.”\n\nIn the first five months of 2022, tourism from US travelers generated nearly $11.5 billion in revenue for Mexico, according to the country’s secretary of tourism. It’s on track to surpass pre-pandemic levels.\n\nThe State Department says 1.6 million US citizens live in Mexico. More than 5.3 million American tourists have flown into Mexico between January and May 2022. CNN\n\n“It’s money that comes in, but that only ends up in the hands of a few people,” Bustos Gorozpe. “And locals end up displaced because they can no longer pay for these areas that’ve become very expensive.”\n\nIn neighborhoods like Roma and Condesa, charming cafes and trendy restaurants now cater to English-speaking expats. Bustos Gorozpe has noticed fewer foreigners making the effort to speak Spanish, and in some cases assuming the locals should understand English. That’s led to frustrations rising among some residents.\n\n“Of course, this is not like, ‘We hate people from the outside,’” Bustos Gorozpe said.\n\nBut Bustos Gorozpe said signs posted in one gentrified community do express a growing anger.\n\n“They read, ‘Please leave, we don’t want you here!’”\n\nDigital Nomads\n\nAmong the US expats who’ve flocked to Mexico City in recent months is 37-year-old Erik Rodriguez.\n\nRodriguez originally traveling to Mexico City as a tourist, and now lives in the city and works remotely as an economic development analyst for a US-based agency.\n\nErik Rodriguez was paying $2,500 for a studio bedroom when he lived in San Diego, but today he says he only pays $800 per month for a one-bedroom apartment in Mexico City. CNN\n\nAlthough his grandparents were born in Mexico, Rodriguez admitted he’s not in Mexico City to rediscover his roots or improve his Spanish, of which he speaks only a little. He’s there to save money while still enjoying a quality lifestyle.\n\n“In San Diego my apartment (a studio) was probably $2,500 (a month),” he said. “Here I have a one bedroom and I pay $800 a month.”\n\nRodriguez and other so-called, ‘digital nomads’, can be seen in city cafes or in parks, laptops open, busy at work. He said when he first arrived in Mexico City, he felt nothing but welcomed.\n\n“I think there was a sense of ‘we want people to come here to stimulate the economy. Thank you for being here.’ But I know that recently there’s been complaints from locals about the effect that expats living here has had on their own lifestyles,” he said.\n\nRodriguez says he isn’t sure about staying in Mexico long term. But, he added, “It is starting to feel like home.”", "authors": ["David Culver Karol Suarez", "David Culver", "Karol Suarez"], "publish_date": "2022/08/22"}]}

This was a dinosaur that would stand, as an adult, about 15 feet tall and (weigh) close to seven tons,” park spokesperson Stephanie Salinas Garcia told CNN in an email.\n\nThe other species that left tracks behind at the park in Glen Rose, Texas, was Sauroposeidon, which would be about 60 feet tall and weigh about 44 tons as an adult, Garcia added.\n\nThis summer’s excessive drought has caused a river in the park to dry out completely in most spots, revealing the tracks – the latest long-hidden secret recently exposed as bodies of water have dried up due to drought conditions across the globe.\n\nThe dinosaur tracks date from around 113 million years ago. Dinosaur Valley State Park\n\nMore than 60% of Texas was experiencing drought last week in two of the most intense categories, according to the US Drought Monitor. The state also recently has experienced heat waves that pushed temperatures into the triple digits, leaving millions under excessive heat alerts.\n\nThe human-caused climate crisis, too, has increased the potential for more frequent dramatic swings in periods of drought and high precipitation, such as flash flooding this week in the Dallas area.\n\nUnder normal weather conditions, the dinosaur tracks found in the riverbed are under the water and filled with sediment, which makes them less visible, Garcia explained.\n\n“Being able to find these discoveries and experience new dinosaur tracks is always an exciting time at the park!” Garcia added.\n\nA close-up of the dinosaur tracks Dinosaur Valley State Park\n\nMeanwhile, the tracks are expected to be buried again as rain is forecast, said Garcia, who added the process helps protect the tracks from natural weathering and erosion.\n\n“While these newer dinosaur tracks were visible for a brief amount of time, it brought about the wonder and excitement about finding new dinosaur tracks at the park,” Garcia said. “Dinosaur Valley State Park will continue to protect these 113-million year-old tracks not only for present, but future generations.”\n\nThe tracks are just the latest discovery uncovered by falling water levels due to drought, both in the US and abroad: Several sets of human remains have been discovered at Lake Mead in Utah in recent months as the reservoir has dropped to about 27% of its full capacity.\n\nIn Eastern Serbia, dozens of German warships still laden with explosives were exposed in the drying Danube River. A prehistoric stone circle dubbed the Spanish Stonehenge was revealed in the diminishing Valdecanas reservoir in rural Spain. And Buddhist statues believed to be 600 years old were found in the depleted Yangtze River.", "authors": ["Claudia Dominguez Raja Razek", "Claudia Dominguez", "Raja Razek"], "publish_date": "2022/08/23"}]}

While rents have been hitting new records for nearly a year and a half, there are some early signs that the market may be starting to cool off: July marked the sixth-straight month of moderating growth, retreating from a 17% year-over-year rent increase in January.\n\nStill, rents rose by double-digit percentages in all size categories in July compared to a year ago, with monthly rents for studios up 14.3% to $1,555; one-bedrooms, up 12.2% to $1,745; and two-bedrooms, up 11.7% to $2,103.\n\nThe South and Northeast have seen the largest rent increases. Miami, where rents were up 26.2% from a year ago, saw the biggest increase among the 50 largest US cities for the 10th-straight month. Miami was followed by New York, Boston, Chicago, and Orlando.\n\nMany renters have been scrambling to find a rental they can afford or opting to absorb a rent increase on their current place. But moving into a new apartment has been costlier for renters, according to a survey from Avail included in the Realtor.com report.\n\nRenters have experienced bigger price hikes on new leases – an increase of about $300 a month over their prior rent, on average – compared to renewals, which averaged about a $160 a month jump.\n\n“Whether in a downtown area or suburb, staying put or making a change, renters are stuck between a rock and a hard place when it comes to affordability,” said Danielle Hale, Realtor.com’s chief economist.\n\nRents rising everywhere, even in ‘affordable’ suburbs\n\nAfter being hit hard during the pandemic, urban rents are climbing slightly faster than those in suburban areas, with rent growth in cities up 12.8% compared to an 11.7% year-over-year increase in July for suburban areas, according to Realtor.com. That’s a reversal from January 2021, when urban rent fell by 2.5% year-over-year and suburban rent grew by 3.9%.\n\nStill, the rental landscape isn’t back to its pre-pandemic picture. While cities are still pricier, the gap between urban and city rents has narrowed. A renter would have paid a 12.4% premium to live in an urban area in July 2019, but that premium was only 5.8% – or $107 a month – in July 2022.\n\n“Compared to three years ago when rental price premiums were typically concentrated in urban hubs, renting is now nearly as expensive in the suburbs, where the rise in remote work has driven a surge in demand,” said Hale.\n\nShe said the days of lower premiums for downtown rentals are numbered, as a return to in-office work and the appeal of city life is sparking a relative uptick in urban rent growth.\n\n“Put simply, renters are feeling it everywhere,” said Hale.\n\nRent growth expected to cool\n\nBut there may be some relief ahead.\n\n“July data shows rent growth is leveling off at a relatively cooler pace than in 2021,” said Hale.\n\nAlthough 72% of landlords reported plans to raise rents within the next year, the rate held steady in the second quarter over the previous quarter after jumping substantially from January to April, according to the quarterly survey of landlords and renters by Avail.\n\nWhen asked why they plan on raising rents, landlords cited higher costs for property management expenses, including tax payments, maintenance and upkeep and utilities. In addition, fewer landlords plan to sell properties in July compared to January, now that the sales market has cooled and rents have soared, according to the survey.\n\n“Like renters, landlords are feeling financial pains from the inflationary economy,” said Ryan Coon, Avail co-founder and VP of Rentals at Realtor.com.", "authors": ["Anna Bahney"], "publish_date": "2022/08/24"}]}

In some cases, an electrical short can cause a vehicle fire while driving or while parked and turned off,” the consumer alert said.\n\nOnce a repair is available, affected vehicle owners will be notified to bring their SUVs to a Hyundai or Kia dealer, the consumer alert said. For now, there is an interim repair for Hyundai but not Kia vehicles.\n\nThe recalls involved 245,030 Hyundai Palisade and 36,417 Kia Telluride vehicles, the consumer alert added.\n\nRepresentatives for Hyundai and Kia in the United States did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/23"}]}

Discovery, which came together in April. The series not only has a lot of attention around it, but there’s also a lot on the line for its corporate parent due to the massive popularity of the original show and the opportunity that brings. (Warner Bros. Discovery is the parent company of CNN.)\n\nAs viewers tastes are fracturing and streaming becomes a larger and more vital part of the entertainment landscape, Warner Bros. Discovery is hoping that “House of the Dragon” can catch some of the fire that the original series had, thus bringing big ratings to HBO and big subscriber numbers to HBO Max for those who want to stream it.\n\nThe new series is also trying to erase the sour taste left over from the ending of “Game of Thrones,” which concluded with a mostly negative reaction from fans.\n\n“House of the Dragon,” which takes place almost 200 years before “Game of Thrones” and focuses on the family of the Targaryens and its litany of dragons, garnered solid reviews bringing in an 85% score on review site Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nBrian Lowry, CNN’s media critic, said the series “plays a less-addictive game” than its predecessor, however.\n\n“It’s not bad, and there are dragons aplenty, but it doesn’t produce the sort of characters that defined and elevated its predecessor to prestige-TV royalty,” he wrote.", "authors": ["Frank Pallotta"], "publish_date": "2022/08/22"}]}
